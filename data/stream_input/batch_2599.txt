B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Not a very good talker.  You talk and the cat repeats what you say but most times you can't understand what he's saying.
B0064MGU98|5.0|As I got into the series originally after the first few, I was very interested in seeing how it all started and how each character was portrayed at the beginning.  It's interesting to see how things have developed over the seasons and it's all good.  It really is a very good show.
0064430227|5.0|I loved this book as a child and purchased this as a gift for a friend.  He loved it!  I told him he reminded me of Harold so I had to get it for him.
B00A83075M|5.0|love wreck it ralph and it is a funny movie really loved it cant wait for wreck it ralph 2 if it comes out
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I text and type in two languages, and this app makes it simple. The swipe feature is also very accurate.  Well made app.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|Robert Reese and Peggy A. have both written wonderfully accurate and informative reviews on this wonderful app. After seeing all the poor reviews, I felt that I needed to add my positive review. I love Lightening Bug. So far, it has performed marvelously.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is an amazing book! I recommend it to people over the age of 12. :)
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|So many people told me bad things about this movie.  I am glad I never listen I thought the movie was great I loved it.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|It was a very cute movie. I enjoyed  watching it on a Sunday afternoon. Would recommend it to a friend.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's pretty fun as long as you like hidden objects games which I do. I got the game before but I got rid of it for some reason. Now I'm playing it casually and it's fun.
B000I9YWDO|4.0|It was a funny movie. I enjoyed  watching it on a Sunday afternoon and Would recommend it to a friend.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I do not really like it if you want a good version of minecraft try pc version or version has no villagers or try x box version
B003KRJNBW|3.0|It was a very good movie. I enjoyed  watching it on a Sunday afternoon. Would recommend it to a friend.
B003GDFQX4|5.0|well structured plot, gripping from beginning to end.This book is hard to put down; it is laced with historical facts.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is annawesome game!!! I think you should be able to save a world from someone elses. I also think you shuld be able to plat with someone that you have already played with, without have to he connected to the same wifi! That will make it like 100000000000000000000 stars
B0040I09RM|5.0|The show has strong story lines, great acting and is far more than just an outlaw biker show. Our family is hooked now.
B005544TRQ|4.0|The relationship between Harvey and Mike is wonderfully written.  I'd watch the show just for their witty banter, but there's so much more to make it worthwhile (Donna, anyone?)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy finding the clues and solving puzzels. They need more levels. Eight is not enough. I'm hoping there is an update soon.
1608871819|3.0|Has a pretty decent amount of concept art and set design but if you looking for the same kind of awesome you get out of say, Art of Iron Man, you're not gonna find it here. Severely lacks photos of sets, props, and the artwork is just not as good. I got it because I absolutely loved Man of Steel and this book does have some pretty cool info about the production on the movie and the book quality is nice. Just not quite 'super'
B001ANSSDC|3.0|The book is a good read, but the movie is better.  Its an easy enough read you can take it on a long flight.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I liked his honest perspective on his service to our country.  It was interesting reading his wife's take at the same time.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|It won a a lot of awards....not sure why.  It was ok. Maybe I didn't like it because I already knew how it would end
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|A movie of hope, I don't understand how anyone could watch this movie and not see God's Hand in it.  God was looking out for that family, made me cry, giggle and but most of all it was a good wholesome movie.
B000FC146C|5.0|Loved it.  It is equally as good as the movie.  I got more from the book though; maybe because I am older now and understand more.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|It was okay, I enjoy movies with Mark Wahlberg, this one was so much better than that movie TED, I could not believe Mark even took that script to play in that movie, so disappointed with the movie TED.
B007VDN1PA|1.0|I now have very find scratchs on many of my negatives. Words cannot describe how much I HATE this product.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Another one of those movies where I love the actors and I got what they were trying to portray in this movie, I did not agree with them, but It was an okay movie.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Yahoo recently saw fit to force everyone into their new email interface.  While some things are better, they failed to bring forward all the functionality of the old one.
1400069742|5.0|VERY INFORMATIVE AND EASY READING. I LIVED THRU THOSE YEARS AND MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT READILY AVAILABLE IN THE RURAL AREAS. GREAT BOOK ESP. FOR HISTORY BUFFS.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Fun movie, keeps you entertained, lots of gore (much more than expected), overall pretty decent but most likely not for kids
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and challenging, without being frustrating. Its actually fairly addictive if you enjoy logic and puzzles. I have no complaints whatsoever.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Love This Show! Well Executed! Really great story plot/ twist and turns! Can't wait to see the next season. Must See.
B000FBJG04|5.0|I recommend this book to all who are interested in the history of wars. , This is very inspiring and indepht of how one of our fighting divisions was injected into the throws of combat.  True stories of history are the best. You will come away with a sense of how these men performed and how there lives were changed forever.  There modest to come home and just get on with life without  fanfare or words of heroics. is a great testiment to a great generation.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I really was not ready for the story to end.. I thought &#34;Sookie &#34; Books still had a lot of life in them. I'm OK withe ending..not jumping for joy.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Damages Season 2 continues to thrill. It's a well thought out series that makes you beg for more. Glenn Close continues to mesmerize her audience.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This is the best game Iowan for any of my portable devices. I love the gameplay. The price does make sense for such good gameplay, but I do wish it was lower. Gameloft, this is your best game yet. keep it up.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Though occasionally whimsical, this was entertaining and fun to watch. The weaponry was not magical but was as unbelievable as if it had been. Worth a bag of popcorn to watch.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|This is their best release, in my opinion. It has a heavier sound and darker overall feel. I'm not a fan of the newer pop-saturated stuff, but this is awesome. Citizen Erased to Microcuts gives me chills every time. But pretty much everything on here is exceptional.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I was really curious how this was going to fit together after years of watching the original Wizard of Oz. Enjoyed it from Carnival to Castle. Special effects were very good.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Haven't used the app in a while. Cloud city is crashing the app, taking me back to the home screen. I've done everything I can think of and both of my parents, and even my grandma can't fix it. FIX THE APP!!!!!
B00002N9ER|5.0|I used it to make a plate holder on a winch roller fairlead.  It worked flawlessly.  I would buy again.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I had read Cassandra Clare's Clockwork trilogy first and I really enjoyed those books. I thought if I liked those I should give these books a try. It took me so long just to get through the first book. The characters in this book are dry, boring, and unexciting. I had to wonder what the point of the Lightwood siblings were in the book as they did not play much of a role, much less give anything to the story of the book.There was not much explanation as to the downworlder and shadowhunter world, or what anything stands for, you just know that they exists and there are certain rules that everyone plays by. You get a sense that the clave is important and that the silent brothers are as well but you are never given much explanation as to why. The book over all felt completely predictable and didn't capture much of my attention. I also got the sample of the next book on my kindle and couldn't finish that. I don't think I will give the second book a try. The only reason why I am giving this book three stars is because I loved the Clockwork trilogy and I know Cassandra Clare can write intense story lines with great characters.
B003UAMWWQ|3.0|Another classic Mel Brooks satire. No subtleties, just heavy handed slapstick after slapstick all the way to the end. Bound to elicit at least one laugh through all the silliness.
B00881VLCE|5.0|It has a great way of letting me indulge my love of jigsaw puzzles.  I really love having it on my kindle,
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Hope to be able to unlock the rest of the game. So far it has been enjoyable. Not sure about $4.99 to play. 2.99 is more typical .<br />.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Interesting writing style.  Great Story.  Way to much detail about house logos and genealogy.  It was hard to rate as I had seen all 3 seasons on HBO and although I found the book more interesting and of course it explained the many things that the series left untold.  On the other hand, i was always ahead of the story, because I knew where it was going.  I am now reading book 2 and if I were to criticize anything, about the author, I would say that I get the feeling that he wrote the novel with the thought of it being more than one book and that it  would become a screenplay.  I recommend it most to people who have not seen the series.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The film was fun and a nice change of pace from what has been out lately.  I found the dialogue especially entertaining.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Awesome island and McDonalds the foods to you can get it yourself to find the best way of calories per day and filling out of the most important part of a wonderful array of a bit
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Got this for my 13 yr old son.  Has kept his I-phone safe for about 5 months so far.  Would buy again/.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was the first book I've ever read that made go OMG every page! The idea of a second hunger games just blew my mind!  I can't wait to read the next book
B008JFLWLE|5.0|For me, it's SO nice to just be able to write in the equation and see it calculated right away. It had no trouble recognizing my handwriting. I am a math person, and I think this calculator is awesome! Now if I could only find a notepad that worked this well converting handwriting to text when I was writing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing. You can create anything you want. And if you buy this game and have it for a while then you can play in the realms.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I grew up on the Amazing Spider-Man, so this game truly offends me with its horrible gameplay and crap graphics. I would venture so far as to say that, even if I weren't a fan of Spidey, and were simply a casual gamer, I would still be offended. There are two reasons why I didn't give this a one star rating: 1)I got it for free, and 2)the game does function. So two stars for not having had to pay for this mobile piece of junk, and for it starting. Had I paid for it, I would've def given it one star. You know what? Never mind, I hate this game, so I'm changing it to a one...*mouse scrolling up to Star Rating...clicking to remove second star...going back to body of review*...there, I give this one star. It sucks.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|casting excellent -- esp. Hannibal.  characters are complex--certainly Hannibal, but Laurence Fishburne's Jack and Will Graham, too. Good plot thread running throughout.  Hard to see how long they can string out stories though.  Maybe a couple of seasons.  Gillian Anderson as Hannibal's psychiatrist is just an excellent touch.
B00BWJ6JO4|4.0|Based upon JRR Tolkien's beloved first published foray into Middle Earth, Peter Jackson's: The Hobbit: An unexpected Journey is a visual delight. Along with essential elements of the famous children's story, Jackson introduces a few of the darker, deeper themes which make it a true prequel to the epic tale that will soon become The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />ND Wiseman<br />20 June 2013
B0064MGU98|5.0|I have seen and loved all the main actors in other stuff but never got into &#34;The Good Wife&#34; for whatever reason. Now I am thrilled to have 4 Seasons to catch up on and that it's still on air!
B005OP7162|5.0|Great series with lots of turns and twists that keep you guessing.  Almost as good as Homeland but then Homeland is a 10 star series!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In the day of too much bad television, this is a classic show and storyline. I love everyone, a very fun time period show- the places and clothes are as much part of my enjoyment as the people.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Writers have a rule. You should be able to state the idea behind your novel in one sentence of twenty-five words or less.  It's the 'what if' rule. It forms the first sentence of your cover letter to a publishing house, meant to inspire others with the vision of the stories that could be told from that one enticing idea.  In Scott Card's story, it would be ... What if a six-year-old, genetically engineered, child could be trained to destroy the race that threatens mankind's existence? ... Laughable, except he pulls it off, marvelously.  In rare cases, a writer of exceptional talent is able to take an idea that seems implausible and create in his audience the hope that this idea can, in fact, be accomplished. In Ender's Game, Scott Card accomplishes this rare feat with astonishing ease.  It was a story I was sad to see end.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|This was a fun interpretation of the age old story of Jack the Giant Slayer. Great fun. I really enjoyed the story. This is a refreshing take on a great fairy tale. Well worth my buck.
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|It is a good pinball program. Very fast with lots effects. Very easy to play on a tablet. It adapts well to my tablet.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Looks like a good game, but it would not play on my KF.  No 'help' screen and very little instruction.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I will recommend this book to everyone I know.  I was hooked from the beginning and if you love a twist, the ending will throw you for a loop.  An absolute must read!
B00A31UXLW|5.0|The black box.  Great read -  Michael Connelly book black box was a great journey I enjoy his writing very much and will order more books by this author
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I enjoyed this love story. So original. It's a great break from all the other movies about zombies. In the beginning it was a little awkward to see a zombie falling in love with a human, but it certainly wasn't boring.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|Fun episodes this season. Penny and Leonard are not the only show in town. Sheldon and friends are also the stars and the girls make the comedy sessions work. This is one of the best seasons yet!
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|The book is very informative and laugh-out-loud funny all at the same time. It feels like you adventure in Australia yourself while never leaving your chair. Perfect summer read
0385349831|4.0|About a month ago, I had read [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]] for the first time in my life. Unlike a typical self-help/motivation book, I found the story intriguing, and continued reading the book well into the night. I was super excited to read Coelho's latest foray into allegory and explanations of human nature. Perhaps it was a bit unfair to hold Coelho to the standard of his most famous, bestselling book. Yet, no entirely unreasonable since [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]] was this author's first novel, and one would expect him to improve over the years.<br /><br />Although [[ASIN:0385349831 Manuscript Found in Accra]] is not on par with [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]], the book is still full of wisdom and great insights into the human condition. The biggest shortcoming for this book, in my opinion, is Coelho inability to build a truly allegorical story within a story. [[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]] was successful because it didn't preach. It simply retold the story, and allowed the reader to draw his/her own conclusions. [[ASIN:0385349831 Manuscript Found in Accra]] is almost too lazy, in comparison. [[ASIN:0385349831 Manuscript Found in Accra]], perhaps much like the society today, expect every point to be made explicitly, to stare directly at the reader. The sudden difference in style might be attributed to Coelho's feelings towards his audience or might be a coincidence. In any case, it makes the novel feel too preachy.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385349831 Manuscript Found in Accra]] is a decent book, but not a great one. To me, a  measure of a valuable non-fiction book is that when you read it, you feel the need to have a highlighter in hand, and begin to notice the crucial passages, under line them/circle/highlight them, and then maybe even retweet some of the best quotes from the book.<br /><br />Judging by that criteria, this book is good. It's very good. In fact, one can see that I highlighted a good 20% of it as \\"important\\" text that I want to returnto and reread. Still, [[ASIN:0385349831 Manuscript Found in Accra]] doesn't provide the kind of urgency that \\"The Alchemist\\" did. It doesn't inspire me to run out and buy several copies of it for my friend and hand it out as the must-read book of the year.<br /><br />Furthermore, I'd caution the reader away from it if he/she didn't read \\"The Alchemist\\". Read \\"The Alchemist\\" first if you've never read Coelho; otherwise, if you read \\"Manuscript Found in Accra\\"  first and choose never to read another of his books again, you'll be doing yourself a great disservice.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|THE PUZZLES WERE CHALLENGING ENOUGH TO NOT BREEZE THROUGH BUT NOT SO HARD THAT YOU COME TO A COMPLETE DEAD END. DEFINITELY A GOOD VALUE FOR THE COST. RECOMMEND!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app was very impressive is only stumped it twice. It is fun to see what it can guess it might surprise you
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|A Fun game but couldn't go far before being asked to buy the full version. Still it's very entertaining and excellent graphics!
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|This game is good when im bored and want something to do. But i dont think it is worth the cost, it should be free
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like the game, but the cost of buying more land and receiving gems is expensive. Getting  heart gems is impossible without buying them my kids still haven't received more and they have been playing this game for several months. Please fix this so the children could  get better rewarded when playing this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very entertaining and challenging.  Should give you a little more information about how to play but other than that I really enjoyed this game.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I wish I could go back to the version I had before! This one is much slower on my nexus, and some of the local radar views don't work - they just hang. I don't recommend this one - wait 'til they get the bugs worked out. Once they get it better optimized and cleaned up I predict i'll be adding more stars. Hope that is soon.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|This was a well thought of game with challenging levels. It can take hours to master this game. I've played it four hours and it and still haven't mastered it yet. It was a free application of the day. Well worth it.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Plot, filming, location, authenticity, acting are very good. Travis Fimmel is uniquely suited to the role. Look forward to next season.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|If you enjoy movies for Visual Effect, and Non-Stop Action this is the film for you, but if you enjoy great storytelling and Characters. I'll think twice before purchasing this Blu-ray. You may want to rent it, before you buy it.<br /><br />The opening scenes were nicely done. On Earth we're introduced to Clark Kent/Superman using flashbacks and flash-forwards (present, past, present, etc...) we learn of his struggles to become the hero known as Superman, and his Earth Father's fears of what the world would do if they found out about his powers. This was a new way to bring the story forward, and I did enjoy it until Lois Lane. It was after that first hour the problems started.<br /><br />In the  2nd Hour and 28 minutes. BAM! He has saved her. BAM! He learns of his home world. BAM! Here's the suit. BAM! Look mom! I can fly. BAM! Lois Lane tracks him down. Then they're introduced. BAM! Here are the others Characters at the Daily Planet. BAM! General Zod invades Earth. BAM! Superman turns himself in. BAM! All hell breaks loose. BAM! All hell breaks loose again. BAM!, BAM!, BOOM!, BOOM! Lois Lane is saved again. BAM! They Kiss. BAM! Superman to the Army General: You have to trust me General. I'm from Kansas, you can't get more America than that. BAM!  The End.<br /><br />The 2nd part of the film was replaced with action instead of Story and Characters. There was no connection to care who he was saving, or the relationship between Lois Lane and Superman.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Perhaps I expected too much, but the film just did not hold our interest. After 30 minutes we stop watching.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|the book wandered; there were sections that didn't flow and were relatively unimportant to the story.  There were some fascinating parts but there were parts that were tangential to the story and couldn't quite see the point as to why they were included.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Acting, especially Christopher Waltz's was excellent. Plotting was more than adequate with some surprising twist. But if the sight of blood bothers you, then give it a pass. All in all I thought it was not as good as Inglorious Basterds or Pulp Fiction.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game was good! The struggles that Ender goes through are so crazy and the context of the whole story was incredible!
B0089XH38M|4.0|AVG is most famous for their top notch desktop anti virus products.  Here they have created an easy to use, well rounded anti-virus product for your phone.  If you are looking for a product that will keep malware off of your phone, and provide recovery features this is the product for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had an enjoyable time with this game. wish there were more levels though since I love this sort of game.
B003U4ZQRK|3.0|Starts to get way too contrived.  The story loses continuity and the writers just throw in everything they can think of, w/o any justification
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|I admit I was not expecting much for the price. I am pleasantly surprised at both the ease with which you can customize but also the quality of sound and options. I use this daily and share with friends.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this  book by the author of the KITE RUNNER. The story spans over many years in the lives of a brother and sister who are separated when they were young. The characters are well developed and have complicated lives. It is better to read this book when you have time to stay with it.  It is a compelling story, a bit sad at times.  The ending is sad but satisfying. Mr. Hosseini is wonderful writer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have just spent 15 minutes playing though i know its a waste of time and plan on discontinuing.  Definitely addictive.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Great job on the 3d.  Very convincing. just wish Michael Crichton was still alive making more fantastic stories like this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read once in Mexico, twice at home and now again.<br />No review can sum the warning delivered by the Hunger Games trilogy. Re-read and possibly heed?  It is important to know who the enemy is.<br />Thanks Suzanne Collins. Someone will be aware. Actually many will be more ready, thanks to your imagination.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I go to play the game, I get ads which I feel could be potentially destructive to my system, so I won't even play with it. I've had too many bad experiences with those kinds of things, they give viruses, so I'm deleting it.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Read all three books to see what all the raves were about.\ I really did not like it ,found fifty so demanding and Steel too immature to foresee her future. Was not for me .
B0044XRIMW|5.0|That will never change and I never tired of watching it after all of these years. I heard it was Michael Jackson's favorite movie and that he had a childhood crush on Liesl von Trapp. LOL. Anyhoo...it was an excellent story, and told very well through dialogue and song. I wish I could write something like it about growing up in the southern state of the United States of Georgia during the 1960s and 70s ...
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Enjoyed this movie so much.  Had great cast ,story line funny.<br />Would recommend this movie for anyone who needs relaxation or just a lighthearted moment.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|But it was okay. Good story, great acting, a little punny humor from time to time. Favorite line: &#34;I am the President of the United States, clothed in immense power.&#34; Some sketchy back story, but a good movie overall.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|Awesome horror movie with awesome characters.  So glad they ported it to blu ray.  Very funny movie while maintaining creepy vibe.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|it really makes you think about life.  The writing is superb.  He is one of the best authors i've ever read
B0036BDPOI|5.0|One of my favorite albums and the one that got me into heavy metal.  So glad to own it on vinyl.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not as complicated as 100 floors but similar concept.  the puzzles are more intuitive.  you put together every day objects to move on.  I enjoyed it and look forward to more levels.
B00985E3UG|4.0|I was hoping for a little more research on the effects of these three &#34;additives&#34; on health, but the inside look at the dilemma and even intrigue among the big food companies was as compelling as it was appalling.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love this show. If you like action and science fiction this is a great show for you. Great actors too! Can't wait to continue the series. Amazon instant video is great.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I love this book it is hilarious:-):-):-):-)<br />Thank you for making the book Rodrick Rules<br />THANK YOU VERY MUCH DIARY OF A WIMPY KID
1608871819|3.0|Not terrible but far from a must have art of book. So much could have been added to help show off the sets and locations of the movie. This is really more of a collection of the digital concept art.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|For anyone who enjoyed Shades of Grey - this book will equal it.  Alot of similarities but I love both stories.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|Genius writing and acting!  This series will raise your spirits, keep you laughing, and bring you back again and again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very fun and addicting. great app! also it is very easy to play after you figure out all of the controls.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I find myself playing this game when my daughter is not.  They made the game so if you just want to go through the levels you can but if you want to collect all the things per level its more difficult.  I find that it makes it so its easy enough for a child and still challenging enough to entertain an adult.
B000SVZIR6|5.0|This is a lovely version of the story of Anna and King Mongkut, based in fact, but highly fictionalized. For anyone who love the movie &#34;The King and I&#34; this is another way to see the story.
B008KP6ENE|3.0|I liked it somewhat.  Not really my style though.  The game play flowed well and the graphics were pretty good.  Although it was relatively small on the phone.  Cute game, would recommend.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like this because it shows a percent next to battery in the corner no more guessing how much is left. It also does much more.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I was hoping this would give a more in depth analysis of my battery usage but its nothing special.  I use superbox and prefer that over this.  Superbox also has much more that this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Acting and presentation were incredible.  The subtitles were perfect for my husband.  Thanks for providing them.<br />We are watching Season 3 now.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A moving and powerful story about all kinds of love. I highly recommend this novel.  Be warned, it is hard to put down.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I bought this book because I loved THE KITE RUNNER.  This book was a disappointment.  I was also annoyed that the author left Marcos's story hanging with no real indication of what would happen to him.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a brilliant book and it is an amazing movie--one of the most beautiful to look at ever made. Acting is amazing, but the editing is the most amazing quality of all.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|One of my favorite Dustin Hoffman movies.  The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD did not disappoint.  A great add to my collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Who knew?  Heard all the talk, decided to give it a go.  Watched all three seasons back to back in 2 days.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|need more levels. it stops at 8. I font like that and am not happy. you should really add more levels......
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Who knew?  Heard all the talk, decided to give it a go.  Watched all three seasons back to back in 2 days.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|The book has gone Into detailed stories to highlight why a certain profile  of a giver works. It is insightful , different and debunks many commonly held wisdoms. Based on factual details it backs up its premise that people who give rationally can be high achieves, a notion that takes time to digest.<br /><br />It is definitely worth a read and go to bible for anyone at the start of their career.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game and easy to move around.  It is the classical Solitare game, and fun to work with.  I would recommend it
B005DJREGQ|5.0|This show is commit legit!! It's what made me watch MTV again. You need to watch this as if your life depended on it. You're Welcome.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love, love this game - hate the popups - but the game is great and can be a time waster as it is addictive
B0050KEVO6|4.0|After my nephew was showing off this game over Father's day I decided to give it a try.  I like it on the Kindle Fire, but I think it would be hard to navigate on a phone like he had.  The concept itself is very interesting, but could use perhaps a bit more of an introduction about navigation.  Overall, really fun, free game.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|I loved all the songs on this soundtrack.  I have been a big ABBA fan since the first time I heard the group.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Cannot wait for season 4 to begin in 2014!! Great special features section as well, definitely a must see show!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This is a classic Hitchcock film, with excellent acting by Cary Grant and Eva St. Marie.  Full of suspense, wit, and drama.  What a treasure to find on Amazon's Instant videos!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Funny and addictive, hope they add more levels soon.<br />Good replay value and production, my girlfriend loves this game, she can't stop playing.
B00AYBU7TE|5.0|I am not even a true country fan and this collection moved me. His old, world-weary voice and selection of songs from other genres make this his best ever.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Bought it for my daughter's kindle (she's 7). Like the shock absorber quality but LOVE the price.  It does the job!
B001IYVUEW|5.0|Great movie...one of my favorite takes on Batman! I have seen this many times!  The download was quick and easy....love that I have on my kindle so I can take with me on vacation!
B00936A0RU|5.0|The acting is superb.  I have my favorite scenes and can mouth the words right along with the movie.  I don't even drink, but it made me want some of that white lightning. Tom Hardy, Shia Laboeuf, Guy Pearce -- all fantastic.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This story with soo many tendrils linked to her other stories, was another peak for her. It was fraught with danger, suspense, and greatly tempered with strong emotion which kept you hoping for their future.<br /><br />It was an excellent book, which reads like the end of the series....which I'm almost in despair of. Please say its just a segue into a new phase of the series.<br /><br />It is a great love story!  Can't state it better than that. You've done it again Ms Singh.
B002EMESSM|5.0|This is one of the classic science fiction movies of all time.  Great story line and good special effects for it day,
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Works adequately on the smaller smartphone screen if you don't have access to a larger screen of a tablet or regular computer. I felt there were design and functional compromises to make it all fit
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I love this show.  I can't believe it has taken me this long to watch this show but with the amazon prime .. so awesome!!<br />Starting at the beginning of a show and being able to watch all of them is great.  The depth of characters is awesome. Katy Segal is awesome in this and whomever plays Jax is great too.  my two favorites.  Way to violent and sexual for kids under 16.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This movie was very entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Being an older pianist and opera singer, I really could feel the empathy for the players.  They all did a wonderful job portraying their roles.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good sequel. New characters were well involved and story line was unique. Looking forward to the next installment on line.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love the music from this movie.  It's enjoyable and very easy listening.  I love movie scores and have quite a few in my collection and happy that I have added this one to it.
B005MLP71Y|3.0|I rented this movie because we were talking about bees and flowers.  Half way through the movie she lost her interest.  It could have just been her mood that day?!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is hard.  You have to sweat and you can't cut corners.  But the good news it only lasts 20 minutes.  The first time I did the video it was so hard that while I made it through I definitely had to take few little breaks.  The first few days it was hard to walk.  My legs were killing me!  But it only lasted about three days and then the workout got easier.  Well not easier but managable.  You still sweat bullets and are so glad when it is over and thrilled that you did it.  After level one you can move on to level two and then the hardest level: three.<br /><br />What I did with this was as I built myself up I started doing two of them.  First level one and level two back to back. I hope to be able to do level two and three back to back and then I hope to be able to do all three of them.<br /><br />You can definitely get &#34;shredded&#34; with this workout but I don't think you can do it in 30 days.  Real physical fitness takes longer than that.  However, after 30 days you will definitely have lost weight and feel great about yourself.<br /><br />It's a really good DVD for the money.<br /><br />FYI: It does require hand weights and a yoga mat.  You could get by without both but you should at least have a little resistance. Use soup cans if you have nothing else.  Then go out an buy some cheap hand weights (between 1 and 3 pounds should be enough).
B004EF65QA|5.0|I came across this series while searching for anything with Richard Armitage. First 15 minutes I was hooked. The acting is superb and the scenery makes you feel like you are in that era. I highly recommend it.
B00BUWY74M|4.0|As a new triathlete, this book was initially overwhelming as there is so much information.  However, as I started training and racing, I treated the book as a reference book, and looked up information I needed as I needed it.  That made this a vast, valuable resource. Great, well-researched and thorough.
B009NY43NY|3.0|As a Sookie Stackhouse fan I was excited for the last book of the series but found this one ok at best.  This one was not as exciting as others in the series and the end was totally expected. 3 stars.
B000003EOO|5.0|caballe has a strong voice but  instead of going up a sutherland does she extends the notes, her fiatos are very piano & i'm not a fan of that feature of her, but she's one of the best sopranos of the 20th century. bergonzi is fine; to me is bergonzi recording hunting open season; i'm starting to discover him. i read before that pretre's direction is kind of caotic, well is not the best traviata on the market, but is very pleasant. i stil have as my favorite the sutherland/pavaroti version. if you do like me who i like to have 5 different versions of my favorite operas, this is one of the 5 best
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved this book, Tina lets you into the life of a comedian and she keeps you entertained and engaged throughout the whole book.  If you are looking for a funny lighthearted book about an intelligent woman in the business....read Bossypants!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I watched this movie years ago and have always love it! One of my favs. All the stuff by yhem is great!
B008602KQI|5.0|Good movie, the plot was a lot better than I expected, I never read the book, so I really didn't know what to expect.
B001VLC3T8|4.0|This rooster is very colorful.  The quality is good and I like the realism Schleich puts into their products.  A bit pricey, but I feel there farm animals are worth it.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I don't listen to this genre of music.  But I could not help becoming a fan of Susan Boyle after hearing her sing a couple of songs on this CD.  She is one of the few exceptions to my normally loud rock playlist.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|Ending was a bit too ambiguous and didn't necessarily have to be that way, I think.  But, typical LeCarre fiction.
B001DF68MA|5.0|My son loves to go on bike rides with his daddy.  This seat is on my husband's bike, and he has no trouble with it.  I, however, cannot ride my husbands bike with this on because there is not enough room for me to comfortably get on and off his bike; this is most likely because of the height of the bike and less to do with the baby seat.  (I'm short.) We are going to try it on my bike to see if it will work for me, but even if it doesn't, this is awesome for my husband's bike.  I have a friend who is 5'5&#34; and she has no problem at all.
B003XU3MWM|3.0|I love historical movies. So any chance to watch a movie based on the Roman Ninth Legion that disappeared in England is a must watch for me.  Michael Fassbender is an awesome actor and he does a great job in this movie, but for my taste there was too much blood spray.  too much scenes of heads coming off or sliced in two. Or legs being cut off...things of that nature. Enjoyed the plot and the story, but was disappointed in the gore.
0785165975|5.0|I plan to have all 4 hardcovers of the Kick-Ass saga and this makes the third one and it was brand new, so I have absolutely no complaints.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Watch this movie and it will change the way you eat.<br /><br />A fascinating look at how the food industry has changed and not for the better.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|It did not fill up to my expectations. Really have not had the chance to listen to it all. Might get a better review later?
B00371XIJE|5.0|Richard Gere plays a tender and hear twarming part. The fact that it is a true story makes it more unbelieveable. This movie shows the true attachment between people and their pets. Not a dry eye at the end.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I choose this review because it is so fun to play.  My Niece turned me on to this and said that it was a very fun game.  I can spend hours on end playing this game.  You really have to pay attention and look over the whole playing field to figure out you next move.  I like that as a challenge.  This was the first time that I played it, and it was not hard to learn.  It is just fun to play.  Yes, I would recommend to family and friends
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great album...had only heard a couple of songs that a friend shared with me and was surprised that I loved the whole album!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME.<br />VERY MIND RELAXING,<br />AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK.<br />MY VERY OWN NON HASSLE AQUARIUM.
B00821OX98|5.0|We enjoyed this sci-fi series.  There is a human aspect with interesting plots mixed in with the alien battle scenes so it can appeal to a fairly broad audience.  My teen-age daughters didn't care for it, though.
B008573RRS|1.0|I found this book very hard to finish .  It jumped around from the present to the past to his imagination.  It was a book chosen by the book club I belong to, only one person in the group liked it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We have only completed up to episode 5 but every night I struggle not to keep watching til I drop!
0307352153|5.0|Her stories combined with research and history were fascinating.  Her ideas of how to practically use the information in a marriage, with children, at work were immensely helpful
B00CL68NOG|4.0|light fun and worth the watch. not Oscar stuff but very nice performances...Streisand's sense of comedy is mellowed ...played the mother perfectly.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I think this was the author's first big novel so I cut him a little slack. It had a good plot and some interesting twists.  The characters in this book do so much shrugging you would think they would be plagued by neck and shoulder cramps. It is obvious to me that the author did some research to understand the details of several types of firearms. Unfortunately, he had a Hollywood understanding of more basic gun facts. He portrayed a shotgun as having the ability to turn everything past the end of the barrel into confetti. Stuff like that bugs me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|you should get this game if you like horse's you get to groom them feed them and more . the best game in the world
B007A4SDCG|5.0|The War of Art is written with brilliant humor and personal insight. If you want a book that is a pleasure to read and will get you motivated to start whatever project you've been resisting--this is the one.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you saw this movie, you remember the awesome music... This CD will not let you down.<br />Three required words?
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|If you are a Metal fan at all, you need to hear this album.  Back in the 1960's and 70's, we got spoiled when one could buy an album and every song was worth listening to. Nowadays, one good song per album with some fairly good ones is standard.<br /><br />But \\"13\\" rates with the first two Black Sabbath albums.  Every song is great!<br />It is gratifying to see that they can get back together and do this!
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|This was an entertaining movie that my whole family from my wife and I to our teens and our nine year old enjoyed. The story confused me at first because of a deviation from a minor element that I remember from when I first read this story as a child, but I liked how they resolved it at the end.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed if you enjoyed movies like the Narnia series.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This was my first Theodore Boone book. I've been a Grisham fan for many years, though, and loved the way an understanding of the law was artfully woven into a great story. Hard to put down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I always love these kind of logic games. and as an added bonus this one was free! so far it's not to difficult but it's gradually getting harder.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Great conversation and chemistry between two actors. If you are looking for a good romance movie, this one should be in your list.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|It got off to a very, VERY slow start and only pick up toward the end.  Not worth the HD price.
B0087EACJK|1.0|Don't waste your time on this one...not a great game on a Kindle Fire HD. Maybe it would work better on something else?
B004X75RK4|5.0|Sandra Bullock is great! I think she is better in romantic comedies than Katherine Heigl, Ryan Reynolds opposite Sandra Bullock was perfect, great characters! Loved it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Just love angry birds!! I paid for this app (mainly because the free versions drive me crazy with so many ads!!
B00C4QSE2O|3.0|Early 90's flick, I remember it being better when I was a kid...my biggest gripe is that it was too long, just when you thought it might be wrapping up, there was another 45 minutes to go..its an ok movie if you just want something easy and mindless to watch...
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The ads in this free version drove me nuts!!! Things would pop up in the middle of a game -- I got so frustrated that I finally spent the $0.99 to remove the ads!! Cool game, though!
B00DF0POXA|5.0|This album is great overall, it's one of those albums that takes time to digest because of the production style and lyrics. I personally enjoy the production, it reminds me of Gil Scott-Heron music and 90's rock. The lyrics are there as well, and as always with Kanye West, they are all straightforward. I know there will be people out there bashing this album and calling it garbage. However, if you like experimental production and good lyrics, purchase this album.<br /><br />Top 5 tracks in no official order:<br /><br />Blood on The Leaves<br />Bound 2<br />New Slaves<br />Hold my Liquor<br />Send It Up
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Contains all the essential functionality from the web-site version.<br />Works as expected on the Kindle Fire - no crashes or fatal abends of the application.  Seems reliable and stable.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a fun little version but nothing new.  You will have fun playing this and there are some challenging levels but unless you are a die hard mahjong player you will play and then want to go on.
B00C33M2EE|4.0|The DVD is great. The music is wonderful, but if you're a fan who has been following for a while, a lot of the songs have already been released as singles. But if you are just coming into the Piano Guys or just have the 1st CD, this is a must have!
B004ELSDZK|4.0|Not the best game I have ever played but fun for a while.  I like idea of the game but it just dose not hold your attention for long periods of time.  Not really a little kids game but adults will enjoy the mental challenge.  If you like puzzles it will hold your attention for a bit
B009XY97VC|4.0|Some great music for working out, playing games or just feeling like you need to save the world. I would highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a challenging game for all and I think it's  to cool. My family loves the game especially my daughter.
B001661RC2|4.0|then you'll like this album. Most likely. Idk. Buy it and see. Or listen. Okay I need to stop reviewing music all I can think of for albums are 'Great,' 'Okay', and 'Terrible.'
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Got this game about a week ago and I can't stop playing it, very addicting. You can either do the training mode which is sorta like a campaign or play online and test your skills. Very fun either way. While the game could use some multiplayer improvements like more game modes, and various vehicle improvements it is still worth it. Plus its free, who doesn't love free?
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Like the fact that it tells me how much battery I have left with a quick glance at my screen.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I wanted a mobile I didn't have to wind up as majority do now, this one has a switch and a remote which hangs on bubs door handle for easy access if he is unsettled. When I first looked at the pics I thought it looked flimsy however that is not the case at all. Bub and I and my 5 year old all love it.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A must see by kids. Fun, adventure, and the underdog wins!  My kids loved it like I did when I was their age. Good family night movie.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Amazing game really worth playing and trying out, easy to learn fun to play really happy with this game AWESOME job
B001RU2YUQ|5.0|I love this movie it has something for everyone from Hugh Jackman  Nichole kidman  from war to romance and a little humor love it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love My Horse.Even though sometimes it slows down a little. I think that anyone who loves horses will love My Horse. It's really cool because you can even invite your friends over to see your horse.
B0090SI42Y|3.0|movie was a little violent for me, but marshall arts was fun to watch could take or leave it oky
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|What a storyteller. The characters are unique and authentic, I love finding a book I can't put down and yet again wasn't disappointed by this author.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This was a delightful book, and I loved the Forrest Gump feel to it, bringing the past together with actual events.  Very funny, and titillating ends to each chapter, which pulled you into the next.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Can't stop with just one episode, you get hooked and fall in love with the characters.  A good series and you can enjoy with the entire family with no worries.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|The movie is based on a true story and is very motivating for teens, it shows that perseverance is a key for success. Nonetheless, the end of the movie gives a wrong message, after all it is done....
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I would recommend this app to anyone who likes WW2 or just guns in General I can honestly say both weaphone are the best weapon simulation app in the app store
B004LLDN3A|1.0|Love the movie but the movie service was not there.  It kept shutting down.  Vudu worked much better.  Glad I didn't spend more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyday I try to get the daily challenge. It helps me in my goal in getting all the people there is to get . Also the hover boards are a good touch.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|Great movie. I really likedmthemcharacters and the &#34;twist&#34; at the end . A good movie for a quiet date night at home!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The formatting is good for a busy person to be able to read and drop it quickly.  I love the history I learned.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|If you are reading this stop right now and go read the book. Yes...it is that good. You can thank me later.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|What a classic!  We watched it to get us ready for Monsters University.  Mike and Sully are the best.  Great for all kids young and old!
1938469011|5.0|A great history of hops as well as some great science behind the use and selection of hops. Best book on the subject I've read.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Juliana Margolis (spelling - my apologies) is brilliant, as are all the big name actors. The writing is rich and intelligent while the story line is captivating. I want to grow up to be just like her.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Very few shows continue to have legs after five seasons much less eight, Supernatural does. The casting is always excellent, and while the storyline at its core tends to recycle every other season it remains highly entertaining and I find myself looking forward to the ninth and even a tenth season.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This was a nice change from the zombie sprinter movies. You actually feel bad for the zombies once you learn more about them. There were a few plot holes, but overall this was an entertaining movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love every novel he has written. It is written with it twists and spins, but in the end, all thread are tied. As the reader, you feel the emotion of the characters.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Incredible book! I loved it. Nelson DeMille is one of the best American authors. Great attention to the details. Everything is very clear and descriptive. And I love John Corey and his attitude.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well worth watching!  I had to limit myself to one episode a day because I didn't want to finish it too soon.
B005544V6A|5.0|The two main characters have a great rapport.  Supporting cast are solid and their characters are fun, soap opera-ish, well-defined.  I particularly like Rich Hoffman.<br /><br />This is escapist tv at it's best:  tongue-in cheek, fun, often unbelievable, with characters & plot lines strictly defined.  The protagonists are the heroes, the supporting cast are various shades of grey, the bad guys are the bad guys.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|When you make a 10 song LP of 7 minute grooves (give or take), you understand, something special just happened..... the groove came back to RnB. It's not about what your saying, it's about how you present it. Justin and Timbaland worked this presentation to the bone. They give you the standard pop appeal, and then they proceed to dress and layer it all up, and then strip it all away again. RnB has lost it's way, and this album found the proper path
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! Awesome! Some of the levels are a little challenging but overall I. really enjoyed playing this game. Wish it was longer.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It has been a while where I couldn't put a book down because it was so good. This book is a great read. Depressing in many ways but a great read.
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|This is a fine app. I got it for free and even the extra plugins were free. So thank you, Amazon.<br />This app is very nice. The pictures are nice, the sounds are recorded in good quality and the design is very well done.<br /><br />The reason I gave it only 3 stars, is because it's useless for me. I easily fall asleep and don't need any help for that. So instead of helping me asleep, these sounds only keep me awake. So I was hoping it could wake me up with these sounds, but the alarm only works with the sounds of your smartphone.<br />So I don't need this app.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I can certainly understand why Denzel was nominated for an Oscar--this is a movie that keeps you at the end of your seat and Denzel was outstanding.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|funny game. It's a basic platform game but it's well done. Only played the main game untill now and I liked  it.<br />The only contra I could find are the virtual joystick, that's virtual unusable on a smartphone. And some parts of the levels do happen in the background. On a small screen it's hard to see what's happening.
0399162097|2.0|My reviews try to explore facets of a book that other reviewers' may miss.  Thus with already 28 reviews posted on \\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves\\" - hereafter, (WAACBO), and nearly all of them extremely positive, I didn't want to regurgitate what you may have already encountered.  So, I did some research to determine how many popular books have been written about this topic?  Not many, Ms. Fowler mentions, Edward Rice Burroughs of course.  She pays tribute to Franz Kafka, \\"A Report for an Academy\\" by quoting a portion at each chapter's beginning.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there are very few adult fiction stories published which focus on chimpanzees.  I found only two recent releases.  The most recent being, Sara Gruen's \\"Ape House: a Novel\\" published in 2010; which takes up the cause of bonobos, Apes that survive captivity.  Far more interesting was locating the book, \\"Captivity\\" written by Debbie Lee Wesselmann and published in 2008, with which WAACBO shares quite a few parallels.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:<br /><br />In both books, the central character (Rosemary (WAACBO) and Dana) have been raised with a chimpanzee in their childhood home as a part of an experimental study on communicating through language using American Sign Language (ASL).  Both are conducted by the narrator's father, who is a Research Psychologist at a Midwest University.  Both stories focus on the experiment's abrupt termination when the chimp participates in a tragic event.  Both women experience life altering changes as a result of the traumatic termination of the study and subsequent loss of their chimp sibling from their lives.  Both stories include a rogue male sibling, who expresses his own devastation through illegally setting experimental animals free.  Both narrators' grow up, choosing careers that champion chimpanzee freedom from their lives of medical inquiry or physical abuse into sanctuaries similar to habitat of their ancestors, where both narrators career leads to overseeing chimpanzee protection from further human abuse.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good read, this book was entertaining.  Rosemary's character was intriguing and empathetic.  Although the book starts in the middle to keep the focus off the fact that Fern is a chimp and not a human sibling (the narrator's references are confusing until the last 3rd of the story), it was useful.  You will find the story line engaging particularly the emotional impact that Fern's loss after 5 years of being part of the \\"family\\" has on each person is a clever exploration.  I don't know if \\"Captivity\\" plunges these depths.<br /><br />I am disappointed that the story premise and story line appears to parallel \\"Captivity\\" so closely based on my research.  I challenge those who wanted a 5 star review to check out \\"Captivity\\" review page.  I based 95% of the comparison between WAACBO and \\"Captivity\\" is based on my reading of WAACBO and the reviews of \\"Captivity\\" on this website.  I have not read \\"Captivity\\", I'm not providing any information that you can't find at your fingertips.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoyed this book a lot more when I thought it was an original plot.  I hope Amazon will not delete my commentary or alter its original form pursuant with my Vine Agreement that I have provided a review of my choosing in return for receiving a free copy of this book.  However, my own experience demonstrates the possibility.<br /><br />UPDATE:  7/23/13 - Captivity<br />Since I have been disparaged for not reading Captivity, I have completed 3 chapters and the similarities are very similar, even the manner in which the narrative is written.  I will post more when I have completed the story.  Meanwhile, I challenge those who wish to judge me to compare them as well.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: 8/23/13<br />Though I finished \\"Captivity\\" by Debbie Lee Wesselmann nearly 4 weeks ago, and a month had passed since I completed reading Fowler's WAACBO.  I am absolutely sure that WAACBO was very muchinfluenced by the story line of \\"Captivity\\".  In fact, those who are interested, I refer you to the following pages:31,32,33,45,89,127,and 285 as these contain sentences that are nearly the same (one or two may be identical).  In addition, each story has a professor, who was an family friend during the experiments, who later turns out to betray the \\"siblings\\" of the \\"sister\\" chimp in a significant and similar manner.<br />Yes, there are some variances and perhaps enough to pass it off as original but I won't read another Fowler story.<br />I thought Captivity was much more interesting and would encourage those only wanting to read one of these to consider \\"Captivity\\".
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game! So much fun! I can play this for hours<br />I usually take my Kindle to the Dr. office with me. And this<br />game makes time fly.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This thing is so consistently reliable it's almost unbelievable.  Plus it has the most full featured interface that I can imagine. Anything that fails to complete can usually be fixed by simply accessing the download list and stopping and restarting the item.<br /><br />Just make sure to keep the program updated, since YouTube sometimes makes changes to their own system that break it.
B001Q7JD3Q|4.0|peter Jackson has made beater  films then king Kong...<br />but to tell you the truth just watching a jack black movie that is not funny is sort of weird!
B0065CCM76|1.0|After paying for the title - it did not show up and did not download.  I checked the download menu - it still did not showl up.
B005FISBTO|1.0|I purchased Dexter: The Sixth Season because I love Dexter - that's not the problem.  The problem was with this product.  I had two copies of disk two - one was labeled disk one, but it was in fact another copy of disk two.  Thus, I had to return and reorder.  So there you have it.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|I bought this as a gift. It was just what my friend wanted. I wish the the Digital code would of worked but all is good. Thank you.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was a &#34;cant put it down, need to know what happens next&#34; kind of books. Refreshingly different story line.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This a cute game. I've sent hours playing it. I don't get very far but it's so fun it don't matter. Try it you will probably like it. My teens like it to.
1926778537|5.0|One of the best art book i bought. A ton of sketches, concepts/designs and all of them are awesome.<br />Joe Madureira and his team did a great job!<br />I Just wish some of the sketches/paintings could be bigger on the page, to see all the details.<br /><br />Go get it, its worth it!<br /><br />... still waiting fo Darksiders 3
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a fun game. I guess I like going around chomping on things. Hmm, I didn't know I was so cruel.  LoL
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Love the Amazon Prime movies and this movie is so heart warming and gives our children a perspective and outlook on judging a book by it's cover before really getting to know a person, awesome movie.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|It gets  boring after a little bit, but I still go back and play it now and again.  Thank you
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I love this old movie, it is a good movie that the whole family can watch and a wonderful excuse to spend family time, I totally recommend.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Recommended by my sister and I loved it.  Quickly drew me right in  to the characters.  Already into season two.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Gets better with every listen. I have not taken it out of the stereo yet.Its even got some banjo and fiddle going on.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I loved the first two books but thought this book was disjointed.  I had a hard time finishing the book and have told friends and family not to bother.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book, although I wish that I had written down some of the character's names and who they were.  It was a little confusing, but as the story continued, it did become clear who was who.  And although there was some confusion, it was totally out-weighed by the writing, the story and the characters. Hosseini painted beautiful pictures with his words.  I recommend this highly!
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|its ok but it is weird when his neck breaks ugh omg  and he nedds to shave ugh yea i complaine
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoying this series. Learned about it long after it was already a hit. Glad I can catch up on the episodes via Amazon.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have been a fan of this series from the very beginning when it aired as a 2 part pilot on the CBS series JAG. NCIS - has succeeded in lasting 10 years, same as it's predecessor JAG and I'm looking forward to season 11 starting this fall. Just when I thought they couldn't top the season 9 cliff hanger with the explosion of a car bomb outside the NCIS offices in the Washington DC Navy Yard and leaving us thinking that Duckie had been killed suffering a massive heart attack at the shock of learning the team and many other occupants of NCIS might have been killed by a car bombing, they have a 2 part episode in the middle of the season killing off ZIva's father, the Israel Musaud leader Eli David and and the wife of the NCIS director which leads up to the hunt of the assassin by Ziva who in her heart wants revenge for the death of her father. She finds and kills the person responsible which leads up to an outside investigation which has us believing they are after Ziva when in the end it turns out to be a cover up and the person they are after is team leader Leo Jethro Gibbs. This also leads up to the surprise visit of former JAG commanding officer Admiral AJ Chegwedden who is no longer working at JAG but is now a high price high power attorney and who would be best to help with the defense of GIbbs. This is a top notch series and the cast is top notch with Mark Harmon as Gibbs who not only is the lead character but also a co producer of the show, and a top notch supporting cast Michael Weatherly as ever wize cracking and movie efficianado Anthony DiNozzo, Cote de Pablo as former Israeli Mossad Assassin  Ziva David brought in to replace agent Caitlin Todd who was killed by Ziva's half brother at the end of season 2, Sean Murray as the MIT computer geek Timothy Mcgee, Pauley Perette as the goth, tattoo bearing and very savvy Forensic Specialist Abby Sciuto, Rocky Carrol as NCIS Director Leon Vance who came in after season 5 to replace the former director Jenny Shepard after her death, David McCallum as the chief medical examiner Dr. Donald \\"Ducky\\" Mallard, and Brian Dietzen who plays Ducky's medical assistant Jimmy, both in the field and in the morgue. This show came along at a time when CSI was running strong in the ratings and I have a gut fealing that NCIS will out last CIS because of the great stories and the raport between team members, and believing and following Gibbs rules, the drama and the humor with the wake up head slaps. This is not only a top notch investigative team but also a family that I have grown to love in the 10 years this show has been on. I don't know what I will do when this show finally comes to an end. I fully believe it will be when the cast and producers decide it's time to end it and not failing ratings that will kill this show as it is consistently in the 10 ten ratings week after week and reruns of the show are run almost daily on cable USA network. In my opinion NCIS is the best series on TV because of the ever developing characters and I can only wish that we might see NCIS continue on for another 10 years. Anything is possible. I keep thinking they are going to come up with another spin off of the series with the Coast Guard Criminal Investigative Service since they've had the re-curring character played by a former cast member of Law and Order SVU Diane Neal. Hey she's a red head, she's got a personality like Gibbs...I'm thinking there is a possible match there.fter her death, David McCallum as the chief medical examiner Dr. Donald \\"Ducky\\" Mallard, and Brian Dietzen who plays Ducky's medical assistant Jimmy, both in the field and in the morgue.

B0094M2S5A|5.0|A classic with many great actors. I bought it on VHS decades ago and still enjoy watching it frequently. LOVE Jeff Goldblum!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Not normally a fan of musicals but this one was aas good as it gets for me.  Most could not really sing but still made it work.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|The book seemed scattered at times but it really pulled together at the end. It's always nice to have a happy ending.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not usually a Tom Cruise fan, but this is maybe one of his better films. The action was believable and not aver the top.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|My eight year old son loves all the extra things he can do and get on Minecraft after adding the pocket editor.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|We watched on LED TV. Very good story and movie. Download was very fast, the main advantage of Amazon vs. apple
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love a good mystery, even more I love a great search and find hidden objects.  This started off great, but there was too much business for my taste.  All of the choices on the right as well as on the left you have all of the quests.<br /><br />I also had an issue with the size of the working screen.  It was very small for elderly eyes.  :)
B009EAO38C|5.0|This music is beautiful!! I would buy it again and again.  You can also view videos on you tube...I am waiting for the next cd.cd.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|nothing new, you can see the twist a mile away.  terrible ending.  not even really good for a date night. drags at times.  just a ripped dude and an attractive girl with bad acting skills, if that's your thing
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love it want more. some hit boxes were a little small and the music could use a little variation but its tun
B0081336FO|5.0|I enjoy all of the sherlock homes episodes, they are creative and thoughtful.  I recommend seeing them. They glue you to the screen.
0152023984|5.0|This item adequately does the job that I bought it for.  Would definitely buy this item again if I ever needed to.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This game could be fun but it makes it too hard to invite friends so you cant complete your collections. Need to make inviting friends simpler. Also freezes up too much.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Dumb is the only word that comes to mind when I watched this.  It was BAD and I would not recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I this this is man is such a great writer. All of his books go deeper into a story....I would recommend this book.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I wanted to see this movie when it came out to the movies but my husband didn't want to go see it.  I ordered this movie through Amazon and I think it is a cute and really funny movie.  I would watch this movie again.
B000JIHP88|3.0|This was much bigger than I thought it was going to be.  But it works good and didn't go through batteries too fast.  Worth the $$.
B007REV4T8|5.0|EXCELLENT! Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Not sure what this movie is rated but my grandkids ages 4-6 love it. While it's a cute story and well done, the main character is still bad - and never gets punished for his evil ways. Giving the story a happy ending doesn't make it OK for him to be a world class liar and thief. What is it teaching? Looks to me like it's OK to behave in whatever manner we choose as long as the end justifies the means. Not right, in my book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series....my husband and I look forward to watching each episode together.  I think a Downton Abbey party is in the future...
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoy the detail. Had a hard time discovering how to access the map for hints. If you like hidden object mysteries it is worth you time.
B00821OX98|4.0|One of the better sci-fi shows on TV.  If you're looking for a bit of action, a bit of sci-fi, and some semi-decent character development, this is the show for you!
B004QX07G4|5.0|it was exactly what I was expecting and more! it's full of good vibes and you just can't stop smiling while turning every page...
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book goes deeper into our future and shows yet another example of the predictions able to be made by simply judging our present. Though the swooning royalty and drama may seem overpowering one should not be conceived.  This book gives us a great example of a strong female character which even in today's more equal society is still fascinating and refreshing. The use of \\"history\\" in this book is extremely creative and profound because though in the setting of the book it is history, for us it is actually the future but some how it feels closer then it is.  This is because of the subtle but clever use of today's reality mixed in.  Though I am only eleven I recommend this book to readers who will  be insightfull and read in between the lines.  l hope that readers will enjoy this book in the same way I did.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|this works great , just like the original one. i must remember not to spill coffee on this one or let the dog chew on it
030758836X|4.0|What starts off as a standard mystery keeps you guessing until the end! An easy read but the characters and their character draw you in.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|It works... that's all I ask!  I can easily create new folders, move documents/files around.  Looks good and it's free.  What else can you ask for.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It's a great game. I have really enjoyed it. They should try more games like this one. Maybe space invaders or Pac man.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I been using Shazam since October of 2012, and it has really helped me to know what song is being played, and to also know the songs that are being played during a TV show!  I highly recommend this app!
B004V71CYQ|5.0|Still a very good movie.  The special effects were great at the time it came out.  I especially enjoy watching this movie and Tron: Legacy back-to-back
0156027321|3.0|I would love to read the book that the top reviewer on this list, Mr. Steve Koss describes in his review, but that was not Life of Pi. Perhaps the novel aspires to these qualities, but in actuality, the book truly is a survival story, nothing more. The sea journey is the bulk of the novel and it is a pure survival story. Pi never explores his faith during this time and almost all of this section is concerned with h the details of survival.<br /><br />I agree with Koss's point that the idea at the end of the novel puts a faith as an interest in the best story. I thought this was a rather superficial exploration of faith; also, Pi could have told any story that was interesting and have it prove this point. Why the tiger? Why the boat? Anything as exciting and unbelievable could have sufficed in proving this final point. The painstaking storytelling in the middle of the novel failed to purposefully culminate for me.<br /><br />To the prospective reader: this is a good survival/companion story in which the main character is entranced by the beauty of religion. If you're looking for something deeper about the meaning of life or the existence of God (which the novel claims to discuss), look elsewhere.
B009C7JS14|1.0|DON'T GET APP it does not work on kindle FIRE it sucks! Don't get APP it's stupid it takes forever to load none of the buttons work,wrong maps , when it's sunny it says it's raining CRAPY APP!!!
B000E41MRC|1.0|i also don't actually find the story believable because the president or whatever that these guys are supposed to be worshipping and waving too all the time can barely speak correctly and is a very small man. he also copied michael jordan's mustache style from that nike commercial. maybe this is all supposed to be comedy, but a bit too dry for my taste! :D
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was by far the greatest summer read! Love the characters! I cannot wait for the second book to come out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game will work your mind. I was hoping it wouldn't be to hard, it wasn't. Use logic and it becomes a great adventure.  Very enjoyable.
B00005JL96|5.0|Good movie thanks.  Just as advertised.  My kids have been wanting this movie and it was very inexpensive from you.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was tired of cards and tiles and found this, I like this game, not too hard but a really fun distraction.
0891419063|5.0|I have relatives who served in the Marines in WWII.  They don't talk about their experiences in the Pacific Theater.  Sometime ago I was given a copy of this book and told &#34;this is how it was&#34;.  It's written a little rough and can be a difficult read.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|I highly recommend this book as well as the other books in the Wolves of Mercy Falls  series.  They  took me to a place  I hated to leave by the end of this last book. Thank you Maggie Stiefvater for a great escape!
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|I missed this movie when it came out in the late 90's and for some reason it made my list of movies to watch recently. I'm so happy that I did. A great, feel good movie with a positive message. I'm going to watch it again with my kids I liked it so much.
B006K1IIHA|5.0|Blu Ray quality is good. Cumberback & Martin are fun and believable as Sherlock and Watson. Contemporary Moriority through us for a loop, quirky and weird portrayal. Thoroughly enjoyed the story line in both season one and season two. If you are a Sherlock Holmes fan, this set worth the money. Great addition to all Sherlock collections.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Met my expectations. The songs are well recorded and faithfully respond to the film. I loved it. Definitely I recommend purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First book I have read in a long time that is truely page-turning.  This book is for anyone, of any age.  Can't imagine how a writer could come up with this concept.  I just couldn't put it down.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I read this book for my book club and really enjoyed the total story. I will look for more book from the author.
B00846REIS|5.0|HOLY COW!  Sometimes I just wanted to crawl in this book and knock Gideon and Eva's heads together.  Looking forward to the next book in the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was challenged by this app. I'm  looking forward to more rooms.<br />I hope they will be even more challenging.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|WOW-ZER!  I am so glad I have a Kindle that reads to me because I COULDN'T STOP READING and I needed to get some work done!!!  Bring on book 2
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|If you want to improve your memory then buy this book and study it. Harry Lorayne and Jerry Luca make it easy to learn and fun to use. I bought this book many years ago and I discovered that improving your memory was like building your body. You have to work at it, and when you become proficient, you have to keep practicing in order to remain sharp, This system works - and it's fun learn to learn. You will discover that as your memory improves the more you remember the more you are able to remember.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0098L3LQW The Starlight Club (Starlight Club, The)]] by Joe Corso.
B00821OX98|4.0|I needed something to entertain me and this fit the bill nicely. Pretty good story line, nice visuals (especially considering this is made for TV and not the Silver Screen), easy to fall in love with the characters (except Pope; that !@#$%!). I wanted something to watch slowly, however, after taking in the first 3 episodes of season 1 I pretty much watched the rest of the season AND season 2 within 3 more days.<br /><br />I recommend!
B002NJUN44|4.0|This is one of my family's favorite movies to watch.  We wish they made the sequel to it.  Enjoyed it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Judged on its own merits, this is a fine YA adventure novel with something for everyone - a romantic love triangle, government conspiracies, and bloody combat in a futuristic version of the gladiatorial combats. Clearly written and a quick read, this is a nice counterpoint to the legions of doorstops infesting the book world.
B007SUW24W|5.0|This album is really good! Ed Sheeran has an amazing voice and he has some really good songs to display his voice on. Best songs include his hit single \\"The A Team\\", \\"Lego House\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Wake Me Up\\", \\"U.N.I\\", \\"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\\". The only ones I don't really like are \\"Kiss Me\\" and \\"Give Me Love\\". They are both good but I can't help but skipping them because they're too long and repetitive (especially \\"Give Me Love\\"). Otherwise, this album is a very promising debut for Ed Sheeran, and I can't wait to hear his future work!
B0068THAGY|5.0|But with a little more violence.  I have to say I love the movie told from the kids point of view.  This is a keeper.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Those who enjoyed Hosseini's other works should like this novel.  In this book, we do not see the physical violence of his other two novels, but rather the emotional loss caused by the forces of poverty.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm stuck at level 3. But I really like the game. I wish the game maybe had hints or something to help you out when you're stuck. I don't have any ad issues with this game.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|Just doesn't have all the right features.  Crashes and freezes and hiccups a lot.  Better to a access via browser, rather than have it be a chore to use it.
B00013M6NK|5.0|I needed a spare battery for when I'm out on long photoshoots. These batteries last so long, I've never had to switch them while I'm out. My old camera and batteries might only last 1/2 hour. Today I took 210 photos over a 5 hour period and it's still ready to shoot more.
B000FC146C|5.0|It was a super read,,,all 704 pages...once started you could not put it down..The love story was so tender and one learned so much about  down/under  CLS
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ln the kindle along with jetpack joyride (also a boss game) i play it like freakin 24/7. Keep up the good work creators!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|The alarm clock is easy to use and eliminates one extra thing to bring with when traveling. I like that you have a choice of sounds instead of a mind rattling buzzer, and can add a message or reminder. Wasn't expecting that on my Kindle, but I'm glad it's there.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I ONLY GAVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE I CAN'T USE IT-YOU NEED TO HAVE FACEBOOK FOR IT TO WORK.  RIDICULOUS!!!  I'M NOT INTERESTED IN FACEBOOK,
B009VSW15Y|2.0|The only thing this is good for is taking pictures of yourself. Otherwise you can't see what you are getting or even where the button is.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and read. I use it work and home. Just a handy tool to have available on your tablet!
B00992CF6W|5.0|the best game I ever played it is totally worth how much it cost. u really get the real minecraft experiance
1609611543|5.0|This book has made my life , I no longer eat wheat  and I feel like I am 60 years young again . Iam 76 year's old and have more strength ,git up and go than Ive had  in years .Even my wife say's she feel's great . Thank You ever so much Doctor By the way I have lost 11/2 inch off my waist in the last 4 weeks .
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It is so cool and awesome I can't describe it. I play it every day and night of the week and will continue to do it every day for the rest of my life.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|Love this movie...  Great story.  You will enjoy this if you are into suspenseful mood.  Keeps you on your toes, so to speak...  Thanks guys!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is great for all ages. I have a 5 year old and two ten year olds who all take turns playing iron man app. Great hd graphics and sound and easy to upgrade armor.
B0067LY4WG|3.0|I like the track, Show Me the Place, the best. Gave it as a gift because I love Leonard Cohen and his poetry and his music. Not my favourite, but no regrets.
014241493X|1.0|This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Do not read this book. I literally cannot fathom how people managed to give this above 2 stars, let alone this book a 4.5 average rating. The book only kept getting worse as I kept reading, and the only reason I didn't put it down by chapter 2 was the hope that maybe it would have a good, satisfactory ending. It didn't. The way Green wrote it made me feel like I was supposed to feel sad and heartbroken at the end of the book, but the only emotion I felt when I finished this was anger because I realized I had just wasted 10 dollars and a few hours of my time.
0345803485|5.0|Just started reading it and already I can't put the book down. Great book. Addicting, alot of surprises can't wait to purchase the next book!
B00136RVAM|5.0|I downloaded this to a flash drive as an mp3 album. I listen to it all the time, good music to drive by.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Good thing that this was free. Loaded easily, beautiful graphics (for the room l was in) easy to move around the room and look at all the key points...  but NOTHING HAPPENS when l try to open the drawer or unscramble the puzzle. Disappointing as l like these kind of puzzles. High hopes, dashed. Took it off the Kindle and reloaded, no avail.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I know that most free games have small issues/glitches that can slow down game play, and this is one of those games. At first it was really fun even though it would glitch or crash once in a while. Then came the update loop. I was prompted to update my game, clicked on the little button and it took me to the Kindle App store, with no option to update only to open the game. As soon as I opened the game it told me to update. It was an annoying circle. I gave it a few hours and tried to play my game, it wouldn't even open so I removed it and reinstalled it. Starting over from the beginning. I completed the tutorial and then did my first land expansion for $2000 in game dollars...when that expansion was finished I selected to do another one...but stopped when I saw it was $640,000 for it. Even if I filled my existing space with buildings that make money it would take forever to save up $640,000 for one expansion. I'd hate to see what the second one will cost. This does not make me want to continue with this game.<br />I contacted customer service. They asked what level I was at and to give them an estimate of how much money I had and how many reward/paid for cash I had. I let them know and they deposited it onto my gameloft account... however, I let them know that I would have preferred to have all of my previous land expansions back instead of the $.<br />I still can't access all of my friends either. It's hit or miss. Sometimes I see a few, but mostly it doesn't show any.<br />I know it's just a game. But I expect more out of gameloft than this. Whatever that update was they pushed through, it's horrible.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I resisted reading this book for a while, not sure why, perhaps since I saw it was popular I did not think it was good.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong, what a great read. I without a doubt lost sleep several nights because I stayed up way later then I should have to read this book. This is a must read for a scifi fan.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love this stylus.  Other reviews stated that the tips of other styluses have fallen off shortly after receiving their product, but I have been using this stylus for a while now and have had no problems.  It works as specified, and with the three different sized tips you only need the one stylus with a tip to meet any of your needs.  The only problem I have with this product is there is no way to attach the stylus to the Kindle to keep from losing it.  I use the pen clip to attach it to my Kindle when not in use, but while using the Kindle I have lost the stylus in my lap or in the chair at times.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This is an amazing book, Scalzi should have won a Hugo or Nebula for this. I just finished it for the 2nd time and I was still impressed. Its a fast read, but it hooks you right away and you will lose sleep because you want to finish this book.
B00BVYU2P2|1.0|It's just garbage. My time is precious to me and what I view should have a purpose and/or be uplifting. This does neither.
B0020M99LC|5.0|I would give it a 8.3/10 because of the acting, the soundtrack...Everything!! Must watch. Daniel Craig plays one of the best James Bond ever!!!
B004HXIZVC|5.0|This app is so amazing. You can even listen to the music without wifi.Now i don't have to search for anymore apps because this is the best and it doesn't have any glitches or anything.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Kevin Spacey is terrific, but so is the entire supporting cast.  It's an addictive treat.  Season 2 can't start soon enough.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Mr. Duhigg began each chapter with a real world example (usually from the marketing world) to set up his point.  More powerfully, he would end each section with a general outline on how to go about implementing the strategy.  This proved important because this book makes you very aware of how much control you have over your worst habits, even those you may think out of your control (like alcoholism).<br /><br />The book proved to be a bit of a longer read than I had anticipated but it was necessary to get examples and strategies.
B007VTUYWW|3.0|Maybe because its old or the actress herself does not appeal to me like she used to.  Angelina Jo Lee has been through a lot lately regarding her health in the news, and just watching her trying to be a super women in the big movies has lost its fantasy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Heartbreakingly addicting from the first page to the very last. I didn't want it to end! John Green has a way of making readers feel like they've known his characters for years...
B0095P33IW|5.0|The story is very well played during WWII, the characters are believable and full of actions.  I missed this one when it was playing in the theaters but I'm glad to see at home from my Roku 2 streaming player.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|How about a search feature so you can scan the book for keywords.  Chapter search would be nice too.  Other than that, it's free and easy to use.
B001NLL93W|4.0|The story is part two of a series.  I was surprised that it contains surprising twists along with new characters.  It is enjoyable light reading, great for a vacation.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|enjoying the action and drama and the  plot to the story<br />every graphic in the blood scene<br />really like it
B000RUAR5G|5.0|Best Movie EVER!!!! Watched it with my son for the first time and he loves it just as much as I do!!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I've come to love Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole stories--a definite Norwegian feel--dark, dark, but dryly humorous--even find myself chuckling from time to time--but the stories are fantastic, and Phantom was no exception.  Jo Nesbo never disappoints!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|super fun. good waste of my time. one of the best FAOTD. kept me entertained for a while. I hope they add more levels
B0060AY6FO|5.0|In the style of Jane Austen, P.D. James continues the Pride and Prejudice story after the marriage of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy with a murder at Pemberly.  It was quite different, in that the writing style is very jane Austen-ish--and a departure from Mrs. James' Inspector Dalgliesh stories, but a lovely read, and as always, written beautifully.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love this game. very addictive! some levels are easy some very challenging. hope for more levels soon. very clever. give it a try!!
B000FC146C|5.0|This is the 2nd time reading the The THorn Birds, I read it the very first time it came out and thought I needed to read it again and am enjoying just as much as the first time years ago!
B007C12RDS|5.0|Excellent if you like British period dramas, which I do. :) The costuming is wonderful, some of the gowns Miss Lane wears are just stunning.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I'm truly amazed at this movie. It's underrated. I love great dramas and I never really saw this in the forefront of movies in theaters. Not highlighted anyway. So underrated...
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|My son wanted to watch this movie and I thought what a waste of money but I was wrong. It was actually a good movie. It was a great movie even for the kids although the whole zombie part is not good for little kids.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Adorable actors, slight story, but great music. Just a fun fast watch. A huge hit with the tween set but beware of the relentless use of the 'B' word.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It was a great, inspiring book. Steve is my idol and reading the book motivated me to try to make a dent in the universe.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This made the process a whole lot easier I referred back to it often as I prepared several books to be sold via kindle
B002XXNSF6|4.0|I saw Before Midnight and immediately became curious about the previous movies.  It's a sweet, romantic, intellectual comedy with lots and lots of dialog...very consistent with the last one.  Now that I've seen the first and last I'm very curious as to what happened in between.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book. I will tell all of my book loving friends. And I hope that you never stop writing
B00005RDRO|5.0|GREAT ADDITION TO MY OLD CLASSICS.  SO GLAD TO HAVE. LOVED ALL THE SCENES<br />AND MOVIE STARS. WISH NEW MOVIES WERE AS FUN TO WATCH
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this a very good game. it can be fast paced if you want it to be or you can stay away for days and pock up right where you left off
B00A757EFW|4.0|I loved this game as a kid, but I forgot just how much I sucked at it.  Play it anyway!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The 1st season is great. See the whole series seven seasons. It's interesting to see the changes the characters go through and how things change
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I really hate writing reviews for apps since I do not necessarily know what to compare to.  This app works as expected.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Ever since reading a copy of American Gods that a friend lent me, I have loved the writing of Neil Gaiman. Once again he has made a book full of fantastic imagination that draws me back into once-forgotten dreams of my childhood. I remember staying awake in bed as a child to finish a good book, and last night I did it again with this one (or at least I tried!)<br /><br />Thank you again Lily for that book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love the challange in this game.  Wish it had lots more free levels, but will most likely purchase more.
B008LG6SXS|1.0|Was not working fir me. Threw in the towel after attempting to get any results. I must be stubbirn because I soent way too many hours getting nowhere.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game so much that I conquer it over and over again.  I really wish there was a #2.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW, IS AMAZING WITH GREAT PLOTS,ACTORS AND COSTUMES, WILL RECOMMEND TO START WITH SESON 1, SEASON TWO AND YOU CAN'T WAIT TO SEASON 3 TO BE AVAILABLE, LOVE IT.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Kind of slow to progress, unless you want to spend real cash. It is possible to progress without spending money, but it takes a long time. Nonetheless, this is a very pretty game.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|What's your deal people? This game is awesome, stop giving it low ratings for stupid things... This is not the same as the free version... it has online multiplayer, and something I cant think of... Plus its only 1$, big deal... what else are you going to spend 1$ on? I would recommend this to anybody willing to play with food!<br /><br />BTW: This game is awesome on Xbox 360 kinect<br /><br />Endless hours of fun__or__A double cheese burger<br />which would you rather have?
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Have a wonderful night in watching this Blu-ray movie of Les Miserables sit back with a nice drink and float away with the tunes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that shoud let you spawn mobs but its awesome and the creaters are awsome and I think that its awsome
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Pudding Monsters HD really makes you think. It is a great way to spend some time and make your brain work but time flies by quickly. If you have an appointment to keep an eye on the time...
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app.  Just one more thing I am able to do on my tablet.  This makes life easier.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|As a huge fan of the music, and the live production,  I was quite disappointed. WHY WHY WHY do producers cast NON-SINGERS in musicals.. STOP IT!!!!!  This country has a plethora of extraordinary singers, with exceptional voices, and the ability to both emote and not dessimate the song in doing so.  This could have been an extraordinary piece of art, instead of the extraordinary piece of .....that it proved to be...for me.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|Great game, but extremely offended by yo ho. Why are those words used? I cringe everytime I hear it. 7 yr old asks why are they cursing.
B0087ITBPC|4.0|For me, the Awsomeness that is Barbra Streisand can never do wrong! I just love her to pieces!  Not a &#34;hardy laugh&#34; comedy, but plenty of &#34;chuckles&#34;. Definate chemistry between the two leads. The performances are what makes it worth your time.
B00632HWOG|3.0|However, there are some nice features such as folders, filters, alias email addresses for the same inbox.  But it bugs me when it doesn't work.
B000002O4X|5.0|John Barry is a sheer genius. One of the most sumptuous scores ever written. It simply takes your breath away. Do not go on living without experiencing this momentous musical acheivement.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is a series of &#34;interviews&#34; with veterans of the Zombie War in the style of Studs Terkel's oral history of WWII. The interviewees range from ordinary citizens and common soldiers to high-ranking government officials. Brooks' ability to give each character an individual voice is reminiscent of the best works of Mark Twain. It was a true (digital) page-turner in the best tradition of modern fiction.<br /><br />I fear for the movie product made from this book. World War Z does not contain the usual novel ingredients, i.e. narrative, plot, character development, etc. How this will be turned into a decent movie without losing its personal essence is something I prefer not to think about. No doubt, readers who care about such things will be disappointed. Witness the fast-moving, apparently collectivist zombies from the trailers. That is a complete departure from this fine book and seeing the movie first may well set a reader up from disappointment in this very good novel. Let the movie ticket buyer beware!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Nothing works. Uninstalling. That's right, uninstalling. This app is a large waste of time. It doesn't refresh, and the weather map won't render at all.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Edison gets credit but Tesla was the real genius. Edison was the businessman. Edison was wrong about direct current, Tesla was right about alternating current!.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was a big X-Files fan and this is the closest show I've seen to that. I am a science geek and really like that aspect of the show (most of which is way off) and this is make believe tv land, so enjoy the show
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|It's an action packed movie.  Just not what I was expecting out of a Die Hard movie.  Previews looked great.  Wont' be buying the dvd.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Honestly, I couldn't put it down once I began reading it.  I read, read, read until I finished the book, and then I was bummed that I had finished it.  I have enjoyed reading King through most of my life, and this book did not disappoint me.
B005H0IW76|5.0|My wife ordered this CD.  She simply loves Michael Bible... I can take  him or as an O.K. singer and a very handsome young man.<br />I give him Kudo's for singing the music that I love... matter of fact I can't think of a single other performer that sings this genre of music.<br /><br />All the other singers like Bassey, Jones, Englebert, Sinatra frank & nancy (who I love) with her duets with Lee Hazelwood and the wonderful Peggy Lee... Andy Williams and on and on and don't forget Perry Como the likes of all of them are either dead or living their life on a banana peel... Streisand is still around, but I find her boring and she sure hasn't aged gracefully at all
1442413611|5.0|Awesome storyline and my favorite book of the series so far. I would suggest this book to anyone under 30 but over 10
B00009RDGA|5.0|This is one of those movies that just rings the bell in every department... Bodonovich (best spelled) has picked up the feel of the great depression so vividly.  Tatum and her father are just perfectly matched in this depression era film.  Tatum is just as<br />good as McCaulkin was in home alone no, she was better for she didn't have all the other actors to play off of.  What in the hell happened to this protential of this young child
B001VB8UAE|4.0|Barbara Streisand is my favorite singer.  She sung many of her old hits.  \\"Lazy Afternoon\\", being one of my favorites was included on this DVD.  She looked classy and beautiful during her, \\"Live 1994 Arrowhead Pond\\" performance.  The stage decorations were elaborate and stunning.  Marvin Hamlisch was outstanding.  The music was beautiful and the audience were spellbound.<br /><br />That being said, this DVD does not show her performance in the best of quality.  The show at Arrowhead Pond was grainy and of poor quality.  I have not viewed the other concerts as of yet.  This is an expensive price for this DVD to show this terribly.  After awhile, I stopped watching it.  My four stars is for her 1994 Arrowhead Pond show, but for the quality, I give it a one star.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Thrilling and very action packed. Tom Cruise is captivating in this movie. Would recommend to watch to all my friends.
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|I felt the movie bludgeons you with it's main theme.<br /><br />Possible spoiler below do not read if you haven't watched:<br /><br />It's a literal interpretation of the following:  When we build walls around our hearts and don't let others in, we become like zombies shambling through our existence.  But, if we are brave enough to let love in we can learn to live again!<br /><br />end spoiler
B004OBQQSG|5.0|This is a classic, Jeff Bridges is fantastic, and if you loved Tron Legacy, you must get this movie!  Tron is one of the most fantastic stories and is much loved as part of my movie collection!  I will say my shipping was slow but the customer service and overall price made up for it.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|This movie was better than I had anticipated.  Good action and effects.  It's a good &#34;turn off your brain&#34; movie.
B003IY48PS|2.0|Okay, the sci-fi horror buffs are going to tell you what a classic this is and give you a thousand reasons why you should love this.  Evil Dead 2 was very good, but this one, just skip it.  I got it because I was all excited about the remake and had seen Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness loving both.  I regretted this movie for so many reasons.  All of the tackiness of Evil Dead 2 that made it special and fun to watch did not work in this movie.  It was really just over the top gore and that's about it.  Campbell didn't even really have the charm that he is so well known for in this one.  Evil Dead 2 is basically a remake of this one anyway and is much much better.
B008Y6MKSW|5.0|They don't make movies like this very often anymore.  The movie has heart and a moral to be learned.  Plus, Bill Murray is in great form which is always a wonderful thing to watch.
B003L16FAE|5.0|This movie is iconic for so many reasons.  The one liners were great, the set up is perfect, and the cast is unforgettable!  If you are looking to add this movie to your blu-ray collection, you won't be disappointed.  The updated graphics and sound made this movie brand new all over again.  I enjoyed every minute of watching it again and you will too!
B009AP4MGE|4.0|If you watch this you are a big loser, the end.  Im joking its kinda funny I guess, if you like songs sung by a buncha dolled up boys and girls
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|I didn't think this movie would be as great as it was because the first one was so excellent, but I was wrong!  They managed to write a story and bring in a cast that was so reminiscent of the first movie that I couldn't help but love it!  The characters are unforgettable including Adrien Brody who really surprised me as I did not see him as this type of military character.  If you love the Predator movies, you must add this one to your collection!
B002A9THA8|5.0|Recently watching \\"The Internship\\", they had so many references for Flashdance and Alex. It sparked a memory and my friend and I wanted to see it. Blockbuster  Video just reopened but their copy has been out!  Lucky for me it was able to be downloaded on iTunes. Unfortunately, we can stream the trailer via an HDMI cable to the TV but with AMAZON, you can't stream videos to the TV. Why?
B005J9ZE5I|4.0|Okay, it's sort of cheesy, the acting isn't going to blow you away, the story is far fetched, and it's a crazy gore filled mess.  So this might sound off but BUY THIS MOVIE!  Bruce Campbell is great throughout this movie!  Take it for what it is and don't expect a grade A movie, and you will have fun watching this movie!  I can't give this movie five stars for the previous reasons, but for a B movie, it's about as B+ as you can get!
B0009MAP9A|5.0|excellent album. I do not know what else to say, this is some of my all time favorite music by Dylan
B0090NNQX6|5.0|i give it to my sis. she really like it and it was what i am looking  for b-day gift.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is definitely a game worth getting because it is not something that will become boring 3 minutes after you download it. This game has great graphics and a bunch of different power ups that you can buy using the coins you earn in the game. So although there is the option to buy coins using real money  you will still be able to enjoy all parts of the game without spending any money! I absolutely love this game! Plus it works really well on kindle fire!
B00D6BQPMM|1.0|I never watched this movie not sure why its on my list..... this should be taken off if I was charged for it cause I never viewed this movie
148113373X|2.0|I've never read any of G.K. Chesterton so ordered this classic of his since he seems to be very popular among some folks but he's just not my cup of tea right now.  One thing I found off putting from the start is he kept referring to people I don't know.  I kept thinking who's that and how do they relate?<br /><br />Anyway, maybe I'll like him better at some other point in my life.  Right now, my focus is \\"losing my life to save it\\" as Jesus commanded so like reading lives and writings of the Catholic Church's canonized Saints.<br /><br />Perhaps this judgment is too hasty, though, since I only read about twenty pages and couldn't get into it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I liked it, it was a bit boring at times but if your a big Oz fan it is a must watch
B008YWY0HK|3.0|Absolutely week feature. Except young lady's hair her is no bright moment in a movie.  I like animated movies, so it's OK to watch once, but there no point to have it in your collection. I will never watch it again.
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|movie was pretty boring couldn't really get into the movie and actually didn't finish watching it all but it wasn't that bad....
B001XUPH9K|5.0|Great movie, a must see if you'd like to understand one of the most referenced movies lines ever. Not the most technically astounding movie, but it was a quite enjoyable watch, even with Shatner at the helm.
B004GXZ69W|3.0|THE BAD<br />This mouse is built extremely cheaply, it feels flimsy and gross in the hand and has the build quality of a $20 mouse, the materials are awful, it pretty much feels like a toy you would get in a box of cereal. The scroll wheel is noisy and has no texture, this is an awful mouse.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />Made every nuance of my wrist discomfort vanish in two days. This is my workhorse mouse.<br /><br />TL;DR<br />Don't buy this mouse unless your wrist hurts, this is not a &#34;good&#34; mouse but it does do what it was designed to.<br />For the love of god, don't buy this if you just think it's a cool mouse.
B005HEE60E|4.0|Not a very serious show, and the lack of budget shows, but there's a charm that makes it obvious why Trekkies still exist today.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Loved it .. also loved all the characters and can't wait for the new season to start .. without having to pay for it ...
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman is always good. Many people say that Ocean is his best work thus far, and it may as well be.
0670034711|5.0|best book ever, changed my life in fact. I have read many times but wanted to keep a copy myself instead of always checking out of the library
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I had low expectations for this show, but it continues to exceed expectations. Mature relationships and well-developed characters. I recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read.  I liked the format, story line, the writing and the history.  Every character was believable.  I hope Ms. Grissom will write a sequel so we can find out what happened to the family.  Superb reading.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this  game. I myself am a huge hidden objects kind of guy, so this game is just great for me!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|THESE SILLY LITTLE BLOBS JUST TICKLE MY FANCY. T REALLY LOVE CREATING THE MULTIPLE EYED LITTLE CRITTERS. THEY ARE SO SILLY.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|Kate Morton spins an engrossing tale that spans over fifty years, deftly telling the tale of two families whose paths crossed as a result of the second world war. Besides the engaging story that keeps you closely involved, there is a an opportunity to learn about the brave English and French people who were not soldiers,but risked their lives just the same in their covert roles in the Resistance movement, helping to defeat the Nazis.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to see this movie and read the next book!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl; :)  (omg this book was awesome full of suspicion which is a thing all books need to have!!!!!! , I am in a writing classes. I want to write a book when i am older so do you have any idea or advice for me
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We couldn't wait to find out how Season 9's cliff-hanger ending was resolved. We were not disappointed. This season continues to show Gibbs, Tony, Zeva, Tim, Abbey, and all the rest of the regulars growing as people and maturing each day as real people do. We appreciate that in a TV show. As usual the mysteries are engaging and entertaining. We can't wait to see what &#34;McAbbey&#34; will do next or when, if ever, Tony and Zeva will break rule #12, or is it #10. We love it!
B0094D462M|4.0|This is an all time classic movie that everyone who is a fan of Tom Cruse should watch. It is a must see.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show keeps you on the edge of your seat. Love it. Love it.  Love it.  Can't wait for season 3.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game, although I'm not through it all yet.<br /><br />I'm not a big gamer, so I really like the fact that it's not to obscure or complex to figure out.  I like the on-screen hint button, it not only shows where objects you are looking for are, but also where to go next if you get lost.  The graphics are nicely done.<br /><br />Overall, it's been a great way to spend some time.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|This season was certainly not the best. Many of the plot points seemed forced and some of the situations a bit far-fetched. Too many coincidences and I don't know how realistic the changes taking place in Dexter are.<br />Also, is it me or suddenly everyone (starting during season 6) knows that the Ice Truck killer was Dexter's brother? When was that ever revealed? I remember Dexter going to great lengths to hide that relationship. Did the writer just skip the revelation, thinking that by Season 7 the audience wouldn't realize that what everyone in the story knows was in fact never discovered?
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I'm so disappointed that I waited longer than 7 days to start reading this because I would love a refund.<br />The book repeats the same drama over and over every few pages and the characters are so drab.<br />The ending was quite shocking actually, mainly because you can't believe an author would lower herself to lie and turn a trilogy into a series last minute... her note to readers at the end was pathetic.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Cheesey action packed movie with a B-movie wanna be plot worth $1.99 but surely not the $3.99 - Good for beer and laughs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved simple bug no t.  I'am excited cor more levels. I really enjoy escape games and this one is pretty.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|Are these black cats out of musical and lyrical ideas ?<br />Is the studio drummer a pail imitation of swing/jazz greatness ?<br />Can the sound quality really be that LOUD and that sub par sounding ?<br /><br />Yes, yes and yes, thus a 2 star rating.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />* Well, I give their classic albums 5 stars and this album isn't in the same league; thus one star off.<br />* Then there's the blatant ripping themselves off, which for me, is really contrived; thus another star off.<br />* Also the overall sound quality (especially the drum sound) drops it down another star; leaving me with two stars.<br /><br />Highlight: God Is Dead?<br /><br />I personally feel like they've played a joke on me. I'm guessing that over the last 35 years no one offered these guys a Rutles type parody (of Sabbath) so they did their own soundtrack album.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Real depth in this show, the actors do a wonderful job as well. I look forward to seeing more episodes.
B0079R9SOG|4.0|I bought this for use on my Canon T3i and so far so good.  It installs super easily and is comfortable to use.  I've tried using some of the cheaper hand straps (e.g., Opteka Wrist Grip) which wind up making it impossible to keep your hand securely in the strap, but still access the shutter button and other controls.  The shape of the B-Grip and the rear-offset of the top attachment makes it easier to hold the camera securely, but still comfortably get at all of the controls.  Is it perfect?  No (you still have to curl your index finger a bit to get at the shutter release...hence the 4 stars), but is it better than any of the competitors?  Absolutely!!!!  Is it worth the extra $20 or so?  I think so.<br /><br />One note on fit:  I have what I'd guess are on the slightly larger side of normal hands (for a 6 ft, late 20-something male), and given the smaller size of the T3i body, I have the strap adjusted to its second-smallest/tightest setting.  So, if you have very small hands and intend to use this on a Canon Rebel-series (or something similar), it may be a little loose, even at the smallest adjustment setting.  I'd suspect that on a larger body (60D and up), this wouldn't be as big of an issue.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The book engages you in a story about how the past always seems to find you...it takes you back in time WWII London....and lets you take a look at life there.....I was thrilled with the ending...
B009NG1Q96|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, but was very disappointed to find that there was no plot.  I'm not exaggerating.  None.  The ending was also disappointing as I discovered there is to be a third book.  I won't be reading it.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|I have to admit I am still a big fan of the original Kevin Bacon version. This was fun to watch, music and dancing are great, it was entertaining.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this app is great! great for a puzzle lover. has a lot of free puzzles! love this app. one of my favorites.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I like this writer's narrative style and really loved the earlier book, The Kite Runner...but this one is on the dull side.  Good character descriptions but the emotional connection is missing.  I never felt pulled into the story.  It's told from the viewpoint of several characters.  That device is usually effective but here it feels too disjointed.  It was nice pastime reading but  Nothing compelled me to finish the book as I wasn't invested in the outcome.  Sorry.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I have waited for 1 week to get to know this album.  I've been waiting for this since \\"Never Say Die\\"--I still have the vinyl I bought when it was released in '78!  I am totally pleased.  I was so DREADING this album--LOVE Sabbath (have since 1977), feared ruining the legacy.  I liked the live Reunion, but not the 2 studio tracks.  Iommi is, well, Iommi.  LOTS of Iommisms in this album.  Geezer, well his bass is STILL as subtle as a jack hammer.  Ozzy REALLY shines here.  Doesn't matter how many takes it took, he nailed \\"Ozzy's voice\\" dead on.  Not too over-produced this time around.  I LOVE IT!!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It casts a new light on high school, through out the book you will find humorous and heavy parts, worth reading!
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|I was grateful for a second season as my grandson just loves Shaun and the barnyard events.  It is a wholesome and entertaining series for both children and adults.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|This is a great value and the only thing I wish it had was a few more pockets for storage.  But considering the cost and quality this is a almost perfect bag for this Backpacking camera buff.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE  IT WAS GREAT TO SEE A STORY ABOUT THE WIZARD.  I HOPE THEY CONTINUE TO MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|INTERESTING READ. LOVED HOW SMART SHE IS. I COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE BAD GUYS UNTIL THE END. LOVED THE CANADIAN AND AMERICAN SCENERY DISCRIPTIONS.
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|EXCELLENT BRUCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN  HIS BEST WITH ALL OF THE DIE HARD MOVIES ESPECIALLY WITH THIS ONE.  IT WAS GOOD TO SEE A FATHER SON RELATION SHIP.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Would recommend. A little out there but plot moves pretty quickly and is interesting.<br />Interesting historical pieces as well! Enjoy.
B004GYY714|4.0|I like it. I. can get Phil Hendrie at night on various stations but sometimes it takes me to a Topeka station playing a sports event.  I also like that it takes me to some podcasts like Stephanie Miller.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Totally love this movie<br />It's an all time classic.  I loved it as a kid and now my kids love it :)
B001AITGWE|5.0|This movie crosses my mind often. It was so good to see it again. Even the wife liked it, which is a miracle.
B007V693YK|5.0|Absolutely love this app.  For me as a novice this app has been a Godsend. Easy to use with great tutorials and explanations as well.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Steam is a wonderful online service for PC gamers everywhere, with its simple interface, amazing deals, and of course the ability to communicate instantly with your friends. If you know people who use and want to keep talking with them when away from the computer, get this app!
B0094M2SCI|5.0|I love all of the Underworld movies. First one is my favorite. Be prepared for the gore.  After this one, you'll probably want to see the whole series.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This app allows me to keep track of the battery as I work. However at times I find the time given is shorter than the time given.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great little game, we have a blast figuring out the puzzles.  The whole family enjoys playing,especially our 6 year old.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Wonderful classic in our own times.  Greatly appreciated the chance to read it on my Kindle.<br />Send me more and more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I only bought this cause I wanted to see how close the movie was. Read the second and third part. Figured that I would read the first. Was surprised that the movie was just like the book. Hope the next movie is like the book, If so it will be better than the first.
0670014893|5.0|It is amazing how LeCarre keeps knocking it out of the park with his up to date novels. This one is not to be missed for his fans.
B000ID1J40|5.0|Released in 1992 this movie shows how computers experts are blackmailed by government in order to recover / steal important material. They face the world of secrets,deception manipulation and betrayals. Very good performance. I consider this movie an excellent one that worth to have it in my collection.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Acting was stilted. Got bored, stopped wasting time by watching it.  And, Amazon's reviewing rules suck, suck, suck, suck, and now I have filled in the right amount words.  Like that adds value.
B00APPMB9I|5.0|This is one of those movies.. that can't possibly bore you. Cooper sets a totally different pace from the 'hangover' series, putting in a wider effort as producer as well. He's brilliant for the role, and the movie has a great cast and production.
159463176X|3.0|Khaled Hosseini writes beautifully. And he did in this book.<br /><br />However, it suffers from a variety of ailments.<br /><br />To begin with, he does not tell the story in a linear fashion. It skips forward and backward in time. I don't have a problem with it the style -- I just don't think Hosseini does it well.<br /><br />As any fan of Hosseini's knows, his stories are melancholy and profoundly sad. In the Kite Runner (his first book), you are often given hope and happiness, if only a strand. In A Thousand Splendid Suns (his second book), I am not convinced there was even a strand. And there isn't one in And The Mountains Echoed either. The same complaint I had about his second book is reiterated in this review.<br /><br />There are too many characters that either have no import or are uninteresting, or both.<br /><br />The pace of the novel seemed very odd... he would take his time in telling certain parts of a story and at times he would speed through things at light speed. Overall, the book seemed very rushed.<br /><br />Finally, the plot sucked. There were subplots that were interesting, but the overall plot was pointless and lacked much of an arc. Furthermore, various subplots were connected together so tenuously that the entire writing technique became banal. It reminded me of Cloud Atlas in that regard.<br /><br />This books biggest plus -- Hosseini's beautiful writing -- is unfortunately its only one.<br /><br />6/10
B00CX1TPF0|5.0|I did enjoy this movie from beginning to end. It's suitable for all ages, although it has some minor violence scenes. Technology plays an important role, but they didn't overdo it and it doesn't ruin the story and the acting. Beautiful.
1476733953|5.0|I am not sure I would call this a science fiction book. It's much more of a post-apocalyptic book, which to me is a very different thing. So if it's the sci-fi aspect of it that puts you off, you might want to rethink that.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is incredible. It's simply written but well written. The pace is perfect. You really get to know and feel strongly about the characters. And the story, oh the story. It's just effing awesome.<br /><br />I had no major complaints.<br /><br />9.5/10<br /><br />P.S. Two things you might be interested in -- this began as a wildly successful series of short stories/novels. This book is #1-5. There are others, and I can't wait to read them, but unfortunately, none of them seem to be sequels to this particular story.
B000TETM7Y|4.0|D'Angelo D'Angelo, where are thou?<br />This is a classic. Few years old, but the production was so good that it still makes a lot of sense.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Untold inside stories that are fascinating. This book is a necessary cornerstone for understanding the pressure of current presidential politics.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This is a &#34;must read&#34; book!<br /><br />Excellent, eye opening insight on what drives our lives from past experiences and how to improve our successes in the future<br /><br />Everyone should read this book for their own personal development.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|This album, and Joe's acoustic work in general, will be considered one of the great works of music for generations to come.
B000003N89|5.0|What can you say. She added to that grand style of jazz and made it greater the sum of the parts. A joy to listen too each and every time.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Really sweet, fun movie - great date movie!  Good dialogue, character and plot development and I really cared what happened to the characters.
B004NDVJA0|5.0|fantastic album listen to it often. It was everything I was told it was and more. Her voice is simply a delight to hear.
B00AKKS278|5.0|I have been doing this for several weeks and though I am not through the painful adjustment period yet.  I am feeling more motivated about accomplishing my goals.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've ever see, and each season gets progressively better! I recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B00BESCJII|2.0|I sure hope that Carolyn McCray continues the Robin Hood Hacker series.  Each of the books has been fascinating, fun, and always on the suspenseful edge.  I have loved each minute in all three books and look forward to more.  Great suspense writer...weaves plots with consummate skill.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Good singing but not my type of movie I actually deleted it 10min into watching it! Total musical like being at a play
B008XKSW7M|4.0|worth watching if you like chick flicks.  Although the humor in this movie is much better than your average chick flick.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I got it just for me, however the kids quickly take over and are involved in the game.  Great for increasing thinking skills!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Good
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Loved it!! There are only 10 levels, they need to add some more. This app really makes you think.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|So much hype around this book and soon, a movie; so I had to read it.  Jumpin' Stick Lizards....why did I wait???<br />Oh yes, there are the bloody zombie chomping moments expected in this kind of book, but it contains so much beyond the regular bite, run, scream, and shoot 'em in the head.<br />The investigation rings of real world possibilities and has me worried about every H9N7 virus outbreak report.  Could this be the account of a future for humanity?  Every story made me think, shudder, or nod my in agreement.<br />Why did this book make me feel like I could see like it was really happening???<br />*Shivers*  I'm gonna dig a moat around my house tonight in my dreams!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I am truly hoping that wasn't the end, so many unanswered questions, what about the forgotten and their talents, and the twins, where did they go? Why Singh, why do you do this to me? I guess I just have to hope for more soon.<br />Overall the continuation was brilliant, I didn't see Krychek as the ghost, and his strength and almost evilness, totally understandable. At first I didn't want to like Sahara, I thought she was weak, I was all like how can she be so accepting? But as the story progressed I realized, she has to be so inheritanly good, her purity had to be able to wrap up Krychek's evil tendencies. So sweet.<br />Then catching up with past characters, can't wait for Mercy to have her babies. I would like to know how Sacsha and her baby is doing.<br />I gave this all 5 stars because Singh writes so passionately she pulls the reader in making them cheer for love and victory.
B0073U0P32|5.0|Checked this out a year after it came out, as it wasn't on my radar when it was in theaters, and holy crap was it a surprise. I loved it. Great story, great acting. A lot more realistic than almost all car chase movies, it really kept me immersed. It has some setup, with good character development, and the final half hour was just awesome. Really cemented Ryan Gosling too me as a great actor. Would definitely recommend checking it out
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Pretty good story that was pretty poorly written, seems the author has s very limited vocabulary. Worth a try, not the greatest book though.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This is definitely not a rehash or another version of a John Williams or a conventional superman/superhero score that we may have have come to become familiar with.  In fact, its very departure is its own strength.  Master composer Hans Zimmer does a fabulous job in creating an entirely new classical score that complements each scene in the Man of Steel movie.  The music is just as serious as the movie itself.  Northing spectacular, no whistles and bells, just fine movie background music that is powerful enough in its own right to accompany a blockbuster of such a magnitude as Man of Steel.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Just doesn't get any better than these two together. I could listen to Beth Hart sing my phone bill ! Is there any genre Bonamassa can't play? Hopefully we can look forward to this off and on collaboration for many years to come. Purchasing this CD and Hart's &#34;Bang Bang Boom Boom&#34;  have been my best music decisions in recent memory.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'd give it 10 stars if that was an option!!  I have watched all three seasons three times and will probably watch it many more
B00COHAUD4|3.0|This movie had a few great things going for it but not enough to really push past the bad things. I really wanted to see more of a subtle film that took time to establish the deep relationships within the characters' lives. I didn't believe most of the roles; making it hard to feel for most of the characters.<br /><br />The Mama character is very neat and well-done... most of the time. There are a few moments when I stop and ask myself, &#34;Wait, why didn't just do it the easy way?&#34; I feel like the story was too short when it was trying to introduce me to characters and plots and that they took too much time with the special effects for Mama. *Spoiler* Mama is a ghost who can easily teleport through walls... Why foes she chase people?! Why did we get to see so much of her? She would have been so much more scary if we couldn't see her (fully) throughout the movie. A peek here, a peek here and our imaginations take us the rest of the way.<br /><br />Now, even though Mama is a ghost you're supposed to feel passionate about, she should be more scary! Take out all the cheap jump scares and this story would be beautiful. I loved the story, especially since it's takes place near my hometown. Now, it's didn't look like Richmond or Clifton Forge, Virginia (where the story takes place), but that's not important. The backdrop ad the ghost should've worked out better, it didn't. I found myself confused because the environment was telling me things the story wasn't. If it's not important, don't waste time on it. Every shot should count and not be filler for real detail.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film, but I ended up enjoying the neat aspects and imagining how much better this could've been.
0374533571|3.0|Good not great.  Have a son who is bipolar and the young man in the story sound more challenged mentally than bipolar.  Thanks for bringing to attention of the public the challenges of the mentally ill.

B004UID2LC|1.0|I have a Nexus and all Nexus phones have no search button, I am unable to use the app because it is missing an integrated search/menu button...
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Back in the summer of 1989, I was walking out of the most ginormous superhero movie ever made. Actually, it was the most ginormous movie release ever, at the time, bringing in $40 million its opening weekend. All of my friends were ecstatic and cheering, and my cousin wouldn't shut up about how the Joker had pulled that three feet long pistol out of his pants and shot down the Batwing, a moment I'd thought was especially stupid, and I wasn't really happy.<br /><br />Yeah, I know. I hear all of you out there being oh so shocked.<br /><br />But, see, the thing I kept thinking, the thing I still think today, was, \\"Maybe, if Burton had just been honest and called the movie The Joker, I would have liked it.\\" [And I could go into a whole thing of all of the things wrong with having Burton make that movie to begin with and how the Joker was the only character he found interesting and how he didn't (and doesn't) like the movie nor, even, the idea of making it--he just wanted to be a part of what he expected to be a vast pop culture phenomenon. But all of that is for some other time.]<br /><br />And that's how I feel about Man of Steel. If Nolan wanted to make a movie about General Zod, he should have just called it General Zod. As it is, I'm left with feelings of dissatisfaction because Superman was only included as what amounts to an afterthought. He's the guy that's going to defeat Zod, and there's only just enough information in the movie to let us know who he is.<br /><br />Which brings me to what I think is the biggest issue with Man of Steel, which includes Nolan's abuse of the title (and let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this was not Nolan's movie, even if Snyder directed it. The story and style was Nolan's, which makes it his). Nolan exploits our outside knowledge of who and what Superman is to skimp on the origin, which he then changes. It's sloppy storytelling. Worse than sloppy. And I don't like feeling exploited. The truth is, if I didn't already knowSuperman's background, I would have had a difficult time with the movie.<br /><br />For instance, my sister-in-law is a Marvel girl, so she doesn't really know about Superman, not the details, anyway. Her entire exposure to Superman was the godawful Superman Returns, so there were parts of Man of Steel that she didn't get. Like why we should care about Perry White. Within the context of the movie, the fact that we spend so much time watching Perry and friends run away from falling buildings makes no sense. We have no reason to care about that character UNLESS we already know about who he is from the comics (or previous movies or whatever). And she didn't feel any real connection to Clark because the whole reason we care about Clark is we know the Kents took him in and raised him as their own. They accepted him. But what we get from the movie is Jonathan Kent constantly telling Clark what an outsider he is. And don't get me started on the ridiculousness of Jonathan sacrificing himself to the tornado to \\"protect\\" Clark's secret. All of this includes the lack of context for calling the movie Man of Steel, which does not come from the movie. Unless you know that Superman is called the man of steel, there's no reason to understand the title, so, again, outside knowledge. Also, the name the \\"Man of Steel\\" was given to Superman when humans thought Superman was actually human. They never think that in the movie, so that particular moniker becomes inappropriate, so, in effect, it's a stupid title for the movie and something only chosen to distinguish it from the other Superman movies. He should have just gone with Superman or, even better, General Zod.<br /><br />So, with all of that in mind, no, I did not like the middle of the movie. I thought the origin part of the origin story of Superman was very poorly handled. We have no idea of who this new guy is, no idea of the strength of his character, no idea of why we should trust him. Other than, well, he says we should, and that after trashing Metropolis (at least, I suppose it's Metropolis--the movie wasn't explicit with that). What we do know is that, when he was a kid, he saved a busload of kids and got in trouble for it. Later, after having a fight with his dad, he allowed his dad to be killed by a tornado.<br /><br />Also, the idea of Clark having spent 15 years as a drifter while looking for his origins is... well, it's dumb. Why didn't he ever stick that key into the spaceship in the barn? The technology should have been exactly the same. Or is it that the spaceship was \\"broken\\"? I'm just not buying that explanation. And why would he even expect to find anything else on Earth from wherever it was he was from? There's no good logic for any of that. It's just a contrived way to bring Lois into contact with Clark and not a very good one at that. And I have nothing to say about the \\"symbolism\\" of having Clark be 33 when Zod comes to Earth. That, also, was just dumb. As was Clark learning to fly, basically, because daddy left him a super suit. For which, by the way, there is no good reason for it to have been on a spaceship buried under arctic ice for 20,000 years.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie, though, I liked. Mostly. It was good to have a back story for Zod beyond \\"space criminal.\\" The swimming scene and the codex being a skull, though, was, again, dumb. As was depositing the codex within the body of baby Kal-El. The rest was pretty cool, even if it was rather like watching Star Wars what with the big battleships while Jor-El flew around on some kind of giant insect. Yes, I'm overlooking the part where, basically, the entire population of Krypton chooses to stay on Krypton and die rather than evacuate despite having the technology to do so. [I'm also overlooking the fact that, evidently, every single Kryptonian colony failed despite having huge world engine terraforming machines.]<br /><br />So... we open the move with Zod, and we end the movie with Zod. It was a movie about Zod. And the end of the movie just went on and on and the destruction was beyond my ability to accept. See, here's the thing, we, as viewers, accept that Superman is a good guy, because, well, we know he's a good guy. We have 75 years of prior knowledge that tells us he's a good guy. But the people of Earth in the movie have no such prior knowledge. They don't know who Superman is any more than they know who Zod is. What they do know is that two aliens showed up and destroyed a major city and tried to destroy the world. But, yet, they just accept that Superman is a \\"good guy,\\" and Nolan gets away with it because he bases that on our knowledge of the character, not what's revealed of the character in the movie (who, remember, allowed his human father to die because of an argument).<br /><br />But how was Zod? So much of the focus is on him, so how was he? Michael Shannon was, actually, very excellent as Zod. If you've seen him in Boardwalk Empire, it's apparent why he was chose, and it was a good call. He brings just the right amount of zeal to the role to make it believable.<br /><br />Russel Crowe, whom I generally dislike, was pretty good in his role as Jor-El. Well, except for the hide-and-seek bit in the spaceship, but that was hardly his fault. Seriously? The virtual Jor-El is going to play hide-and-seek with his son upon being uploaded? Another bit of contrivance to get Clark out of the way so that Lois could injured. [And, um, just why didn't Clark hear her coming down  the tunnel? It's not like she was being quiet. Or that that should have mattered at all.]<br /><br />Henry Cavill was adequate as Superman, although I think he really got the part due to his resemblance to Tom Welling from Smallville. They have the same \\"farm-boyish\\" grin. I liked Costner as Jonathan, even if I didn't like the part, much, as it was written. I don't have, however, have strong positive feelings for Diane Lane as Martha. I also thought Amy Adams was good in her role. The rest were non-spectacular.<br /><br />The final result is that I have a lot of mixed feelings about this newest Superman, which is a far cry better than how I felt about the last Superman. This new one is just too much Nolan for me, who seems to be more concerned on an ongoing basis with what seems cool rather than what makes a good story. Seriously, I didn't need more of the Inception-type building collapses. I am interested to see where Nolan is going to take the story, unless this just ends up being a setup for the JLA movie that DC and Warner Brothers are still trying to get off the ground, at which point, I will decide that DC needs to scrap all the previous movie history it's developed and start over, just like they keep doing with their comic book world. Maybe, someday, they'll get it right.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I just finished reading this book last week, after re-reading most of the series over the past year.  I must say, it's a worthy close to the story, and the entire book is nothing but interesting action with a bit of intrigue (Though much less plotting that previous books).<br /><br />This is my second favorite fantasy series, second only to Recluse, and it is probably the best single-story fantasy series I've ever read.  (I'd only put Asimov's Foundation series as a better continuous story)<br /><br />There were a few questions left unanswered, but I don't feel it detracts from the quality and scope of the storytelling.  Very good finish.
B004HZYHGM|5.0|My favorite adventure story of all time, and this is the same story with illustrations.  The Disney movie from 1950 is about the movie version, fyi.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game that makes you think. first few levels are easy. buzzed right through them rather quickly. fun though . keeps my boys occupied while waiting or while on trips.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Love Tarantino movies.  A bit bloody, but that's Tarantino.  A bit vulgar - but that's Tarantino.  Take it for what it is - entertainment.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|You see world war 2 stuff everywhere. You don't see a lot with world war 1. It makes for an interesting backdrop.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This is a great historical movie.  The detail, acting and story line are compelling.  But if you want to know who's who and their role in history, keep Google open to research and learn.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book ever is right here. I give it five stars not only for the excellent choice of words but for the suspense, action, and romance.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|I waited a long time to see a great thriller. It is hard to think of another psychological thriller over the last ten years as good as Inception.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan is a great director and writer. He is one of the decade's best.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|There are movies I watch many times. Some times when my wife is gone for a weekend I watch the Bourne trilogy. I may watch this movie again.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This really is a worthwhile attempt of showing the multi-facets of Lincoln in a 150 minute film. The film only covers about 5 months of his presidency and the overriding storyline is the events surrounding the passage of the 13th amendment.
B00BOLE7X0|4.0|I understand Sally Field fought for the part of Mary Tod, I'm glad she got the part. The flying nun has come a long way. We watched her &#34;grow up&#34; in our house hold and always enjoy having her in our living room.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  A great book.  Really changes your outlook on life. Another great book by Mitch Albom.  Highly recommend.
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|An old story with a new twist. A little to gory for the younger kids. Not what we call a family show. But none of the sitcoms on TV are like the ones we watched when our kids were little.
B008ZTW7OU|5.0|This album is almost absolutely perfect.  There is only one song I cannot listen to, While We're Young...Not saying that this music is groundbreaking but for those that appreciate throw back music to the 60's and 70's then purchase this Disc, as well as Learn and Burn.  The Sheepdogs just don't disappoint.  Bluesy, simple melodic old style rock...
B00992CF6W|4.0|this was an amazing game, but with the update I cant play with my friends and the Realms beta never has available server slots. So I cant play multiplayer of any kind. Please fix.
B00BU2VSNU|5.0|My original copy was so scratched up it would barely play but this is still one of Jeff's best works by far and to get 2 additional tracks should leave any of his fans very happy to have gotten Long Wave and Armchair Theatre a few months apart.<br /><br />This album is definitely more Jeff than ELO.  You can hear Jeff's 50's rock influences as well as The Wilbury Sound as I like to call it throughout the record.  Most importantly there is a great variety of true upbeat tunes, great lyrics and of course Save Me Now which should be a daily reminder played for everyone who lives on planet earth.<br /><br />Thank you Jeff, it was almost worth the wait :).
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have had this app for awhile but now it does not worki. It does not recognize my city. The app needs to be fixed.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|The reason why The Next Generation was on for as many seasons as it was is because of the excellent cast and how the characters were continually developed.  This season brought back Dr. Crusher (thank god!) and made the family complete once again.<br />Other than that, another very solid season full of drama and adventure that is sure to please :-)
B00005JLPK|5.0|It was very well produced. The music was great & authentic. The location was like I expected and very Mexican.

B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is an amazing writer. I love all her books and this one did not disappoint. This was a wonderful story about secrets in the past and second chances.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like the games love how each floor gets harder and harder. Only thing I would make it better is maybe clues that don't work for that floor.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|While it was not as captivating as The Firm, the movie was very enjoyable and worth viewing. I enjoyed it and did not regret it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Keep 'em coming iTree!!! Love this one and Jewel Legends!! One more free game from iTree that doesn't disappoint! Thanks!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a fun way to wast 30 min I enjoyed it however the game could use better instructions on what you are supposed to do to get you stared
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Help! Love the game but stuck on level6...can't find blue weight! is there anyone willing to help! racked my brain! Just figured it out a few hours after I posted! It finally dawned on me! Put two and two together and it came out right! Me and my eight year old granddaughter love this game! We found another one for free and we are playing it too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It is so easy! My four year old sister loves it too. I recommend to get it. NOW
0439023513|5.0|Best product if you are a reader!!!  If u like reading u have to read this book great for teenagers!?!?! I'm 13 and the book is good ill say what is about but ill spoil it!!!!!
B00846F1YW|4.0|Played for the first time having a ball gotta love hidden pictures. I like the scene changes and some of the charectors are a little bizarre. Small time america.
0670026557|3.0|On starting this book I thought the premise sounded interesting - similar to other books I've liked by Malcolm Gladwell about how human behavior works to produce success and failure of people and ideas.  But I found the first chapter exceedingly wordy and hard to plow through.  Then suddenly in the third chapter the pace picked up and it was hard to put down.  And so on throughout the book.  It's a hard slog to get through some of the chapters as the author's style is too dense and detailed and doesn't flow, but if the subject was interesting to me the author's prolixity didn't bother me as much.<br /><br />Recommended with the above reservations.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Longevity of the album is questionable but there are 10 quality tracks on here. Uptempo and flavorful. This is not your regular Rap album, it's way more. People who are giving it 1 star are clueless when  it comes to music as a masterpiece. No two Kanye albums are the same. I still favor MBDTF more but these 10 songs are just pure beauty and skill at its finest. Hats off to this egomaniac known as Yeezy. Great work and everything. If you want a lyrical and worthy RAP album then buy \\"Born Sinner\\" by J. Cole but I'm warning you, you won't revert back to Born Sinner or any other music for a while after listening to Yeezus. I was initially disappointed when the tracklist was revealed and only had 10 tracks but all was forgiven when I play this album. It's a great album, great work, high production. Thought the album was really going to disrespect God and religions but it didn't, Kanye is just being his egotistical self. Can't blame. Awesome work. Listening to it again by the way, ran through the album 13 times according to iTunes. 40 minutes of pure artistry but I couldn't give it 5 full stars because of the 10 songs, album leaves me wanting 4 more tracks. Give us more Kanye! Musically approved.<br /><br />(Update: June 29th) - I just HAD to buy the album. No booklet (thought it was going to be in the back, had a feeling it wasn't) but it's all good. 10 songs, no fillers, not one filler. Play it in your car, blast it. Play it at home, blast it. Great album, it is now a 5 star album for me, well 4.7/5.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|You are giving reviewers a disincentive by insisting on a wordy review. Stars are all I wish to give. OK
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A good read for the holidays, though it can be a bit hard to wade through from time to time. An honest telling of his story.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Extraordinary glimpse into an unknowable world. Deeply layered, richly textured, an absolute masterpiece. Can't think of a modern novel to equal it.
B0031RS4UM|3.0|read this on the strength of the first one, but found it a bit lacking after the fast pace of the first one. An ok read, but some of the characters are a little too stereotypical/ caricature-ish. The readers interest can drift easily in parts of the story.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The beginning had the father telling a story with elements taken from The Shack.  With all of the different characters and switching back and forth in history it was hard for me to get involved and really care about them.  I expected more.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|This CPU is easy to super clock to a higher speeds and water cool it as this is what I had expected to do with it.
B00BB67UNW|2.0|Even a solid cast - including the likes of Mark Wahlberg, Russell<br />Crowe, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and \\"Friday Night Light's\\" Kyle Chandler -<br />can't rescue Allen Hughes' \\"Broken City,\\" a muddled mix of P.I.<br />fiction, civic corruption and political skulduggery.<br /><br />Wahlberg plays an ex-NYPD cop turned private investigator who's hired<br />by the mayor (Crowe) to find out if his wife (Zeta-Jones) is fooling<br />around on him. But is there more to the case than meets the untrained<br />eye?<br /><br />You know right off the bat that your script (in this case, by Brian<br />Tucker) is in trouble when the key point hinges on a real estate deal<br />so arcane and esoteric in its details that you would need to be a city<br />planner yourself to fully comprehend it.<br /><br />Filled with characters, conflicts and conundrums we couldn't care less<br />about, \\"Broken City\\" fades to insignificance even as we're watching it.<br />The city ain't the only thing that's broken here.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|By far one of the best books of  read in years I recommend this to everyone I know.. can't wait to read more
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Better than expected. A enjoyable movie to watch. Lots of action and great story line. Would watch it again and again
B00CX1TPF0|3.0|The sound quality to this movie was really low. We had to turn the volume to maximum position to hear the movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Now I have to go get the rest of the series, and looking forward to the movie.. Love my Kindle Paperwhite!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Game is really fun.  Gameloft out did themselves when marking this strategy game. This is my second favourite strategy next star command.  The only thing people won't enjoy is the fact that things take forever to build.  Even in the beginning.
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|This book is a fun, quirky read. I couldn't put the book down. It is a funny, mysterious, romantic, and an all around captivating book. This series is one worth reading.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|You should know what to expect from this movie, and it does it.<br />I watched the HD version, and it was pretty good.  Audio came thru the system well, and either my tivo or the amp picked up the surround sound encoding fine.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I have all of their cd's and a couple of the dvd's  I would order the one in London, but from what I've read it will not play on the dvd units in America...
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|So far I have not been able to get it to work right.<br />So no way I like it. I did not build it so I can't fix it.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I actually really enjoyed this remake. They did a good job, in terms of look and feel. The action was good, and the story line was changed just enough to be interesting. They should have kept the original Mars setting, though.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|excellent storyline. visual effects awesome. I recommend this movie. I hope there is a part 2 coming soon. Rent it !!!
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|I enjoyed the second installation of The Dark Knight Returns. Not bad, for an animated adaptation. Looking forward to more Batman in the future.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|It's a fun album to listen to, sounds great. It may be a little ahead of it's time for some of the basic fans out there giving it one's and two's...but if you give it a chance you it will grow on you. After a few listens you can appreciate how well the album sounds as a whole.
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|It is very rare that I find a movie these days that actually adds something lucid to my understanding. One of the benefits of film is that you can communicate intelligently without directly blurting out your ideas.<br /><br />Into the last good fight I'll ever know...
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Never listed to JC b4, but on the recommendation of a friend, I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. Album plays straight through, no skipping required. Production is very strong, lyrics are engaging, and he actually takes the listener on a journey of sorts.  This album dropped the same day as Kanye's, the main difference for me was  it only took 1 listen for me to claim this album a winner, it took 2-3 w Kanye's. Great album, great artist. Glad I got it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a good game and its good for passing time. I would recommend it to any one who likes puzzles.
1623420148|5.0|This is a funny, highly entertaining story about a player who gets what he deserves, learns his lesson and finds love--and it's all told from his point of view. The result is a fresh, funny, addictive story that you will love to pieces.  I know I did!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Well written, easy enjoyable read. I couldn't wait to finish it.  I don't know why amazon demands so many words, have I hit the minimum yet?
B005UKJX4E|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this but it was a big disappointment. We watched it when my daughter and family came for a visit. No one liked it.
B00BI5IXL4|3.0|It was good but the stage version is better.  Most of the actors were good.  I would recommend watching it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am really thrilled with this mouse. I have been a console player since the 80's and as such I am accustomed to a controller. I started PC gaming in early 2010 and continued my use of a controller (Xbox 360 Wireless controller). I just could not get used to the M/Kb combo. Well I like to play games like Torchlight 1&2 and Diablo 3 which use the mouse for the majority of the game. I have a MSFT Wireless Laser mouse. While using this to play games my Pointer would jump all over the place and stutter and that would get annoying. I started to look for a gaming mouse. I came across the Anker 8000 and read all the positive reviews. Well I purchased one (received it today) and played Torchlight 2 with it.<br /><br />WOW, what a Major Difference in gameplay. I am totally stoked while playing with this mouse. Being able to a Button Presses to the side buttons means I don't have to interact with my Keyboard at all and can just focus on the task at hand. The Anker Mouse is extremely responsive and I love being able to change the color of the Anker Symbol on the front of the mouse. I highly recommend this mouse:) Very happy with this purchase.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it but was disappointed there wasn't more levels available or maybe more rooms to explore per level. But I liked what I had- the solution to how you opened the door got a little harder as you went along.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Just when I think I've found someone that can't be guessed, this app gets it.  Fun for the whole family.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The first time, I died, nearly at least! But after a while got better, worked up to the second set but fell off (started running). I am going to add it back into my rotation. There is a LOT of jumping jacks (second week is less, thank goodness) so if you have had kids and, well you know ladies, then be aware, a LOT of jumping! That being said, each time was a bit easier and I appreciate her coaching you along, this is NOT the Jillian from this last season of TBL!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't get it to open anymore can someone help me with this please. It has to always have 5 stars!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this app it is so fun.the best part is you get diffrent<br />ainmals thir so cute an colorfle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed all the puzzles so far. Not so difficult that you give up or have to cheat but still challenging enough to give your mind a work out. Nice job developers!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's an exciting ride watching Mike Ross and Harvey Specter work their magic. Harvey's the sophisticated, well versed shark. He's a high priced attorney with Michael Jordan on speed dial. Mike is a late to the game pot smoking slacker that needs to grow up. How the two bond is in a very unusual, unethical and shall I say morally corrupt way. They win some and guess what, they lose some. Lots of cobwebs and bones in their closets. Oh what tangled webs we weave, when we first try to deceive.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|Not exactly what id hoped for.  A great deal of the move was so visibly dark, it was difficult to see what was happening.  It's an old story line, basically, and I've seen it done better.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|I laughed so hard at this movie, it made me a bit asthmatic! This movie is so racist, so sexist.. it is hilarious!!! I watched it twice in a wk, the second time was because my friend said he never saw it so I made him, and we laughed or hours!! We always have inside jokes now when we go grocery shopping and see vita coco & bananas. :D
B0047E9TRA|5.0|I'm no stranger to this movie.  I saw it in the theater when it was first released.  I loved it then, and I love it now.  It is an adaptation of a Stephen King novel at its best and at his,
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|downloaded app and 615MB data file (took a while). would not run at all on my android device. Waste of time.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's an alarm clock and it works.  Who cares about this rating.  It is a free app so I like it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a very great book because it teaches you friendship and kindness and this book also teaches me that being different can be a wonderful thing and that you could do things that you never thought you could do before.<br />\\" You are beautiful in every single way, yes words can't bring you down.\\"  - Christina Aguilera
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Best game ever I  happy that they made this game it is at a level of difficulty that everyone can handle
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading this book I couldn't stop crying. It was extremely good. One of the best series I've read to date.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I Love the movie Jurassic Park but I love the movie even more in 3D. Cannot wait fro the next 2 to be in 3D.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was having a difficult time falling asleep, and I never thought this would help.  It started working the first night.  I like the variety and the sounds are very authentic sounding.  It's been a real help with my sleep issues and it is certainly worth a try, if you are having problems falling and staying asleep!
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|A superb film full of raw emotion and perspectives rarely spoken of, much less so well depicted on film.  John Hawkes is incredible as Mark O'Brien and Helen Hunt proves herself as a dramatic actor.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is sooooo fun and extremely addictive I wouldn't play any tiger games for so long because I was too busy playing this game,I recommend getting this game
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Supurb acting, well drawn plot and incredible setting and props makes this a don't miss show in our house. Maggie Smith is sensational.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I think the game is great.  You have to think. The graphics need a little work. Maybe a help or a hint feature would be a good idea though.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I had misplaced or lost the GPS receiver that came with Microsoft Streets and Trips. I ordered this as a replacement. There was no problem installing it to my Windows XP laptop and Streets & Trips Version 2013. With my Microsoft receiver, my house appears to be a couple of hundred feet east of its actual location. With the Bu-353-54, it was on the button. For the short period that I have had it, I noticed that it is placing my car on the road rather than very slightly to one side as with the Microsoft receiver. That's plenty close enough for navigation. And the Microsoft version is less expensive when purchased with Streets & Trips. But based on my experience, the BU-353-54 is accurate. That may the because I was able to place it on the top of the car instead of on the dashboard. There is no good way to put the Microsoft version on the roof of the car and it is not designed to be water proof. I like placing it on the roof of the car because that gets it out of the way when I have my laptop computer in the passenger seat.<br /><br />The receiver has a magnetic base. It appears to be plenty strong enough to stay put. The receiver has a low profile and appears to be aerodynamically shaped to hold itself down in addition to the magnet. I haven't tested it at 100 mph yet, but I would be willing to bet that I would stay put. There is a rubber-like ring on the bottom to protect the car's finish. The cable is just under 5 feet long. I wouldn't really want it any longer. But that can be extended with a USB extension cable.<br /><br />No real complaints so far.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie just did it all for me. You fell in love with Django and his cause, and from beginning to end you were totally transfixed. Also, the soundtrack of the movie was splendid, and that made the movie much better for me as well.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Easily the most interesting drama on television. New trial every week with an interesting cast of characters. Never a dull episode.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Really kept my attention the whole time. Just loved this book.. hard to read at times because of the slavery issues but really kept me wanting to read more every day
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was by far the best book I ever read. The intensity, the sadness, everything. I couldn't set it down. I can see why people love it so much and I can wait for the movie!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Buy it if you like her music. That's all there is to it. Just supporting a good mate for entertainment.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Hadn't had a chance to see this series when first aired, so I started watching it on Amazon from season 1 and couldn't get enough.  I think it's one of the best shows on TV with great acting and writing!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The first episode I watched was by error on my part, but I immediately fell under the spell of the two lead characters.  All the episodes are well written, and the casting is spot-on.  This show is a modern day &#34;Odd Couple&#34; meets &#34;Columbo&#34; with a little &#34;CSI&#34; thrown in for good measure.  I highly recommend this show and look forward to next season.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Such an itersting plot and so well written - should be a clasic. Very enjoyable and riveting, a great bunch of characters.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|As the boomer generation's favorite performing artists are aging with us, many are turning to the musical hits of our parent's generation and finding them meaningful. This requires a generosity of spirit on the part of the listener, to accept a cover of a classic tune with a very different singing style. For example, when we first heard one of Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook series, I was appalled at the unsophisticated interpretation of some very beautiful songs. But we love Rod's voice and with a minor attitude adjustment, we now really enjoy his unique sound on these favorite and classic songs of an older generation--we can still enjoy more sophisticated covers, too.<br /><br />Such is the case with \\"Clapton\\" with the significant difference that Clapton is NEVER \\"unsophisticated.\\" All of his wonderful earlier collaborations with artists like BB King and JJ Cale have led naturally to exploring the material in both \\"Clapton\\" and \\"Old Sock\\", which we like even better. So if my parents can forgive me for these new covers of their favorite songs by people whose voices mean so much to us, we can accept, indulge, embrace and enjoy their unexpected covers of these forever wonderful tunes. And \\"Old Sock\\", too--it's even better for a trip to the nostalgia of these great songs performed by our favorite performers of a different generation and genre as they move thru new stages of life with us.<br /><br />On \\"Clapton\\", Mr. Clapton includes several standards such as \\"How Deep is the Ocean\\" and \\"Autumn Leaves.\\" On \\"Old Sock\\" (which we like even better) the standards include \\"All of Me\\", \\"Born to Lose\\", Goodnight Irene\\", \\"Our Love is Here to Stay\\" as well as a very eclectic cover of the Fab Four's \\"The Folks Who Live on the Hill.\\"<br /><br />In the meantime, a return to the collaboration with the under-appreciated JJ Cale is much appreciated. Clapton is particularly a great interpreter of Cale's music (\\"After Midnight\\", anyone?), including River Runs Deep on \\"Clapton.\\"
B00CWY76CC|1.0|It doesn't work on my kindle fire!<br />I hope developers really test their apps fully to make sure they are functional before pushing them out to the store.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I Loved it. I think this app is very well made and creative. I am looking forward to the development of more levels!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Don't leave the book when you find it starting off slowly and uninterestingly. You will find it surprisingly funny evolving around a 100 years of world history. A great read.
6305622914|5.0|This was a movie I have liked since it came out.  My step-mom introduced me to the world of non-american movies.  It is down and gritty.  None of that special affects people are obsessed with.  Real characters equals real emotions.  And if you want to watch this with your kids, well don't worry, all it shows are a few booties.
B007FROGME|5.0|This book was for me a pleasant surprise in its originality. By now I have read the entire trilogy and all 3 books are great to read. Suspense of a criminal investigation in the Soviet Union where formally there is no crime.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I love it.  She is very unique which is hard to find these days.  So tired of hearing the same old thing over and over.  I like the techno additions to her natural voice.  Fun to listen to.  She is beautiful and so is her voice.  You should get the first album if you like this one.  Both very good.
1603425381|4.0|I have used some. Some are a tad difficult for me or just way too much to add on a piece.  Got ideas, however, for borders to add that weren't so involved.  Maybe one or two rows instead of the 4 shown.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I love this movie.  I remember just dying to see it when I was a teen and it came out.  If you like the story of a woman who would do ANYTHING for her son, mixed with lots of action, and a bit of sarcasm, then this is the movie for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has refreshed my marital bed for certain!  Not for the shy or inhibited though, but for those with an open mind.....<br />I loved it!
B009LA1QW6|5.0|This is such a good follow up to her last album.  If you love her voice and her over all sound, you will not be let down.  Very good song.  Does have some adult language.  Mostly because of a song that says her pussy tastes like pepsi cola.  I love this.  Worth more than I paid for sure
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a wonderful jigsaw puzzle app.  I like many features such as you can choose the number of pieces up to 288.  I like how you can click on the end piece icon and all the end pieces show up.  That is so much easier than having to pull them all out.  Once the puzzles are completed the graphics are stunning.  The puzzle pieces show up on the side of the screen and you must scroll through them which is neat.  Here is what I do not like and this is just me and my vision/ perception problem.  The background is dark and I haven't found anyway to lighten it.  Once you get started it is difficult to see a missing piece with the dark background for some of the puzzles, especially if they are dark also.  I wish that the pieces to scroll through could be enlarged a little as again it is difficult to see the shape of them as they are very small on a dark background,.  I hope the maker will pay attention to my ideas.<br /><br />I love puzzles and find this is one of the best that I have found.  I will probably end up purchasing some extra puzzles.
B000P5FH3K|5.0|I love the two main actors in this and I have no regrets getting this.  They did not disappoint.  My heart ached for Claire Danes character.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really did like this game for my kindle fire, but after it was downloaded, I could play it once, but couldn't open it the second time. I just deleted it again. Don't know what the problem was.
B005WBBYXO|4.0|Good book, and now I have to fill up 18 words so I'll just type some nonsense here and tada!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game for my kindle fire! It's fast and it keeps me on my toes. My grand-daughter prompted me to get this game and I'm glad she did. It's a game for all ages, I believe. My youngest grand-daughter loves to play it also.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter was home from University and we watched the whole season in a couple of days.  I had already seen it but love the show I watched it again!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a good game! I haven't gone through all the levels yet, but I have fun trying. It's nice to be able to shrink the picture so I can see it all in one frame.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!  I can hardly wait until the next room comes out! I will be telling everyone about this game.
B0017M1XJW|5.0|this has been hailed as the definitive recording of La Boheme.  Pavarotti and Freni deliver stellar performances. I have this recording on CD but felt I must have it on my cell.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|Apparently games can only have two varieties, things like Farm Ville where you have to run around and get things then wait for them to grow, or mature or whatever or Angry Birds where you throw things and try to break them.  This game is like Farm Ville, The Croods, CItyLife and on and on.  It's not original and I'm so happy I didn't pay for it.
B0057UAE54|5.0|I had to have this recording of Frampton in my collection because of the memories associated with the music.  I was serving in Spain while in the air force and this would always be playing in the hanger while we worked on aircraft.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good game. Not to hard and not to easy. Can't wait for more rooms please add soon
B005NNV044|5.0|While growing up in the late sixties and early seventies Pink Floyd has always stood out to me as being a progressive band.  This particular recording escape me and I only caught when I was watching a documentary on the making of Dark side of The Moon.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Program froze right away and I had to delete it after one use.  I would not recoment anyone even take the time to try it!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I rated the first two books much higher than this book.  I felt like this book didn't progress the story much, seemed to be a lot of filler.  The one part that should of been longer (you know what I'm talking about if you read it) was just a few pages. Something as big as that should have been longer, especially given the length put into other parts of the story that didn't matter at all.  I am invested in Gideon & Eva, so I will read the other books. I just hope they are better than this book.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I have random internet coverage for my phone and with this app it helps me view videos without having to wait for it to rebuffer. That way I can start downloads in the morning and by lunch I can watch a slew of youtube videos. Great for that. I just wish I didn't have to sign into the app almost every day. It never keeps my log in information regardless if I click the &#34;remember me&#34; button.
0307352145|5.0|This is one of the most informative books I have read! If you are an introvert you will relate well to the information in this book. If you are an extrovert you will be enlightened. This is a book that I think ALL educators and employers should read, so that they can better understand the world through an introvert's viewpoint!
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|Overall a decently packaged BR for the price. No frills here with no additional bonus features that I rarely watch or don't need.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I great puzzle game. I would recommend it highly. I would buy this game. I love the progression of difficulty. Great job!

B008Z9L94O|5.0|I ordered this via wharehouse deals, it was listed like new, which it was brand new, still in box w/ shrink.<br />Gorgeous 4 lp set w/ 2 booklets (book like the cd w/ lyrics and an expanded other book w/ the original art work and the picture before billy cut his hair (the one where darcy is holding a carrot) with billy explaining what each song was about or how it took shape.<br /><br />There was a lot of people complaining that ZERO suffered from some sort of imperfection, which I don't hear on my turntable setup but its not to say it wouldn't be there on a lesser system. The album is broken into disc 1 as sides a/b c/d  then disc 2 as e/f G/h<br />it wasn't like the original press in that regard but this is 4 vinyl instead of 3 so it plays at a higher fidelity i bet.<br />I would still buy this at its new price if i didn't come across the deal. I have been pleased w/ how the prior re-issues sounded (i picked up P. Iscariot and was happy w/ it as well...can't wait for the aeroplane box and adore to come out like this personally.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I needed a self-powered microphone for a Contour+2 action camera's remote mic input.  This one does the job in a compact package with good voice reproduction.  I am using it to pick up radio communication in a noisy airplane by placing the mic in one of the ear cups of an aviation headset.  Here is a link to a video using the mic in the airplane:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />If you have a device that only accepts mono input like the Contour+2, you'll need a 3.5mm stereo to mono adapter between the mic plug and the input to the device.

B00571F26Y|4.0|This book has been informative to my problems.  I have had a life time of constipation.  This book was recommended to me after someone asked about my weight loss.  Back in February when lent started I thought it would my greatest sacrifice to give up sweets.  40 days and 10 pounds lighter I realize that most of the sweets I eat is cookies and cakes. All made from wheat.  Well the constipation had somewhat seemed better. I now have been wheat free for at least a month and all chances of constipation is gone. WOW huh! You should give a try. A lot of more positive changes has come from it also!!:)

B0081SPK0I|3.0|Obviously if you grew up in the 80s early 90s you remember this arcade game. The game works and is fine for a few minutes but then I realized it's not as fun as the original without a steering wheel. Promptly uninstalled.

B00BEPVAV8|3.0|First off, I do like the graphics but that alone can't be the sole reason I get a game. Gameplay is like any other acarde-y racing game with objectives to beat the clock. Nothing new here, played for like 20 minutes and uninstalled.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors. Many reviewers have commented that her newer works are not comparable with her older. I disagree. As evidenced by this book, Ms. Cornwell keeps up with current medical trends as well as investigative techniques. As someone in the medical field, I find this refreshing. She also does not shy away from issues that modern people deal with as evidenced by Lucy, her homosexual niece. This book had me guessing until the end. I look forward to her next novel!

B009G78EE2|5.0|The days of popular hip hop music being filled with useless profanity and meaningless interactions are gone. Macklemore's authentic and at times gut-wrenching lyrics state the obvious and ask questions people have been waiting for someone to ask. Yet he manages it all with a kind of humility and grace rarely seen on Top 40. Ryan Lewis is a downright genius, drawing on musical tastes and styles from every genre. Each song is a carefully constructed composition, a masterpiece.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|McKenna is a splendid writer, particularly with dialogue. Though the book is sad in many ways and highlights past Roman Catholic abuses, there are points of levity and wit. I won't spoil the ending, but it's one of the best endings I've read in a quite a while. A beautiful story. I will read more by this author.
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is not a long book.  But its length is deceptive.  Even now, days removed from reading the book, I am still thinking about it and haven't really been able to read anything else.  It's one of those books I read and I knew it was good when I was reading it, but I also just was so deep into it that I couldn't take a step back and think about everything going on in it.  So I read it and I finished and I thought, \\"Well, that was different.  It was good, but... I don't know that it's amazing.\\"  And I closed the cover and went to sleep.<br /><br />Only, I couldn't really sleep.  I just kept thinking about the book.  And in the morning, I mulled on it some more.  And then I read the NPR review by Annalee Newitz and finally, things seemed to click.  And I understood that this really is a masterfully told story, just as one would expect from Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />What makes the book so powerful, and what was articulated so well in the NPR book review, was the impact of a middle-aged man remembering what happened to him as a child.  The financial difficulties his parents faced and how they dealt with them, his father's sudden flare-ups of temper, a terrifying moment in a bathtub, the fragility of relationships when the people in them have had to bend too far not to break.  How does a seven-year-old make sense of the world and what is happening to him?  How does a middle-aged man look back on his life and what he made of it, permanently changed by occurrences he only sometimes remembers?<br /><br />So much of Gaiman's work is about the choices we make and the consequences of those choices.  We spend so much effort trying to make sense of our lives and justify what we do.  In The Ocean at the End of the World, we see that from the perspective of the same person as both a child and an adult.  And as an adult looking back on his childhood, the narrator gives us enticing glimpses of a life and a family that were not as idyllic as they seemed.<br /><br />In a way, this book is textbook Neil Gaiman.  The language is so beautifully subtle and evocative.  The setting is described in such a way as to put you right in the thick of things, and the action moves so smoothly and yet is so, so scary.<br /><br />In another way, this book is a departure for Gaiman.  In Neverwhere, American Gods and The Graveyard Book, the hero is very much someone you love.  In The Ocean at the End of the Lane, you are not sure how you feel about the narrator.  You know what he was like as a child of seven - lonely, quiet, and scared - but you don't quite know what he's like as an adult.  And that moral ambiguity - the uncertainty that the boy grew up to become a man who was worth all the effort - is really the lynchpin of this story.  Our friends and family put so much effort into our well-being when we are young, hoping that their efforts will make us into good, productive people when we grow up.  That their investments will be worthwhile.  But we are nothing if not flawed, and the struggle to live up to those dreams and expectations is something we all deal with.  And it's something that Gaiman articulates so brilliantly - and so very, very subtly - in this novel.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great series with wonderful characters.  Loving this.  Laura and Dorcas are the center of the story but many of the shows center on the theme of modernization and the impact on small town life.  I sometimes question the authenticity of the dialogue and some small items on the set but love it anyway.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I put off seeing this movie for awhile as it the last movie Zach Snyder made that I needed to see, and I knew it had a bad reputation in comparison to his other movies. It started off bad, but once I finished, I found myself pleased with the movie and surprisingly good enough to buy.<br /><br />The storyline while a little confusing at first, actually attracted my interest. It isn't completly original in the main goal, but the development of the characters, what Babydoll's visions were, the paralleling of the dream sequences to real events kept me watching. I found myself caring for the characters and felt sad when things turned out bad for them.<br /><br />Now the ending I liked but it has a missing scene that is extremely helpful. Babydoll is told she needs \\"Map, Fire, Knife, Lock and the reason\\", well the theatrical cut, does not have the scene where she finds the reason. She does sort of say she figures it out, but it isn't enough for most viewers. Go to youtube and look up Sucker Punch uncut ending it's about 7 minutes. It's a pity studios decided to cut that scene out as it properly concludes the story.<br /><br />Now why three stars? Purely becuase this movie is more of an eye candy film then Snyder's other movies, only a select few will appreciate the film and its messages and unlike Source Code (which is similer in terms of making you think and being powerful yet simple) the ending can easily be misinterpreted. I myself had to look up the film's synopsis to make sure I understood what I had just viewed.<br /><br />Ultimatly I'm glad I saw this as for ME, it was a good pleasure film.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|What a read! Took me all of 3 days to finish. Great story about living and really enjoying life for what it is... I'm ready to watch the movie !
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|I'm new to a tablet and I thought the idea of reading books on an electronic device was awesome.  I didn't find anything I wanted to read, but I honestly did not spend much time looking.  Was easy to use.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has an amazing ability to transport the reader to new terrain, culture and feelings.  He has done it again through this beautifully crafted novel.  I was spellbound throughout, and I feel enriched for having read it.  The author develops a strong empathy in the reader for the characters, who face some of life's greatest struggles.  This is amazing literature!

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|As a family we have watched every season.  Sometimes one person would miss a few episode and get upset others<br />were further ahead.  We purchased the DVDs and watch additional episodes on Amazon because we were never able<br />to catch it on tv.  We usually would watch several episodes back to back.  Love it!!!

B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly, more than 10 years later you are still going strong in the hearts of fans.  If you have not see this series before, you should.  It's only 13 episodes and worth the time.  It got cancelled way to early.  View it and see why so many fans feel that way.

B009NLC1D6|5.0|Hindu's Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was the equivalent of the Christian's Jesus Christ born at the wrong time in India's history. A country so vast, with so many tongues, with so many religions, with so many ethnic groups (including if not especially the Untouchables), India was part of the British Empire. Until Gandhi, based on the bigotry experiences he suffered in apartheid South Africa, returned to India to seek for her independence.  However, in his wisdom, he wanted to give too much power to the Muslims of Pakistan and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). These points were well made by the movie. Yes, he was resourceful, peaceful but up to certain point, feeble-minded enough in giving India her independence, but at what price? He took away the power from the British usurpers and gave it to the Muslim despots and corrupt Indian government. Until the inevitable nuclear holocaust (India and Pakistan have fought already many conventional wars), we can call Gandhi's victory a Pyrrhic Victory at best.  The movie is so well done that one does not feel the three hours plus of its running time.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I've read all the Jack Reacher novels (including the one the movie is based on).  I expected to be disappointed, but wasn't.  Yes, Cruise is not the hulking monster portrayed in the books, but he's a great actor and I felt he played the Reacher character well.  It's really about attitude, confidence, and so forth.<br /><br />I really, really, hope they make more Reacher movies.  I enjoyed almost every minute of it.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|... about how country music now is just 'pop' music with a cowboy hat on.  Maybe this is too.  But its got me hitting repeat.  I'm a displaced southern gal born in the heart of Nascar country, charlotte, NC.  but I mostly listen to pop and hip hop, I reckon its an '80's thing.  This album seems to satisfy all of my listening desires ... at least today.  fickle listener
B000AP04OM|5.0|This musical is a family moment. Great scenery, a little history, sing-a-long songs,  imaginary trips and more this wholesome classic offers much to anyone who sits in front of the TV. I have a three-year old who ow sings the entire &#34;Do a deer&#34; song.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I enjoy all of David Baldacci's books. I enjoy this new series even though it is very Jack Reacher like (another enjoyable series)
0385349831|5.0|This book is a daily plan for making the most of who you truly are. A loose story line and very short chapters make it an inspiring book for all, but New-Agers will see many of their truths within.
B004I744AS|5.0|There is an added plus to this app.  In addition to getting a fine dictionary, there is some fun info and a hangman word game.

B001974DG0|5.0|I honestly have enjoyed all of Koontz' books so far and this one has been among my favorites. It brought me to tears and joyous laughter more than once. Whilst giving me many things to think about, like the power of love.<br /><br />If you like a good tale, this is the one for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game a lot because I like to search for things and find out mysteries and get clues to unlock boxs

B00AGOGOLE|4.0|There is this little girl who loves taking pictures and  that's me. I love recording videos much more. And  I recorded tons  of vids until my camera HD ( kindle fire camera ) did not let me. It says camera has stopped. And  I hate that. Nextin needs to fix this problem.
B0072HDP9M|5.0|Well what can I say, apart from I loved it!<br /><br />I love books and movies that flick from past to present. I was very suprised how the movie stayed true to the book...incidently the movie is an alltime favorite!<br /><br />You can just imagine the bustling Whistle Stop Cafe with it's colourful characters. .<br /><br />The book transports you to a different time when things seemed so simple but were not, due to the massive difference because of your colour, your sex and the great depression.<br /><br />All the characters are so well described you can imagine being there liking them or hating them.<br /><br />There were so many colourful characters I could not choose a favorite, from the prankster, hard hitting loveable character of Idgie, the gentle kind somewhat niave Ruth, the big loyal family man 'Big George' to the lonely 'Smokey Lonesome'!<br /><br />You felt like you could taste the BBQ, fight Idgies fights, cuddle Ruth and stand up for the your beliefs too!<br /><br />You could salivate because of the description of the comforting Southern Cooking, great Southern Recipes included.<br /><br />Thouroughly enjoyed the book and have and will recommend it to anyone :)
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have been looking for this sense I got my Kindle. I started playing it.it was awesome!you!you get to crate anything u want to.you should definitely get this app! It's awesome. It's worth a dollar.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I've read most of Kathy Reichs' books. They can be a little boring in the beginning. There is a lot of French words. I skip over them. Sometimes there is too much detail. She ends up putting everything into one story. There are different murders but they are all related.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is very fun it's one of the best games I have ever played but I rated it 4 stars because I think the backgrounds look stupid
B000JMKTLO|3.0|A mildly interesting story with a main character that needs a lot of work, an awful lot of work. Too intelligent to be so messed up. Nice red herrings, could have gone several ways which is good writing. Sort of like a Michael Crichton novel, good concept, weak ending.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|This app basically tells you what you already know. Like the battery percentage and temperature. This app is basically is thermometer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|SO MUCH FUN AND VERY ADDICTIVE!!  Not extreamly hard but challenging! An interesting and colorfull room on every level! CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE LEVELS/ROOMS TO COME OUT!! :D
B00992CF6W|4.0|My opinion for Minecraft is its an awesome game but the dynamite takes like 3hours to explode because there isn't any flint and stone to explode
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Wonderful biography. Would definitely recommend to everyone who's interested in learning about someone who's influenced the world we live in today
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|You must watch this movie. It is a bit cerebral and may go over many peoples heads, but it's one of my all time favorite thinking man's movie. The lives of many generations of the same pair of souls interact through hundreds of years of reincarnations to culminate in an important event far into the future.<br /><br />Actors play multiple roles and in some cases you won't realize it until they show the credits at the end.<br /><br />&#34;Our lives are not our own. From birth to grave we are bound to others, and with each crime and every kindness, we birth our future&#34; - the recurring quote and theme throughout.<br /><br />Very good and although a tad bit slow at times, it is nonetheless intelligent enough to keep your attention to the very end.<br /><br />Jerry Boutot<br />http://www.jerryboutotmusic.com
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Surprised by this movie and the storyline.  It may be a little bloody/gory in a few spots for some folks.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show is a must see! The concept is original and thought provoking and Maslany's acting skills are out of this world! Can't wait for the second season!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it!  I think it has a good lesson in it.  A few scary parts like any disney movie, but overall the girls (ages 4 and 6) really like it
B00867HDTA|5.0|Both my 3 year old and his Father can play the game for hours. It has games for all skill levels. Graphics are very well done.  Good buy all around
B008K3HRF0|2.0|Long movie that didn't really get to the point.  My kids like almost anything Dr. Seuss but they wouldn't even sit through the entire movie on this one!
B000P0J09W|5.0|Perfect movie for those that like adventure based movies.  Go vaules about kids helping their parnets and remaining loyal to each other with things get ruff.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Some kids movies I get sick of watching over and over again.  but not this one!  I could watch it a million times and I still find parts in it that I missed the time before.  Great for the kids but also entertaining for adults!
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Good movie, very little plot, lots of action in true Arnold fashion. Well worth the watch if you are an Arnold fan
B002BWCJOA|4.0|My 6 year old loved this movie and wanted to watch it all the time, but then started to have nightmares about it!  So, we have not watched it in a while!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This continues right where Hunger Games and left off, and keeps right on thrilling you.<br />If you read Hunger Games, this is a must read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season three left me more breathless than season 1 or 2 and that is quite a statement.  No one is safe!
B002QCD2OG|4.0|This was a very good movie.  A worlds collide type of movie.  The theme and setting for the movie was excellent also.  I watched it on my Kindle Fire 3 times in two weeks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can you escape is extremely additive! I cant stop playing! the only bad part is you have to wait for all the levels to come out. other than that it is so much fun!
B00AKO93JK|4.0|Not a perfect workout program, but is a good quick program for working out on the go. Got it for free, so no complaints.
B0011Z330C|5.0|i love this album. Green Day is and has been one of my favorites. Couldnt pass up on the deal
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I've been an Archer fan for a long time. The Clifton series is just great. Each story moves right along. The plots kept me interested and awake longer then my pm schedule prefers. Really like Archer's style of short chapters and his choice of historical period. It's obvious by the third book's ending- so as to not spoil things these should be read in order as they were written- that a fourth book is on it's way. Looking forward to the next edition. Really easy to recommend Archer's Clifton series-hope you ENJOY.
B000NDMRDW|4.0|I love this movie. It is one of my favorites. Wish i could watch it on my big screen though.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Well now, we know what Hansel and Gretel did now after they grew up.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I recommend it to others who enjoy fantasy.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|once you pick it up it is hard to put down, the movie was ok, but you miss so much by not reading the books
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love  reading of other cultures and peoples.  He develops his characters well  and leaves you wanting to know more.
B000U6BT40|4.0|This is a story which could be possible. It ties in conspiracy theories, romance, science, unusual characters (who are also believable), and adventure. The stories are consistent and fun. I am hooked and am now watching ALL the seasons! Enjoying it and hoping it doesn't end.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love getting all sorts of ideas from this site, for painting, fashion, jewelry, etc. and also follow what my friends like.  Great!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I am enjoying the AccuWeather App, it seems to give me more info on weather and my area than I probably need.
1439152802|5.0|This book was amazing! Maybe kates best yet! As this was the last of her books that I read, I found this one started differently but within a few pages I was hooked. Whatever book she writes next, I will be reading it. I will definitely be on the look out! I hope you are writing right now Kate!
B00271HTLI|4.0|I have been late in my reading of Harry Potter. I am reading a book and then watching the movie associated with the book. The most interesting thing to me is seeing how different people interpret what the book is saying. I have to say that I liked the director of the first two movies better than the director of this one.
B000ICKPOQ|4.0|I have always liked the Stargate movies and series.  This is a good one for any regular sci fi fan.
B003YCIE68|5.0|This has been on my wish list for a long time and since no one ever purchased it for me i bought it myself. Love Dudley Moore
B001AQQR2S|4.0|It was cute movie and a good show to watch with your kids! The kids loved it and have watched three times now! I've seen it a few times too.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|These three motion pictures redefined the \\"Hollywood Blockbuster\\" for Baby Boomers and their kids.The Grandkids will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I spent three consecutive nights sharing the Trilogy with my 15-year old son. Fabulous!  John Williams' score drives the entire film with the power of a modern symphonic masterpiece. A long, long time ago, I waited in lines to see the originals in 70mm Dolby--several times. The original mag tracks have been even further refined and the result is phenomenal. The Blu-ray version looks and sounds great.<br /><br />Regarding the authenticity of these re-releases, my sentiment leans towards \\"does it really matter\\"? The CGI additions do not improve anything--but neither does it detract.<br /><br />This will not be  a satisfactory offering for film professors, students or archivists. Then again, we are not talking Citizen Kane here. These movies are supposed to be pure hi-decibel fun and they will remain so for generations to come.<br /><br />Heaven knows how much money I shelled out at the box-office way back when. For thirty bucks, kick back and enjoy three evenings of hi-def, window-ratteling popcorn bliss.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is a great app if you're looking for something fun,or just to kill time. I definitely recommend getting this fun app.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|Love this movie, I can never get sick of it! My 2 year old also loves it. I would definitely recommend this for the whole family!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|when we watch the video for this it look really fun. but then we bought and I have no clue how to play. I thought I found one thing but then it would not let me get it. this is a rip off do not buy it.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This is such a cute movie my 2 year old and I cannot get enough of it! Love the fact that there's singing in this one considering all of the new disney movies don't have any more like the classics. Cute story line too.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Works great on Kindle Fire. I like Christian music BUT there are not to choose from on here. They could add more then I would tell all my friends about it. You Tube has more Christian songs .
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|It's a cool game but for the price it's just a bit crazy to spend that much on a game
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter is one of the only shows I know of where you have no idea what's going to happen.<br /><br />The characters are so well developed you almost feel as if you know them personally, which makes the show that much more intense when you see them fall in love, get heart broken, and die.<br /><br />The story arc for the Dexter franchise is unbelievable. Unlike other shows which forget about important information that happened within the first couple seasons, Dexter connects the dots between things you've seen in Season two and things your watching here in Season 7.<br /><br />It's incredible. One of my favorite shows.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This book was wonderful to read with powerful characters and a great story line...if not many story lines.  You will not be sorry if you purchase this book as it's delightful to read
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|The book reads in a juvenile fashion and the writing has a mediocre quality to it. I never felt like the main character matured much through her experience, though that seemed to be the point.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is an amazing bit of tech.  I cannot imagine how it is able to ascertain a character with so few questions. I have shared it with a number of friends,.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Dub step, dancehall, electro, industrial...Kanye brings it all on this album. Mr. West keeps pushing the envelope in creativity, visceral lyrics, and production. Bringing on Hudson Mohawke and Daft Punk was a great move. I am a little bored of people whining about Kanye's direction, since college dropout Kanye has proved he has always been outside of the box so his evolution should be no surprise. Are you a fan of the album or the artist? I loved MBDTF, it is one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time, this is great album in its own right and puts a exclamation on the direction that MBDTF first wrote.
B000SGSU58|5.0|So much has been written about this book that I have little additional to offer. Just suffice it to say that Harry Bosch overcomes the most horrendous obstacles to solve the case. Another genre-leading book.
B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter loves to play with this set.  Keep in mind though it does not come with the monster high figures so you have to buy them separatley.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show is one of the best lawyer shows I have ever seen. There is a little bit of everything for everyone here. The back plots and character renewals make this a pleasure to watch.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I highly recommend this - there are a couple of ways to play this Mahjong game - enjoyed both the quest and the various games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it is awesome you and your family would love it too its cool and amazing i
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I loved how neatly the booked ended. I am happy that I was left feeling like Sookie would have a good life!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Dont get me wrong every body loves minecraft.<br />IThis app is a fun, challenging, and creative for all ages. It would be five stars if it would update sooner. I mean come on! The apple app store already got the update a month ago!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are really good and it is really fun today I love all of the activities the horses are gaited tho good game yay
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|I love Ann Hathaway - and Jake is always good to look at so I wanted to see this movie.  I think the story line was good - worth watching.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|This is one of the best dramas on television.  Probably no coincidence Ridley and Tony Scott are exec producing.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Writer tried to insert funny type lines in inappropriate places in this action movie. Dissappointing at best. Action scenes had alot of over kill stunts.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Continues momentum built from Season 1 and keeps me coming back for more.<br /><br />I can't believe I'm so interested in the lives of servants in a royal British house.  It's kind of like a really good soap opera.  Thank you PBS!
B007L24T52|4.0|This book is a really good read, you get caught up in the action, watch his and her relationship unfold and try to figure out who exactly is to blame. I couldnt put it down,gripping and would certainly recommend it. Look forward to reading other Baldacci books.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I think Tesla is possibly the most underrated man of the 20th Century, facing a variety of high=powered foes, but ignoring the floss of their comments.  There is enough missing in the Tesla history to make us wonder what we missed.  This book starts off rather rambling, but gets down to the biography in short time.  I enjoyed it, I think it reveals an extraordinary man.  Especially a good read for young minds or high school age.  Stimulating.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game has many boards to choose from from easy to very difficult layouts. It can be addicting. I am not sure if I am playing it exactly right, but I am enjoying it.
B000LX00RY|5.0|I love this movie. Meryl Streep is amazing, as is Anne Hathaway. I own this film and it is always a go to on our stay inside movie days. Chick flick, but awesome.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I purchased this watch as a stop-gap while waiting on my replacement strap to arrive for my Vostok Gaz14 as I have a think for accurate automatic watches.  I am not disappointed with the performance of this sharp looking watch.<br /><br />I prefer watches with a larger face, but this watch isn't overly small.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone wanting a quality automatic watch on a budget.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a generation classic. I have loved this movie since I was a youngster and I think it is still relevant for today's audience.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is awesome I play it . I am a master at it and I played it for 5 years!
B0074VTHKM|4.0|This was the first series of books that my son read when he was in the 3rd grade. They were a little advanced for him when he first started but then he managed to breeze through the rest. John Grisham is phenomenal.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Honestly, Jeremy Renner is such a good actor, he can play in any movie and make it interesting. If you want a fast paced movie with action, then this is for you. It's not like they were shooting to win an Oscar when they made this film. They were obviously going for a good time, and they accomplished that. The witches are not scary, which is a good thing for a person like me who is easily frightened. But they do make the witches down right vicious, so you are rooting for their deaths. So go ahead, give this movie a chance. I enjoyed it.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I honestly had no idea what this movie was about and even once it started I didn't know exactly where the film was headed, but I ended up completely surprised and fascinated. What a great movie. Unexpected twists and turns keep you guessing the entire time. Well done.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|One of the things I like about Altucher from his blog is his open book way of talking. He never pretends to have all the answers. He tells you about his failures as often as (or more often than) his successes. There is no pretence to his entries.<br /><br />This carries through in his book. He repeatedly tells you that these things he writes about worked for him - try them and see IF they help you. He gives so much information I already plan to re-read it to figure out what I missed. Also, I have to admit, I've never thought of being an entrepreneur, but he makes a case so convincing, and sounds so do-able, that I actually consider it in the realm of possibilities now.<br /><br />Definitely a book I would recommend. To anyone feeling stuck in any part of their lives, or anyone wanting to do better in any part of their lives. :)
B00CX1TPF0|2.0|This movie seemed to have so much potential. However, the special effects and animation was cheesy and poorly done. Sadly I bought this film for my son before watching it and now we are stuck with it.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|Absolutely beautiful movie so much more meaningful now than when I watched it as a child :-) . The scope of the soundtrack is breathtaking and the characters all flow together harmoniously :-)
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Talk about a heart-warming, charming tale. I loved this movie. It was well written, super cute, and funny. I highly recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another really good book by Sylvia Day, my only problem with it is that I'm done and will have to wait a LONG time for the next one! SIGH<br /><br />I liked this one better because they actually try working through their problems this time instead of just running away or acting childish. It was rather annoying in the first two books every time something would go wrong Eva would act as though she were 16 instead of her mid twenties.<br /><br />Also, we see more into the mind of Gideon in this one, and some of his secrets and mystery are revealed. This was probably my favorite of the series so far. There is still quite a bit of action and drama, it just seems more like adult drama instead of teenage bs.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Wish there were more than just the episodes a season. One of the best shows on television!  The third season is coming out soon and looking forward to that one as well!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book didn't disappoint!<br />It was full of suspense, drama and it almost had a mystery feel to it as you try to figure out who's doing what and or who, as well as speculation on Gideon's secrets. I mean, what IS he hiding?! lol Sometimes it a bit frustrating, but in a good way, I just want to yell at the characters and tell them how stupid they are being, but that's a good thing right, it means I'm invested in the characters - and once again Sylvia Day pulled me in and kept me entertained for a few hours.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book to be released so I can read it! I do like that there is no cliff hanger, I could stop reading the series now and I wouldn't feel like I'm missing out on the end. Don't get me wrong, I WILL be reading book 3!!
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Not as good as Next Gen but pretty good. It seems to take place in the same time frame as Next Gen but a little into their story.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm sad that the series has come to an end, and while it isn't how I would have ended the story I still thoroughly enjoyed the series from beginning to end. This book did have the feel of someone trying to end a series, it is packed full of info, and sometimes its just a totally random character popping in and telling their end game story. It just didn't have the easy flow that some of the earlier books seemed to have. It was definitely time to come to a close.<br /><br />Thank You Charlaine Harris for creating one of my favorite series that spawned my favorite TV show, and entertaining me for several years!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I am so disappointed this is not available for my newest tablet.  This worked great on my old Galaxy Tab, and my grandkids loved it!!  I dropped the tab and had to replace with a newer one.  I was so disappointed that it is not compatible with the newer Galaxy 2 Tab 10.1 model.  I hope that will change soon!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|** spoiler alert **<br /> I prefer an actual storyline vs reading a porn... with that said, in my opinion this book was much better than the 50 Shades series. There is more story than steamy. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of steamy scenes, but it didn't leave me feeling like I just read the script to a porn flick. There were more characters and background info to set up future books.<br />I will say that it was basically the same principle - rich guy who has sexual issues falls for an insecure woman, they make the press, he has family problems and an ex that he speaks with frequently causing drama for the new couple, she shares an apartment with her bff, etc etc. Basically the same idea for a book, only one author focused on the bondage and made the book about sex while the other dove into the characters and added the sex as a bonus
B003VANOFY|2.0|My Experience:<br />-Wearing the headphones for more than an hour or two hurts the ears<br />-Disconnecting and reconnecting it annoying<br />+Various buttons might be useful for gamers but not for casual people who just need a comfortable headset, they're no use<br /><br />Returned after 2 or 3 days of use (can't remember). I would tell my friend to get a good (wired) headset and good microphone separately and would not recommend this product to other people.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I just love this book!  I am not done with it yet but almost can't put it down!!  It is done in an unusual way!  I haven't enjoyed a book this much since my last Agatha Christie book!!
B00005JKGK|5.0|Yes, although it was girly and the boys in my classroom were not into it, there was a serious emphatic response.  If we had not read the book, the movie would not have made sense.  My students actually needed to read more.  Yet, the movie added the visuals for others to understand.  Excellent movie!
B0095H4FAA|4.0|I finally gave in after all the hype about this book series, and it was worth it. I will admit it took me a while to get through the first chapters. With all the political background and information that you needed to take in in order for the characters to be introduced and their backgrounds properly. But once you got past those chapters it was well worth it. This is a great book I could not put it down and could not wait to read the second and the third. I know the movie just came out and I did watch it, but the book is better. They always change the story in the movie.
B00AQMQBKK|1.0|Cannot get game to install on my Kindle. Plenty of memory left, tried to<br />install several times. Not sure if it's the game or a Kindle problem.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|It seems as if Linkin Park's music changes with every album, and this is no exception. They've definitely kept up the top quality music they're known for. The album has 12 tracks, comes with a free one month trial of LP Underground (or at least mine did) and the front cover booklet includes lyrics for all the tracks. So many various new instruments are integrated and each song delivers something different to your ears. Chester still shouts, as always, and Mike returns with his top notch raps. Every song on this CD got my attention and the more I listen to it the more I fall in love with it. Every LP fan should appreciate Living Things. I've been a long time fan and they have yet to disappoint me.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|This movie is great.  I wasnt expecting it to have so many good elements to it, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Good rent!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I've read several English historian accounts on The Tudors and they all agree with me that Jonathon Reese-Myers literally became Henry VIII in this captivating series. I am a history teacher/photographer/film maker and I would not say these things if they were not true. But believe me - this series is absolutely compelling and fascinating. While no one can know exactly what was said and what really happened, 5 centuries ago,  I've found that majority of this series is grounded in documented fact. And honestly there are events depicted in this series that are still being debated by historians, such as the role that Anne Bolyne's father played in her marriage and demise. And some events were simply changed outright, such as the fact that Henry Viii's sister went off to marry the King of Portugal. In fact she went off to marry a French Royal. I'm not sure why they just couldn't stick with the facts here. Still I guarantee you will be spell-bound if you care anything about history and drama at all. The only movie, in my opinion, that rivals the Tutors is &#34;Anne of a Thousand Days.&#34; Richard Buton played Henry VIII in this older movie, and he was an almost impossible act to follow. But Reese-Myers miraculously followed well - superbly - astonishingly! Do yourself a favor, watch all 40+ hours (by the way this is the longer BBC version as well - you will want every minute you can get, believe me), and go to England. Once there, arrange a trip to follow the trail of Anne Bolyne and Henry VIII. Visit the places they lived and played out their ultimate dramas. It will be unforgettable, especially since you will learn lessons that are relevant in your life as well as the life of society today.<br />Mike Holt  bluewolfmike@yahoo.com
B004WMKSH2|4.0|I watched Part One and Part Two on the same day.  I tried to keep up with all the movies  but as they bore me a little I forgot to watch the last two.  Well the last two were the good ones.  I really enjoyed them.  I'm glad I watched them
B004SH40BQ|2.0|I should have listened to other reviewers when they said it drains your battery like no other.  I have an ipod nano attached to a Lunatik.  When I have the Kokkia in and I'm listening to music on my Blueant Q2, not only does it drain the battery in less than 1 1/2 hour, but it has to be on the same side as my headset, otherwise the music breaks in and out.
B005UG542S|4.0|The last two movies were the best of all of them.  I have been only a moderate fan of both the movies and the books.  I have found them only moderately interesting as a whole.  In fact I gave up reading them after book four.  However this last movie and Part one are really pretty good and I am glad I finally watched them.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This is a great book I really enjoyed it.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first book.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|The costumes in this movie are fantastic and I love the storyline with new mutant villains Tokka and Razar. I wish actress Judith Hoag had stuck around to play April O'Neil.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love this game. I keep playing it over and over. The graphics and the puzzles are addictive. My daughter installed it on her tablet too.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Along with Songs for the Deaf, Rated R is (in my opinion) the band's best work.  Not a bad song on here and love the different vocalist approach.  Feel Good Hit of the Summer is just classic!
B008Y73940|5.0|Loved this movie. Matthew McConaughey at his best. Plot twist at the end was awesome. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. I like where it went and how it took you there. Don't expect an obvious payoff at the end. If you like subtlety, puzzles, and an underlying off beat shoreline,then play the Room. I will definitely be playing the sequel.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|This kind of movie just not up beat for me. It make me sad. I know it's base on real story it even make me more depressing.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I like fiction with an interesting 'sense of place'. The bookstore, the apartment, San Fransisco, the Google campus - the descriptions left me with a comfortable feeling - that I 'knew' these places.<br />The characters and plot were very intriguing.<br />All the ingredients made for a good story.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is very good actor but movie itself is long and boring. Lincoln was strong and a smart one. It didn't show much of that in this movie.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I honestly thought that this book would be a lot better than it was. It was pretty good but the book just got so much hype, and it made it seem like the best book on earth. Parts of the book were so beautifully written but overall not the best book ever.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|was kinda fun but gets old real quick...was ok but gets old you know what I;m saying dawg..word to your mother..
B008JGSM6G|4.0|love this app. its lots of fun to play. hours of entertainment. I recommend this app. for anyone who likes brain teasers
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is great! We love the acting, the plot and the writing. The streaming quality is pretty good, too.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I rented this movie on amazon instant video and it was just so bad. I am being professional here cause I could say other nasty things . It was boring as I found myself checking emails and reading. I was paying for this movie and it just wasn't interesting ,the characters were fake and the storyline was just stupid,please don't waste your money .
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Excelent, this a Best buy for runners!<br />Easy, functional, Good equipament And very Good accessibility! Now my dates are save<br />Good luck
B0072GPPNC|5.0|This gave a great insight into the role of horses in the first world war. I viewed this movie on a 60 inch TV with surround sound. It was very impressive and spellbinding.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Very entertaining. Easy to learn and fun for all ages. My 8 year old just loves it. She plays it for hours and is always asking questions about each new animal she rescues.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. I bought it back in alpha for pc. With realms if you have a minecraft account just go to mojang.com and migrate your minecraft account. After you do that just sign in as Your minecraft email and password. It's that simple.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love it but I wish I had more keys and coins but whatever it's still a fun game to play!!:3
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game! I need more rooms or I'm going to die! !!!(not literally) it is hard but I figured It out well my friend and I.MAKE MORE ROOMS!!!!!!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Its hella dum for the next to me anymore I love u doin answer me to ask out of drama cuz
B004EPYZSK|4.0|movie was very well made and i enjoyed it,i would tell all my co-workers to watch or even buy this movie
B005OCFGTO|3.0|Some scenes are missing from some of the movies compared to other versions viewed and TV versions. First &#34;Deathly Hallows&#34; DVD physically looks like a counterfeit as there is no picture on the DVD.
B00C061HZY|5.0|One of their best albums!....refreshing taste of music! Completely different sound than any of their previous albums out....expectations have been blown away
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am not a big reader but this book kept my attention and made me laugh. It was a good read
B00CIH371W|5.0|Escaping from her boyfriend, Conner, and his mafia-style life of organized crime, Sara Jones becomes a silent hero in this tangled web of mystery and suspense.<br /><br />Spiders remain busy spinning a murderous web when they are signaled by a unique sound heard only by spiders. Possessing poisonous venom, the spiders complete their mission consistently.<br /><br />Sara learns she is immune to the poison, and this is where the story begins to build up suspense on every page.<br /><br />Caught in a web of deceit, Sara isn't sure who to trust, Conner, the gorgeous hunk of a boyfriend who entangled her into his life of crime, or the other gorgeous hunk of a boyfriend, Brett, who replaces Conner. Yes, there's plenty of sex interweaved with horror and violence in The Tegen Cave.<br /><br />Keeping up with Sara's libido as she tries to spin a web of moral survival is incredibly entertaining. All the characters become real in this particular world of spiders and creative fiction by Inge-Lise Goss.<br /><br />Appreciating extraordinary writing was a pleasure. I was engaged throughout the story as there was never a predictable event. I'm hoping for a sequel to The Tegan Cave, by Inge-Lise Goss.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|A little gory and some graphic sex, but I am a big girl and can handle it. Don't know if I want to get into depth with the books, so the show is perfect!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It kind of reminds me of Mario, its a fun game. It is worth downloading. My kids love to play it!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This author is adept at really taking you into the world of his characters and making you feel like you are there.  He created a whole world of fantasy and magick, and you could almost believe these things are real as he describes them so well and seems to have such a deep knowledge of them!  Great author.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Wish Hollywood would make more of this type of film that is uplifting and will appeal to every age group.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm really shocked at several of the reviews.  This book is written just as well as any other Sylvia Day book, and it held my attention until the end.<br />As for the ending:  If you do your homework, you will find in Ms Day's blog where she informed readers that she wasn't going to abruptly end Eva and Gideon's story for the sake of &#34;trilogy&#34;, but was going to allow their relationship to take its natural course- even if that means more than three books.  I don't see the money grubbing that some have written of; only a gifted author who loves her readers and writing and wants to see her characters through to a place of natural resolution.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was a good read, but I thought it paled in comparison to The Kite Runner and even A Thousand Splendid Suns.. The plot was rather predictable and occasionally slow.
184990409X|5.0|Always a favourite out of the Holmes stories was The Hound of the Baskervilles. I admit that I already had a copy of this novel, but with the addition of the BBC Book reprint and the introduction by Mr Benedict Cumberbatch, I had to buy it. The cover is beautiful and flawless and the introduction by Mr Cumberbatch is quite adorable (to me, anyway; but then, I'm a fan).<br /><br />As a fan of both ACD's original stories and the BBC's Sherlock, this was a must have. It was just an elementary decision, as Holmes would say. (Or perhaps he would have simply called it 'fleeting fancy for romanticised fiction'...)
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|I think it is wonderful that John got some of the newer artists to perform some of his old standards with him.  Great music by great musicians.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|This is the first of a two part animated translation of Frank Miller's classic work, The Dark Knight Returns.<br />For fans of the original comic, the animation adopts most of the key concepts and visual motifs. It is also quite faithful to the plot and nuances. So if you are looking for a \\"faithful\\" adaptation this rises to expectations.<br />If you are unfamiliar with that work, it can be a bit tricky. The fundamental part of the legend and myth of Batman are well known so the film makers and Frank Miller can be forgiven in not exploring the background except where it fits their fundamental themes about obsession and finding a meaning to one's life. The story of the rich young man who is scarred by crime as a child and who dedicates his life to fighting crime using his wealth and devoting his life to this end is generally well known. The book and film asks the basic question: what happens after a life time is spent fighting crime and now Batman is an old man? What has he got to show for his efforts? Is the world a better place? Has he made any difference other than to beat up a lot of thugs and crooks?<br /><br />The details about particular villains, key plot themes (like the Batcave, Batmobile, Dick Grayson, and Jason Todd) and relationships (James Gordon, Selina Kyle)are assumed. If you are unclear as to who is Two-Face, Catwoman, and such, you can figure it out with careful viewing and listening to the context of the dialog but frankly that is like reading about the end of Hercules without knowing about the 12 Labors or Mysterious Island without 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and how it affected Captain Nemo. The production values are excellent with smooth animation and the action scenes are well done and faithful to the original comic. The voice acting is also excellent - not the same cast found in the superb Batman: The Animated Series but it is still very well done.<br /><br />S<br />P<br />O<br />I<br />L<br />E<br />R<br /><br />The comic and movie points out that one man, even when he is the Batman, can only do so much by himself. He must somehow change the world around him in some lasting way if he is to have any positive legacy. The obsession of Batman forces him to tie up loose ends in the present and the past. The present is manifest in the form of the Mutants, a gang based on raw power and brutality with no subtlety. The past is represented by Two-Face and the Joker. Two-Face, (once Harvey Dent, close friend of Bruce Wayne) forces Bruce to accept that there are some things his good efforts can't fix. The Joker is his classic foe - the irrational psychopath. Batman grasps and easily can deal with rational foes - their actions are predictable and motivations understandable. Counter measures can therefore be taken. The Joker doesn't fit and just wants to play and Batman is the ideal foil. The comic and movie leads us to conclude that Batman can do a lot to help stop rational crime but irrational behavior can't always be treated/cured and by definition may have no sane solution.<br /><br />The world is larger than just Gotham City and when national and international politics intrude, it brings Superman into conflict. Finally Batman accepts that he has not only grown old and can't fight on as he once did, he has to engage the greater world outside of Gotham. To make his life meaningful and leave changes that are lasting he'll have to take on the world's problems. For Batman fans, it leaves the irony that he becomes very similar to his legendary enemy, Ra's al-Ghul. His intentions are clearly better and he isn't willing to see the deaths of millions to achieve his ends, but the final scene of him creating a secret organization working towards his aims and goals while keeping to the shadow and training successful generations to take on the struggle cannot be an accident. Frank Miller must have meant this as a final point and does it nicely with the subtle parallelism with Ra's al-Ghul.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Terrific stories, beautifully written, but never fully connected. I would love to have had a sense of completion for several of the characters' storylines.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  The only way you can get it made the national institutes of health and vanilla ice age of tartar.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good way to waste time. I like when they have several rooms for one level. they try to throw you off with extra info.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Engaging show that finds you rooting for the bad guys.  I'm glad I started from the beginning not having seen the show on television.  I couldn't imagine having to wait each week for a new episode.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|The cover does exactly what it's supposed to. It fits perfectly and is transparent so it warms the pool when the sun hits. Just have to find a large beach ball to put in the center to keep rain water from collecting but it works great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like the app, had fun playing it.  It just needs more levels added to it. I was just upset that it ended so soon, and without warning.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|His unusual health problem that lead to coma was eye opening, along with the devotion of his family during his illness .<br />He discribes and gives testimony about the experience he went through along with his sciencetific research that does prove to him that God and Heaven is real ....
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Ever since Kanye first released College Dropout, I've been a huge fan.  I've purchased all of his solo albums and every time that a new album was about to drop, I would get pumped to hear some new Kanye...good beats and decent lyrics in an otherwise garbage-filled genre.  Late Registration, Graduation, and even 808s resonated with me on many levels and I was proud to be a Kanye fan despite all his ridiculous antics \\"off-stage\\".  When MBDTF released, my reaction was mixed, which in many circles would have people screaming in outrage.  However, I saw what was happening...Kanye was moving away from his roots and his music, especially his lyrics, were moving more towards that of other rappers.  More songs about himself, money, women, and a bunch of expletives to boot.  Regardless, I bought MBDTF, hoping it was a lyrical misstep due to some events in Kanye's personal life at the time.<br /><br />Enter Yeezus.<br /><br />Well, my fears about his lyrics have manifested on this album.  Kanye has fallen off.<br /><br />Like many other reviewers on here, this \\"music\\" isn't fun to listen to.  The messages are harsh and angry, and oftentimes feel entirely displaced since Kanye has become such a successful artist.  With every album however, I always give it more than one listen.  I never let myself play an album once, make a final judgement, then never replay it.  So this one got about 4-5 spins, because quite frankly that's all I could handle.  After the first listen there weren't really any tracks that I immediately wanted to listen to again...maybe, MAYBE Black Skinhead.  The subsequent listens didn't get any better.  After hearing all the chatter about how great it was to bump in the car, I gave that a try, but I found myself skipping most of the album and turning it down when driving near others (because lets face it, listening to this \\"music\\" in your late 20s is embarrassing).  The rapping here is bad.  The production is messy.  The flow is...well, non-existent.  The content is...pretty much on-par with most other rap albums.<br /><br />Avoid this album.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|actually fell asleep.  i watched it again for a while but then turned it off,  waste of time and money
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Love the album and would recommend it.  Be warned that there are a few F-bombs, which you need to know if your kids (or in my case) grandkids are in the car. Upbeat and perfect to play on a warm, summer day.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The graphics are great and it is very challenging.  It is frustrating because the character gets killed a lot.  I wish the game would give you a slow motion until you get used to it and maybe a map of where you are going.  But, it is a lot of fun and you get a laugh when the character gets eaten.  Worth the money.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|it is so relaxing to have this playing while reading or to go to bed to.  great sound choices and mixing functionality.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|when we catch. the squral can get the nut too....the dinasurs are way to pricey ......need an easier way to make friends on there...
B00785P2QC|5.0|Will tell friends about this game. I don't find many games I can play this is a<br />Cool game for everyone
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Compelling story line, in which the reader is never sure where it is heading until the unexpected ending.  A real psychological thriller.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so fun. The level causes you to think. It is very entertaining! The gameplay is truly amazing! This game is a must get and a great way to past the time. The app is very smooth. Looking for more apps by this creator!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|The action was good the story line was a little weak.  The past die hard movies took place on US home ground and would have been better had it been done in the US rather than in Russia The movie seemed to be short on action scenes.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am totally addicted to this totally additive game. from the first time I played it I have been hooked. Love it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|When I first opened this app, I tried to create a kik account, but it kept stopping  unexpectedly. This happened at least four times. I'm not sure what to do, but I will try to see if it will work again. Sorry I had to give such a bad review. :(
B007REV4YI|5.0|This Bond movie was excellent. I liked the twists and turns as well as how it stayed close to the concept. At first I was a little afraid to watch it when I heard that Heineken had bought a spot in there, making that his new drink. NOT So! We still get to see James Bond have his martini shaken not stirred
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Shadow of the colossus was my favorite game growing up, and to see it remastered and to be able to play it in 3D is beyond nostalgic.<br />The game is designed like a symphony. Even the silence on the way to each colossus creates the suspense that crescendos into the full orchestra's epic melody as you are desperately holding onto the creature's back for your life, with sword in hand like a conductors baton, ready to signal the final curtain for this work of art.<br /><br />ICO was good too.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|Didn't get a chance to see the new movie.  I really enjoyed this older movie with a young Mia Farrow, Bruce Dern, and Robert Redford
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Game was fun but you only get 8 free levels and its harder than I thought it would be,I had to cheat on you tube. I don't plan on buying it which I buy a lot of games not fun enough for me. If you really like these kind of games you might pay but not me there's plenty of games like it for free.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Was in the mood for something light and entertaining and could make me laugh.  I am 72 years old so it has been some time since I was pregnant, but some things you never forget.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|The game is great, the bubbles go where they are aimed and it has a lot of interesting features, but if you fail at any level you get sent back to level one and start all over. I would prefer to be able to keep trying at the level I failed. If I fail at level 14 I have to start over at level one and play thirteen games to get another shot at level fourteen. That has kind of soured me on the game.
1742200508|5.0|I love the Lonely Planet guides. I was turned on to them by a friend of mine who travels the world and always gets a LP guide to wherever she goes. At this point, the collection of these attests to her travel history. So I got this book as a present to my parents, who are going to England. She LOVED it. She got uber excited about the fold-out maps, and the super specific suggestions about places to visit -- the when, what, how, why, and where of *everything*. Full-on 5 stars!
B0064MGU98|4.0|Good show.  Good acting.  Fun to watch.  There is better, but there is much worse.  I've enjoyed it.  Hope you do too.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|As with any good sci-fi, this show had many of its roots in solid science.  I have never been a huge fan of the genre, but I am truly enjoying this. My only regret is that I discovered it only after it was canceled.<br /><br />The characters are really original, and there is much humor to be found amidst the action, drama, and pathos.<br /><br />Almost finished with Season 4, I shall have to take the final season slowly so that I may savor it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am getting reintroduced to sci-fi and wow, what a great choice Wool was. I couldn't put the Silo Saga down. I have downloaded the rest of the series and will anxiously await Dust, the final book in the series this summer.
B00B37ET42|5.0|I've only read a few Fitzgerald books, although I've read many other authors of the time.  This was a great look at the period.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Howey unfolds an imaginative plot line like the petals of a flower.  He has refreshed the post apocalyptic genre with this creation. Highly recommended.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|A great family movie that allows adults to enjoy the gaming references and children the fun plot line and animation.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I loved DISNEY'S NEMO movie and this app is a lot of fun!  It is unique especially for younger children, it is great for small muscle and hand-eye coordination!
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|I liked &#34;OZ The Great and Powerful&#34;, the visuals were stunning. The storyline was OK, but overall I had mixed feelings at the end of the film. This is definitely not for young children. Even though there were some &#34;cute&#34; moments in the film, some of the scenes would have a negative impact on the impressionable young. This film is much darker than the old musical film &#34;The Wizard of OZ&#34; that most of us grew up with. There were many OZ books in the series and a potential for more films being made. If you like fantasy films, you should make the trip to OZ with this one.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I am a horror fan totally  when I watched this movie I was alone up until now I won't ever do that again everything about this movie is perfection it is must. See and a must have am patietly waitin for part two and all I can. Say is omg am so so ready for it at least I think I am please enjoy everyone
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|Got a real kick out of the movie. I am a long time fan of Barbara Streisand and enjoy watching her perform. Light hearted movies are hard to come by these days. What passes for comedy is often either vulgar or silly...sometimes both. For me, this movie was neither.....it was just very funny. At the end of the film I was left me with a smile on my face.  That rates a four star review for me.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This movie is so wonderfully crafted. The acting, the directing, the cinematography, the music all put you into Poland during World War 2. It beautifully depicts one of the most horrific tragedies of our human history and reveals how a human heart cannot help be affected by the people around it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for anyone, but parents should be cautious because there is violence and some nudity. It's a little cliche, but I believe that, &#34;those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.&#34; This is a piece of our past that should never be repeated, and therefore must be remembered.
B002WY65W4|1.0|The digital copy included in this product has expired by over 15 months.  It gets one star due to the false advertisement.  Shame on you Amazon!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I started reading this book only that I wanted to read it. Once I started I couldn't stop reading. I'm ready for the next book to see how Katniss is going to handle the next phase after winning the Hunger games.
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoyed watching all the epidodes. Can't wait for the next episode. I would recommend this show for sci-fi or action movie lovers.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini does again what he did so well in his other books -- chronicles an Afghani family's march through several generations capturing each member's humanity. The novel is interesting, joyful, heartbreaking, kind, cruel, and very plausible.
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Although, I have liked the past \\"Die Hard\\" films, I bought this one for my husband, who loves watching Bruce Willis action movies.  I cannot tell you how disappointed we both were, but especially my husband.  This \\"Die Hard\\" should be in a category by itself, it's sooooo awful.  You sort of know it's gonna be bad, right at the beginning, with terrible graphics.  Then, there's no plot to speak of, which really screws up the whole movie.  We're not talking about award winning plots, here; when we say \\"plot\\" we mean even the faintest semblance of a plot, just to hold the thing together....just to give you some structure to relate to.  As a result, this terrible movie is just one long chase scene after another for the whole time (where you don't know why they're doing this or where they're going, or where this is all leading to)......plus the camera work is very bad, the lighting is bad, all of the acting is bad, no directing to speak of.  Bruce Willis must have needed the money, to agree to appear in such a piece of junk.<br /><br />My husband finally could not stand it and we turned it off and threw it out.  We haven't seen such a 100% waste of time and money.  Even if you love Bruce Willis, you will not love this.<br /> The one final word for this is B O R I N G ..... Get the DVD for \\"Jason\\" instead.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|Between work and home, I have so many passwords to remember that it can make life difficult at times.  This AP is great and works great, too.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Great intertainment! This show is highly addictive. I'm glad I can watch episodes one after another and not have to wait the normal time between episodes during the season.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I was not sure if I was going to like this but I discovered that it is very interesting.  It is definitely different than the shows you see on TV but it is BETTER.
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Love it Love it Great movie Arnold rocks & Johnny Knoxville rules!!! Great action flick brings back memories of 80s action flicks that I loved.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book and felt there were many lessons interwoven in the book that would speak to any age reader.  It is a subtle and warm telling of the problems our kids face (no pun intended) with trying to fit in and be &#34;normal&#34;
B00CW665VI|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised because I have never read anything by this author.  All the characters were funny and engaging, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a true romantic!
B007SGM084|4.0|I was apprehensive when purchasing this trilogy because of all the hype about the &#34;kinky sex&#34; and even heard some refer to it as &#34;porno&#34; but I have been pleasantly surprised that it isn't that. Yes, there are some sex scenes that go beyond &#34;vanilla.&#34; The story line is wonderful and intriguing. I couldn't wait to get up each day and see how Christian and Ana were going to grow their relationship and their individual selves. Great read!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I had thought that Daniel Craig was starting to look a little old to play James Bond when I saw the previews for this film. I was right but that was kind of the point. A more mature James handling change and the mistakes of the past with the aplump that you expect from 007. Well worth the rental and fun to watch. From the technical side, I have about a 10.5 mbs coverage and that is over WiFi to my PS3. There were no issues streaming this movie whatsoever. The quality of both sound and picture were excellent.
B005I64U5C|5.0|Green Lantern (Two-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray)  Great!! I love this one so much....Service is great and I got it as excate date. Love it!!
B005VMSATA|3.0|Maybe it was just the fact that I had heard through the grapevine how awful this movie was. Overall there are big holes in the plot and charaters that don't need to be there. Also the fact that they were trying way to hard to set up a sequel. But the acting was passable and the effects were good. Although this is no X-Men or even Iron Man 3 it was an okay movie and not bad for a $3.00 rental.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Jurassic Park (3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)  Great!! I love this one so much....Service is great and I got it as excate date. Love it!!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Great series will watch again soon. Great acting and plot. The actors were really great and you never know what to expect from beginning to end
B00AEFYX4U|5.0|Rango [Blu-ray]  Great!! I love this one so much....Service is great and I got it as excate date. Love it!! Love it!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show is fantastic! Best show I've seen in a very long time. Tatiana Maslany truly deserves an emmy for her brilliant performance.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I happened upon this by accident and am now hooked!  It reminds me so much of the X-Files, of which I was an addict, that I can't wait to come home and watch another episode.  I am already on season 2 and plan to continue watching all seasons available.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Great historical fiction! It held my attention from beginning to end. I am a fan of all Ken Follett's books.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Despite some pacing issues due the complexity of adapting George R.R. Martin's books, GAME OF THRONES is for sure one of the best TV shows ever made. Acting, casting, dialogues, locations and art direction are top notch. The show is unlikely any fantasy show ever made. And finally fantasy is being shown as a adult, thought provoking genre. GAME OF THRONES is already a classic to be viewed and reviewed over the next decades.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|As a novelist, I closely listen to the lyrics, how one crafts the words to engage the listener of a song or the reader of a book.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|Perfectly spun and wonderfully suspenseful. The characters pull you along through a plot with twists that you never expect to see coming.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|As I novelist, it's never too late to tell your story in song and in book print. Each of us has several stories to tell, to inspire others.
B0020VKZ4I|5.0|The songstress sneaks in and envelopes you with the mood of each song.  Her voice is amazing and her performance is, too.  Sing on!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This is so long and sometimes tedious; however it is fascinating. Everyone should give it a go and plow thru it.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|When I ordered this app I thought it was compatible with my Kindle Fire HD....<br />Unfortunately it wasn't,  none the less to my surprise it works great on my smart phone!  The loss of one star is for not being compatible with my Kindle Fire.  I do recommend this app for any smart phone with  the Android operating system!  :)
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Not able to finish this and I almost never leave a book un read. Not a book for me. End
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere solidified Neil Gaiman as one of my favorite fiction authors. I've always been a fan of fantasy, but I strayed away from it b/c so much is just ridiculously terrible, but Neverwhere re-kindled the fire for me.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|More than a review for the music, these five stars belong to Amazon's digital platform. Unlike major competitors for my digital dollar, Amazon makes sure I can listen to my purchases on all my devices. MP3s are so preferred for their universality.<br /><br />On this particular purchase, Amazon sent me the CD, allowed immediate download, and then gave me a dollar credit. Do that at iTunes sometime.
B004VFN72S|5.0|Chilling, well-acted thriller. Harry Connick reeked of psychopathy. Holly Hunter as usual  became the character, & Sigourney Weaver was fantastic as the haunted profiler. Enjoyed the nuances in minor characters' relationships.Get ready  to be on edge.
B005HSL626|4.0|I got this so my great-niece can play it when she comes to visit.  I play it, but I think I'm too old to do it well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game. Super addictive. Not too short. Great value. Pretty much everything I was looking for in a puzzle game. Really peaceful and relaxing background and music.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Arrow is a fun action packed series. All the elements of a Super Hero and a touch of the now makes it more believable.
B0094LYBT2|5.0|A movie with a powerful storyline, surely to bring you to tears of sorrow, and tears of joy, Courageous is a call to men to be the fathers that God intends them to be.  This movie, although not filled with big name actors, is very well acted, with believable characters, and ones who demonstrate clearly the type of men God calls us to be.  I'm not a crying person usually, when it comes to movies, but even on the second viewing the tears could not be held back.  The storyline is very touching, and the characters win their way into your hearts.  The Kendrick brothers know how to deliver the message in a way that will spur you to action.  Wholeheartedly I can recommend this movie.  And to think, the drama and suspense was portrayed without the use of any foul language, yet without affecting the feeling of realism.  Who would have thought it?
030758836X|5.0|The first half of the book was great, I couldn't put it down.  The second half was good, it dragged a bit but still made me want to keep reading, to see how it all ended up.  All in all, a good read, and a very surprising one, too.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love this show, we re-watch it over and over. The characters are great, the overarching story is great, and something fun and new happens every episode. Stargate Atlantis does a wonderful job of presenting a new setting and characters while giving nods back to the original show along the way.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I can't stop watching this show its so interesting similar with dowton abbey in a different way !!<br />All the drama and the character, nothing to complain about.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Very entertaining.  It played a little loose with Fitzgerald's plot, but the acting was fabulous (except Redford was too wooden).  Enjoyable party scenes during which I learned more about the Charleston than my mother showed me.  I loved the twins.  Costuming was beautiful.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I liked enough after watching only a couple of episodes,  I bought the entire season, cant wait to finish the season.
0525953728|5.0|Great read. Thanks for taking the time to write the story as accurately as possible as a first-hand account. All SEALs are dedicated and committed people providing a blanket of security to all free men, women and children around the world.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. Loveable characters, decent story plot and easy to read. For a quick short read,  it was surprisingly good.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Dislikes: you only have so many chances then you need to wait till the time is up before you get more lives.  Other wise I'm hooked!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|cant wat for more levels completed all of them in a few hours this  evening ..hope they get more soon
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I love this album plus I got a free complete album download to my Amazon Cloud player! What a deal!
B005LAJ212|5.0|Amazing writers, suspenseful episodes, gorgeous location, fashion, and decor.  I love all the characters! Every episode is like a finale!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|So much easier to check out the battery life than the way I use to . I love just having to glance at my screen.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was disappointed- the beginning was interesting but as the story line progressed it dragged and I found myself being forced to continue- it doesn't hold a candle to the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns-
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game. It's a great way to kill time. BUT. It only had 10 doors to open. If it weren't for that ,I would have given it 5 stars. This is an app I would pay for if it had more levels.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Great easy movie to watch. Very entertaining and gave a new twist to the whole zombie epidemic scene. I loved it.
B009CF3P7E|4.0|I admit I had low expectations going to see this movie but it was really enjoyable.  One of the better movies we saw in the last year or so.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I didn't even know they made an app for amazon.com. You can get other apps from the app store also.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's like a lawyer version of House with a second brilliant character and a lot of firm internal politics. Definitely looking forward to the third season starting in July.
0143123173|5.0|Excellent book by Craig Johnson. I LOVE this whole series and every book has been wonderful!! These books are very entertaining.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Jewels Star is a typical game of matching 3 jewels to score points. What I love is the variety of games offered, with a variation on the theme of matching 3 jewels. Playing the same game over and over can get boring, but Jewels Star has many different challenges to keep you interested for quite a while!
076781326X|1.0|This is a total rip-off!  I only got half of the movie!  Do not purchase!  Totally dissatisfied!  I was really excited to watch the whole movie that I remember from my childhood but no such luck!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun game, can not put it down, love games like this, it challenges you, super fun, fun, great time waster
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I was not aware that you needed to be in the Facebook hive in order to play the rest of the game. I can only play the tutorials.  I think it need to make it clear that this is for Facebook users.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I have read other of Ken Follett's works and was not disappointed with this novel.  I thought the character were interesting and I enjoyed the &#34;history lesson.&#34;  I will read the next book in this series at some point since I know I will not be disappointed.
1478978082|5.0|I like all of Michael Connelly's books. He never fails to deliver a good story and interesting characters. Buy it.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Have to be careful what i say here... Afterall fans of this movie already know the first rule of Fight Club....
B004J4WLB4|3.0|Diffenbaugh has a catchy writing style that allows one to read this book with ease.  The prose flows as a great novel should, however I was not intrigued by the story.  I think she should incorporate a bit more intellectual rationale in her character's decision process, rather than stating outcomes for no apparent reason. I am interested to see how her next novels progress.
B00013RC8O|4.0|Not the easiest film to follow by any means. Also keep in mind this film does have nudity so keep that in mind when you sit down to watch it. Also make sure you dont even bother with the newer remake version of this. It is a tragedy and an injustice compared to the classic.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I thought this movie would be decent and pretty good but it actually was amazing and perfect in about every way possible. First of all, this is the best idea ever! It's like, how was this not thought of before? The whole movie is really clever and filled with one-liners and hilariously gratuitous violence. The characters are original and deep and all of them are equally badass in their own way.<br /><br /> Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton are both top notch actors and both shined every second that they were on the screen. The acting, the story, the dialogue and the soundtrack were all flawless there's not a single thing that could have been changed for the better.<br /><br />I'm not sure what movie the critics saw but they must have walked into the wrong theater or something because this was a fantastic movie.
014312093X|5.0|This is a fantastic novel, if you enjoy espionage, thrillers, and even if you don't I believe that you will love this book.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Man of Steel truly could not have been a more perfect Superman man movie. From start to finish this movie is edge of your seat intense and at moments bordering on the terrifying. From someone who is typically not a fan of the majority of Superman comics or of any of the movies in the past this one blew me away.<br /><br />The special effects are the best available, the storyline is fluid and thick, the dialogue is natural and the acting is award worthy.Henry Cavill is the best Superman, everything about him is an exact representation. Michael Shannon as Zod was overpowering and every scene with him held a terrifying tension.<br /><br />It's really hard to go into any details without giving anything away but this is as revolutionary of a super hero movie as The Dark Knight and is right there in its quality. If you haven't yet you need to go see this as soon as possible.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. I am looking forward to more levels being added. Challenging but not so hard that it is frustrating.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I enjoy this show but there are so many things to nit pick. Does anyone else recognize zombies that were killed in previous episodes? Sometimes I'll even see the same one within the same episode that was killed in an earlier scene. It's been over a year since the beginning of this, I think it's time for the zombies to start decaying and falling apart. They are infected with some virus, they aren't magic.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Good entertaining movie - not too deep, good plot, easy to watch, kinda like a graphic novel - look forward to the sequel
B003Y5USF0|5.0|Great Movie, I've seen it before but wanted my kids to see it. I will watch it again some day.
B0051T46XM|5.0|Denne filmen er en stor mockumentary. Viser noen av det vakre landskapet i Norge, klarer den å blande fantastisk troll lore til en sammenhengende og underholdende film. Jeg elsker å rainbow flip. Takk.
0071636080|5.0|Love it! Great tips to be on the road to be a great presenter, no matter what the subject. I think an college that teaches public speaking shouid use this as part of theoir reading.
B00A2H9LK6|3.0|an honest attempt at being as rad as the first one... the actors are just so bad though that it takes away from the movie, particularly the guy.  Still it had the feel of the first one that i loved so i do like it
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ends kind of suddenly, but a great read - I really liked it! Hoping there are more bookis in this series...
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  A unique story, well-told.  I loved the ending, it caused me to lay the book down, gaze off into space and ponder what I'd just read...with a little smile on my face. : )  Very sweet in an oddball sort of way.
B002R1Q8RO|3.0|Carl Hiaasen is one of my favorite authors. I've read most of his books more than once. He's very funny skewering the corrupt politicians, real estate developers, etc., of Florida, he's a champion of the environment, and the endings are always very satisfying. The book STRIPTEASE is no exception. The movie falls quite flat by comparison, which is surprising given the number and size of the bosoms in it. I suppose if you were a thirteen year old boy you'd give it five stars. I gave it three because the cast is very good, but that's the best I can manage.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this set because my 9 year old wanted it.  He claimed he could read it easily....not so.  He read a minute and closed it.  I guess its too difficult for A 9 year old.  Well, the books will be here when he is ready.  All in all, a good purchase.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The end caught me totally surprised. I knew the power field would play a part in their escape but the conclusion was a bit of a stretch. Still a good read and very hard to find a place to stop reading daily. I finished book one and it took me three day to do part2. I'm on kindle so  I'm about to download #3 . Here we go again!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very interesting plot and turn of events. Definitely didn't want to put it down. You can envision this really happening.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great effects speed of the game scenarios changing daily challenges to motivate you are a lot more than the first game. Enjoy it a lot
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. But if your memory is not really great you may need to keep notes to insure you don't forget the order of things you see.
B009I0QTF8|5.0|Amazon, how you get so fluffy? I mean, I ordered this and expected to wait over a billion years, but instead of becoming extinct like the dinosaurs you sent me this sucker within milliseconds. If I had a gold medal, you'd get 10.
B00CUWKHVI|5.0|Jamie Cullum's jazzy genius meets the world of pop, while still maintaining his artistic style that I love.  Tons of great songs on this album.  Buy it!  You won't regret the purchase.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is really fun because not only do you have to figure out a way to feed Om Nom but also his cute little ancestors from the renaissance, stone age, the time of pirates, Greek Times, and more! With each new time period comes a new special button or control, which you must use to pass the level for example the freeze button in which you use to freeze time. This game is another great addition to the Cut The Rope series! It is definitely worth a buck.
B00CWV8X04|2.0|I was looking forward to a thriller with an exciting plot twist.  I found this slow & figured out the twist about 20 mins in.<br />Spolier:<br /><br />If you are a fan of Channing Tatum, you'll be very unhappy about his early departure in this film.
B005LUJWMG|2.0|I love Ken Folletts books. They are gripping and written in such a way that I find it hard to put them down after starting - even the long historical novels ( especially those). Unfortunately this book does not live up to the usual standards - I was happy to put it aside for later... I tried that several times.. And ended up giving up halfway through the book.
B000063DFQ|5.0|In my opinion, along with \\"Powerslave\\", this is the ultimate Iron Maiden's masterpiece. \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" is a song that you will find yourself playing over and over again, and again and again ! It's that addictive. \\"Flight of Icarus\\", \\"Revelations\\" and \\"The Trooper\\" are classics. And \\"To Tame a Land\\" is a successful progressive metal song, if that term means something at all.
6305358613|4.0|I was hoping for a complete film cradle-to-grave of Elizabeth's life, but at the very least, this film helped to set dates and names into my mind as to who the major players were, and what they did, and how Elizabeth responded.  It's a riveting film.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy Mahjong and find it challenging. I just wish there were more of them within the game. Overall I really like it.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|&#34;And yet what must strike any [21st] century reader who follows the course of the summer crisis of 1914 is its raw modernity. It began with a squad of suicide bombers and a cavalcade of automobiles. Behind the outrage at Sarajevo was an avowedly terrorist organization with a cult of sacrifice, death and revenge; but this organization was extra-territorial ... ; it was scattered in cells across political borders, it was unaccountable, it's links to any sovereign government were oblique, hidden and certainly difficult to discern from outside ....&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Sleepwalkers&#34; examines the question of how  ww1 came about. While not  inseparable, &#34;how&#34; is different than &#34;why&#34;:  here, &#34;how&#34; addresses the sequence of interactions between individual and institutional actors, while &#34;why&#34; seeks out &#34;remote and categorical causes: [e.g.,] imperialism, nationalism, ...&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Sleepwalkers&#34; thesis is that the how is complex, involves a lack of transparency in state decision making (both between states and within governments), and - perhaps above all- &#34;narratives that structured perceptions and motivated behavior.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Sleepwalkers&#34; is very accessible to the serios reader interested in how the war came about. The text is engrossing: the analysis is fascinating. it also must be said that it is slow-going: the analysis is rich and complex, requiring substantial time for reflection to appreciate the richness and comprehend the complexity. The intellectual rewards of taking that time are well worth the effort involved.
0553801473|5.0|Beautiful coverege!!! Easy to read because of printing. Can't wait to start reading. Now I'm reading book # 2!!! My favorite books!!!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This was the best season so far to date. The last couple of episodes on this season was fantastic!!!! My favorite episode was the introduction of Death! The way he stepped out of that car & strolled down the sidewalk with his cane (in slow motion) was EPIC!!!!!! I was shocked how the season ended....but I'm not going to spoil it for the ones who haven't watched this season yet!!!
0345529057|5.0|Love it! I can't stop reading!!! I'm going to take  one of the books on my long trip, can't wait to read all 4 books.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|You need to stop reading every couple of pages due to your laughing out loud. Great, great, book, highly recommend it.
B00C061HZY|4.0|I'm a huge Daft Punk fan, and their new album Random Access Memories was absolutely stunning. I heard the preview on itunes, and knew I needed the Vinyl edition.<br /><br />When it came, it was shrink wrapped in plastic, and the inside cover art was very nice. However, after storing the records in the paper sleeves for a few days, it still caught some dust. The paper sleeves was kind of cheap for packaging, but I'm looking in to getting some sillicone sleeves to remove that problem. Other than that, after a good cleaning, the record works great!
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|I love Superman, and have since I was a boy. This toy is pretty much exactly what I expected, a traditional, nothing fancy, action figure. It is durable, and I bought this for my 3 year old a few weeks ago and its still in one peice. Thats saying something, considering my boys energy! We threw a big party, and I found alot of the party supplies at  www.superman.awestores.com for cheaper. Just thought Id throw that in there in case there was someone else looking :) Hope this helps! As a parent I gave it 3 stars overall, but my boy would probably give it a 5, as he always plays with it! So if its for a kid, its a good bet!
B00C061I3K|4.0|This album has a style unlike most of what Daft Punk have done before, so anyone who like me is a big fan of their previous stuff should be a bit cautious before buying. Having said that, I really enjoyed this album, some of the tracks are going to stay on my playlists for years.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I absolutely adore Sponge Bob and always wanted a baby Gary!  He is really cute and a perfect size. I am 56 and have Sponge Bob everything.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Decided to go out of my normal genre and chose this classic. I don't regret it one bit, I definitely wouldn't mind reading this again!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Has awesome beats and keeps my head bobbing for hours! Can't wait for another album to come out! Only wish the tracks were a little longer.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is an awesome site for people to connect to friends and make some friends. I have school and most of my friends have moved away or went to a different school but they have Facebooks so I can talk to them all I want. this site also has games, videos, and funny pictures too. and the last thing you can do is like and dislike comments and follow other websites that you like. for instance, you can like think geek.com and dislike the grilled cheese truck.  therefore it is an awesome website that you can do multiple things on
B009NY43NY|1.0|While mildly entertaining, it seems like this book was rushed. This was definitely a huge disappointment especially because it is the last book. I have been a huge fan of these books over the years and this one just left me wanting more. There really wasn't any type of satisfying conclusion, she just quickly and sloppily tied up a couple of loose ends but it mostly left you wondering. The plot wasn't that great either! Not her best book that's for sure!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Works good, but sometimes has wrong hrs left. It. Said I had four days left on my Blundell instead of four hours.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! So much fun somethin to do wen I'm bored! Awesome places to go n win prizes. One thing I Hate is you have b gifted some prizes
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|I can add my voice to all the others-- can't say enough of how wonderful she is.  She is someone to watch and savor for years to come.  We are blessed to have such talented artists among us.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I ran WPP China as WPP China CEO.  I worked my way up and had to fight off many speculations, doubt, criticism of my devotion to my career, my accomplishment and my choice.  I echoed everything Ms Sandberg raised in the book.  A very inspiring read.  While reading the book, I'm thinking of starting a initiative of \\"WPP Women\\" in China to engage with women leaders in WPP group in China to raise the awareness of gender equality and encourage of more \\"lean in\\" among our female colleagues.  Wish me luck!!!
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I can't get the people to work under me to use decimals for portions of an hour on their timesheets. This calculator makes my task go a little faster.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Every episode has a great story, cast works together nicely, contains humor, drama, emotion, and the interaction between Ziva and Tony is interesting. You get done with one episode and you want to start the next and you are entertained. The last episode has me waiting to see the start of the next season.<br />Anyone that enjoys crime drama will like NCIS season 10.
B00AK57N00|1.0|I didnt like it.  Not my style of game.  Maybe someone else might like it more than I did. I uninstalled.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I am definitely one of the many who thinks Firefly was ended much too early. Great writing mixed with awesome actors make for a fun and fantastic story that will provide lots of entertainment. Space Cowboys are fun when given this cast and crew.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Rare movie on a giant whom could go toe toe with thomasedison and others peers of his time..good viewing see it
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I really enjoyed watching Dr. Who. The ready relationships and great actors that play the roles help create a great and fun series to watch. Great watch for anyone that enjoys Sci-fi/Fantasy shows.
B00BI745AA|1.0|if you've never seen the stage production you might be able to barely tolerate the &#34;high school musical&#34; vocals. Crowe and Cohen just plain suck
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It was better than the kite runner, but not as good as s thousand splendid suns. Sometimes it was confusing at the beginning of chapters because I didn't know which character was talking but I enjoyed that. It's exciting to try and figure it out.
B000HL09MG|5.0|watched this movie again after many years and I found it so much better the i first thought. Nicole Kidman is fantastic and is the driving force moving the plot forward.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was really enjoying  playing this game until the update. My game wouldn't load anymore so I had to uninstall and reinstall and start all over again so I wasn't happy
B007UZO3F6|5.0|I purchased the SZ77R5 on 6-17-2012, and the unit I received did not have the updated bios to support Ivy Bridge cpu's. Fortunately I had a 2500K Sandy on hand and was able to flash it without having to contact Shuttle support for an updated bios chip. I currently run the following:<br /><br />i5 3570K<br />16GB Corsair DDR3<br />EVGA GTX670 FTW<br />Samsung 840 Pro 256GB SSD<br />Asus DVDRW<br />Win 7 Ult<br /><br />Some people have had issues with the power connectors on top of \\"full length\\" graphics cards. It's definitely a tight fit between the power connector and the bottom of the removable drive chassis, but it is not crimping the cables. I was having an issue with the system halting during POST when I had my WD USB 3.0 ext hdd connected to the front or rear USB 3.0 ports. I had the SSD as the first boot device, but it didn't resolve the issue until I disabled the usb boot option.<br /><br />The only con is the noise that emits from the psu and the 50mm fan. It's not overbearing, but it is audible in a quiet room. Overall I am thoroughly pleased with the XPC.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|If you've followed the series this long, it's because you just want to see how it ends.  It accomplishes that goal.  It's a page-turner as you go, but it isn't really a legitimate &#34;payoff&#34; for the time spent on the series up until now.  To be fair, it couldn't be, considering how much time that's been and how large a payoff-deficit the last few of Mr. Jordan's books have been.<br /><br />Lots of threads for more books in the Wheel of Time universe, if there proved to be such a market.  Starting over in the world we readers have surveyed, at excessive length at times, might be appealing.  A chance to start with new characters might be a good one.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|This is a traditional Jack Reacher-type of novel, with several challenging twists. As often happens with the Reacher series, Lee Child provides several philosophical issues to leave the reader to ponder long after the thrill of the basic mystery has waned.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A wonderful story that keeps you reading.  I didn't want to put it down.  This book sucked me in right away.  It's a book I will not soon forget.
B00559BSXO|4.0|This is one of the best Box Sets I have ever bought.<br />I love Elvis Presley music and songs.  The best!
B00C061HZY|4.0|A testament to Daft Punk's love of yacht rock and disco, this album has some sensational analogue club hits. The mixture of talent on the record easily makes it not only a wonderful DP album but a record you can listen to over and over without it having the nasty taste of &#34;produced in 2013&#34; written all over it. The sound is amazing and the irresponsible love they have for this period in music really shines.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love the fact it makes you think and I'm so addicted already. great game. I cant seem to put the game down haha
B001FXCE46|4.0|This is an amazing and mysterious record to me. I think you could re-arrange the track list and you wouldn't notice because of some homogenous sounds but it is infinitely enjoyable. You can get burnt out on it if you aren't careful.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a wonderful app. You can use your account here to sign in with other networks. So you don't have a bunch of account with tons of passwords that you can't remember. Many famous people,companies, and organizations are on here so you will be able to connect with many different people. Best of all you can this app for free.
B00544L9EI|5.0|Royce and Eminem are not only complimentary, when combined they are invincible. The playful nature of their potty mouthed rhymes catch you off guard as they slide in simple commentary. Two very talented writers and rhyme slayers not only elevate the music but their matched delivery and camber really heightens the listenability of the record.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great free game to pass the time and to take your mind off the day. The graphics are good and the play keeps you wanting to play more..
B001XUT6AG|4.0|It's a great movie. This and Wrath of Kahn are the best films that the original Star Trek cast have made. The plot is easy and fun, there are a lot of cool effects when the Klingon ambassador is killed, the cast of great supporting actors (all in klingon attire) makes the film even more watchable.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|The style of the movie reminds me of Vanhelsing but the story is a great reproduction of the children's fairy tale. I love Gretel and Hansele and how kick but they are together. They know what they are doing I also love Edward he's such a cool troll and honestly before I found out what happened I thought he was some one else.
B005TKD8ZK|5.0|Haven't quite finished this yet, its the kind of book that i like to to dip in and out of. As a person who has only relatively recently rejoined the running community after a 25 year hiatus, i am finding this book quite the inspiratiion. Murakami has beatifully written a book about his relationship with running and its impact on his writing.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Not much in the way the scripts were written. The acting wasn't great either. I watched it for about 50 minutes & just couldn't get into it. Nothing like &#34;The Wizard of Oz,&#34; not even close.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Cannot beat book 3, and the introduction of these new characters were a bit confusing as I loved the &#34;original&#34;, but a good read nonetheless.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Would be more fun using a controller I think, but I enjoy it none the less.  It is a fun concept and eating humans is always funny.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|The major problem with this app is that you cannot print directly from a web page. You have to type in the web address into eprint to print the page. Good luck remembering the address of the page you want to print
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved reading this book so much that, when I finished I started back up again. You cannot help but falling in love with Travis and Pidge. It's the kind of love you hope to find in life. The story was so beautifully written, the characters were so relatable and the story sucks you right in. Everything about this book was lovable and I highly recommend it. I wish there would be more books like this. Absolutely fantastic read. Loved, loved, loved it!
B00BSO2U1Y|3.0|Forty or more years ago, NORMA was considered to be the most difficult of soprano roles. Only a handful of singers dared attempt it, and usually only after years of artistic maturing and preparation. Now, everyone wants to have a go at it. We have had big dramatic Wagnerian interpreters such as Gwyneth Jones and Alessandra Marc , light/bright voiced singers like Beverly Sills (Just around the time her illness was diagnosed, Arleen Auger was preparing to take on the title role!) , and mezzo-sopranos such as Grace Bumbry and Shirley Verrett taking a whack. Mezzo-Soprano Cecilia Bartoli has now joined the fray. Does she succeed? To the extent that she is never boring,yes !<br />Both her positive and negative traits are fully on display. She is an generous and engrossing interpreter, but her aspirates, her breathy coloratura, her choppy legato, her fiercely rolled \\"r\\"s and her explosive \\"p\\" sounds are very much in evidence. She gets a pass, but barely.<br />Sumi Jo as Adalgisa is in good voice considering the number of years she has been on the stage, and her bright sound suggests youth in suitable contrast to Bartoli's dark sound.<br />John Osborn who made a strong impression in the lyric role of the Duke in Halevy's CLARI is here over parted in a heroic role. (Similarly miscast as he was as Arnold in the recent EMI GUILLAUME TELL.) It is a lovely voice, but he is no Pollione.<br />Michele Pertusi, normally a highly reliable singer, is not in good voice here.<br />The real problem here is the conducting of Giovanni Antonini. Supposedly this is a return to the manuscript source materials for NORMA, yet the high speed conducting, full of explosive fortissimi is exactly what we have been told was alien to the Bel Canto composers. At these breakneck speeds, the music and the singers rarely get to breathe !<br />The sound recording is excellent. The book/album packaging is attractive, and some of the articles in support of a re-studied NORMA are interesting without being entirely convincing, but it is a pity that they couldn't have waited to include some of the photos from Bartoli's recent stage appearances in the title role.
B009GX69RK|5.0|made me laugh so much i love new girl one of the funniest shows ever! stop thinking about it and just buy it lol
1592537251|5.0|I am suspect to write about this book, since I am also an urban sketcher.<br />The collection of drawings and the structure of the book is inspiring and informative for<br />beginners and professionals.
