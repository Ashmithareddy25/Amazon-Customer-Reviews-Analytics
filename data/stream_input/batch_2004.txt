B004EBT5CU|1.0|Adele has the pipes, but the music is VERY derivative. There is not a single melody or phrase on this album that wasn't used about a trillion times in the 80's. I cannot stress enough how bad this album is. That it was given the best album of the year by Amazon's editors proves that their ratings are worthless and geared toward middle aged white women.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|My daughter reviewed this book.  Here is her Review:<br /><br />My best friend was telling me about this series a while back and so when I had the money, I finally purchased the first book. I like the idea of the steles and the runes and the magic; it's a pretty interesting concept. The few minor error s that marred the experience I had in reading this was that 1. My friend gave me a whole bunch of spoilers. And 2. The similes on every page. At least, that's how it looked. I know I counted three on one page alone.<br /><br />So, the good:<br />-Nice descriptions<br />-I was able to get sucked in, although all the similes kind of threw me<br />-it puts a sort of twist on a concept that's been around for a while, with many different takes of it done along the way.<br />-The characters were cool and for the most part believable.<br />-The tiny dash of humor was nice.<br /><br />Con:<br />-Too. Many. Similes!<br />-There were times when the situations weren't believable.<br />-Even without all the spoilers my best friend gave me, I probably would have seen the plot ' twists a long way off. I mean, who else reading this predicted that Simon had a crush on Clary?<br />-the incest factor. Yeah, I already know Clary and Jace aren't related, but still. For those who don't know til later, it can be kind of creepy.<br />-Not enough Magnus. I mean, he has a constant cameo through the book, but you only actually meet him twice. And as soon as I met him I loved him. And his cat is just too adorable.<br />-it was too hard to keep me sucked in all the time. It seemed too easy for real life to pull me away, and as such, it took me about a week to finish. I once read The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian in two hours. Now THAT was a good book<br /><br />It was with the con factors in mind that I decided to drop my rating by a star. It was still a good book, though. It's just not a favorite.

0375869026|5.0|This story is an interesting read for middle schoolers, promoting disability awareness, including physical identity issues and emotional strength as one forms disability-related identity.

B002LLE3Q8|4.0|When I was in high school I absolutely loved this album. While my peers were listening to Billy Squire and Pat Benetar, I was playing this. After all these years I decided to grab this 2 CD set...what really intrigued me was the outtakes. It seems that pretty much every available outtake/alternate was used here. I personally love how they added the BBC Sessions, even taking one of the tracks from an \\"upgraded bootleg source\\". All of them are very interesting to hear from a fan and collector's point of view. If you're a fan of this album then you really can't go too wrong with this, bonus tracks and all.<br /><br />The only reason I have to subtract a star is because both discs contain the exact same material...albeit the \\"2004\\" and \\"2009\\" remaster...which to my ears sounds EXACTLY THE SAME! And think about it, do we really need a new remastering every 5 years? Personally, I would have much rather the band fill up the second disc with more outtakes/live tracks. Speaking of which, this would have been the PERFECT place to put the complete Plumpton Racetrack Show from 1969! Since Fripp and Company seems to have no problem putting bootleg tracks out legitimately on their own label. To me it would be a great idea to put out that show rather than put out the same material twice, oh pardon me...remixed. (By the way, a friend of mine who's a huge Crimson fan told me that the band knows that the album sounds exactly the same, they just did it...well...to do it...and to fill up another disc).<br /><br />So yeah, wanted to give it 5 stars but they band fell just a bit short on this. Oh well, I guess I'll look forward to a 2014 \\"remaster\\" next.
B000W93CXQ|4.0|This book was really touching and makes me think differently about people in my life and to be more aware of the issues going on in the world. I think a teen would like this book the most. The only reason why I didn't taste it five stars is because I personally think some of the reasons in this book weren't legitimate even though I'm only she knows what she went through.

0765325950|5.0|I applaud Brandon Sanderson. To come into a series that he had read, and take over for an author who had poured a good chunk of his life into his own mythical universe must have been daunting indeed.<br /><br />Sanderson definitively shows three things in this novel: 1.) He is an ace at writing battle scenes and action scenes in general, 2.) he has a knack for writing that works on a thematic level, and 3.) he has real affection for the WOT universe. I find it hard to imagine anyone else taking over this series and doing it as well as BS did.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Not being disrespectful ( so dont jump my s***) but this was a highly funny slightly racist movie. But that was the point of the movie so they hit the hammer right on the nail. LOL<br /><br />VERY funny, jaw dropping movie (at times)- Enjoyed every moment of it.

And everytime i tell people this they get their panties in a bunch saying how im suppose to like captain america because i live in america. NOT! This movie was as bad as i pictured it. I almost fell asleep. It has its slow moments where you just want to break the TV, then right before you fall asleep the action picks up and your like &#34;OOOHHH interesting stuff....stay awake..&#34; I have nothing against captain america, its just in my opinion it could have been WAAAYYY better than it turned out to be.

B000LB0M8S|5.0|I got this fan to replace the noisy chipset fan on my Intel DX58SO motherboard. My fiance loved the quietness so much that she got one for her motherboard as well. Our office is so much quieter now, it's quite amazing just how loud those small OEM chipset fans can be as they were creating the most noise out of our computers. The fan is a direct replacement and fits perfectly with the given power adapter.

B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy was OUTSTANDING. Add I read all 3 in 2+ weeks - I realized this was an overwhelming task for me. Usually I bore and have been known to discard books prematurely.<br />Anyway, I recommend this reading not only for females but also for males. I will 're-read it starting tonight to my significant other - as HE WILL NOT READ IT ON HIS OWN.<br />IF I COULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE OFFICIAL MOVIE:  oh my!<br />Michael Ealy would make the perfect Christian Grey!<br />Can't wait for more books and the MOVIE!

B005WUHAX8|1.0|If I could give this less than a start I would.  This was returned promptly as it was not an official Lifeproof case, it was a knock-off.  The case felt cheap and not well-made, it failed the &#34;water test&#34; you are supposed to do, you couldn't take a picture through the cloudy lens for the camera, and it rattled when the phone rang like a poorly insulated trunk with a stereo system in it.  The serial numbers were unable to be verified as real with Lifeproof, so it could not be registered for any sort of warranty.  There are no authorized sellers of Lifeproof cases here, so buyers beware that they very well may not be real cases.  If you want to be sure get it directly from Lifeproof or check with their website on who authorized resellers are.

1434102750|5.0|This booklet (28 pages) was originally published in 1940 and some new material was added twenty years later. The Foreword to the edition I have (published by Waking Lion Press in 2009) was provided by William Bernbach (1911-1982), one-time chairman and CEO of what was Doyle Dane Bernbach, then renowned for many of the greatest ads in the 20th century. The booklet's author, James Webb Young (1886-1973), added a \\"Prefatory Note\\" in 1960. His first publication, How To Become An Advertising Man (1963), focuses on core concepts that every ad practitioner and copywriter should know:<br /><br />o Knowledge of Propositions<br />o Knowledge of Markets<br />o Knowledge of Messages<br />o Knowledge of Message Carriers<br />o Knowledge of Trade Channels<br />o Knowledge of How Advertising Works<br />o Knowledge of The Specific Situation<br /><br />Today, these core concepts continue to provide the \\"basics\\" on which all effective marketing depends when attempting to create or increase demand for the given product and/or service and multi-media advertising is without doubt advertising's most powerful resource. However, for at least the past 75 years, everything begins with a compelling idea.<br /><br />In A Technique for Producing Ideas, Webb offers what he characterizes as a \\"simple, five-step formula anyone can use to be more creative in business and in life! \\" Although the process itself is indeed simple, completing it to achieve the given results is a wholly different matter. Webb's focus is on the process by which to generate ideas. \\"They appear just as suddenly above the surface of the mind [like a lovely atoll above the surface of a deep blue sea]; and with that same air of magic and unaccountability. But the scientist knows that the South Sea atoll is the work of countless, unseen coral builders, working below the surface of the sea.\\" Keep in mind that Webb developed or encountered this insight decades ago.<br /><br />The details of the five-step \\"formula are best revealed in context, within the narrative. I will suggest now, however, that (a) this booklet is by no means relevant only to advertising or even to business in general, and (b) it can help almost anyone to develop more and better ideas when seeking a solution to a problem or an answer to a question. Because Webb thinks and writes so clearly, the booklet offers the additional benefit of helping its reader to reduce (if not eliminate) all the \\"clutter\\" in the mind that accumulates relentlessly over time.d in context, within the narrative.

0316069434|4.0|There is little joy in Harry Bosch's prosecution of the decades-old case that forms the centerpiece of \\"The Black Box.\\" Although he is, as always, determined in the face of pressures from above and below to achieve justice for the murder victim, both his character and Connelly's prose feel more than usually mechanical--driven by the facts of the case not by a passion for the job of detective or of writer. \\"The Black Box,\\" the title of the novel, is a case in point. Literally the phrase refers to a box of 3x5 cards on which officers took case notes, but in Bosch's mind it evokes the flight data box that provides the key to a crash. \\"The Black Box\\" becomes shorthand for the \\"one thing\\" that will bring the case together. But finally this feels like just an pretext for unifying the novel, as the clues come together from Bosch's patient mining of the evidence, not from a \\"black box\\" or single illuminating fact or insight. It's not an inspired title, but a sign of Connelly, like his detective, grinding it out; this is his title, and he is sticking with it.<br /><br />I did, however, really like the unique blend of past and present in the book, especially the setting of the original crime in the LA riots that surrounded the acquittal of the police officers who were tried for using excessive force in the beating of Rodney King. This setting allows Connelly to give us a glimpse of an earlier time when cops used different techniques (no computers to log evidence) and a younger, but recognizable Harry Bosch. He uses the racial tensions of that event in a creative way to cast light upon the present day as well (I won't be a spoiler here). Connelly is a great storyteller, and this juxtaposition of past and present is a worthy hook. But page to page, \\"The Black Box\\" is not his best book. It feels a little tired.

Dr. Alexanders book is different in that it provides scientific explanations and from a neurosurgeon/scientist explains that the experience was real yet cannot be proved via science! It's a profound story, a littlel technical, but it will change the way you look at your present life. I give it 5 stars!

1423124111|5.0|The Poster Art of the Disney Parks is a beautifully done hard cover book that contains full color posters from many different decades and from all of the Disney parks around the world.  Anyone who loves Disney can appreciate the amount of detail that goes into even simple seeming things such as these posters.  All of them are vividly printed, whimsical, and full of interesting details.<br /><br />The book is quite large in size so you're able to enjoy the posters without pressing the book up to your nose.  There is a nice introduction, a section on how the posters are printed, and short introductions for each section.<br /><br />I'd like to mention one word of caution, however.  Amazon seems to have a problem shipping this book undamaged.  Initially I couldn't even order the book from Amazon since it said that they were examining their shipping method since people were complaining.  When that advisory was lifted I ordered the book from Amazon expecting them to have gotten the shipping problem resolved, however the first copy I received was poorly boxed and as a result the book was damaged.  I called to get an exchange, and as usual Amazon was excellent about it, and the replacement book was perfectly packaged and arrived in pristine condition.<br /><br />All in all... exceptional and beautiful.

B007ZI06FE|4.0|I really liked this novel, though I agree with one of the other reviewers. This was more fantasy romance than steampunk. The main plot revolves around a woman falling in love with a vampire. The steampunk element is mostly background and a few references to mechanical police officers that aren't central to the story.<br /><br />This novel was well-plotted and kept me entertained throughout, however there were a couple of points that should be mentioned:<br /><br />Fans of supernatural romance will love this book, but Steampunk fans might be disappointed. This is a vampire story that happens to be set in the Victorian age. Personally I was a bit offended that vampirism was almost an exclusively male-dominated power. Women were not allowed to be infected, aside from one and she was a minor character who appeared twice. Bec McMaster also neglects to fully explain her concept of vampires in this novel. Blue Bloods are infected with the disease, but eventually the virus takes over and they turn into mindless, hungry monsters. The details of this change, and how people become infected in the first place is only hinted at, or explained in snatches throughout the novel.<br /><br />I hoped Bec McMaster would do more with the knowledge Honoria gained about vampires during her father's medical studies.<br />A rogue vampire was tearing through the streets of Whitechapel, and though Honoria had a few impressive vampire-killing gadgets, Bec McMaster didn't really capitalize on the gadget/technology angle in this novel.ring through the streets of Whitechapel, and though Honoria had a few impressive vampire-killing gadgets, Bec McMaster didn't really capitalize on the gadget/technology angle in this novel.

B0011UBDTK|1.0|I bought these for Christmas because the set was only $68, which is a great deal. I've been wanting this set forever, but I didn't want to dish out the $200 it was.  The day I got it, I started watching it and got through season 1 just fine, and most of season 2.  Then the episode I was watching just froze.  I tried skipping over it, but that didn't work, so I went to the next episode.  Didn't really have an issue with that. Then I got to season 3, and the second or third episode was completely unwatchable.  The picture would freeze, and my dvd player couldn't even skip over it.  I tried to view it on my Macbook to see if there was a difference and the program clearly stated \\"skipping over damaged area\\".  Something is definitely wrong with these dvds.  I decided to return these and try to exchange them hoping I'd get a good set of them, and sure enough, season 3 was still messed up on the second set I received.  It's been returned for a refund.  Maybe the deluxe set doesn't have defective discs.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|It's definitely Final Fantasy, the only major difference is the touch screen interface, which can take some getting used to.  The graphics are what you'd expect from a port from Nintendo DS, but the larger screen is a huge plus. I am currently playing on a Kindle Fire HD and have not experienced any compatibility issues. The price may be high for a tablet game, but Final Fantasy games selling for around 15 bucks is actually a pretty decent deal.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|This is a nice case, but the relevancy is not there. You can put the earpiece in your pocket and be better off. This is cumbersome to carry.  Not necessary!
B002ZG9760|5.0|good movie in blue ray and great price<br />definitely will purchase more blue ray movies<br />and came in plenty of time for christmas!
1471304965|2.0|Let me first say this. I loved the book. A must read. When I ordered this &#34;fullcast&#34; I wasn't sure of how many discs or hours the audio version would be. I was looking forward to listening while driving on a long trip. Unfortunately, this is a very abridged version that lasted only a few hours. My fiancé had never read the book but was also not impressed. Two problems. First, this monumental work cannot be reduced this drastically and still have the same impact. Amazon should note how many hours this audio version covers. Second, the audio version has selected mostly dialogue between the characters over the philosophical treatise. Doing this has greatly diluted the books'  meaning, and therefore, impact, in favor of highlighting the banter and setting of their trip. After having often spoken about Pirsig's achievements, my fiance and I finished the two CDs. We both turned to each other and said, &#34;really&#34;? This is an appetizer, not a meal. If you're in search of &#34;quality&#34;, you'll find it in the book, not the audio.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love it!! If you like object finding games...this ones great! Only complaint is that I wish some items weren't so easy to find!!
B008LY9AWG|3.0|The stories were what one would expect from Michael Connelly - as far as they went. It's advertised as 3 short stories and that is exactly what you get. The rest of the product is simply a clever way to advertise and get the customer to pay for it - not really worth the selling price.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|The movie arrive on time and my 7 year old loved it.  He has been watching it day in and out!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great fun at the right price. The suggestion option comes in handy ever once in a while<br />Great for kids 8 to 80.
B003MXAOVM|4.0|This movie depicts an important piece of church history and is very well scripted and cast.  It gets a little long, but is well worth hanging in there for the bag pipe performance of the song at the end.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I bought this app for my daughter and she loved it until she discovered that she couldn't get all the ponies on the app by using the money you earn in the game. There is no way I will pay over $100 for a pony that is just on a game. Change the prices on the ponies or I will be forced to delete the game as it is too expensive!!!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love playing this game. I look forward to hearing the alert that one of my friends has played, and then it is my turn<br />.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Her vocals on this track are crazy awesome. I have yet to find another artist quite like her - with those haunting lyrics and deep, soulful sounds. Incredible!!
B00123KDMO|5.0|I listened to this cassette tape over and over when I was in junior high.  There is not a bad song on it.
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|I just saw this movie. The movie has been shot in India. It depicts very similar background of ethnics. Whats amazing is (I lived in India for 25 years and now am at the USA) the scenes conjure a very authentic scenario of how Pakistan looks like. The movie doesn't condone any torture or anything. Thats what gave us the information. Not sure if by trying these terrorists in US courts and putting them up in a USA hotel will really help us get any answers.<br /> The movie is not for the faint at heart. It ends with the final showdown in which osama's family gets shot (and the two couriers). This man dragged himself into this. He killed 3000 innocent people on 911. I think the director has done an awesome job at putting 10 years of manhunt into 2.5 hours. I have no idea what part of this movie raised any thought that the information presented was classified.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Great game but hard to get hearts with no friends so please add me!<br /><br />:)<br /><br />Miss_Jules<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Super fun game!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|for years I have saved magazines for recipes and craft ideas. bookmarked web pages ...now I can do all that within pinterest...love it. I do wish there was a way to prevent pins that don't link to recipes...but I have learned before I pin a photo I follow the link to see if it leads anywhere...donating all my old magazines to Goodwill they are appreciative of the donation..win win with pinterest....
B008GFI418|5.0|I loved this from the first lovely image of driving down an English country road.  It is edited  to be entertaining - featuring snippets of things Martin worked on and talks with McCartney, Ringo, and others.  The emphasis appears to be about equally on the work and him as an engaging personality.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|Great movie. The Best I've seen in a long time. Very visual and emotionally moving. I would recommend to anyone.
B005LAII80|2.0|This was a ridiculous, plotless movie.  Yes, I like the sound effects and all of the shooting but the plot was as simple as (1) criminal who breaks law is arrested, (2) criminal's boss tries to prevent an arrest by locking down a building after Judges are inside and (3) Judges and bosses people chase each other around and shoot alot until the bad guy boss is finally overcome.  That's it.  I will try never to buy a movie again based on other's reviews.  Better to watch it as a Netflix rental and then decide if I want to spend money to have it in a permanent collection.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it throughout. The characters were all very interesting and well-developed. Although there were no real plot surprises, it didn't feel boringly predictable.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|This set comes with 3 postcards and a 3D image cover, which is a great addition to an already fantastic set. I'm not a big fan of how the case is set up to hold the blu-rays, I think it would have been better if it was thinner. My star wars blu-rays are in a much smaller package, and it makes for a much nicer package.<br /><br />The series is great and the quality of the video and audio is superb, if you liked the series when it aired, you will love it  in this set!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|In my opinion, this book was a lot easier to get into then the first book.  This book explains why Christian, was the way he was sexually,and how Anastasia was able to help him.
B0095T3H2U|3.0|I had already watched the movie on DVD and was watching it for a second time. I was very disappointed at the quality of the video- it was really pixelated.
0345803493|5.0|The trilogy is lovely. Everyone should read. I loved the storyline. My very dear friend who is 89 read it and she said it made her arthritis flare up. Lovely book
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it!! Very catchy and wanting to read more. Hard to put down!! Highly recommend for the hopeless romantic!!! :)
0345803507|5.0|The story line was great. Writer does a lot of repetition to bring her point across. I got it though.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Alittle far fetched but at the same time I liked the characters and some pretty good action for a low budget film . I have seen 500 million dollar films that don't hold a candle to this.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the trilogy. Storyline was great, writer chose to be very repetitive in describing occurrence. A must read however.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Very good continuation of the \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" story. I felt like there's a lot more going on this one and it moves a lot quicker. There's a lot of new developments that will be very interesting in books to come, particularly a discovery made by Bran and Jon's adventures beyond the Wall. All chapters are written from the perspective of nine different characters, and I can honestly say that each one was intriguing and fit into the overall narrative very well. Martin continues to prove he's one of the elite fantasy authors by honing the world he's created and the characters that dwell in it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very good book, easy quick read.  I now have a whole new respect for our armed forces.  A must read
B00ANT9MZW|5.0|Coming off her much deserved Oscar win for \\"The Hurt Locker\\", Kathryn Bigelow reunites with Mark Boal for \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\", a superbly crafted chronicle of the decade-long manhunt for Osama bin Laden. As she did in her previous film, Bigelow proves once again that she is a master at her craft, lending intelligence and a keen eye for detail to the film. She's no stranger to intense and gripping scenes and \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is no exception; there's multiple parts of the film that will leave you white-knuckled and on the edge of your seat, particularly the last thirty minutes which are some of the most intense moments of a movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />The acting here is top notch. Jessica Chastain throws herself into the role of Maya, the CIA operative that eventually tracked down bin Laden and doesn't miss a beat. In a role that couldn't have been easy to do, Chastain does a great job of bringing an intensity to the screen that, eventually, convinces her CIA coworkers that her theory could be true. There's a large cast in the movie, as the movie takes place over a period of ten years, but a few standouts are Jason Clarke as Maya's confidante and fellow CIA member and Kyle Chandler as her tough and un-believing boss. The cast that makes up Seal Team Six, including Joel Edgerton and Chris Pratt, are very good as well.<br /><br />This is a very powerful film that will resonate with so many people. Even though the audience knows how the movie ends, the journey to that ending is some of the most powerful filmmaking in recent memory.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Roger Brown, 5&quot;6&quot; and overcompensating for it by his own admission, is a successful corporate headhunter. Not successful enough to afford the lifestyle he and his gorgeous amazon wife live, however. So Roger and Ove, who works for a security company, have a racket. Ove turns off a house's security system, and Roger burgles the house of its expensive artwork. The key is that they replace the painting with a copy, so the trail is cold by the time the theft is discovered.<br /><br />Roger is not likable. He cheats on his wife. The chip on his shoulder is enormous. He's successful as a headhunter because he is good at manipulation. But by about the middle of the film, I started feeling really sorry for him. Roger is a jerk, but he is a non-violent jerk. And after meeting Clas Greve at the opening of Diana's new art gallery, his world doesn't just start falling apart, it starts falling violently apart. Clas is one mean man to cross.<br /><br />Through it all, Roger keeps his head. He is quick on his feet and I admire intelligence on the spot. And, after a while, I started rooting for him because, golly, how many times does a man have to be shot at before you simply have to be on his side?<br /><br />The plotting of &quot;Headhunters&quot; is great. Twists and turns and positively Kafkaesque at times. But there's humor, too, though it is mostly black humor. But anyone can relate to using a toilet paper tube to breathe as you submerge yourself in an outhouse pit. At the end, it all comes together in a great AHA climax.<br /><br />&quot;Headhunters&quot; is definitely not a movie for the squeamish or for kids. There's a lot of blood and a lot of gore, with sex thrown in for good measure.  But if you don't mind the violence, watch it for the keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat plot. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Clas Greve, may be better known for his part as Jaimie Lassiter, in the HBO series, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. In &quot;Headhunters&quot;, he's easy on the eyes even while his special forces flintiness makes you worry for poor Roger.<br /><br />&quot;Headhunters&quot; was filmed in Norway, and we watched it with English subtitles.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was riveting ,easy read and  a. must read ..I would highly  recommend this book to all. My friends.<br />Smoochaz@msn
B005LAII3U|3.0|I enjoyed the movie even after seeing the previous version.  The UltraViolet Digital Copy is not very good and there is no reason to buy it.  The quality is lacking and I will skip it on my next purchase
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love the characters but the plots have been getting a little slow in the last couple episodes. When characters are so likeable I hope they can get the storylines together.
B0079J28NC|4.0|I've always been a Beatles fan and I've introduced my son to them through Yellow Submarine. We've enjoyed the iPad book for a long time so I purchased this DVD of the film to watch together with him. It's as trippy and fun as I remember and the restoration is beautiful. The film is colorful, funny and safe to watch with a four-year-old too. The extras and the packaging are great and anyone familiar with the film or the Beatles will be happy to own it. My only problem is with the film itself--it's a little too long and wears out its welcome before the conclusion. I understand part of the restoration was reinserting the Hey Bulldog section toward the end, but every time I watch it, I feel like it's \\"done\\" after the All You Need Is Love performance. Look at me; I'm a nit-picker but I do truly enjoy this a lot.
B000ESSTL0|5.0|This is an amazing 5.1 surround sound mix.  None of that live DVD bulls*** where they just put the song in the front 3.1 speakers and the sound of the audience in the back speakers or other \\"surround sound\\" mixes that just push the music to all 5.1 speakers without any actual mixing.  Highly recommended.
B004Y042N8|4.0|The Ads Free version is lot of entertaining fun for when you need to fill in some time or just clear your mind.  Youngsters and oldsters will enjoy.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|What can I say to anyone about Evil Dead 2 that they don't know already?  Chances are good you've already bought the 25 other versions released on DVD or blu-ray and this has a few new nice featurettes with some interesting stories from the making of the movie.
B003E8P9G0|3.0|One of the better young adult novels out there.  I have not read any of the authors other books.  This is not a Hunger Games, but it is a fun read.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|I recommend it for anyone interested in U.S. history. It's not made up, like some would make us believe. I have not seen the Showtime series, however.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Great old movie and to have it on DVD means you can watch it for years, whenever you need a good dose of Bela.
0525952926|1.0|I've never written a book review on line before, but I feel that I have to now as a public service to warn people not to spend their time and money on this book.  The public has been tricked into thinking that based on previous books Ken Follett and publisher think they can get away with this awful book.  Bad or no character development, stupid adolescent sex scenes, you know you're reading fiction because these characters are not part of the greatest generation.  This isn't a book, it's a quick, cheap made for TV movie. Had to be written just to make money.  So disappointing.
B003YL4L0W|2.0|I tried one of Jodi Picoult books based on a friend indicating she liked this authors books.  I read part of this book and deleted it as i did not care for the language or the topic.  Afterwards freind told me that yeah, a couple of her books were that way.
B00846REIS|4.0|Story mirrors 50 Shades of Grey.  Looking forward to the next book.  Definitely an erotic romance and good read that doesn't want to be put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A feast for the eyes!  Great cast!  Great acting! The costumes are amazing but used realistically with restraint since those were difficult economic times. The women are informed and consulted, their opinions considered, by the men.  All those in the house work together for the common good with the exception of a couple of bad seeds (who could reform one day, who knows what the writers have in store?) I cry. I laugh. I am stimulated intellectually and visually. It is what I would expect from anything associated with Julian Fellowes.
B00049QQHI|4.0|I'm very hapy with my choice of this used copy of &#34;The Basketball Diaries&#34;. It arrived quicker than estimated. Thecondition of the disk was as good as new, thus making the price outstanding.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I am not a Brad Pitt fan but this was well-done.  I would recommend it and would watch it again.
0143113100|5.0|This book gives good insight into how retrainable the brain is.<br />I bought a second copy of this book for a friend.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This is by far the darkest Batman. Loked it, didn't love it. Acting, very good...special affects OK. Loved Ann as Catwoman!
B00979CS50|4.0|My husband is a major Neil Young fan and really enjoyed this CD.  He loves almost all kinds of music (except opera and rap, which isn't even music).  He was at Woodstock, has subscribed to Rolling Stone since it was a newsletter rather than a magazine, and Neil Young is one of his favorite performers - what more can I say?
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Child has created a great character.  While you can't really know him, you know he is honest, ethical and interesting.  In every book he demolishes the bad guy(s), Child does a great job in making them truly despicable, and I love it!!
B00786XVOG|5.0|I have a playlist of Yanni and other new-age performers that I always listen to on long airline trips - it helps me to relax and not stress over the possibility of lost luggage or missed connections (especially with the noise-canceling headphones).  This was great music, although I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD yet.
B0052BZ6X8|3.0|Meh... it was ok. I would not have paid to see this in the theater, but it was ok for a prime movie.
B00005QGAV|4.0|I love this cd and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
0385535147|3.0|To me, it started out better than it ended. I still like John Grisham and his books.  Amen, amen, amen.
B00005QGAX|4.0|I love this cd and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
1603427244|5.0|I only really know how to cast on one way and that's the long tail cast on. It works for many projects, but it gets kinda boring. She tells you the different projects each cast on and bind off are good for (sweaters,socks,hats etc.). Which I find really helpful odds are I would use the wrong one!
B0009XNUK0|4.0|I love this cd and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|What else can one say about a story full of foreshadowed twists and turns, in a setting that looks like the Houses of Parliament?<br /><br />The excessive scrupulosity of the residents of Downton is just so much fun to watch.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|I love this cd and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
B00005MP58|5.0|A sensational production  of Jane Austen's masterpiece.  I've used it to convert several men who previously claimed they &#34;disliked&#34; Austen.  After this tv version was first aired in the US, I became a &#34;Darceymaniac&#34;, and still love Colin Firth.
B00005QGAT|4.0|I love this cd and I was glad that I was able to purchase this product at a reasonable price
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A contemporary story that takes place in Las Vegas. It demonstrates how you can really wind up in difficulties under the effects of too much to drink. Very good ending, I would recommend it to anyone
B000HC2LI0|5.0|New in shrinkwrapped box. Perfect condition. Loved it. All dvds worked perfectly!  The original script from the pilot included was wonderful. I now have a very happy husband.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK SOOOOOO MUCH IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!Jeff Kinney is the awesomely awesome comedy writer I would reccomend him to write every book,that is how much I love his books.
B006903GX8|3.0|I errored when I bought this one.  Thought it was the novel and it is not, my mistake I guess.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMG I was biting my nails to stubs reading this book. As soon as I can I am reading the third book. Suzanne I hope you never stop writing because you have a true gift and I love you.
1419705849|5.0|My son reads all the Wimpy kids books. He says &#34;it's a clever comedy that kids can really relate to.&#34;
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The first one was fun.  A deliciously over-the-top salute to tough guy action stars past.  Not great, or even particularly good, cinema, but it was entertaining.  This concoction is the remnants of the first movie, thrown into a blender with some of the worst dialogue ever uttered and a large dollop of &#34;this time it's personal&#34; testosterone glop and pureed into a visual slurry that will have you wishing you were watching the Gigli Director's Cut.  I'm an unabashed fan of Jason Statham and I still think Stallone has something to offer but this is not it.  It's hard to have fun when you're stuck in a spasmodic cringe loop.
0385535147|5.0|I'm already over half way through it! Grisham's story lines always bring that unexpected twist that I a;ways enjoy reading.
0307990818|2.0|I looked forward to reading Nesbo's latest and am sorry to say that I was disappointed. I didn't enjoy the storyline or where the events took me. It was overlong and confusing. I guess it didn't help that I took it to read while on a cruise, but my dissatisfaction continued after I got home,  I finished it and was even more unhappy with the miserable ending!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I am a big Dr. Who fan and even though my daughter purchased this by accident I can forgive her because it is an amazing show!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Certainly the darkest episode of the series. Dumbledore's exit circumstances never made sense, to me, anyway. There was little to segue into Jenny and Harry being married. There was also gaps in character development for Ron, Hermione and Malfoy. But the author has hadmitted having difficulty with teen and post teen relationships.<br />Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, the inimitable Ms. Bonham were all superb.<br />That having been said, the lack of preparedness on the part of the school was out of character. There was plenty of action in the fight scenes. Enough to satisfy anyone. The &#34;horcrux&#34; element did not make sense and the Elder (wood) wand was not really ever a part of the movie.<br />The producers of the movie made the same mistake Ms. Rowling did by trying to stuff 100 lbs. of action into a 75lb. package. A transitional book or a transitional movie might have helped. (And I'm a fan.) So, having gotten all the negatives out of the way, I say just sit back and enjoy the fun. It's fantasy, so have a good time. I did.
B0006J28BO|5.0|My kids, husband and I all love the cat returns. Very different from other movies for kids! They love watching it over and over again! Captures their attention well!
0765325950|1.0|Let me be clear on something: I'm giving this a one-star rating because of the limited format choice.  I loved the book, Brandon Sanderson did an amazing job, and Robert Jordan's nearly-unchanged last chapter threw me for a loop; I didn't expect that ending.<br /><br />I'm irritated that I had to purchase this book in hardcover, however.  I've read Brandon's report of Harriet McDougal's concerns over her departed husband's legacy, and over ebooks splitting sales to keep this (in her mind) from hitting #1 on the NYT BSL.  I don't care.  I dropped $20 on the book via Amazon because I wanted to read the book, and because I didn't want to have to assiduously avoid websites for fear of spoilers for another 3 months while waiting for the book to be released to the Kindle market.<br /><br />Whatever her stated reasons, I'm still left feeling like this is just yet another person in the publishing industry who's fighting tooth and nail against a new distribution paradigm.  Record labels did it with the advent of digital music, and the record industry is now in shambles.  The closure of Borders Books, and the increasingly small number of customers I see in my local Barnes & Noble, are telling me that resistance of ebooks is having the same effect on the publishing industry.<br /><br />And to be honest, if the industry is going to resist ebooks like this, then yay.  Let them die.  I can pay $450 for a professional edit of a personally-written book, and put it up on the Kindle market and make the bulk of profit myself.  Sure, I have to do my own marketing.  But it underscores a vital point: for an author whose primary purpose is to have their work read, publishing houses are no longer a necessity, merely one of multiple avenues of distribution.<br /><br />Sure, I'm probably being petty in \\"review-bombing\\" this book, and its status as a NYT bestseller is assured now regardless of my views.  Either way, I have a feeling that Ms. McDougal missed out on a lot more revenue for thisbook by making those who prefer to use e-readers wait another 3 months (and it would have apparently been longer if Brandon hadn't convinced her to step back from a full year-long wait).  Those who want a hardback would have bought it either way; those who want the ebook now have to wait longer.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say, I've encouraged friends of mine who want to read this book to wait a week or so after publication and just go into a used bookstore chain like Half Price Books and purchase the book there.  Sure, it was sold once, and that $34.99 was parceled out to the retailer, publisher, and authors.  But when a friend of mine came up to me three days after release with a brand new-quality copy she picked up at Half Price Books, I was proud.<br /><br />I don't want to keep fans of hardbound books from having the books they love.  I don't understand why they want to keep those of us who like using e-readers from having the same.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I find myself remembering lines from this book even though it's been weeks since I finished reading. To say that the story is compelling is an understatement. I will concede that, even though I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, some parts of this book were so incredibly technical, I felt out of my depth. Easy solution? I skipped those parts. The rest is just too good to pass up, even if you're not a neurosurgeon.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Stephanie was back at it!  I have not read a book yet by this author that I didn't enjoy.  It's fun to read a book while laughing out loud!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Heartwrenching, elating, and encouraging all in one. It makes you furious, heartbroken, proud and happy. You definitely become the characters!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like how the cop chaces u and u are like a rebel and u get to chose characters and get money like lots
B001VLXNO2|5.0|Being a lover of historical fiction, I found this book &#34;right down my alley.&#34;  Archer captures the persona of Mallory and his beloved Ruth.  The accounts of mountain climbing span the range from humor to harrowing.  The recreation of British society will engulf anyone who is a fan of Downton Abby.  This is a most absorbing look at a very determined individual, who made personal sacrifice to achieve his dreams.
B005LAII6C|1.0|Horrible movie. I regret my wasted time. It's not a family friendly movie. Do not buy. Save your money and buy something else!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|self deprecating and hilarious. i believe every girl will relate to at least SOMETHING in this book. she isn't afraid to show that being a successful woman doesn't mean that you have it all together or everyone will love you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow what an awesome book. So full of suspense. Can't wait until the next book come out. I sure hope the capitol get what they deserve.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|If You like the Blues this is a Great Cd by Buddy Guy to add to your Blues Collection !
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|cute game..but this is the 3 rd time I had to start up again...too many issues...will NOT spend ANY cash on it this time...you need to fix the issues not only in this game....but your other games....like Fantasy Town...I have not been able to play that one for 6 days now..I am quite far into the game also...please fix!!!!!
B002WCLG3Y|2.0|Halo Legends consists of eight vignettes each done by a different producer.  Most of the vignettes are too short to be effective.  The style of animation differs between each vignette because each was done by a different producer.  It doesn't add up to anything.  It's not a complete story and wasn't intended to be.<br /><br />I couldn't see any reason for producing this DVD, nor could I find any merit in it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story....well told !!!  This is worth every minute of reading.  Interesting manipulation of events and the ending is totaly unpredictible
B0053O89KG|5.0|I loved the ending it really moved me and like I have said prior I hope this will continue!  PLEASE!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive. It is perfect for playing on the go because you can start and stop at any point and easily pick up were you left off.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I look forward to watching at least two episode all must every day!  I like that Beckett and Castle are getting closer!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the stuff is cool and fun to do and to unlock. but some are to easy. it was So fun
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I just found this show about a month ago and I ordered all 4 seasons and I have pre-ordered season 5.  I hope this show lasts for years to come!<br /><br />I think the lastest show was really good!!! I also think that this one was one of the best of all!!! I have watched at least 5 times since monday!!  I am so happy that Castle has been renewed for next season!!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Five years in but the characters keep getting more interesting.  I am pleased the relationship between the two has not derailed the storyline.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I really love this show I love the chemistry between Castle and Becket. I hope it continues! Keep it on!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I found this to be a pleasant mix. Good sound and great vocals.  I would recommend this to any fan of train.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Great doll house for the money.  My granddaughter loves it and it didn't cost a fortune, and it doesn't take as much space as the Dream House.
B007L6VR12|5.0|really enjoyed seeing this and didn't have to wait long to watch, the disc came within a few days and played great! i appreciate it!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is tons of gun.I can't believe I waited so long to get it. Well worth the money. great for all ages. looming forests to unlocking all the levels.
B00000F566|5.0|my mom and i both enjoy watching this movie from time to time so it was awesome to find a used copy for only 38 cents! thanks so much!
B007A4Y1NQ|5.0|I wanna start off by saying that I'm completely biased because Being John Malkovich is my favoriite movie.<br />That out of the way, the movie itself is as good as ever, and could also be found in a non-Criterion DVD edition, so what makes this particular Disk worth buying are the extras you really can't get anywhere else.<br /><br />The highlight of the package has to be Lance Bang's Making of Doc of the movie. Called &#34;All Noncombatants Please Clear the Set&#34; (for reasons we find out while watching), it diverges from the classic formula in that there's no talking head interviews or sappy reminiscing to push the movie itself. Instead what we get is a true behind-the-scenes look at what the set was probably like.One of the best parts has to be when Catherine Keener gets an injury and is replaced by someone, who while might seem weird for the role, makes a lot of practical sense.<br /><br />In fact that's most likely the best way to describe this movie and this package in general. Being John Malkovich might be weird, odd, and zany but it's handled and made with care and thought, which oozes out of this 2 Disk Collection and given the movie itself, makes sense.<br /><br />*Other extras include: a commentary by a director (emphasis on &#34;a&#34;), Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich, a booklet that's clever but honestly not that informative or interesting, a slideshow of pictures narrated by Spike Jonze that's much better, a new interview with John Malkovich that I didn't watch yet, & all the extras that were included in the first DVD release of the movie
B009YQJ322|5.0|I'm sorry to say that I didn't see Dredd 3D in theatres. I simply didn't even hear about it until a friend recommended it to me. It's absolutely brilliant. Hyper-detailed action, no-compromise characters and a tight script combine with slick and stylized visuals to give movie-viewers a truly unique experience. Please save this movie from it's undeserved fate. Buy the BluRay and tell your friends about how amazing it is!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'll just say that it was a good end to the trilogy and it was worth reading 390 pages. If you really want to know what happens, read it instead of hearing it from someone else. I won't say anymore because I don't want to give anything away.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown was an amazing example of never giving up. I want to use the lessons I learned from this book to teach my kids to never give up on their dream.
B007DIQC90|5.0|First heard this group on &#34;Q&#34; and then bought the album for a road trip. Liked every song and never tired of listening. Have a fresh exciting sound. Now I hear their songs all the time.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The author is an exceptional writer and I loved reading this book! I dislike the fact it's like every other book I've read as far as its predictable but on the flip side I couldn't put it down. As predictable as it was I just had to be sure... I hope to be reading something by her again!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Love their swagger, the rhythm and lyrics. I play this CD at least 3-4 times a week and can't get tired of it yet.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|The cover photo is misleading and I don't understand why they used the image of a very beloved former president.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Extremely well written, wonderful tale of young love and family disaster. Plenty of twists to keep you guessing. Lots of questions but everything comes together neatly in the end. Some sex but depicted very tastefully. Highly recommend for everyone.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am a mom of an active preschooler and toddler.  I started the book Friday evening and finished it Sunday.  It was that good!
B0063IH60K|4.0|As far as solitaire - this game is entertaining.  I like how you have multiple options to play.  Great way to relax.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! I can't wait to finish the series I'm on so I can read it again!! :-)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really addicting boring fun game. it is not the greatest game. but it was free. so its not that bad.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Coming from Reality is the sophomore effort from Rodriguez. For this album he trekked off to London to make the album. This album is just as strong and moving as cold fact. Production quality is high and Light in the Attic did a great job on the audio restoration of this disc. It all comes in a beautiful digipak with extensive liners notes! I would highly recommend this release reissue to anyone interest in 60's music. A+ for digging up an reissuing this long lost and under-appreciated classic album.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This novel was VERY thought out, and I absolutely loved that I was hooked from the start. It's so nice to read a GOOD story from an author with actual TALENT; it's such a rarity. I most definitely would recommend this book!
B0000C1733|5.0|16 of these best collected together in one single disc set. If you are looking for the best of the Red Hot Chili Peppers I would recommend this set. It is a great place to start your collection. All of the truly essential songs are included in this low price set. Truly the best for less than $10.00 who could ask for more?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|&#34;HOPELESS&#34; is an excellent book dealing with a very sensitive subject…You are on a roller coaster ride from the first sentence! It's one you do not want to put down--it’s intense, funny, happy, sad, erotic, sexy and every other adjective you can think of!!!! And the BEST first kiss ever!  Colleen Hoover is on my &#34;Best Author&#34; list!
B0000508U6|5.0|Parachutes is one amazing debut album. The energy, emotion and power of this disc is stunning! If you are fan of Coldplay or even just interested in hearing more from them I would highly recommend this CD! Great Music,Great Price = Great Deal
B00A757EFW|1.0|You can only play the first board on this &#34;free&#34; game.  Then, halfway through playing the second board (which takes no time to get to&#34;, the game stops in the middle of playing and tells you that you have to buy the game to keep playing.  Dont waste your time with this demo.
B000002GKT|5.0|If you are fan of Humble Pie this album is required listening. Rockin the Fillmore is considered by many to be one of the best live albums of all time!  It is pure raw power from beginning to end. You just might need to get the doctor after Rockin out to this one!  A true classic rock album on CD for under $6.00 is one of the best deals around! I would recommend you add this one to your collection now
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would recommend this and both of the other books! I could not put them down! You will not put this or the other books down!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Halfway thru and it is so boring.  I keep reading waiting for something to happen.  Going to be hard to finish this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I purchased this book on my kindle and I loved all three books I could not put them down! I would recommend this and all three books!
B006P96PAO|5.0|Excellent movie that will keep you laughing while also speaking to your soul!  Every boyfriend, husband and/or father should see this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this and the other two books! I could not put the book down when I started to read it! I purchased it for my kindle!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The balance between romantic tension and mystery kept me engaged and the story, while potentially depressing was interesting and realistic.  I found the lead male character a little too mature for his age but not necessarily unbelievable.  Overall a book I would recommend.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I like the show. I found it smart and entertaining and the character development was well paced. I can't wait for next season.
B004J64QSI|5.0|We are fans of Alfie Boe.  Just an amazing production.  Our whole family likes it and watches it together.  Admittedly, we are a musical family.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|What can I say that hasn't possibly been said about this show already? If you haven't checked it out by now YOU NEED TO!!! This is one of the best high-fantasy stories I've ever come across. In ways for me this is better than the Lord of the Rings movies (not the books mind you). With such a large colorful cast of character, a tv series is best suited for such an expansive plot. It helps incase you don't like one of the main characters. Don't worry because there are ten more just as fleshed out and interesting just around the corner!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Bought as a gift for a friend who had never watched the show, now she's hooked. Time to buy season 2.
B006WWTKQ0|5.0|Very good movie for the family. It did it's job, it entertain my family.  The 3D animation was great and the story line was cute.
006123205X|5.0|Audio is the way to go just listen while you commute to work then discuss it with your wife in the evening makes you look like you spent hours reading and studing lol I may never read a book again
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book starts off very slow. It gets better, adding some expense and excitement by the end. Overall I would saw these series of books are just OK due to the nature, content and how slow the plot can be in spots.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I recently found out about this series from a couple of my friends and decided to check it out.  I have really enjoyed the series and will continue watching it.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|The movie is really funny with some times of suspense and sad times. I would reccomend you to watch it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I couldn't wait to see Mad Men season 5, and I was not disappointed. I don't watch much TV, but hate to miss this show!! Acting is superb, storyline never bores, and I think we can all relate to one or all of the characters. Bring on Season 6.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|What can I say.  It's a rear lens cap for Nikon lenses.  Fits snug and secure.  Ordered from Amazon and received 2 original Nikon replacement caps.  Some others have claimed getting knock off caps, but when ordered directly from Amazon I got the real Nikon parts.  This LF-4 (made in Thailand) is a replacement for the LF-1 (made in Japan).  I think that this cap actually fits better than my LF-1 caps with a more secure feel.  I have used it on both modern D/G lenses and older prime manual lenses with no issues either way.  Every Nikon shooter should keep a couple extra of these caps handy.
B0032KSXRW|5.0|This is the standard for all ron-com's. I miss these types of movies where the drama is real and not some perceived slight or missunderstanding. It makes the resolution and happy ending so much more plausable.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Attractive, clear layout.  Like the hourly, daily, and full week forecasts, meteorological explanations, and weather news stories.  I usually use this in combination with NOAA website (for more graphs).
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so addicting and so much fun.  I find myself doing things to pass the time so I can save up coins.  Great game!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Great movie i loved how skeeter had the courage to stand up to the racist idiots of the day i would recommend this movie to everyone.
B001706I5I|5.0|My kids love this version and it was nice for them to get the background story on Grinch.  They always love the cartoon version every season and were enthralled when they got to see this.  I will probably buy the dvd for next year.  I do think the quality of the film was kind of low.  I streamed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great easy read, can't wait to read the second book. It was hard putting the book down. Enjoyed it much!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I started reading this book knowing very little about it -- but seeing it everywhere. I was not disappointed. It's one of my favorite books of the year.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|My granddaughter requested this and she enjoyed it very much. It is not something that I watch so I cannot comment on it.
1400069289|5.0|I had to read this book for a management class, and ended up liking it so much that I bought a second one for a friend. Great for understanding habits.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I got it for my grandaughter. She had the first season and wanted the second season I do not watch it, but she is happy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book has literally made me speechless. Never in my life have I read something so dramatic, thrilling, heart wrenching and just purely wonderful. I didn't put it down the whole day and would suggest this to anyone.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Seven Samurai is one of my all-time favorite films, and I was very much looking forward to watching the blu-ray version.  After firing up the blu-ray player, however, I was surprised by the amount of film grain present.  Also, the blacks were washed out in places, and sometimes the picture flickered as though the light in the projector was ebbing.  When I stood closer to the screen, scratches were evident--as though the film had been viewed too many times.  This was not typical blu-ray quality.  Nevertheless, I soon got caught up in the movie, and everything was fine.<br /><br />When the movie ended, I popped in my old DVD version for a few minutes, just to compare.  Then I realized how superior the blu-ray edition really is.  The DVD version was really bad--lots of artifacts, dirt and \\"noise.\\"  These things had been cleaned up in the blu-ray edition.  The detail in the DVD was so muted that it was hard to watch.  The blu-ray edition is indeed superior when it comes to crispness of detail.  The sound is also much improved.  So Criterion's blu-ray is in fact the best version of the film.  Just be forewarned: the restoration and transfer is not nearly as good as, say, Casablanca.  Perhaps technology will advance to the point some day when they will be able to make a pristine edition of the film.<br /><br />Parental Advisory: This movie contains medieval-style warfare, and many die.  Killing scenes are bloodless, however, and often concealed from view.  There is one scene where intimacy between unmarried individuals is implied, but not shown.  The film also contains some minor language and drunkenness.  It is suitable for junior high age and up.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  It is a \\"must see.\\"
B009O07NDY|5.0|Listening to this soundtrack takes me back to the LoTR trilogy while introducing new themes and favorites.<br />A must have for any fan of soundtracks and classically influenced music.
B005CRQ2Y4|5.0|Very good, well worth the price and the short time that it takes to read.  Might not be for everyone, so research Pynchon a little before buying if you're picky.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderful  story and very informative from an historical standpoint. Follett really is a master of putting you in the time and getting you immersed in the story.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Honestly, I have found I really enjoy Clint Eastwood movies. Therefore, I rented this one thinking there was a good chance I would enjoy it. I was right, the movie was well written. Even if you're not a huge baseball fan, you will like this movie. It has a little of everything you would want from a sports movie, a good story, a hero, a villain and love. It's a good movie for guys and gals. Therefore, it is a good compromise for a movie to watch to together, one that you may both enjoy.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I usually love Grisham's books, great story teller with lousy endings. This book has a solid ending, predictable but okay because the book is so much fun to read. The characters are hilarious and I found myself lol more than once, very entertaining.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|We should all know that this is a mobile spin-off of Minecraft. I didn't think it would be that good, but it is great! Get it!
B004TI5N38|3.0|Character was unrealistic too much of a super hero. I think Baldaci was stereotyping the military man same problem when male writers tell a story as a female, just doesn't work.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|There is something missing and something too much as well.  Cannot put my finger on it.  Sorry.  Liked the story overall.  Who has not ever asked themselves at some time what they would change if they could. Thanks for writing the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|These days it is hard to find a show that actually has a plot and sub plot thick enough to keep me interested.  If you like period pieces and some English movies you will love this.  The costumes, the acting, and the sets are spectacular as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I cannot put this game down!  it is brain stimulating logic puzzle fun!  I highly recommend it!  three more words
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I just got ripped off and am going to request a refund on this. I thought I purchased the 3 disc extended collectors edition and I received the regular version. This is bull. I would watch out before you purchase a movie for instant streaming. This is a fantastic movie I love it. But #$@% you Amazon for ripping me off!!!
B008B68IEA|5.0|If your daughter is into monster high like mine she will love this bed!  It has a blanket, pillow, TV, alarm clock, smoothie, and a bed for her pet.  It has taken a position at the head of my daughters bed and not moved since received at Christmas.  If you had trouble finding Monster High stuff in stores around the holidays Amazon was a great alternative.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very good story and probably could be true to life.  Did not end like I would have liked it too!!
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Everyone said this movie was amazing. I definitely enjoyed watching it but the plot seemed random. And I like science fiction. This isn't one for the ages. But it is entertaining for the evening.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I liked it then i accidentally logged out and it won't let me  back in i tried but it kept on sayin &quot;hey there log in with facebook or email
B000AJIAOO|3.0|Between some of the songs I have heard before, some of the other ones are screechy and obnoxious. I know they can do better...
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|This book is something I should of bought years ago, before I started setting up the studio. With the books help I literally ripped my studio apart and started from scratch and the results are outstanding. Well worth the money.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Really Really long and tedious the middle stretches out this kind of boring but the ending was good. You should watch if you seen the other two as it closes everything out
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love it was a little strong in some places but liked it glad her and pets got together and started a family
B0095R64AO|2.0|This movie was supposed funny and while it had it's moments it really wasn't. It was just really long and awkward relationship between these two people yeah I would watch it at your own risk and maybe only if it's free. Oh and if you have nothing else better to do with your self.
B004AUGJS8|4.0|The film was very interesting in that it felt like a psychological thriller and sometimes a fictionalized documentary which I think may be the case since it's based on an true story. It was a good movie, not exceptional but it keeps you enthralled for the majority of the movie.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|The Kingkiller Chronicle is a masterpiece of fantasy. If you loved The Name of the Wind, you'll love this one also.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is great. They could've made the game longer but still a good game. Should get AmaZing spider man for my kindlefirehd
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is one of those books that make you wish for that extra 6th star to give. Reminds me of The Name of the Wind.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I choose to read this book for a project. I couldn't put it down and I finished it in 2 days.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon manages again to create a distinct and interesting world of magic. One of the few books, I'd give 6 stars if only possible. Really looking forward to the next part!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book caught me by total surprise. It had me on the edge of my seat the I tire time. I had no clue what was going on or what to think. I loved the twist ending. My only complaint was that it ended.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I wasn't hooked by the murder mystery the author decided to use as a sequel to Pride and Prejudice.  The story didn't have me wanting to dive back in to read some more.  I wanted to see where the story would go, so I finished it.  The story didn't make me love all the characters.  The only part that I found interesting is the opinions/explanations offered up by the author about why certain characters made particular decisions in the original.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is better then the one I hope third one can follow up<br />This is the best sequel ever
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|I love this movie and it was so fun to get this in 3D and Blu-ray.  This is a really fun show for the kids.
B006LSZECO|4.0|For those of u with imperfect marriages, this book should lend u some perspective. If u just need a good thriller in it life, this is a must read. Totally enjoyable story. I would change the ending though. Enjoy!!
B005HW21Y4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how good this book was. I'd recommend The Iron Druid Chronicles for anyone who enjoyed The Dresden Files or The Hollows.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I always know that if it is &quot;free&quot; that means a trial.  The game was 2.99 and I thought it was worth that.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Having just bought my blu-ray player, i was looking forward to trying out some blu-ray movies.This one played really smoothly and clearly. Once you've tried blu-ray, you wouldnt go back to dvd already. But along with the other blu-rays, this was a good movie with a plot that'll make you wanna buy all the James Bond movies. I didnt quite understand the story the first time i watched this movie on my dvd, but after i watched this movie on my blu-ray, the experience feels different and the whole story unfolds differently. And i went to download the OST, You Know My Name by Chris Cornell. Good soundtrack.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My wife has this game on her phone and my son was always wanting to play it. I downloaded it to his Nabi and he loves it. He gets a little frustrated at times but overall I think it is one of his favorite games.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|The last time i watched T2 was on a LD. You know that huge laser disc? Yes, that! That was how long ago since i watched it. Yet this show has left such a lasting impression on me that i decided to search for a blu-ray version, and i found this. It is super clear for its sound and movie and you will not regret this buy at all. And for a price less than 10bucks is a damn good deal.
0062218867|1.0|I haven't read a Discworld world for a while, picked this up in an airport. This is just not a good read. Way longer than it needs to be, neither characters nor settings are interesting. City Watch Commander Vimes is on vacation grousing over a dearth of bacon sandwiches. Crimes, but no hi jinks ensue. Yes, we find that goblins have a culture and artistic sensitivity. But so much time is wasted by the time we arrive at the climactic river scene I was just thumbing forward to the end. I expect even completists would be disappointed by this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever you will love it this is the best game ever I love this game I love this game
B007STXHTM|5.0|Just returned from our cruise. Used underwater, ziplining, rafting and everyday pocket carry during tours, onboard ship, rain, etc..... No issues, leaks, or other defects. Very pleased with the GoPro and it's associated parts.<br /><br />Tip: when using underwater, rain, other adverse weather conditions, use/spray Rainx on it, let dry. This will help water droplets run off quicker and keep a clear pic/lens free of droplets.<br /><br />If you don't have one, check them out. Got mine during Black Friday sale on GP2's and now using wireless/Apps to record my experiences.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|great action movie. I loved it. I heard about this movie before but I didn't want to give it a try because I just thought I would stick to the first dredd movie with silvester stallone but I saw it and It's really cool. Lots of action.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|My grandson played this for hours! I personally only played it for few minutes but only because he started playing!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The lead actor who played Lincoln, played a good role. It was an entertaining movie, I would recommend it to watch.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I sat down in a dark room and played this.... I litterally started crying. No joke. I got all 8 pages and then saw Slender and..... died.......
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Fun, the male and female leads were played well, more so the female rookie judge, she nailed it. Some slow motion blood and gore, so if that disturbs you, maybe don't watch. I would like to see the 3D version.
B004P7CNE0|2.0|Stupidity and violence don't need to go hand in hand, but in this movie they do.  I bought this as a present for someone who requested it.  This movie was one demensional.  The bad guys were all stupid, the plot and storyline were poor at best.  I like Christian Bale, but can't understand why he would agree to make this movie at this time in his career.  I would compare this movie to a &#34;B&#34; movie or a made for video movie.  I feel sorry for anyone who paid good money to see this at the theater.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I can't get enough of this movie - sexy and decent storyline (romance). Recommend for women everywhere! Channing Tatum is just so sweet (as in yummy) in this role.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This story of a poverty stricken man sentenced to years of imprisonment for the theft of a loaf of bread in the 19th century resonates with me as an Australian convict descendant. Like my ancestors from Britain and Ireland, Hugo’s character in France, Jean Valjean, has the opportunity to turn his life around, not through a Ticket of Leave in a new country but through an act of kindness.<br /><br />The novel’s overall message of the goodness and beauty of human nature is an appealing one. Hugo opens the readers’ eyes to what is important in human interaction. He shows us that people are forced to become what they are by the rules and expectations of society which imprisons people even when there are no prison bars.  Characters are stripped of the labels stamped on them by a judgemental society. For example, Valjean sees Fantine not as the prostitute she has forced to become but as a woman and a mother, a mother desperate to be reunited with her daughter. Instead of condemning her and taking advantage of her vulnerable situation Valjean respects her and helps her.<br /><br />For those who are daunted by the prospect of reading one of the longest novels ever written it might be useful to approach it as five novels (1: Fantine 2: Cosette 3: Marius 4: Saint-Denis 5:Jean Valjean) and settle down to read one novel at a time.<br />Each volume is a leisurely narrative that includes lengthy descriptions of characters, settings, conditions and events; a narrative that wanders off onto tracks that don’t appear to have any connection with the plot which I found annoying and  frustrating .<br /><br />Such a book as Les Miserables deserves a longer review than I have time for. To summarise, it is a story of the human condition, of love, loss and hope, of French society in the 1800s, and it is a plea for social justice.<br /><br />Those who are like me and enjoy reading Dickens are likely to enjoy Les Miserables.<br />.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Love how it tells the story of the author's interview and the adventure at the same time. You feel as if you are in the lifeboat with Pi the whole time feeling the hot sun and the salt water on your skin as he did! The details and specifics of his diet makes you cringe yet you want to hear more. Only wish there was more to the ending of Pi and Richard Parker's relationship.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this product to help my headphones reach there full potential. This product really brought the bass out of my Skull-candy Roc-nation Aviators. The battery life is great i charge it probably every other day. The build quality is pretty good being that this is a china made product, it is very light and sturdy . Overall best product that you could buy for 20 bucks.. I recommend to anyone who want to bring out the sound of there headphones.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I couldn't put this down. A great read and exploration of what it is to be part of a community.
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Although simplistic, it is somewhat challenging to get past the obstacles (cat, rat).  Entertaining and I think my grandson will think it is fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very well done.  You will love the characters and come to care about them.  That makes a good show.  Fabulous scenery, both inside and out.  You will love it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I just got a Kindle Fire for Christmas and am just getting started with Aps.  This ap is a really cute game and fun for adults and children.  It is easy to maneuver and very entertaining.  I would definitely recommend it.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Like the storey lines.  Wish the star would get rid of the stubble  he is too good looking to have it
B0007KLH1Y|4.0|I purchased this for my son & he loves it. Good quality a bit $$ but he enjoys it & so does his sister.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you enjoyed Fifty Shades...then you will love this. In the beginning I felt they were similar but I didn't feel as though I was reading the same book.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|In my opinion, this is among the best (along with the early ECM ones) and also \\"jazzy\\"<br />Metheny recordings. I was pleasantly surprised with the earlier unknown for me sax player Chris<br />Potter and apparently quite young base Ben Williams. Unlike other Pat Metheny recordings, there<br />is no explicit dominance of guitar solos on this CD, rather it sounds like a consolidated<br />recording. There is, I think, only one old composition on it (roofdogs) with a nice new<br />interpretation and sax solo. The rest of the compositions are apparently new, including the first<br />one (which resembles a bit Charly Haden style). All compositions are really nice. After listening<br />this CD I had an impression that Pat Metheny is searching for a new balanced and consolidated<br />way of imbedding his amazing guitar abilities.
B007UXSKMU|5.0|This was a good film to watch if you are a Cruise fan, which I am.  It was beautifully filmed and was suspensful.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|This was a good movie I just wish it was scarier and didn't leave a cliffhanger at the end with Ryan in the mental ward I wish it had showed him a little more there but overall it was a well thought out and directed.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Funny, insightful and filled up with &#34;popular wisdom&#34;. His &#34;business&#34;approach to writing comes in the right moment, proving that  writers can make a living out of their passion as long as they are determined to make a change in the way they perceive the whole concept.<br /><br />I totally recommend it to all writers, whether they're copywriters, ghost writers or bloggers. What are you waiting for? Buy it! :)
B008NMT684|4.0|My boy love this game but with only about 10 puzzles they get bored easily.  I hope they update it and add more soon.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app really makes me feel like five years old again.<br />Hopefully kids my age feel the same way I do.
0452295548|5.0|Jill Bolte Taylor's book and words, sharing her experience, will blow you away.  It is totally amazing how the brain works and how we can actually control it and our thoughts, and how we can better tune into what our brains and bodies are telling us.  It is a very deep book, but she explains everything wonderfully.  A must-read for anyone interested in the workings of the brain and/or NDE experiences.  Highly recommend.  Also got one for my mom and she cannot stop talking about it and is learning so much from it.  Very enlightening and encouraging!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|What can you expect from Nicolas sparks...a great love story and a tear jerker in the end. I can't wait to watch the movie!
B009GESJH2|5.0|Every CD seems to have a little different flavor than the previous one with Kid Rock...although they all exude his unending energy and talents.  Rebel Soul reminds me of his earlier music....more rockin' and of course some beautiful ballads.  All his music is great, and I cannot wait to see him perform in 3 weeks!!  If you've never seen a Kid Rock concert, you don't know what you're missing.  He blows away every concert I've ever been to all wrapped up in one.  And it's not laser shows or stuff to &#34;impress&#34; with props.  KR's concerts are unbelievably awesome!  He puts everything into it and relates to the audience throughout.  It's as if he's one of us in the audience.  One of my gay girlfriends saw him with me last year and she could barely catch her breath afterwards....when she could finally speak she said &#34;He is so F****ing SEXY we HAVE to see him again!&#34;  Guess ya can't beat a better review than that!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|One more left can't wait for the movie!<br />Guess I have to settle with the third book for  now OH my!

B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is a ridiculous amount of fun!! Good fun, challenging levels, I'd have to say I like this better  &quot;Cut the Rope&quot;!! Get it while it's free!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great book.  like all Vince Flynn´s book is full of action and as they call it a page turner. i am waiting for his next book
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game I enjoyed it and it was nice that it was not only hidden object, but also there was a story behind it. also liked the fact that I could play for 5 minutes or 20. and still came back to where I left off.
B007LB2B3K|4.0|First heard this band on SiriusXM about five years ago, before they started getting regular airplay. Dude has a weird voice, but it grows on you.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Better then the the 80s flick .  Close to the comics and would recommend to anyone just looking for a good shooter flick.
B001NIC0A6|3.0|The movie is great but the feed was not as good as it should have been. there weretoo many paues and the movie froze a few time while the sound kept going.
1400069289|5.0|I'm very much into psychology and there is a large part of me values entrepreneurship. I bought this book so that when I start my own business I am better able to influence ( or at least understand) people's behavior. I am only about half way through the book, but I have already learned a lot. Great book, can't wait to finish it.
1571200851|5.0|This book is wonderful.  Yes some instructions can be a little difficult to follow at times, but if you have a little origami with paper experience it helps.  You can always try projects with paper then move to fabric.  If you stick with it, it makes a beautiful addition to your quilting skills.  Have made several projects with this book.  One of my best quilting investments.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I've watched the season three times, because then I can notice the sets and costumes. It goes without saying that Jon Hamm is not hard to look at!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Whether you understand the techno terms complete or not the reader should not be discouraged. This is a fantastic read on par with Apollo 13. Well done Andy
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I had never heard of this book until the movie came out amidst fanfare and hype. I thought it was for kids until several of my professional friends revealed they had read and enjoyed it. So, bowing to a peer pressure of sorts, I started reading and was captivated by the storyline in this futuristic fantasy /social commentary. I read straight through - as my friends warned me I would want to do - and found it a quick, enjoyable read. My only problem is that the book ends in a sort of cliffhanger but I'm not that captivated that I want to read books two and three.
B006YRVY2G|5.0|of what is still to come.  I absolutely love the series and only wish there were more episodes and that Series 3 was already out.<br /><br />The music gives me something to look forward to the end of 2013.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I had to read this book for a Leadership Class for my work.  It was a very moving book.  I highly recommend it.
1481251880|5.0|I've been reading so many books lately its sometimes hard to really write a good review that doesn't sound like the ones I've already written.  There's a lot of so-so books out there, ones you liked but easily could forget.  This was not one of those.  Holder and Sky were very developed characters with a solid story that kept me interested to the end.  Not all of the book was happiness, but believable and in certain instances gut wrenching.  I so look forward to other books from Colleen Hoover.
0440246016|5.0|I've never been disappointed with any of the books, I've read by Lee Child thus far.  It's the typical good guy wins story.  Not quite a police procedural but there is lots of police policy in the Jack Reacher series.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Enjoyed book.  Makes me want to read more about sigma force-get back story too.  Liked the blend of historical info and the various geographical locations.  I could visually see these places in my mind.  Strong action and fast pace kept me entertained.

B0083Z614S|5.0|It is a beautiful classic that keeps your interest . I would recommend my children read this story when they get of age.
0062082353|4.0|Chris Kyle is a man that absolutely loves his country. He was tormented by the separation<br />of his duty as a Seal and that of his family. He could have taken out more bad guys which was his duty if not for<br />the politics. As Gen. Patton said you win a war by making the other poor bastard die for his country and that is what Chris was trained to do.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|From start to finish this felt like a live action film! Music was great! The art work had the feel of the graphic novel completely. Part one and this one, part 2, are for any bat lover,\\"a must see\\" and for that matter, a must own.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season three is shaping up to be as wonderful as season's one and two.  With a few new characters and interesting story line's, it is sure to be an exciting ride.
B003L77GGK|5.0|If your a show fan this is a awesome buy! The extras are soooo funny and well worth the buy.
1592402038|5.0|I bought this for my aunt for christmas. A few years back I bought a hardcover version for myself and showed it to my aunt. She wanted to read it after me, but I never got around to reading it because I started school. For christmas I decided to buy this for my aunt instead of giving her my copy, she loved it and has no doubt finished reading it already.

B0039TAHMA|5.0|When I bought Lord of Thr Rings, I knew it was a good movie, but now I know it's an amazing movie! With tons of action, but also personal moments, also it have some romance going on throughout the whole series!
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time! It up there in my favorites with Dogma, Die Hard, and the Fugitive.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I decided I wanted to start tracking my spending a little on my Kindle and so I downlaoded this handy program to help me with my grocery shopping.  (Can't take the computer with me).  It does what I need it to do and for the right price.  It is a little difficutl to use at times but considering it's a downsized program from Excel and Word I'm happy with it.  I saw a lot of bad reviews on other programs similar to this that scared me away.  I'm happy I went with this one because I really haven't had too many issues with it.
0061906220|5.0|Great book for all ages. Catchy tune, and predictable text make it a fun read.  I will be buying other Pete the Cat books!!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This is my second book by Ken Follett that I have read this month and it was a fantastic thriller. If you like world war 2 scenarios, you will like this book.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I can't stop playing! I love it. The coins regenerate fast enough that you can keep playing forever. It is just challenging enough to keep you hooked without baking you buy things or frustrating you.
B008GANNIC|5.0|This album is one of there greatest yet..The more I listen to it the more I love it!!!<br />P.O.D. is my all time fav band!!!
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|Outstanding!  Mr Gaimen delivers on so many levels. While almost all are noteworthy,  pay especial attention to \\"Chivalry\\", it is simply a treat.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The style in which this book was written was very interesting and novel.  It held my interest to the very end and was never predictable.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book gives an excellent overview of our current food system (Big Ag) and helped me sort truth from myth. As Pollan clarifies his thoughts and feelings on the issues, I was able to do the same. And he includes health, environmental, and spiritual/emotional aspects of the subject as well. An excellent resource, and very well-written.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Inspiring and perfect...this book is relatable Chbosky keeps the reader on his toes throughout ever letter Charlie writes. An amazing read.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very good show , entertaining , keeps you on your toes , can't wait for the new season , must watch !
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I was not familiar with The Original Series. I thought it was corny and campy. I'm more a Next Generation girl. I got this collection as a gift for my husband who is a true blue fan.<br />Well, I still think it's corny and campy but now, in a good way and I'm now a fan as well. The remastering is truly well done. The images are now (according to the original people who were working on them) closer to what they wanted to achieve. The special effects have been revamped and even though my fan of a hubby thinks that it sometime takes away from the whole thing, I think it adds quite a bit. We are used to being dazzled by amazing special effects and the remastering has added that to a series that was great to begin with.<br />The special features are full of amazing info and they answer questions such as \\"how did they do that?\\", \\"Who came up with that?\\"<br />A really good buy!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Starts slow, but don't give up. Really good book, totally not what I expected.  Real life experiences and keeps you captivated throughout.
B009D95IJM|2.0|I ordered two of these books as gifts. The book itself is really funny and great.<br />The jackets of the books both had stickers on the back covering the barcode that were partially torn off and dirty.<br />The bottom of both books have large marker marks on them that extend onto the front cover. Disappointed.<br />Look like they came from the bottom of the bargain bin.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I love most of the Scarpetta novels.  But enough with everyone being out to get Kay, Lucy,  Benton, or Marino.
B0016CTX68|5.0|Finally bought as MP3, Let It Bleed really is one of the absolute best Stones albums, Love in Vain, Country Honk, and all the others!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing story. Full of twists and turns, every time I thought I had the plot figured out there would be another twist. This book was a jaw dropper. As usual no complaints from Colleen hoover's writing style.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I already had the DVD set and I've watched them several times, it is one of my favorite classics, this BBC production especially. The Blu-ray set is unbelievable. The colors jump out and the clarity is great.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like John Grisham.  At times, I got lost in his story.  It is an involved plot that doesn't play out until the end.  Good story!<br />a good read!!
0634089358|5.0|excellent book and ED Friedlund is a great bass player and teacher i most certainly buy more from him at a later date
B001BPJJ1E|1.0|The worst copy I've even seen. Take your time and order what other commentator says about a PAL copy from Amazon.co.uk The magic the movie itsefl can have, will be vanished as soon as you play this copy. I'm stuck with a movie I do not want anymore.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After I read the The Hunger Games, I thought to myself, what else could transpire that could take up 2 more book?! Suzanne Collins delivers an amazing and well-written tale that at the same time both satisfies me and leaves me wanting more. A MUST read!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|wow!!!!!!!!!! its the greatest game ever lol creeper so awesome lil u got to get this game and its FUN
B00493E1GI|4.0|Ok, in reading  the book, I felt the main character was whiney, spoiled and irritating. A few months after the movie came out I decided to watch it being a HUGE Javier Bardem fan. HE, was amazing in this, Juila Roberts, just ok, she really didn't fit the part in my opinion. The locations the movie was set is was great and true to form. Loved the music too. I bought this movie so i can watch it when I miss Italy or need to see that handsome JB!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!!!!! Colleen has done an amazing job on this book...I was unable to put it down! Holder is one of a kind, and intense. Sky is a survivor, and intense. Hope 'Les', is the most intense I have ever felt. Thank you Colleen Hover!!!!

But movies from Amazon warehouse Always work!!
0345803493|3.0|Like others the repetition drives me nuts! ( Arguing about food, biting of the lip, the sex) I actual ended up skipping over the 46688733147 sex scene's. We get it the sex it good, but the author didnt need to go into every single detail ever single time! ON WITH THE  ACTUAL STORY PLEASE!....which is actually very good. I can't  to read the third book
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun and not too hard to beat.  Not sure the difference in the two delas but still play it often
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I chose this book because it didn't have a expected outcome as far as the heroine story. It kept me interested and wanting more. Not too graphic and good story telling. I would definitely recommend this book to others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book of the series.  I enjoyed how Suzanne Collins predicts the world to come.  It's the original. READ IT!!!!!!!!
0425252868|5.0|There are many great stories from World War II.  This isn't a great one.  This is the greatest of them all.  Be uplifted by the story of how bright the human heart can shine in the darkest of hours.  Make this book your next read.
B00074CBMY|1.0|Let me say right off hand, I am a huge fan of Joe Cocker. This album, however seemed to be &#34;phoned in.&#34; Most of the songs were all wrong for Joe especially James Taylor's &#34;I don't Want to be Lonely Tonight.&#34; One of the worst things on an 11 song album was that the song at the beginning and end was the same song! &#34;Chain&#34; was more of what Cocker usually does well, but a whole album wasn't worth one good song.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's ok if your really board and have nothing else to do I would rather read or search the internet

B007712XAU|5.0|I have watched each episode of each season many many times. The manor is gorgeous. The landscape is beautiful scenic English countryside. The costumes are so remarkable! I just love all the fashions of each era. The sense of humor is playful. The intrique keeps you wanting more and more!

B007C94XG4|5.0|Great family movie.  My two grandsons age 6 and 7 want to watch it every time they come over. Music is wonderful
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best of the best. People who like Temple Run should try Subway Surfers. It has powerups it has multipliers just like Temple Run. Best app ever.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|excellent read.  Story contained love for one s family and outsiders, a struggle to get through bad harsh times, and mistreatment .  Read book in just a couple of days.  Hard to put down.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book just like all his other books.  I have never been disappointed in a Jack Reacher novel yet.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven keeps you on edge for start to finish and the suspense keep you wanted to read more. A book that is hard to put down.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|THIS IS THE HAPGOOD TRANSLATION and the rating is for the translation, not the novel. Amazon doesn't seem to like to list the translators but it can make a huge difference.  I just got a Kindle, and having read Hunchback several years ago and having the Signet Classics Les Mis waiting on my shelf for a while, I decided this would be a good first hurdle for the Kindle.  The hardcopy is so huge! Along the way I wondered why I seemed to be reading so slowly and having to re-read sections -- was I not adapting to the Kindle? -- and then I finally came across a phrase in this translation that really didn't make any sense at all.  Maybe a word-for-word translation rather than an interpretation? - \\"...the great art: to make a little render to success the sound of a catastrophe...\\" I had another free download of the book, and found exactly the same translation. In the Signet Classics Fahenstock/MacAfee translation, however, it was in perfectly good English: \\"...the great art, to give a success something of the sound of a catastrophe...\\"  Here's what's annoying: if I pull up the Signet Classics version on Amazon, it has link to buy it in Kindle edition, but the LINK'S TO THIS COMPLETELY INFERIOR TRANSLATION! Amazon doesn't offer a Kindle version of the Signet Classics translation so I'm looking elsewhere and using conversion software if I need to, then picking up where I left off in the Hapgood translation.  Free is fine for public domain English-language books (Dickens, Twain) but I've learned my lesson with translations and will pay for premium.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I must say the \\"Hunger Games Trilogy\\" was not what I expected.  I thought it would be the usual ordinary books I have read in the past but they were unlike any other books I have read. These books took me in like no other books, they are amazing, thrilling and the most exciting books you will ever read. Words can not describe the characters and the connections. It was as if you were part of the book living out  everything the characters went through. Truly amazing.<br /><br />A definite must read!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a great game. It's a bit addictive but it's fun. I wish it wassail a little more interactive but what can you expect for an app.
B008RTE066|5.0|Nicely packaged time capsule of a brief musical spark. Sounds great and the commentary gives an intimate feel to the experience.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because it makes you think and it challenges you in every way.  I recommend this to everyone you won't be disappointed.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very good love story. Women especially will enjoy. Easy reading and I couldn't put it down until I finished. Enjoy!
B00006FDCD|3.0|When I was younger I loved the movie IT so naturally when I saw it on Amazon I had to purchase it, but it just not the same.
B00846REIS|5.0|This should be read before Reflected inYou..Very similar to 50 Shades of Grey.  I would highly recommend this book to women.
0525953728|3.0|If you are interested in recent history, Owens' story is for you. If you're looking for emotion and how what he experienced impacted his life, his relationships, his psyche...you won't find it.<br /><br />Perhaps I am biased; I am more interested in \\"after the war\\" and what soldiers experience when the bullets aren't flying. I think (and I certainly hope) that killing people (and seeing them killed, or friends killed) would have a psychological impact on a person, Navy SEAL or not.<br /><br />But this book was pretty much all factual. I looked everywhere, but only twice did I detect emotion (one of which was disgust directed toward Osama bin Laden). Only once did he mention the families of the SEALs, and that was basically \\"it's better not to say too much.\\" Huh?? For me, not a very satisfying read.<br /><br />I would have had more respect for him if he'd shared his inner turmoil (the final chapter hints at it, so I guess there was some) and how he came to grips with what he'd seen and done. I mean, if you're going to write a book on this topic, why not lay it all on the line?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just watched zero dark thirty while that gave me the intelligence side of the story, this has given me the seals view, just an amazing story. Not my typical reading material, but well with it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Exciting story line.. Keeps you on the edge the whole time.Loved E.L. James whole series.<br />A must read. Need to read all 3 books in the series.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I thought this book was very good it was the opposite of eldest Poalini did a very good job of writing this book i can't wait to read inheritance
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a very good book. Was suspenseful and thrilling but still a romantic story. Beware...things are not as they seem in this book. The ending is the best. The movie should be a must go see like The Notebook or A Walk to Remember.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing!!!! Love this trilogy with the all my heart and soul and it comes at a perfect time in my own life . All is well now, thank you Suzanne Collins!
1400079276|4.0|A complex, fantastical novel with philosophical musings and literary tropes discussed throughout. Translated to English from Japanese, it is a novel that has the distinct feel of its country’s setting.<br /><br />About:  There are a a number of story lines in this complex and layered story, with the two primary ones based around Kafka Tamura and Mr. Nakata. The story starts with fifteen year old Kafka in the process of running away from his home in Tokyo, perhaps due to his emotionally unavailable father or to find his mother and adopted sister, who left when Kafka was little. As a usual sort of intelligent teen with some unusual attributes (he has an imaginary boy named crow who advises him on various issues), he takes his “road trip” to escape.<br /><br />Then there is Mr. Nakata, a lovely “simple” older man who cannot read but can amazingly speak to cats (and boy are the cats amusing and well done). He has a “Zen” like characteristic to his attitude and also to his speaking quality in the audio version. Although the two men never actually meet, they move inside the story with their own personal quests overlapping frequently - with the intricate connections becoming clear as the story progresses.<br /><br />Thoughts:  Kafka on the Shore has a variety of  themes which may intrigue potential readers, as they did me. Some of these are - cats; World War II; philosophical musings; discussions around literature; the use and discussion of literary tropes such as metaphor, allegory and more; and the arts, including music. Murakami addresses gender and feminism in an indirect way. He has also woven in Asian spiritual themes such enlightenment and rebirth, and some interesting imagery regarding body fluids. The strongest thread in the story is its connection with the mythical story of Oedipus, that creates an unusual twist within the book. For a bit about this myth, here is a short definition:<br /><br />As a Freudian psychological metaphor describing son–father psychosexual competition for possession of mother, the Oedipus complex derives from the 5th-century BC Greek mythological character Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father, Laius, and marries his mother… (via Wikipedia)<br /><br />It’s interesting that several of Murakami’s major themes for Kafka on the Shore are metaphor and the myth of Oedipus, and that this shocking complex is also considered a metaphor in its definition above.<br /><br />I felt that the readers’ voices for the characters where done very well, giving life to the various and well developed characters. I liked that so many of the themes stimulated an intellectual side for me and that better yet I learned a few things. However, I had a conflict – there were too many sexual references and scenes, some were too detailed. Indeed the end of the novel became more about our main protagonist Kafka’s sexual desires and experiences than anything else. Otherwise a very worthy read and well done in this audio version. I give this intriguing audio book 4 stars; more if the sex had been a bit more subtle.ther psychosexual competition for possession of mother, the Oedipus complex derives from the 5th-century BC Greek mythological character Oedipus, who unwittingly kills his father, Laius, and marries his mother… (via Wikipedia)<br /><br />It’s interesting that several of Murakami’s major themes for Kafka on the Shore are metaphor and the myth of Oedipus, and that this shocking complex is also considered a metaphor in its definition above.<br /><br />I felt that the readers’ voices for the characters where done very well, giving life to the various and well developed characters.

B0025T6EY0|5.0|Love David Duchovny and all the actors in this show... nothing better than a bad boy with a big heart!!!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Carry On will be the next hit. I like the percussion element in all their songs. Fun to drive to.
B00942Y6WI|4.0|I don't want to say a comment.  Why can't I just assess using the stars?  You should change this requirement.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked the graphics and enjoyed the story line. I highly recommend this game. I liked that I could play at my own pace.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I bought this book, because I was in a hurry and just picked one of the top sellers. My mistake, I did not read the summery.<br />This is the story of a 16 year old girls who just does not behave like any 16 year old would. Neither does her new friend! The whole story has many ridicolous very twists and tons of uncredible statements.<br /><br />Buy this book, if you're below 12 years or believe that there is only one american girl who does not know what LOL means (&#34;just to give an example&#34;).
2070643026|5.0|It came on time and in good shape. Reviews on Amazon were not good, so I am looking forward to seeing where the translation fails.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It's true that the subject matter is dark, but this was a surprisingly good read.  Laugh out loud funny more than once, which was completely unexpected.  It had a bit of the &#34;Dawson's Creek&#34; curse in that the teenage characters were all more insightful and well spoken than your average physicist, but that's easy enough to forgive because the story is so well crafted and the writing really pulls you in.
1451695195|5.0|Since reading this book, I have bought it for 5 other people (I only got it a month ago).  In 2008 I lost my daughter to homicide and have been looking for answers ever since.  I'm not one to trust blindly but this book gave me a concrete way of understanding the author's experience which brought me an incredible amount of comfort.<br />What a difference it has made to my life.  Thank you!
B009RI4FRU|4.0|If you like Wes Anderson's multiple story lines, quirky dialog, and well cast ensemble movies then you'll enjoy this. The younger actors were as good as the adults, which made the movie.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie made me feel so much.  It was a sweet and painful and improbable love story between developing pre-teens.  A time when everything is just so intense, especially true when you are \\"different.\\"  I rooted for them and really enjoyed the other story lines and cast. It's a comedy and there were VERY funny moments. Excellent acting and imaginative almost surreal cinematography.  Highly recommend.
B008EQIK90|2.0|I never watched the original series but knew of it and who was in it. The Depp role was great, but the comedy and quality of this movie was hit or miss for me.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Could not get into the book at all and the way it was written. Too formal for me.i will see the movie
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Pretty nice retelling of the story. Good special effects, futuristic, dystopian future a la blade runner, etc. The ending was a little over-the-top-Michael Bay-multiple climactic scenes.Good action flick.
B000V8MQZI|5.0|Foo Fighters!  Need to say more?  If you are a Foo Fighters fan, you need to get this album for your collection.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|funniest movie ever ! especially if you like smoking pot and using cocaine !!! this movie shows great examples of that to your children watching the movie !!
B004FRX0MY|2.0|I was shocked to see that one click ordering is automatically activated even if it is turned OFF in your account settings. Please look into this bug. I discovered this when purchasing an MP3 album. Sometimes a customer needs to select a particular billing account - credit card, and address, then verify they are correct.
B00428CCPW|5.0|I love this record!  I bought it for my sister for Christmas, and it's so cool to hear Taylor's songs on vinyl.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I love military novels based on reality. Builds respect for the military. We'll see if Zero Dark Thirty compares.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I can't give enough praise to NCIS. NCIS is television done right. It's one show that I consistently watch. I even watch the re-runs. Season 10 is off to an amazing start and I can barely wait for the new episode to air each week.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|This story has been overdone and the character development is pretty much shallow if not predictable.  The movie is not relatively scary either.  The creep factor is not really strong.<br /><br />Spend your money elsewhere.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The only thing wrong is that you have to wait for the next episode, lol. Hopefully they continue this for several more seasons
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is not only an amazing love story but also a suspenseful book as well. A must read!! I loved it!!
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|Rio is a cute movie, that is fun to watch. It has lots of good musical numbers that we get to watch along with a couple of budding romances. The story is about the illegal exotic bird trade with perhaps the last two birds of their kind captured by the traders. The male was brought to Brazil by his owner who was convinced by a conservationist that he was needed to mate with the conservation group's female. The conservation center is broken into and the pair of rare birds are stolen. Most of the rest of the movie are the attempts of the two birds, who end up chained together and manage to escape from the smugglers, to break the chain and get get back to the jungle (for the female) or the owner (for the male). Did I mention that the birds can talk with one another and with other animals? The male is way out of his element--he can't even fly--which leads to a lot of hilarious situations. Spoiler--you may want to skip this piece of commentary, although you can see it coming in the plot: Meanwhile, the owner and conservationist and the \\"inside man\\" (who has regretted what he did), are trying to track down the two birds. They have their own little adventures.<br />The 3D is good in this version, color is great. Worth watching although some jaded older kids may not be as excited by it.
B005544V6A|4.0|At first wasn't so impressed but after a few episodes it started getting better. I gave 4 stars because some characters are just cold or bad at acting.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|Although I have not finished reading the 800 pages - I am well on my way to completing one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. Reading it helps to ground you on what took place during the 1900's which laid the foundation of what's been happening for the last 100 plus years. It gives you the insight on how and why our polictical parties have their current agendas. This book makes me feel like my head was on backwards and it slowly starts turning in the right direction as I continue reading.<br /><br />I am also watching the video version just to reinforce what I have read.  Get this book if you  want to learn about a different view of American history; the one they don't (afraid) teach you in school - Enjoy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|a very complex and well crafted story that kept leading the reader in different directions, only to find their expectations unfulfilled and a new path beckoning
B004JMY312|5.0|Being 30 years old, this is an absolute classic.  This movie has it all and than it adds Bette Midler.  It is a great story and a must watch around Halloween time each year.  Hilarious, fun, and ever so slightly touching Hocus Pocus will give you everything you want.  Even if it isn't Halloween and you are discovering that you haven't seen this film yet, stop what you are doing and enjoy.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I wasn't so sure if I would enjoy this game,  but I'm glad I tried it out!  It is great fun for fans of the show. &lt;3

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I have to say this is the only mic I have ever bought to use with a cam for motovlogging while riding my motorcycle and it does great and the on and off switch is really useful. When I get a call on my Scala bluetooth head set from my partner I can cut the mic off and talk and not have to worry about recording my converstations. Anyway I would tell anyone to buy this product the sound is wonderful and really has great sound quality.
B000001DQI|5.0|The music CD was reasonably priced and the &#34;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&#34; is a classic album.  The CD made a nice Christmas gift for a family member.

B008Z9L94O|5.0|In evaluating all the negative reviews for people who have the vinyl issue of this great album, there are many questions to be asked of the turntables used in playing vinyl LP's period. First, do most people know that a tonearm on a turntable is not perfect? Almost ALL tonearms have tracking errors at the beginning and especially at the end of playing ANY LP. The only tonearms that actually play without tracking errors are called 'linear tracking tonearms'. Second, is your cartridge worn out and did you know a worn cartridge will cause errors in tracking and cause more distortion in the tonearm error zones? Is your cartridge even mounted properly and in the proper alignment with your tonearm? Is the counter weight adjustment set up properly to that particular cartridge manufacturer's specs? Is your anti-skating adjustment set up properly? Again, ALL this will cause tracking errors and more distortion in the tonearm error zones. And even more important, do most people know that a standard thickness 12\\" LP is approx around 100-120 grams and that anything heavier than this with thicker vinyl that you MUST have your tonearm vertical tracking adjustment changed to track the LP properly so it does not create distortion? I know a lot pf people will probably say 'but the other 180 gram LP's I play don't do this and I haven't adjusted my turntable any differently than playing standard LP's'. I believe this album has an excessively hot dynamic 'low end' and at times there is a distortion sound effect used by the band. The low end frequencies on an LP are the most difficult to track for ANY turntable. A turntable that is not set up properly will be distorting this extreme low end frequency and in some cases even skip. In my opinion, anyone who does not have their turntable tuned up regularly (just like your car) or have a VTA (vertical tracking adjustment) on their turntable for non-standard LP's, they should buy the CD version. I can't believe there has not been anyone who has mentioned these fine details yet about turntables. Luckily Amazon is not knowledgeable on this either or a lot of people who received credit on their returns would not have. How do I know this? I asked the local audiophile LP dealer here and they have not received even one return on this vinyl version album yet and have sold many many copies.
0765325950|5.0|I have now read all 14 books in this series, while many have told me that they are just too long I have no problem with that. In 2007 Robert Jordon passed from this earth & Brandon Sanderson took up his mantle with extensive notes and outlines, Sanderson has finished the series with books 12, 13 & 14.<br /><br />1990 was the year of The Eye of the World became a NY Times Best Seller, it took me by storm in 92 as I quickly read #1 and them #2 The Great Hunt which is my personal favorite of the whole series. After reading Dragon Reborn (The Wheel of Time, Book 3). I decided to get the Hardcover editions and have been a first day buyer of the rest of the series.<br /><br />I also have 9 of the 14 Audible editions. That said, here is my opinion of #14.<br /><br />The novel is of epic scope and wraps up all the sub plots from throughout the series. It could have been twice as big, but editing keeps it at 908 pages. So some minor characters only get a page or two. Still it is a must have for any Wheel of Time fan. Not everything turns out as I had hoped, but I think all events went as both Jordon and Sanderson wanted.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0765325950 A Memory of Light (Wheel of Time (Tor Hardcover))]]
B007R3BFR0|5.0|I've been listening to garbage since they put out their first album, and most of their output since then has been excellent, and this album is no exception - In fact, I'd say it's some of their best work.  To put it simply - If you're already a Garbage fan, you won't be disappointed.  I also like the look and feel of the album itself.  The gate-fold sleeve and record jackets are heavy and sturdy, not flimsy like some record covers, and feature great artwork in really vibrant colors. And the records themselves are just as solid.  These are some of the thickest, heaviest slabs of vinyl I've seen (which means more durability and a longer lifespan - not to mention they just feel great when you pick them up.)  So all in all - a fantastic record, both in the content of the songs, and the quality of the materials.
1451648537|5.0|Review by Donn G. Ziebell, Ph.D., Never kicked by a horse nor a mule, and author of the non-fiction Amazon book, \\"My Letters to a Prisoner ---I had not met.\\" Become an insider to the humor and private life of the writer's encounters and adventures home and abroad; a selection from over 100 letters written in six years.<br /><br />The most interesting words employees applied to their leader, Steve Jobs, was \\"he is in his reality distortion field.\\" This was applied when Steve was thinking and speaking outside the realm of rationality. The odd thing was, it was accepted and expected, and coworkers were frequently y pulled into his irrationality and challenged to create, adapt, and change concept restraints to invent or reinvent new products. His products changed our cultural and societal landscape in terms of the way computers could work, and how communications systems would work in ways as never before. This is a must read Amazon book<br /><br />His management style many times was very brutal to employees and extended to the far end of the emotional spectrum where he would easily cry if he was not getting his way in negotiations or meetings; even in Board of Directors meetings. I can't imagine how the emotionally charged atmosphere within Apple both day or night had to cause countless types of responses within the entire Apple culture. Even to a point where an employee would respond by willingly walking away from huge likely sums of personal wealth.<br /><br />Steve Jobs' early life antics and travel to find a spiritual life guide in India, his experiences with drugs and relationships, clung onto him in subliminal ways throughout his career. His being an out-of-wedlock child and placed as an infant into adoption,  carried an emotional price of which he denied to exist. The author of this book did a fantastic recording and of telling the life story of Steve Jobs that is detailed and absolutely riveting. I enjoyed Jobs interactions in the world around him but he is one person for whom I would not be able to work. Our personal reality distortion fields would never mesh!person for whom I would not be able to work. Our personal reality distortion fields would never mesh!
B007R41E8O|3.0|I think this is a decently fun little game, but it seemed to fall short of it's own trajectory.  The story started out okay, but became lame pretty quickly.  The puzzles were fun but pretty easy.  There was a lot of tedious running around for necessary objects, and the hint button is a must to help sort out where to go next as there is no real logic for where things should be.  The ending is a nice twist if you don't mind the fact that it makes no sense at all.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works just like the description detailed. Easy to use and legible. Great app to have to make my kindle more complete in its function.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best stories I have ever read. What a great entertaining book. I highly recommend anyone to buy this.  It is a long read but how King writes always makes you completely involved in the story. If you are looking for a story to get lost in this is it!!!
B002ZIAC26|5.0|I bought this because 'Bloom' was so magical. I was not disapointed. Soooo glad this album has become part of my life.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I somehow missed the last episode of Season 2 and was happy to discover that Amazon.com offered a download for $1.99. Just wanted to catch up with the story of Downton Abbey but was extremely surprised with the quality of the video. The picture clarity, depth and color were outstanding. The audio was exceptional. Much better than watching on my HD television.  If I miss another episode I will not hesitate to purchase it on Amazon.com.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I. love love love love love love love love love love love this game I think it is better than temple run deffinetly get it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one.  One of the best series I've read in years.  I'm sure it will be a movie as well.
071815780X|2.0|OK, looking at the other reviews here I am prepared to admit it's me and not necessarily Jamie, but I found these recipes challenging.  Having dot points instead of clearly set out numbers makes it difficult to follow where you are up to, and the method jumps from one part of the meal to another then back again.  There are also a LOT of ingredients and equipment, my husband (who gets to wash up when I cook) is ready to divorce me if I cook another of these meals.  Having said that, the ingredients are fresh and most of the meals are innovative.  I guess I just need to improve my own skill level!
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this at the last minute because I like my kids (who are now teenagers) to have one board game every Christmas.<br />They were happy I did! We all enjoyed playing it, and it is a nice change from ipod  and x box games!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is not the book to start with, I encourage you to buy the trilogy collection to feel the impact of the story as Ms James portrays it.  It was an excellent read.  Well written: hot, steamy, exerotic and visionary.  On the same token flipped, you can find:  pleasure, love, new experiences, trust and passion.  Things are not what they ways seem... somethings there's disappointment, expectations and dreams you might have for others... Read the books for the story not for the sex.  If you don't take the sex out of context, you will find Ana's permission and your experience, whether good or bad, it's your experience about her sexual permission.  Again, read it for what it is and keep the story moving.  I love great stories... This book is a defininate \\"Love Story\\".  Very exciting, deep and passionate - from it's beginning to it's end.  Ms James, you are artfully crafted to tell a story.  Thank you for this experience. (R W Vellere)
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|This will entertain you for one day, then it gets pretty old.  It feels like you are playing the piano. It is not easy.

0345803493|5.0|Must buy these books, they are great! I had read reviews before buying them and wasnt sure if I would like these. Some people were pretty harsh on their reviews but I found them to be great books by a great author.  Hopefully the author will keep writing more like this series.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|The book in itself is delicious. And it has not been my experience that this classics are correctly formatted for the kindle, but this is not the case. The text is perfect and the original ilustrations are really great!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was a pretty quick read.  I enjoyed the insider perspective.  He has the ability to put you right in the middle of the action without a lot of fluff.
B00633W614|5.0|Loved this book...now can't wait for the next book of the Clifton Chronicles in May 2013.  Will order right away.
0345472322|5.0|this book is changing me.  I like it and have shared it with other people (teachers, my wife).  We all can grow.
B004X4R3FE|5.0|Excellent movie coupling history, humor and drama. Gives a new insight to life of the &#34;royals&#34;. Well worth the watch!
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I was really disappointed with this book, as I have read others by this author and enjoyed them. I just found the main character tiresome, and her undercover assignment uninteresting. She was to induce an up and coming author to unknowingly work for the British government. What I found to be funny, though, was when she was reading  some of the author's work, she summarized the plots. Those plots were more interesting than Sweet Tooth..
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is my top favorite game. After looking at the screen shots before I got the game, I knew I was already gonna love it! I recommend this game to everyone!
030758836X|4.0|This is really good reading. It is one book you hate to put down. Very easy reading and different. May read more of Gillian Flynn's books.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have never read a cold case story that caused such a feeling of conviction as did this book.<br />Excellant work.

B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game us fun and fast-paced. Any who seek a good multiplayer tablet game should consider this. It's combat system and loot us great.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This music is so beautiful!! I can visualize scenes of the movie when I listen. &#34;. Supermassive Black Hole&#34; takes me to when the Cullen's play baseball. A super cool song.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Best app I've downloaded! Free version gives great taste of the game, and leaves you wanting more! Far too easy to waste hours playing it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down!!! Can't wait to start book 2!!! Movie doesn't do justice to the action scenes.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a sad yet sweet story.  I particularly enjoyed the setting...1970's Ireland.  Felt the rural Ireland depicted was authentic and ripe with colloquial verbiage.  Particularly fond of James and sympathized with his longings born of a bleak childhood.  The quiet kindness between the characters was warm and moving.  Dramatic and satisfying conclusion.
B007HO392S|5.0|Always great, love her music. Mix in with pop and country! Choose from soft, to fast pace music as you like it, but gotta be a country music lover to enjoy the pop!

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I absolutely love Lana Del Rey. She is amazing and it is represented in this song. I listen to this all day. Every day.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is not my usual gene, and I admit that I started with the series because of the movie. The story tells like it could be real, which is to say that at no point did I feel that I was reading about some super human detective or some ridiculous plot line. The antagonists didn't make any glaring errors that cause the suspension of disbelief to crumble.<br /><br />Overall a very entertaining read. I won't be rushing into the next novel straight away, but I am curious to read the second book in the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love love love this book. Lots of twists and turns. It keeps you on your toes. I couldn't put it down. Stayed up till 3am to finish it. :)
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|The fight scenes are IMPRESSIVE !<br /><br />Forget Jason Bourne.  Watch this.<br /><br />Usually, Soderbergh movies have good music.  The only letdown in this move was sometimes this was hit and miss.
B00000DHR0|5.0|These Are special moments by Celine dion brings out the real meaning of Christmas through her wonderful voice. A must fit the season
B008XX6J4C|5.0|For old rockers who enjoy the works of ELP, Yes and Tull and now find ourselves looking for some new music with some substance....Here it is....Is it hard rock no, but it a wonderful mix of symphonic and classical talent mixed with New Age. Add in the fun of the Video's, and these guys are just plain fun to watch and listen to. I look forward to the future when they are writing some of their own music instead of rearranging existing tunes. But until that time comes, I'll take whatever these guys dish out. The measure of music is whether it moves you...these guys do that with every song...what more can you ask for.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|One wish the holiday album is sensational  Whitney is at her best. Love the arrangement  very upbeat wish she could do more
B007EECSFA|5.0|The further into the book, the more intriguing.  I think this is a great book for any book club to read.  Very well written!.
B000002A46|5.0|This album gives a real upbeat to the traditional Christmas songs.  Especially the spiritual songs. I sing them her way untol long after Christmas holiday
0756688701|5.0|I got this a before my son's 3rd birthday and oh boy it quickly became his favorite book for the next few months! He constantly wanted to look at the pictures! It has ALL the diecast models of ALL of the characters of the various Cars movies, Cars 2 and Mater Tall Tales, Air Mater, etc. Kids will love looking at all the colorful images and \\"read\\" about them. The descriptions are about the die casts and a bit about the character, but its not really a \\"story\\" to read for kids, more of a visual and learning the character's names.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this not knowing what to expect.  I was immediately taken with Sky.  The book twists and turns and keeps you wanting more!  I read this in less than 12 hours (I am new to reading, so this is good) staying up past 2am because I could not put it down.  I hope there will be a second book.  It is by far the best book I have read in a long time.  I immediately re-read it then loaned it to a friend who did the same.  This book is simply amazing!
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I can not stop listening to it! Their voices are magnificent. I saw them on a program, that they did not win, but at that time, I fell in love with them!.<br /><br />Great service from AMAZON!! love you guys!<br /><br />Odette Breton
B004QX07G4|5.0|The book was just like listening to what she talks about  on her show. Very funny. If you are a fan you will enjoy this book.
0262731541|3.0|You can go pretty deep into this book...a lot of science of course, but great historical information on cycling, physiology, nutritional aspects of performance. More of a book that is a reference for deeper thinking readers.
1451695195|4.0|I like this book, was reading it at a time when my brother-in-law was at the end of his life.  Did bring some peace about his death and being written by a neurosurgeon, it brought some validity to life after death.
0439023491|5.0|So far the story keeps going from the first book. The trilogy of the Hunger Games books will explain alot then the movies. It is best always to read the books first then watch the movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I chose this book because of the outstanding ratings and I was in total agreement.  What a first kiss!!!!!  It gave me butterflies!  I rarely write reviews but this one was a must.  I rarely read a book twice but this one will be one for that list.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|The Camel Club rides again.  I love the characters by Baldacci.  This story is fascinating and a fun read.  It is a convoluted and I kind of got tired of all the red herrings.  But the wonderful characters an intriguing story line carries you thorough.  If you liked the previous Oliver Stone stories this book is a must read.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great on my Kindle Fire!  Easy to load, great for the whole family!<br />The little green guy is pretty cute.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I like this show, it brings together all of the fairy tales i grew up with. It's a great show to watch with the family too, since i cant watch my other shows (Walking Dead, Dexter, Etc) around the little ones :(
159514188X|5.0|I wanted to know who was going to be next ! ,i couldn't wait until the end to find out who is the 13th person . This book was definitely a page turner and i would LOOOVEE to see this as a movie if it could be possible .
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I didnt think i'd like the first season since i heard it wasnt going to be a continuation of the first season but i totally got in to it. I kinda wish that the same story would continue into another season since i get way into it. But i guess its okay since some of the same actors are in diff episodes ;)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book!! Will make you laugh very hard (: I really hope he keeps writing more of these books! (:
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I just started watching this and i cant get enough! i got the first three episodes on Amazon (streamed on TV) then i decided to go out and buy the rest of the set. Cant wait til March for the 3rd Season!

B005P4PAVK|5.0|I dug on the first couple of seasons better but this show still cracks me up. Gimme more please :)
B006TVQU6C|4.0|only real con i can think of would be it not having removable/replaceable metal shield things on the back where your video card is placed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app because it is little space and there is over 100 games on there for free and you have to unlock them
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Expendables2 was, IMHO, better than the first one.  The story-line never really changes much in these types of films, but knowing that going in means that all you have to evaluate is how well they pull it off.......and I think Sly and the crew did an excellent job with Expendables2.  I particularly liked seeing many of the icons of action films (Chuck Norris; Arnold; Bruce), which I'll admit influenced my star rating.  Regardless, give the movie a view.
0307596885|5.0|I read this book and now have become Ms Munro's newest fan.  I checked out 3 books from the library of hers because I liked this collection of short stories so much.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|What a waste of money.  The story tries so hard to explain the time travel &#34;looping&#34; connection, that the whole thing becomes convoluted and boring.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt was excellent (but then again, he's a great young actor), but Bruce Willis looked very old and looked like he was sleep-walking through his part.  If you're an Amazon Prime member (or a Netflix member), wait till it comes there - don't buy this movie.
0316228532|5.0|This is a good book.  I was so pleasantly surprised at her writing skills.  I had her sterotyped with Harry Potter and sort of expected that mode of writing.  Mrs. Rowiling kept me reading constantly and at the same time I was worried what I was going to do when I finished the book because then I would not have anything to look forward to.  There is such a cast of characters and your feel as if you know each and everyone of them.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is one of those book series that I just have to complete.  Such a different world for escape everyday.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was so good but sad for all the dead and the end of the trilogy I hope to read more of Suzanne Collins
B005X5XIL0|2.0|After seeing the ratings, I thought this would be a great Bocelli concert - I own the others - but it did not live up to the rating - the NY philharmonic was great, as were the guest instumentalists, but the guest singers did not measure up, nor did the material chosen. Celine's performance was lackluster (especially in comparison to Heather Headley on the same song in the Tuscan concert). And home on the range in NYC? - give me a break! Buy the others, give this a pass
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Even free it was a disappointment. Go see the movie or stage play. Deleted from my kindle. Good luck if you try to enjoy it.
030758836X|3.0|I bought this book because of the reviews and the high rating in People Magazine. I will think twice before letting my opinion be swayed this way again. The story started out so slow and it took me almost to the middle of the book to get involved. Once I did, it was easier reading. The problem, however, was that I didn't care for either of the two main characters. When the reader has no emotional investment in the characters, there is no passion on the reader's part to root for anyone. Both the husband and the wife were not likable people, (but then, the author wanted you to not like them, I'm sure). It is not my favorite way of navigating through a story though, as I want to be invested in the characters and actually care about what happens to them -- that is what drives and motivates a reader to keep reading! I could not have cared less about the characters, what would happen or how it would end. Also, why does the author find it so important to put in so much smut language? That is not intelligent writing and it surely isn't an intelligent book. This goes to the library, not to be saved by me.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very inspirational book.  Makes heaven a place I want to be. Dr. Alexander had an unbelievable experience.  I recommened this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining.  When I heard about the series, I didn't think I'd be interested.  After watching the first episode, I was hooked.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I had seen Plague Inc. in my Amazon recommendations for a while. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing the app for $0.99, since from the description and some of the reviews I knew the goal of the game was to wipe out all of humanity with a virus. I didn't think a game with such a creepy goal would be fun at all. However, when I was purchasing a few apps, I decided to go ahead and give this game a try for $0.99, and I am definitely glad I did. This game has to be the best $0.99 I have spent on app purchases.<br />Even though the goal may be creepy, what makes this game fun is the strategy involved. You begin by infecting a country with your virus, and as it spreads and infects more people, you get \\"DNA points\\", which you can use to \\"evolve\\" your virus (giving it different abilities, like being resistent to antibioitics (under an \\"Abilities\\" tab), being able to spread through livestock or water (under a \\"Transmission\\" tab), or having a coughing or coma symptom (under a \\"Symptoms\\" tab)). You can also devolve the abilities, but you only get 2 DNA points back, even on something you spent over 30 points to get. You'll get DNA points by clicking on red and orange bubbles that randomly pop up, and also sometimes you will just randomly accumulate DNA points, though the faster people are infected the faster you get DNA points. Once your virus infects more people, humans will discover it and will eventually start working on a cure. Once a cure is found, the virus is usually quickly wiped out. Also, once a cure starts being worked on, blue cure bubbles (similar to the red and orange DNA point bubbles) will begin popping up, and if you click on them you can slow the cure. Some abilities you can give your virus will also help slow the cure. There are also random, ficitious news feeds that pop up that are fun to read (though after you play a few games they get old because the same ones tend to keep coming up).<br />While the game may seem simple, there is a lot of strategy involved, because you have to imagine what would happen in real life. For example, if you make your virus really deadly to begin with, humans will find it scary and work harder to eradicate it sooner. Also, you can make your virus so deadly that it will kill all its carriers before it has time to infect everyone, making you also lose the game. On the other hand, if you don't make it deadly, humans will die more slowly and have more time to come up with the cure. Thus, a lot of strategy is involved in trying to wipe out humans with a virus because you need to try to find abilities that will slow down people from making a cure, but also make sure it doesn't kill all its carriers too quickly. This can be challenging because some of the abilities that slow down the cure also are deadly (such as the coma symptom).<br />Also, at the end you can look at graphs showing how lethal your virus became over time, cure requirements, etc, and this is another cool part about the game.<br />I highly recommend this app to anyone who has a dollar to spare and is looking for a fun game to play, especially to someone who enjoys strategy games.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Absolutley love this game. Its very addicting. The challenge as it gets harder is what makes it so fun. Try it!!
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Ok, for die hard Kiss fans really, some interesting differences to the original album, but more than one bonus track would have been appreciated, and would have made the package seem like less of a cash in.  Otherwise, a great listen.
0553801473|1.0|The \\"Game of Thrones\\" series of books is absolutely terrible and frustrating.  I just finished book 5 and am angry that I kept reading.  Admittedly Martin has created an fascinating world and many great characters.  I was hooked from the start and expected to finish the series loving the books.  Instead I finished book 5 angry with myself for wasting all that time and with even more angry with the manipulative author.<br /><br />The main problem is that Martin ignores one of the basics of the story-telling arc.  The Climax. Often referred to as \\"The End.\\"  If a story is to big to be told in a single novel, we have the tradition of the trilogy.  In a series or a trilogy each book still wraps up most story lines with a hint of further challenges ahead.  These books end with major characters and plot lines dropped for hundreds or even thousands of pages.  After 5 books and several thousand pages, the fundamental story in still far from resolution.  I feel manipulated.  Martin has clearly concluded that he can milk us for the maximum amount of revenue without bothering to conclude this story.<br /><br />I read a lot and don't often write reviews.  This series is a waste of time.  Read \\"Dune\\", read Asimov's \\"Foundation Trilogy\\" read \\"Three Day Road\\", read anything.  But for the love of all that is good about books, stay AWAY from this series.  If I save even one reader with this warning it will all have been worthwhile.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|a sad, but well written story of today.  I liked the character development and connections of the two families and how their familial connections changed them after tragedy strikes.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Another excellent story from HBO about a fascinating Founding Father. I love another window into American Revolutionary history. While I might have enjoyed more scope of some of the events, the point of view telling of the story, which was primarily told through the eyes of John and his wife Abigail, was a very interesting way to tell this story!
B00427W67C|5.0|Many will argue with me but I feel that aside from the ridiculous and the surreal, the comedy in this film is extremely smart.  An excellent critique of the entire movie industry.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one instance where I do not really wish to try and put into words my feelings about a show. The reason is simply this, nothing I or anyone can really do justice by this production with mere words. I had to have it after seeing it, I watch it over and over. A great telling of a pivotal period in American and European history, as related by those who experienced it. Wonderful!
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I usually only read Christian fiction but I decided it might be nice to try reading some of the classics.  The reading is a little more difficult because of their different way of writing and the terms that we are unfamilar with but the themes and and content are great.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is a wonderful and amusing tale, surprising at times and an wonderful romp through familir and oft heard UFO stories and legends. I find I have to watch it at least once a week!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|People don't realize how common spouse abuse is. Most people just ignore things like this especially when it is the man abusing the wife. Most women think it is their fault somehow. This book was great in showing how a man can go crazy when he is in love with a woman. It's a ego thing with most men. I thought this book was a great read and can see why it became a movie. Great read!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This movie took me back to a childhood television favorite, &#34;The Time Tunnel&#34; where you might be taken to the past or the future, and as in one case, back to the wild west and cavalry and indian battles where aliens from the future were also involved. The sort iof television guaranteed to fire ones imagination. Cowboys and Aliens had a great cast, some of whom who I would not normally associate with a western, yet who were all stellar. The special effects were never predictable or tiring, but enhanced the story greatly! I loved this one!
B009E9QOEO|1.0|Wow!  what a horrendous production and recording.  Note for Led Z... Give it up boys.  Robert Plant lost his voice 40 years ago.  Jimmy page should be ashamed of himself, with the garbled distorded mess he cobbled together here. John P. couldn't even be heard on about half the notes. And for the people in charge of recording this joke...You've got to be kidding me.  It sounds like they had a cassette recorder setting about 300 feet back in the crowd.  Anybody expecting a quality Led Z experience, I would suggest going back to the old original recordings from their begining, which to this day have stood the test of time.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I saw the theatrical release on DVD and was captivated by it, I wish I had the opportunity to see it in a theater but working nights always makes that difficult. Some of the story seemed......rushed, or perhaps........ omitted. The directors cut on the other hand, tells a far more complete and very different tale that makes this movie a must-see in my opinion. It may perhaps offend some people who have a very western-centric way of viewing the world and it's history, as I was surprised to learn that Americans mostly stayed away from the theaters when this originally came out I felt the movie provided a very balanced telling of the story that did not overly villify one side or another but sought to explore the roots of a conflict that plagues the Human Race this very day. I give this version of this film my very highest reccomendation!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|awesome graphics. long gameplay in the purchased version. well worth 2.99.  good storyline with many different scenes. looking forward to sequel. very happy with purchase.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have always found war movies and documentaries to be among my favorites. The Pacific from HBO did not fail to meet my expectations. Having watched it when it first came out on television I immediately planned to add it to my collection when it came out on DVD. The story, which focuses of course on some of the actual participants, the veterans, is sometimes difficult to watch because it is true, but likewise, impossible to turn away from. I had relatives who served in the Pacific War. I feel it is important, especially as one who was fortunate enough not to have to go to war, and who so far have children also fortunate enough not to, to understand, or at least try to understand the horrors they experienced. It is a story i would not want to have lived, yet feel must never be forgotten or taken for granted. It is a must see for everyone!

B002UM5BXW|5.0|Such candid commentary on the world of a restaurant worker.  Anyone who has ever worked in a kitchen will find this book both genuine and hilarious.  Anyone who has not worked in a kitchen will be exposed to a world they probably never knew existed.  Either way it is an enjoyable look into the world and the mind of one of the most interesting characters in the culinary world.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved loved loved this book. A lot of passion and emotional. Its a page turner for sure. Really enjoyed it
030758836X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  The author engrossed the reader by the continuous plots and turns. There have been some complaints about the ending...but I found it fabulously justified.  Both characters have serious flaws so the ending is very realistic ...loved it !
B009NPKTN6|5.0|i loved the movie, it was very entertaining i loved all the actors,alex baldwin was very good ,and i love julianne she is so talented and last but not least,who knew tom cruise could sing? he was awesome throughout the movie and i usually dont like his movies but this one was amazing. i think he should do more musical type movies he was showing everyone that he could do anything he put his mind to.i love that! also Russell Brand as always was great.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this story to everyone that can read. It felt like a modern day Catcher In the Rye to me, with a new millennium twist. I felt like even if you couldn't in a small way relate to the main character, there had to be another  person in the story that reminds  you of yourself. Or someone you know. Or someone you don't know. The story was beautiful.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|i didnt like the movie.It was not what i expected from the trailer. it just kept jumping back and forth and not really explaining what was going on.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Well written and easy to understand.<br /><br />The author creates the life of an alzheimers patient.  Captivating writing and most enjoyable and educational book.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The movie offers a typical plot of good triumphing over evil. This time, three little girls (orphans) overcome the disinterest of a man who attempts to be the most evil person alive. Along the way, there are a number of quotes and scenes that offer amusement and make it worth watching the movie.<br /><br />I enjoy this type of movie primarily for the adult humor embedded in the children's animations. The length is about right, and the plot is reasonably believable.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|One thing I love about my Kindle Touch is that I can read the classic books without without the smell of mildew.  No squinting to read the browning pages either.  The prices for classics are amazing too and go from $0 to a couple of dollars.  Wonderful combination for lovers of the classics.
B00003CX5P|2.0|They sent me a movie that constantly skips. this was not stated that the movie was scratched. im very unpleased with the quality and truthfulness.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I loved this CD from first play.  None of the songs had to grow on me.  There's a variety of styles, so that it's not a collection of songs with little variation, but at the same time it's a cohesive collection - they certainly belong together.  All are definitely rock & blues of a kind.  Some songs have an eerie quality.  Many are reminiscent of classic rock like Led Zeppelin, Steppenwolf, Hendrix, The Animals...but this is new ground being covered and won't disappoint.
0786955570|5.0|love it .. actually for my retired us navy bro... i sent it over to him as a gift  He likes it a lot
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Oh boy, if you like JN you will love this one and Diane Keaton, she is such a kick in this one.<br />I have watched more than once and always get laughs from it.<br />It is in great shape and got her as ordered
B003G4W49C|5.0|I only wish that I had found this book years ago so that I could reread it more times. Well written with a hero you can cheer for and weep for. I recommend this marvelous novel to anyone who likes to think about what they read, and to anyone who just loves a good, original story.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|For a free app this indefinitely works good a and gives you other extras..like how much time you have  on different areas ie : mp 3, internet,Skype and others.

0425252868|5.0|I did not personally read this book but gave it to my grandfather as a gift for Christmas. He was a pilot, as well as a prisoner of war in WW2 and so I thought he might enjoy it. He loved it!! He was very touched by the book and thought the author did an amazing job.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is a good tool will save me from doing long hand calculations that can be more quickly done with this app.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I think a majority of the negative reviews were due to people expecting Harry Potter, and I thought JK Rowling had made it clear from the beginning that Harry Potter this is not. That being said, I can still see hints of some HP characters in the characters from this book (namely, Vernon and Petunia Dursley as Harold and Shirley Mollison), but overall, this book is vastly different. This book is certainly macabre (but so was Harry Potter), but it is a real page-turner in my opinion. The characters were very well defined, and very relatable - I think I can name a person in my real life that is similar to each of the characters. This book will especially resonate with you if you live in/come from a small town. The pettiness of small-town politics was spot on, and how everyone knows everyone, word spreads fast, etc. It takes place in Britain, but it could have just as easily been Michigan.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very entertaining book which held your interest from the first page.  Being a senior citizen, young at heart, I would recomment it to any age who enjoys light-hearted romance stories.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read historical fiction . Intertwining several families and generations gives more depth  and different points of view to consider on the subject., and brings a very human element to how we react to events we have little control over.<br /><br />One needs patience reading this work because you need to keep the characters straight in your mind.
B0074JODP8|5.0|learned about joe b. on the satriani web site years ago and picked up the rockpalast dvd. joe, along with eric czar and kenny on drums were impressive in 06! then royal albert hall blew me away when he played with mentor and universal idle clapton, post crossroads festival. clearly, he is following in erics footsteps by his unquenchable thirst to push onward and upward. he shares the spotlight and has a great time doing it! hiatt, hart and rogers are outstanding on 2 songs each. hart is sexy, soulfull, and complements joe nicely. the production of the entire presentation. the band is tight and joe obviously is evolving at enormous intervals. this time hammering down on the finale young mans blues, dual neck 12 string. this was smokin! will see him live in april in vegas. counting the days.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this to find out what all the fuss was about, and was mildly disappointed. It was nowhere near as interesting as I had hoped. I finished reading it, but have no interest in reading the rest of the series.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is a fun game that requires some brain power and imagination.  You have to discover new and creative ways to beat each level and it is like nothing around.  I was very quickly addicted to this game.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is a good story but good. I thought this book was long and I couldn't finish it but I did because it was short
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Entertaining and will make you think. Great for all ages. I would recommend to those who enjoy silly little brain teaser games.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|A real page turner. Great from beginning to end. Can't wait to seethe new col. Out where Tom. Cruise plays Jack teacher.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Great app! Started with free version but paid the couple bucks for upgrade. Great dictionary, games and articles are great addition. Quick lookup ( especially for playing Word games).
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose this book because I wanted to see the movie but didn't get the chance go. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes adventure,animals, and just looking for a plain good book.
B008XCM18Q|4.0|The Bourne Identity is action packed and has so many twists and turns in the plot. It was really amazing.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|A very confused and meaningless movie. Ending sets up the next movie to come. Lots of killing and wooden acting.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|A really great book. It's a thrilling sequel to an already great series. James Dashnet sets up an amazing plot.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|If you love bingo, like I do, then this is the game for you! Love it!!  Easy to understand & gives you plenty of time to mark your cards, even playing with multiple cards.
B008K6DU4Y|2.0|This app worked fine about 2 months ago and now I got my new kindle fire reinstalled it ready to watch my shows and it closes down every 5-40 seconds while watching anything AVI or MKV format. It even does it in the menu... this never happened before for me on the fire.. what did you guys do, please fix cause this is the only app I know of that will play MKV video format!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just a lovely story. So funny and heartbreaking and honest.  Not just for young adults. I also highly recommend \\"Looking for Alaska.\\"
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I purchased this game based on the reviews, and I was not disappointed.  This is a fun puzzle game that starts off easy, but gets more challenging as you go.  Nice graphics and great sound effects.  This is not your typical jigsaw puzzle game, so it comes as a refreshing change.  I recommend this game to those who like to relax with a good puzzle.
B009K72G8I|5.0|The clone wars is a very good series for all ages.  Season 5 is just as great as the other 4 seasons.  I like the episode about the droids mission.  I recommend this to everyone  good animation and good a good storyline.
B0061S073A|4.0|love that my 3 year old can no longer install new apps! this allows me to save money while he continues to have fun and learn. lol
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite British films. If you like comedies then this is a must have. You will not be disappointed at all!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|While I fully agree that \\"The Dark Knight\\" was a must see picture, and Heath Ledger's Joker was just as disturbing as the Joker should be, it was not a movie I wanted to watch a second time. It was unrelentingly tense for the entire movie, and I came away from it more exhausted than entertained.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" did not make the same mistake. While much of the movie is tense, and often depressing, the mistakes of the previous effort were avoided. There were plenty of tension breaks and brief moments of humor in this film, even during the most critical dramatic scenes. That saved it from being a beat down of the viewer, and allowed me to enjoy the movie without the exhaustion I felt from its predecessor.<br /><br />This story is epic in scope, and puts the Batman through some paces he's never faced on film before. It certainly reminds me of some of the Limited Series in the comics where he faces failure, both in action and in mind. There is depth here to go with as much action as any action junkie could desire.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is outstanding. Both images and sound are top quality. I don't have a quibble with any part of the presentation.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00068NVI4|5.0|This may be the last time these old guys can muster the energy to do this nearly three hour program.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is very well done. Characters and fascinating and depict an earlier time in society. In our casual, informal way of living and relating to each other seems strange but in many ways is refreshing.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Had it on my iphone and then got a kindle for Christmas, so had support@teamlava.com move my storm8 id &amp; game over.<br /><br />Love it even more on the big screen!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|good flick ... no big explanation needed here  ...<br />you know what you are getting into when considering this movie.
B004QKNXIQ|2.0|Actually I had downloaded this video for my granddaughter, but we didn't get a chance to view it when it was taken back. I really don't like Amazon's policy on this. If we rent it, we should have as long as we wish to view it. Very unhappy with this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. I was nervous at first because it started off seeming like a book for a teenager. As I got further into it, it became real and I fell into the main characters role. I think this book is great for all ages. It's a must read!
1481251880|5.0|I just finished reading one of the best books I will ever read in my life. That's a loaded promise from someone who's barely lived a quarter of their potential life. That's a lot of books I will potentially read, but it stands true for \\"Hopeless.\\" The third of Hoover's novels transcends what she already established after Point of Retreat. I didn't think it was possible to find a better New Adult contemporary after Slammed, and Hoover proved otherwise with her own work. So thank you Colleen Hoover, for creating Holder, Sky and Hope and reminding me that even the darkest nights are still lit by the stars.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book! It was better than 50 Shades! Can't wait to read Reflected In You! :)
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie has a great feel to it. Reminds me of Quentin Tarantino movies.<br /><br />Definitely recommend for people who can handle violence well.<br /><br />I watched it and emailed my friend, who lives across the country from me, asking if he saw it yet. Going to buy him a copy from amazon and have it shipped to his house if he says no.<br /><br />It's that good!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was one of the best books I have ever read! I definitely recommend it to a teenager who doesn't get a lot of attention and has complicated life. All I have to say is I cried like a baby! And I loved the book very very much!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Didn't know what to expect, having never read any of Morton´s books before....and couldn't have been more pleased with this story.  Kate has a gift as a storyteller.  I loved everything about this!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|this is an inspirational movie very nice to watch.  You will love it. A movie for the peace in World.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|thanks again for it i play it everyday i can at work in my car in my house thanks for it
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Angry Birds-Star Wars (AB-SW) incorporates a lot of the elements from previous AB games (space / gravity, heavy birds, etc.), but also adds some new elements from Star Wars: Luke has a light saber, Obi Wan uses the force to push stuff after you smash it down, Han Solo shoots his blaster 3 times, etc. Not sure why Chewbacca is a &#34;heavy,&#34; he must have put on some weight after the movies were done filming (haha).<br /><br />I wasn't as impressed with AB-Space, but I really enjoyed AB-SW. The screens were well layed-out, and you didn't feel like you had to get really lucky to get 3-stars. You still had to approach the screen the right way (shoot here, then shoot there), but you didn't have to do the same thing five times in a row, hoping that you would get a lucky bounce.
B005KCZRI8|5.0|Creative modern rock music still exists.  Don't forget to check out the bizarre story leading up to this band's career.
B009FXIICK|3.0|Typical pick-3. Instead of shapes or fruit, you get different zoo animals. My biggest gripe is that it ramps up pretty quickly. Maybe I'll get better at it eventually, but I really feel like I'll just give up and play something else.<br /><br />The boss at the end putting you down is quite depressing. Cute at first, but now I just frown at the screen and click to go on.
B00917IQFY|3.0|I prefer vinyl over other formats, but it's also nice to listen to an album in the car or on your Ipod. If you're like me, you may want to purchase the CD instead, as this album doesn't give you any extras. Most vinyl you purchase these days include a download card. Paul Simon's latest album contained a hi-rez version similar to an SACD. Tom Wait's latest contained the CD; Lucinda William's Blessed had 2 CD's. I'm really disappointed with Graham Parker's record label.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|well written and great example of the angst of a brilliant young man coming of age; think holden caufield with out the profanity
B007PVHMCG|4.0|I think is a little too expensive for what it really is! I think the price is high just because is minecraft. There are other lego set that are much funner and bigger for the same price.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's as good as the website. I like being able to look at ideas when I am not at home or on break at work.
1451695195|5.0|Great, great. My 6 year old grand son read and looked at it several times after I read it to him originally. It is now used by my church Sunday school teacher for her lesson with her Sunday School pupils!<br />Sigrid A. Kidd
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book made<br />Lincoln appear as normal a man whom anyone would enjoy spending time with. As the president life and struggles increased , his true character emerges. I believe that president Lincoln is the greatest president and friend to the common man that ever lived. The tragic ending is so sad for his Penn family as well as most of his cabinet officials. It appears that Mrs Kearns Goodwin has penned a master piece. Now I'm going to see the movie is as good as the book.  Thankfully, Martin  Saylor
B00957T6X6|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive about reading this genre but I loved this book! I loved the historical aspect, the characterizations,  the plot. The intrigue keeps the pages turning. I am already reading the next book and look forward to reading the entire series!
B007VGXS8M|4.0|My 4 yr old & I have enjoyed this game. Would recommend it to adults & children around 4 yrs old. It's much better than violent games.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Great variety of mini games and hidden object searches.  Too many conversations, but the skip button is great.  It works well on the Kindle Fire.
B00005JOHC|1.0|I did not order Two and a Half Men: The Complete First Season.  I ordered a different one and it was great.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|Inexpensive. Fits and protects the screen. However it would be nice if it had something to hold the stylist in place as there is no zipper.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|Every time u touch the screen it counts as a mistake. Whether u r trying to zoom in, zoom out, or scroll the screen it counts as messing up. Also u can tap the screen where u want (rite on the item) &amp; a 30% of the time it counts as a mistake. It shouldn't count to zoom or scroll but as soon as u touch the screen it does. It should b when u lift ur finger not as soon as u hit the screen. Would b 5 stars but these r MAJOR flaws in the game.
1609611543|5.0|It seems like the people who gave this book bad reviews see it as a diet. Though he does give advice about how to lose weight, I do not think this book should be read as a diet book. Nor compared to Atkins. The book is written by a dude who questions the norm. He is going against the grain with studies and trials to back him up. If you are looking to this book to make your fat just drip out of your pores, look elsewhere. Think of this dude as the Led Zeppelin of food. He is changing the way we look at our food and opening our eyes to some pretty amazing(scary) stuff. He offers way to lose weight, but don't take it for just that. This isn't a book that is meant to be followed for 6 months and then you go back to your cheese puffs. It's a lifestyle book.
B0052REQLK|5.0|I added this book to my reading list because of Dan Pink's strong recommendation (his favorite book from 2012, I seem to recall). I so enjoyed 30 Lessons that I interviewed Karl for our People and Projects Podcast on iTunes. In a world that is filled with books from pundits who spout advice for living, to celebrity &#34;be like me&#34; books, to outright dangerous books like The Secret (listen to my interview with Heidi Grant Halvorson), 30 Lessons is a great read with refreshing insights from those who have actually lived life.<br /><br />I particularly appreciate how Karl steered clear from the obvious lessons. Though he certainly did plenty of distillation, I loved how he allowed the voice of the &#34;experts&#34; (his term for those in their 70's, 80's, and 90's) to permeate the book.<br /><br />I enthusiastically recommend this book and have added this book to my gift list for college grads and newlyweds. Don't miss the website for The Legacy Project for more information on Karl's research.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've read many Nicholas Sparks novels, yet I couldn't put this one down. The characters captivate your attention and steal your heart with every turn of the page. Such a great book!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This is great because you can create a cocktail of sounds and can easily change anything. Lots of sounds and hundreds of combinations. Only down side is that it sucks the life out of the kindle battery.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Wow! Mark Owen (pseudonym) has had a unique life. But in the end, murder, state sanctioned or otherwise, is murder. Yes, I hear the counter arguments already. But can we all, including our Islamic brothers, just start living in peace?
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Certainly, this app doesn't offer everything you find on the website, but for quick reference it's great. User friendly, fast information in the palm of your hand. Don't know how I got along without it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I didn't know what to expect in purchasing this book, which had a lot of hype (I guess I was curious, just like the next person). In the end, it was a pulp fiction, with alot of sexual situations. An O.K. book for a vacation I guess.
1878424319|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone with an open mind and half a brain .. and I think it should be &#34;required&#34; reading for anyone seeking &#34;answers&#34;.<br /><br />The &#34;Fifth Agreement&#34; is a perfect follow-up .. and I think anyone who does read &#34;The Four Agreements&#34; will immediately seek out the &#34;Fifth&#34; .. both books reveal basic &#34;truths&#34; that should be shared with the world
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rothfuss' writing style is amazing, it shows that it took him 5 years to write this book, the character development and subject are fantastic.
B007HACDLK|1.0|Hard to believe written by Mr, Flynn.  Language was simplistic, not up to any of the prior books, all of which I have read and enjoyed.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|Fits my Nikon P510 perfectly.  Extra storage is available, two small side pouches and one center pouch will securely hold accessories.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I loved every page of this book, cannot wait to read the next one! The second half of this book I didn't want to stop reading till it was over!
1400049628|5.0|Living over a funeral chapel, I've assigned myself the roll of society's Paul Revere.  I will sound to my neighbors the call of the walk of the dead.  I will destroy the damned who refuse to accept the light of the lord, so proceed to walk amongst the living to terrorize and destroy!<br /><br />So yeah, this book was a natural choice for me.  G'head and buy it.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I liked this book. The down side is you must read the first book to make total sense of this one. Bones and Cat have a rocky relationship but he has finally found her again and doesnt intent to let her go. Theres a lot of action and twist in this installment of the night huntress series.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|Can't go wrong with Eric Bana - He delivers his role the only way an actor of his calibur can.  A must buy for your movie library.
0679805273|5.0|This is the most poignant Seuss story I have ever read and I'm 35.  I saw a video for a reading of this by attendees of Burning Man (odd I know).  I was blown away at the meaningfulness and depth of the story and couldn't believe this was for a kid.  I immediately looked for a copy and this was the best price.<br /><br />It's a great story and the book makes a very thoughtful gift for a child or even an adult who has reached some milestone in their life.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this book, you'll read this and rethink you're life - in a good way... and it rhymes!  Crazy good!  Buy one... or several!
B004QX07G4|2.0|First of all let me start off by saying, &#34;I love Ellen&#34;!  I thought her book would be as funny as her show, but I am only on the second chapter and I can' t seem to get into it!  I feel like she is just rambling on and on and not really going anywhere.  The &#34;funny&#34; lines so far that have made me smile are those that she has said on the show a million times already.  I also felt as I was reading, I could not get her voice out of head!  In my opinion, Ellen should stick with the talk show where she has guests to interact with and stay away from writing, it' s just not her thing!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|not enough time to decide if it is useful. wait a week. I need more time! I will write a proper review in a week or two.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Both my husband and I both loved the whole Harry Hole series - but can't stop thinking about the end and hoping that it is not what it seems - I know it has to end, but I don't think I am ready for it. Jo Nesbo is a great writer, I hope more will be coming.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Music from all around the globe.  Works great even living a rural setting without the best high speed internet. Would recommend.
8866131105|5.0|I use it like personal log and to take notes on meeting. Priceless. I love it. Look no further. ,
0375869026|5.0|I read this book to my 11 year old son. It was beautifully written......funny, touching and a wonderful way to teach our children about KINDNESS!<br />I have passed it along to teachers, parents and friends all whom have had the same reaction.....OUTSTANDING!!!!
B006R1T40I|5.0|what can you say, I love Bonnie. Been a fan since her first album in the 70's. If you are a Bonnie fan ,you will not be disappointed.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book explains how habit affects our daily life and the society in a scientific way, with lots of detailed interviews and stories as examples. Worth your time to read the whole book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Intense, romantic, and beautiful. The book is bound to catch your interest from the start. It's definitely one of the better books I've read!
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Great entertainment - makes you use your brain.keeps you entertained and thinking. Everyone should enjoy it. simple yet fun and cute.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|Fun reading although the end was predictable.<br />Can see young teenagers really enjoying.<br />Wouldn't want t o continue reading this type books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great easy fun game that passes the time. its simple and wash to learn and get good at. Get.this game.
030758836X|4.0|I really liked this book, but I can't say I loved it. Parts of it were compelling, really a page turner, and other times, like the first 1/3 it was a bit slow. The ending felt a little abrupt. I don't think it quite deserves all of the hype it got, but I did enjoy the back and forth, the way both characters are shades of gray. I really enjoyed this book, but it falls just a bit short of something really special. A great read, lots of fun, keeps you guessing, but a little anticlimactic. I will definitely pick up her other books, and I think she may be destined for greatness. Obviously a lot of people loved this book, it won a lot of awards, was nominated a lot. Great voice, somebody to keep an eye on for sure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really awesome app please download today! I love to build on the go with this pocket edition instead of always having to make the Xbox boot up and trying to find it on the games menu.it's a whole lot of fun. If you buy i hope you enjoy it.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I love Michael Connelly. However, I don't know how many more of these singles I'll buy because a lot of it is promotional material for his books--which I always read anyway.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell...and Linda Hunt as Henrietta Lange.  Plus an amazing rest of the cast.  If you've ever seen NCIS...or even if you haven't but you enjoy well scripted...action filled (without being over-filled)...and strong character relationships and development...you'll love NCIS: Los Angeles.  Give it a try.  Trust me...you'll dig it  :)
1423136802|5.0|My daughter was thrilled with the boxed set for Christmas. Her English teacher at school &#34;turned her on&#34; to the Percy Jackson series.
B00138J6VM|5.0|Of course great music, easy download onto Kindle, and sound is not bad.  Will probably download more music.  Nice for in the office.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I didn't think it was possible to make a Judge Dredd movie worse than the first one that came out with Stallone in it from the 90's but these guys did it.  Every single minute of this movie sucked, not a single good aspect in the entire show.  Even if you need to waste your time there are better things to waste it on than this garbage.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This is the fourth in the Bourne series and certainly one that deserves notice.  Even though Matt Damon does not appear, the story line is this agent is on the hit list to shut down Blackthorn, and all other dark ops programs of which Jason was part of.  We do get to see a number of passports with Jason's photos, and he is mentioned but that's it.  Jeremy does a great job, just as he did in The Hurt Locker.  He was also the bad cop in SWAT.  Once you realize this is not a Jason Borne film, but with many of the same cast, you will find it just as action packed and entertaining.
B006LSZECO|2.0|In the Book Description for Gone Girl on Amazon, the book is described as a \\"masterpiece about a marriage gone terribly, terribly wrong\\".  In other reviews I've read, kudos have been given to the book for its exploration of what can go wrong in a marriage.  To me, those are gross mis-representations.  What happens in Gone Girl has nothing to do with what can happen to a marriage but everything to do with what happens when two amoral, selfish individuals manage to end up together.  It can't happen just to anyone of us, unless you happen to cross path with someone as depraved as one of the characters in this book.<br /><br />The fact that the book's central plot is not built upon the foundations of a marriage may not necessarily be a bad thing.  But the problem here is that this is one of those books that rely solely on shocking plot twists and turns to propel it forward.  When we first meet Nick Dunne, he is a concerned husband who has come home from work one day to find his wife Amy gone.  We also get to meet Amy through a series of diary entries that depicts her as a vivacious young woman deeply in love with her husband.  As Nick start to put together clues that may point to Amy's whereabouts, however, details begin to emerge, both about Nick and Amy's marriage and Nick and Amy as individuals that threaten to turn any theories the readers may have about what actually happened on its ears.  And when the author starts to throw one surprising revelation after another at us starting at around the midway point...well, some readers may be seduced by these unexpected plot twists.  But for me, these were made completely at the expense of any realistic character development.  And it only got worse from there, as Amy and Nick continue to stray from their original character arcs and the plot development get more ridiculous and unbelievable.<br /><br />In the end, the lack of sympathetic characters means that I couldn't care less about what happens to any of them.  And that makes for dull reading indeed
B00466HNHM|5.0|Great movie to watch at any time!<br />Kevin and Whitney Houston were at their best and the sound track is unforgettable!

B0015DROBO|5.0|I've listened to and read this book now, and really enjoyed it both times. The pace is good and the story compelling. I recommend the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|There was never a time in this book where I was bored. I've read all of her books because they grasp your attention and believe me when I say you never want to put the book down. I absolutely loved this book!!!!!!!!
B00AI3OLI6|5.0|Just love listening to Buddy Guy.  One of the greatest.  I have several of albums and I can't think of one bad song on any of them.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app mostly because of the exact percent of my battery life and how long it needs to charge.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|It works perfectly with my Mac mini!<br /><br />It was reasonably priced at $60<br /><br />I needed a turntable plus I now have the option to turn my old vinyl records into audio files, instead of replacing them with CD's or audio downloads.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|Very simplistic and tends to be a bit boring.  Not a real challenge to win.  OK for the younger set,
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book captured me. It tells a unique story that is both brutal and touching. It doesn't fade away at the end - the end is the key. I have spent many days reliving this saga.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book and very thought provoking.. def read it! I thoroughly enjoyed it.. The characters are truly believable... Hope Less!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Loved this book so much. Can't wait for Flynn's next book.  Just began reading his other one. Hola
0871164566|5.0|I don't know how to express how I really love this book!  All the projects in it is so wonderful!  I can't wait to get started with the beads I have here at home.  And what is even nice is that I know I will have a different piece than the one shown because I will be using my own selection of beads.  Everyone should own a book like this!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I laughed so hard in parts of this I was crying. I especially enjoyed the message that you have to stand up for what you believe in even if it's different than what your family wants for you, but it also showed that standing up for those freedoms and needs also comes with a personal responsibility.
B008SVFX96|5.0|ritchie dose it again. he is a awesome guitar player and writer. his music is rock and plays from the soul. a must have cd. the seller was fair on price and fast shipping. great seller and great cd. thank you.
B009VB97EY|5.0|You know, I can't even comment on the story. I wasn't listening much when they were speaking. It was more about the eye candy.
B007G51UV0|5.0|Pros:<br />This is a great hi-performance Motherboard. I have been a system builder for more than 20 years so  it was a fairly easy install for me. First time builders should have very few problems if they follow the manual.  Experienced system builders won't need the manual until the mobo is physically installed tin the case. I did attach the WiFi board first as mentioned in other  reviews.<br /><br />Initially, I used the onborad video vga to set up the system while waiting for my  Asus GT640 card to arrive.  I loaded the &#34;basic&#34; software for the mobo first so I could get into the BIOS at start up, to do some tweaking.  This gave me opportunity to set the RAM Compatibility push-button on the mobo which took a few seconds.<br /><br />Very Small Cons:<br />These are not show-stoppers or red flags:<br />This mobo is BIG it took some time getting into my mid-tower case. The front SATA connectors were somewhat difficult to access in my Antec 500 case. The HD bay sits directly in front of those  connectors.  I pulled my drives out and routed the cables through holes that were in the back of the drive bay. It is a two-hand procedure; one hand to rout the cable just at the point of insertion and the other hand to snap the cable into place. You might want to consider plugging in the SATA cables first just before you mount the mobo.<br /><br />My system:<br />Asus P8Z77-V Pro, Intel i7 Quad-Core over-clocked to 4.3Ghz; Cool Master Hyper 212EVO CPU Cooler; Asus Gt640 2GB DDR 3 PCI 3.0 Video Card factory over-clocked, 32 GB 1.6 Ghz RAM - 12Gb is configured as a RAM Drive; 4 Hard drives totaling 3.64 TB (4 HDs 3 1GB and 1 640GB) two DVD Optical DVD Drives. An additional 6TB offline storage Firewire and USB 3.0 interface.<br />This system is used to produce and edit video media.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|It works perfectly, it retains the ethernet cable and even if you move around it stays put. I recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever. l loved it. it is so so so so fun fun fun fun fun.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love Bruno Mars! His style is authentic; and the songs are catchy. I am listening to this album on repeat!!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What's the defenition for addictive and fun? Flow Free this game is so fun I couldn't put it Down for days!!!!! Get it today its so fun you will enjoy it!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is such an amazing movie that I can't stop gushing about! I think Nolan brings the series around full circle and it is fun to watch. Great performances in the movie by all. I think this is well worth getting on Blu-ray as it is visually stunning.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|with Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) and Watson (Lucy Liu) portrayal of his beloved characters. After being able to accept Holmes and Watson as 2013 human beings, it really comes together nicely. The entire cast, writers et al deserve a five star rating for humor, entertaining episodes and surprises. Watch more than one or two episodes and you'll be hooked, if you are a Holmes fan.
B004HD61KE|3.0|This book is a fast paced action thriller with elite government agents working against an ancient secret  society and the clock, in order to prevent total destruction of the world via volcanic eruption.  The story moves fast and some of the history is interesting enough to continue reading to the end, but there isn't enough character development and some of the main characters seemed to try too hard to actually be a memorable character.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|The earlier Reacher novels were the best.  Great detail, great action.  You know what to expect from each, and this one delivers.
B0060D15AK|5.0|Great Movie.  I throughly enjoyed it!  Acting was very good and area where movie was filmed was beautiful.  Best buy of the year
B007JMW46U|5.0|It’s amazing how one good book can truly open your eyes. The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes, a collection of short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, did just that. I have learned to make more observations and observe detail better, and soon you can too!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Probably the best novel on the future of human race, in Clarke's vision. Excellent knowledge of human nature, imaginative and full of innovative ideas.
0399160450|3.0|His books have become lengthy. Filled with the characters full name and tite. It almost seems like they are used to fill space.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a good book. I am sad to see the series end.  I am looking forward to reading more of her books.
0071762345|5.0|The layout of Dave Kerpen's first book is invaluable.  I'm an avid reader of business, marketing, and entrepreneurial books and I found this one to be in a class of its own.  At the end of each insightful chapter, Dave offers next step action plans for the reader to follow and apply his concepts to their own business brand.  The organization of the book is ingenious making it more a daily reference guide rather than a pleasure read.  I highly recommend this book for social media novices and seasoned professionals looking to shake things up if they feel their business has plateaued.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The writer makes you love and then hate both of the main characters right up to the last sentence in the book.  I also can't decide if I'm comfortable liking a book that makes New Yorkers snobby better than though types and Midwesterners overall trashy with a useless existence.  I suppose that was part of the love to hate plan...and there is always some truth behind stereotypes.  Regardless, I found myself deep into these characters and after a slow start I couldn't put the book down.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Creative writing with great actors!  Jessica Lang never ceases to amaze me with her talent!  She is my hometown girl!<br />Loving it from Minnesota!~
B002RKSZKI|5.0|This Kindle edition of Emma is well formatted and easy to read. There are none of the problems with spacing or justification one finds in some Kindle books. Highly recommended.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Truly a book that is hard to keep away from, I just wanted to read and find out more about the girl and the story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I would say that if you are the kind of person that takes solitary seriously, then the automatic card placement or the ability to choose the outcome of your hand will drive you nuts. If you are like me and you just like to win, then all around great. It's a great app!
B0015DROBO|5.0|What an interesting character and view of the way she looked at the people in her life.  Her convictions were so strong and her life happenings made the book one that couldn't be put away.  I knew from early on that I wanted to read the other two books in the series.  This Trilogy by far best books I have read in a long time, maybe best ever.  I loved every minute of the story and the style of storytelling, and right amount of suspense.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is so simple and timeless...i could listen to this over and over...have lent it to friends!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Of the three books in the trilogy I enjoyed this one because of the detail.  It was maybe a little too long but understand that to get all of the story told it had to be lengthy. I liked that when I finished the book. I really understood the characters and the life they chose to lead.  I also enjoyed reading about the political side of the country it took place in.
0062082353|5.0|This is a great book that will keep you reading. You don't want to put it down. I find myself laughing out loud.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Read while on holiday so had downloaded it at the right  time. I was annoyed when I finished it. Good book
B008J34466|5.0|I was very impressed by her music. I normally just listen to country, but this is a great workout CD
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had some of the Alien movies already so this was a great buy. No only did I complete my series but I was able to upgrade to Blu-ray.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down even though I read it before.  I didn't remember all the details but I knew it would end well.  But it was great reading it again and there were parts I didn't remember so it was a thriller.  Hope I can find another book by Nicholas Sparks that I haven't read yet.  I love that the stories take place near Wilmington North Carolina because that is a place dear to my heart.  I HAVE BEEN TO Southport and Bald Head Island band my boys went to college in Wilmington North Carolina so it is always in my heart
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This was an excellent buy, I completed my Matrix collection and was able to upgrade to Blu-ray at the same time.  Love the quality and clarity.  I did not have to pay shipping through Amazon.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book is a great book. It made me realize that animals can have feelings just like humans. I definitely recommend it.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|It was so funny!!<br /><br />I chose it because... Greg falls in love with Holly Hills. Then a new girl just moved in so seems Greg checked Holly OFF the list! I'd love to give it all of the stars! LOL it was hilarious!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a good dictionary but its hard to understand<br />So ill advise many people should read this dictionary<br />Love Samantha
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I was at a family christmas get together where my grand some had gotten this book as a gift so I read a few pages nd was hooked so I down load the book to my kindel. Finished the book in one day great story. Lookinf forward to read the series.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Too descriptive not up to usual high standard&#60; But i would Still purchase books by Lee child AS he is avery good Auther
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is the same cable that came with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 purchased mid-December 2012.  It is 5 ft. long just as the original. I purchased this one to keep in the car for charging the Kindle on the go, along with this USB car charger:  [[ASIN:B00511PS3C AmazonBasics 2-Port USB Car Charger with 2.1 Amp Output (Black)]] I am completely satisfied with this combination for car charging.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The combination of this cable with the car charger, as I referenced, has worked perfectly to charge the KF 8.9.  One of the drawbacks of the KF is how extremely quickly its battery wears down. There is no point taking the Fire with me on a day's outing because of its weak battery. The car charger/cable are indispensable accessories.
B0046W5E0Y|4.0|I rented this on Amazon Prime for our granddaughter.  She loved it, but has not asked for it since, so I guess I would say that it's a good choice for the 48 hour rental, but not necessarily to buy (hence the 4, not 5 stars).
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|For all of us who love agent Pendergast, this is a must read!  Without giving away the plot, we might lose him forever in these pages.  Terrible events can occur when the &#34;Der Bund&#34; is involved.  This book is an emotional rollercoaster, one which I found nearly impossible to put down.  From the opulence of the Dakota, to the tropical forests of Brazil, this book will keep you reading into the wee hours.  Start it on a weekend, otherwise you just may not get to work.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Quality batteries, packaged for protection, good price, prompt delivery  I use them in my Craftsman garage door transmitter.  Seem to last awhile
B008I43DYU|4.0|This app gives me everything thing I need in a calculator and more. It is simple to use and extremely quick. I am just now learning the scientific part of it, which is a bonus for me.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Well written and easy to read in most part except on the part about author's view on God or author's attempt to make theological statements which was vague and weak. Overall good read. I recommend to anyone interested in near-death-experiences.
B00633W614|3.0|Archer is a superb storyteller but there are elements of this novel that simply deny credibility.  While the characters are very well developed, their behaviors are too often predictable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great one. Couldn't put the it down. It's  typical husband beats his wife, she leaves and finds true love book, but I enjoyed it. Waiting for the movie to come out. Hopefully they don't change a lot like they did with The Last Song.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far so good. its a little slower than I would like, but overall its ok. I haven't gotten very far yet I just hope it continues to fun.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord works great! I also love that it is longer than the original cord. The USB is a good thing to have because you could take it with you and plug it into any USB port.
0765325950|4.0|First - I truly have loved this series on the whole...    Second, and in no way feeling any sense of conflict with the statement above... I've also been frustrated and disappointed along the way to the conclusion of the series captured here in this book for many of the reasons others have mentioned here and elsewhere around the web. Having mainly to do with what I felt were too many meandering side plots and an overwhelming, ever-expanding supporting cast of characters that seemed to \\"get in the way\\" of the overall progress of the narrative. That, at least - in a way that felt rewarding as a reader who had become invested in the \\"the story\\" and the characters over so long a span of time and pages. I have to believe that Rob's very last statement in his review over at io9 [...] captures the general sort of feelings MANY fans have had with this series... though I think there will of course be varying degrees from fan to fan as to how much those feelings really get in the way or not, or at exactly which book Jordan really started to \\"lose\\" them.    But after the first few books, many of us were just caught up... and muscled through the drudgier moments along the way hoping for a big pay off. And I for one really wanted that pay off from multiple angles... from both a plot resolution standpoint and wanting the \\"story\\" to end in a satisfying way; as well as from a character standpoint. Yes, some characters became annoying over time... or maybe rather; more than becoming \\"annoying\\", the inclusion of so much of what felt like tangential material in the midst of some of the core characters losing their distinction and definition just further distanced me from some of them in a way that was difficult to repair heading in to the last few books. It's not just that the characters ~changed (that had to happen), but rather that I found that Jordan left us without much more than the bare essence of what was driving those changes. At least - that's the way it \\"felt\\" to me given thesheer amount of time and material across which our core characters development took place. And as much as I still love this story - I refuse to accept the \\"easy out\\" that I've seen from the many fans out there who rabidly assert that Jordan could do no wrong; that \\"The Pattern\\" spun these characters into what was needed in order to save the world. Bah - it was still a story - and I think we as readers would have been much happier on the whole with much better treatment of the core characters. We didn't really get much in the way of supporting storytelling outside of the characters own introspection and inner monologue to explain why they were changing in the ways they were. And the impact that had to my own attachment to these characters throughout their journey was greatly underscored by the single-most repetitive theme throughout the series... that communication between people in this world was a train wreck! And that was true NOT just between men and women - which was really just the central device Jordan otherwise used to convey that theme of never truly knowing what another character was saying or thinking, or what their motivations were. I \\"get\\" that there was a reason for this being a central theme in the series... particularly in light of the nature of the final conflict between Rand and the Dark One here in AMOL (though who knows if that last bit was outlined by Jordan - or injected entirely by Sanderson). But still... I think the series could have been a lot better with a more effective balance to Jordan's use of such devices compared to the impact such treatment had on our view of the core characters.    But I do have to say that at the end, Jordan himself did in fact seem to be on a slight bit of a course correction. I certainly would love to have seen how he would have wrapped up the series himself... though I can't help but think that despite some people seeming inclined to accuse either TOR, Sanderson or maybe even Harriet of wanting to \\"milk\\" the series for 3 more volumes instead of the supposed single book AMOL that Jordan had intended to close the series with; that particularly in the face of so much of what felt like filler material in the mid-to-end-section of the series, a single book version of the ending we've now gotten spread across Sanderson's concluding 3 books would have seemed awfully abrupt! As it stands - the AMOL we did get even felt somewhat abrupt at times. Whatever... in the end, I really did enjoy these last 3 books quite a bit!    So I have to hand it to Brandon! I think he did a fine job with a difficult task... In hindsight, I actually think Jordan's mid-series near breakdown in the overall plot progression and core character appeal worked in Sanderson's favor; in that so much distance had come between what I had first fallen in love with about the core characters at the beginning, and where we found them near the end, that the change in authors didn't come across as incongruous or out of place as it otherwise could have.    So here now, at the end... what I can say is that in anticipation of this final volume - I went back and started a re-read the series from the start. I'd already gone back and re-read several of the books a few times here and there over the years - but I wanted to have a straight run through all of them just before I read A Memory Of Light. I didn't quite make it half-way through Winter's Heart before AMOL was released though, but that was far enough in to the point where things had started going downhill for me the first time(s) around that I can now say this:    I've loved this series... and I've also had problems with multiple aspects of the story and character development. But in the end, wanting to enjoy what little there was now left to this decades long adventure that I continued to invest myself in even during the anti-climatic middle - much like some of the characters in this world seeking some bit of calm in the \\"void\\"... I just sort of cut all the baggageloose... On my re-read, rather than skip past parts of the middle books that I felt distracted the overall narrative - I \\"chose\\" to sort of just take them in stride - cognizant now that they didn't represent an endless march toward nothing being resolved. And... I just didn't mind as much as I did the first, or even second time through those books. I'm not saying they became \\"better\\" books just because of an altered perspective... but again, I just \\"chose\\" to not let it get in the way of me taking a few months to remember, reflect and enjoy on what was \\"best\\" about what got me here to the end. In and of themselves they weren't ever really \\"bad\\" books - just not what many of us \\"wanted\\" out of the enormous amount of time we'd been investing in these characters. I've read some reviewer comments here that I would probably agree with; that buried within this saga is an utterly masterful 5 or 6 volume epic of nothing but satisfying goodness. After my pre-AMOL re-read though - I actually do think we'd be able to fully enjoy even a few more than that, by keeping much of what Jordan threw at us, but just perhaps a lot less \\"time\\" spent on the stuff that seemed tangential, replaced with a bit more consistency in and page-time for our core characters.    I realize most of what I'm saying here isn't specific to just this one book - which is really what we should be talking about. I'm pleased with how AMOL wrapped up the Wheel Of Time... Kudos and Thank You to Brandon Sanderson! I can nitpick some things I felt were flaws over the last 3 books, and oddly enough more of them here in AMOL than his 2 preceding books, but again - I consider those moments that I didn't think worked well as part of the overall \\"baggage\\" that I don't mind cutting loose in the face of an otherwise satisfying and bittersweet conclusion to a beloved story. I'm giving this particular book 4 stars... it'd probably be a little lower (like 3 and a half) on just it's own merits alone - as there were some parts in this book that I found to be a bit sloppy, but I'm bumping it to a full 4 for how well I think it - as the concluding volume in this series - served in closing out the larger story of The Wheel Of Time. Color me satisfied, and grateful that we got a compelling ending! I'll go elsewhere to expound on specifics that I loved or didn't like about AMOL in particular... if you're a fan of this series that gave up along the way, I would still HIGHLY recommend considering jumping back on at the start of Sanderson's taking of the reigns... filling in whatever you missed in between that and wherever you may have jumped ship with some online plot summary reading or something just to be aware of the major plot points Jordan \\"did\\" give us in the waning years of his middle books... even if you only made it as far as book 4 or 5 (I was relatively happy until finishing Lord Of Chaos). I'm greatly enough satisfied with how things wrapped that I think if you EVER had any feeling for these characters that you'd be missing out on re-capturing a bit of that magic and wonder by not giving Sanderson a chance to close things out. Normally, I'm a die-hard for going the whole way through with a series (though I doubt I'll EVER read Goodkind's Pillars Of Creation ever again)... but I say the relative meandering of Jordan's mid-section of the series could actually work in your favor. Get the more relevant \\"highlights\\" in summary form from the point where you might have gotten frustrated enough to throw in the towel, and jump back on at the end of the ride. It was alot of fun... and very bittersweet. Goodbye Robert Jordan, and... thank you!

B008FPOIT6|4.0|A fun read. If you're looking for a quick, light read I recommend this book. It was on the verge of fantasy but still in the real world
B009NOVCTM|4.0|But I like it, like it, like it.  Yes I do! (I now pronouce you man and wife) HA HA
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I also have the basic FiiO E3 and let me tell you that this small device exceeds all my expectations.  Battery power lasts as long as you could need (more than 6 hours) and you can adjust volume and boost.  Hard and resistant case.<br /><br />Good value for your money.  You can use to multiple tasks.  Not only for headphones, you can preamp all kind of sound signals like musical instruments with this little piece with rechargeable battery.
B000002ADT|5.0|About 25 yars ago I met a disc jockey, who had a radio jazz program. I asked him what his favorite recording was, what does he consider one of the top recordings? Without hesitation he said that this is the greatest recording of all time, partly because of the players involved, but mostly because with the exception of Davis, all played this the first time-improvising their roles, when this was recorded. I can listen to this all day.
B00867GHS8|4.0|I love this movie, the only regret is that I had to purchase it in 3D ALSO.  I just wanted Blu-ray & digital copy, had to buy the 3D also. Ahhhh &#34;just keep swimming.keep swimming&#34;.....
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Love Lena Headey in this role. She's an incredibly versatile actor, but the Kiwi Karl Urban was a weak choice for character lead Dredd.  Was hoping for someone more buff and gruff... Like Stallone who has incredible charisma and a latent need for subtitles.<br /><br />The theme of this movie is a tad off-putting where in the future all common law and economy disappears but a totalitarian government knows best - it just reeks of our present day crisis.  If the movie were released during better economic times, and in better taste, I might give it an extra half star.  However, character development is much needed as well as better casting for all, but Headey.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Very different and entertaining. The author has a fresh, clear voice and the moves the story along quickly. It keeps you guessing and is not what you expect. Finishing this will make you want to seek out the author's other books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW! I could not believe all the twists and turns! A very good story and compelling LOVE story! I loved it.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I love historical fiction. This book describe the era very well that I could feel this happened. I will look for more of Tracy's work.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I have not read this book since childhood, but it is still as entertaining as it was then.  Mark Twain was really a gifted writer.
B009GED3HS|5.0|What can I say? This show is hilarious with its strong plot and attention to detail. However it did restated my crush on Neil Patrick Harris. Whom delivers a hilarious and dead on performance as Barney the womanizing friend of Ted.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|I purchased this to provide an extension for a Punchlight USB recording indicator lamp for my studio. The Punchlight USB requires 250mA to function and the BlueRigger passes plenty of power. I connected a 16ft Tripp Lite active extender into the BlueRigger and a 15' standard USB cable into that, about 63 ft, and the Punchlight worked perfect with plenty of current and reach. I also plugged my Droid Razr into the BlueRigger and was able to slow charge. No problems with data transfer either. Obviously these cables aren't intended for heavy current devices as it can only pass what is left of the 500mA hub supply after the cable's requirements, which seem to be pretty low. Interestingly I also tried a Tripp Lite U026-10M 33 ft and could not get sufficient power. Their 16ft version did not suffer the same shortcoming.<br /><br />BlueRigger is an excellent cable, well built, no problems and a great price to boot.<br /><br />*Edit*<br /><br />For those who find the info useful this cable has a very low current requirement which leaves about 450mA available for devices plugged into it. BlueRigger responded to the current usage on this cable as follows:<br /><br />Dear Customer,<br />Thank you for your interest in our products. The USB Extension cable with consume around 50mA current for its functionality.<br /><br />Please do let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.<br /><br />Thank you<br />BlueRigger LLC
0226264211|5.0|In the post-Lehman world Milton Friedman has regained his 1970's role as someone to scare children with. In reality the writing of a Friedman, or for that matter a Keynes, is much more nuanced and diverse than their adversaries would probably want it to be. The monetarist Friedman is the second most influential economist of the 20th century. His ideas on privatizations, taxation, deregulations and monetary policy have had huge global impact the last 30 years. This is a book on economic and political freedom that has been translated to 18 languages and sold in over 500.000 copies. It was written in 1962 at the height of the hegemony of Keynesian thought.<br /><br />I read this book due to a promise I made. I've never before read anything by Friedman as I try to stay clear of economics literature to instead focus on business and investing. But in fact this is more a text on political philosophy than economics. It's a book in the same genre as Friedrich von Hayek's The Road to Serfdom (Hayek is mentioned three times in the multiple forewords) or dare I say John Stuart Mill's On Liberty. In the text Friedman tries to define what the state's role should be from a liberal point of view (in the original sense of the word, not the current US use). Friedman is hardly the libertarian anarchist you might expect. In fact there is a rather long list of tasks he assigns to the state - although not as long as the politicians have assigned to it. Some of the things the author writes are of course exactly what his antagonists would expect, for example that the business of business is business. However, the reason that Friedman does not want companies to have social goals is not that he thinks the issues lack importance, it's rather that they relate to policy issues that should be decided by the democratic state. \\"The existence of a free market does not of course eliminate the need for government. On the contrary, government is essential both as a forum for determining the \\"rule of the game\\" and as an umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided on.\\" On top of that, if companies have too many goals, they will fail to reach them all. Other things in the text are probably quite different from expectations. Friedman for example suggests negative income tax for those with the lowest income to ensure a minimum level. Yet other things written might actually be different from what fellow liberals expect, such as his opinion that the core unit of the society is the family, not the individual.<br /><br />One interesting passage is where the author discusses the federal system called old age and survivor's insurance (OASI), very much like the pay as you go pension schemes of most western countries. Friedman sees the system as consisting of three separate parts - a) the obligatory to purchase annuities to provision for old age, b) the requirement that they should be bought from the state and c) a redistribution of income insofar that the value a specific person is entitled to is not the same as what he is paying for. \\"Clearly there is no necessity for these elements to be combined.\\"<br /><br />After reading this book you are struck by the fact that Friedman seems to have been a very nice person - how come then, he's so disliked? This quote might provide a clue - \\"Competitive capitalism promotes political freedom because it separates economic power from political power and in this way enables the one to offset the other.\\" This is probably why capitalism and its proponents are so disliked by the political intelligentsia. They don't want to share power. Friedman is an über-academic and the book is written 60 years ago, it's not always an easy read. At the same time there are plenty of highlights and the book supplies ample memorable quotations.<br /><br />Friedman notes that it's only after a crisis that real changes occur and when they do, the ideas that are available at the time and are not contaminated by the crisis will be picked up pretty much regardless of their merits. So the obvious question is what ideas will surface this time? I'm afraid Friedman wouldn't approve of all the possible answers. This is an old book that will give you fresh perspectives on current events.<br /><br />This is a review by investingbythebooks.com
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Based on first episode, I was not sure whether I would like this show or even bother to continue watching.  I really liked the way  Green Arrow was written in Smallville and the way Justin Hartley played it, so it was a bit of an adjustment to accept this different version.  Having watched several now, I plan stick with the series.  Story starts off slow, but they are now building the back story and character development very well.  Stephen Amell as the lead was a good choice for the tone of the show and direction they seem to be taking the story.  Another plus for the show... the actors Paul Blackstone and John Barrowman.  Both of these actors have been in other scifi or fantasy genre shows and are doing great with their characters in Arrow.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Game has great graphics and a good story line. I would definitely recommend this game to others. The free trial h looked me and the cost to unlock is reasonable.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A Higher Calling is a great read for several reasons. Even beginning with the author and how he was influenced by his grandfather's stories about WW II is pretty unique. Then the two stories of the German Ace and the American Pilot are told separately in great detail. Forty-two years later, their stories merge and add closure to one of the most compelling questions that men of war might ask in their memories--why did that man spare me and give me a life? A Higher Calling is a great read who appreciates the insights into the human struggles of war and the life and death moments that warriors experience.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books.  I finished 50 shades<br /><br /> in no time, they were a little too mushy in some places but the overall experience was good. I would defiantly recommend them.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I listen to the ocean sounds and imagine myself at the beach as I drift off to sleep. lots of sounds to choose from.
B00AQF8CJ0|2.0|Fun game, however mushroom power does not work.  At least on the kindle fire it does not and the touch pad controlling needs fixed
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I have revisited each story in Alice Munro's Dear Life collection days after reading it. Her characters are grounded and always &#34;one of a kind&#34;. They live deeply and struggle in always surprising and new ways..
B003ODIZL6|5.0|When I read the original, I thought that it couldn't get any better, but I was very wrong! The adventures in this sequel make you cling to it, and want more when it's over. I truly mean that, evidenced by me crying after I finished reading. This is a highly recommended thrilling novel! And like I said, I cried at the end!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Times are changing, but not the inclusion of many narratives about Seal training and books on Delta-The Hunt for Bin Laden,  Sole Survivor, Seal Sniper, not to mention the Military &  Discovery channels coverage of the '' war on terror ''.  so I was pleased at the quality of the author's story telling skills and the glimpses of daily life in the teams. Seal Team members I met when I was a PH5 stationed Pensacola and San Diego frankly scared the Hell out of me.. so I enjoyed this insightful account of Seal Team life as a navy NCO specialist.<br />I loved the book, and was frankly surprised by the way things  ended.  I would be proud to call any of these heroic guys my friend! They deserve the same respect that we have for our Founding Fathers,  they are made of the same metal!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This was by far the most interesting piece of literature that I ever read!! I was amazed at the many thrilling twists and turns that this wondrous book had to offer!! I don't think that I will ever find a book as exceptional as this!!!!
B004IDG97S|4.0|This is a classic Stallone movie. Why do I need to rate it. It is one of a collection of sci-fi/futuristic movies that over the years have been moved in the sci-fi hall of fame.
B004OZZ624|5.0|The suspense keeps u'r mine going and ur eyes open all the time I was hoping that they would get away and that's no joke.  A must see...!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It is a rather dark movie with tons of graphic violence. However, I knew that going in. I was, however, very happy with the movie and didn't understand the entire plot until the end. Good Movie.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I must say when i had a issue you all fix it my order was on time and everything so thanks alot !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|At first, I was not impressed with the sex every time you turned the page but later realized this was much deeper than just \\"mommy porn\\".  It's a love story built off tragedy, obsession, control, true love and affection,growing and learning together.
1451695195|4.0|I found it fascinating. Wish more details were spent on the 'journey', rather than what was going on in the real world at the time.<br />Good read though.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|If you are a fan this is one you will want for your collecton.<br />You will not be dissapointed. Excellent!
B004SBX112|1.0|My wife loves playing this game on her Kindle Fire.  Worthwhile to purchase this game in order to skip the advertising.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|very entertaining game. graphics are beautifully done. the mini games are fun. only issue was the game was a little short.  overall, I think it was great!
B006PTL1QM|4.0|This Movie is pretty good. A psychiatric doctor who's just starting his career gets sexually involved with a his patient however i thought the facial expressions of Keira Knightley who plays the patient was a little over the top. Her acting in this movie just didn't seem to natural for a patient who was having emotional problems but she is not one of my favorite actress's. Her acting to me just comes off as that, &#34;acting&#34;, She's not one to me that makes me feel the part she plays.
0547884591|5.0|I bought this book hoping to learn to speak Spanish.  While I still intend to do just that, this book made me think about learning in a whole new light.  I am trying to improve my running and realize that time and more running will help but I went from running .25 miles at 5.5 mph to .8 miles at 7 mph in two days.  How?  I deconstructed the running form and broke it down in to the basics.  It is about doing things more efficiently.<br /><br />Now that I see how his system works I've broken down Spanish and am ready to start learning.  What a great book.<br /><br />All of the recipes are slow carb friendly.  I don't follow the slow carb diet too much anymore (as he lays it out).  I've learned the how and why of food and have my own way of eating that works.  These recipes are great, however, and I plan on using a lot of them.<br /><br />Tim is a great writer and story teller and you'll enjoy the book for the entertainment value as well.  He tells a story of being a student in Japan and that they learn to do math on an abacus.  I am going to order an abacus ASAP as I've always been very poor at math.  Thanks Tim!
1416583432|2.0|Terrible. If you are interested in learning why your dogs licks his anus, why he rolls or eats poop, why he jumps on you, why he eats your baseboards and why he digs holes to China, this is NOT the book for you.<br /><br />If you are intersted in reading boring stories about comparing human psychology and how it compares to a dog sleeping all day, then buy this book immediately.<br /><br />I could not relate any of this to my dogs' beahvior because the book was written like a college science book.<br /><br />If you are a psychologist, you'll love it. Otherwise beware.
B005LAII62|5.0|A reallyl funny DVD in 'cartoon' form.  Great for all the family, I will watch this again and again I enjoyed it so much.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really  enjoy this game for hours on end. Nice graphics easy to follow. My son enjoys this game also
B004MC8CA2|4.0|thi app is all right if you ask me but the only problem is that I need to have Wi-fi to make it work... which means I can't  take it to church but it is a good app.<br /> &hearts; God
B004FP1WX0|3.0|I pretty much agree with Spurlock since I did find Catfish to be entertaining. There are a few things that I question about the film, but mostly wonder why Angela never directly apologized to Nev in the film . She cried for her lost youth and felt shame for what she did, though it really seemed to me she about being caught once confronted by Nev and the boys. It was only the ending credits that it is revealed that Angela gave up the fake Facebook accounts. This seems more like acceptance and resolve to give up the sham then remorse for what she did for so long.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great read, History and fiction together makes a great read. This book I will read over again. If you like history and vampires you will really like this book..
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I purchased this cd. and I love it. It wasn't all broken up like most cds when purchased in the mail. Shipping fast. I will purchase from them again when I get cds through the mail..
B004VMUS9G|2.0|The countdown alarm, alarm and stopwatch works. Other than look nice, It doesn't do anything my phone already did with out it. Look through your apps again, the countdown alarm and stopwatch feature is under CLOCK, or at least on mine it is.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Its the classic Pac-Man, which is great. I love the game. This version, which is touch screen of course, can be difficult to maneuver at times. Try this free lite version first before you buy the real thing.
B008XK69S6|5.0|This review is just scratching the surface of what it does! And it is easy to use. This product works on a lock screen without  a password and you don't lose any of your phone unlocking features. The sound seems to me to be the same and it comes with an equalizer.  It lets you explore all the albums digitally in a way that is very nice to look at. You have the choices of seeing it like a photmontage (a bunch of images put together, in an order) or list of categories. The categories are artists, albums, playlists, genres, all songs, folders, and customize view. Customize view is not for me that useful, i'd suggest unchecking all the boxes in customize view. In Artists, it shows you multiple albums that each artist makes, under the artist name, of course. The genres seem to personalize to what genres you have already on your phone.  It has  an album auto download feature, that you can turn off if you don't want it. It also has a resume playback feature that automatically plays music again after you end a call, which you can also turn off if you don't want it.
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|Very powerful protrayal of a sad part of the United States. Jennifer Lawrence is a wonderful actress, for her young age.
1449410243|2.0|Wouldn't have purchased this item as a gift if I was aware of that it contained some unnecessarily crude content.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's voice as beautiful as ever. You'll love it. Have purchased all her CD's so far and they seem to get better.
1423140605|5.0|11year old Grandson has given this series his total seal of approval.  He loves the mythological background, he thinks the hero is truly heroic, he says the story is one you can read over and over again and still enjoy.  The series has even inspired him to write his own Heroic Stories.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy this show!  It has a little bit of everything ... mystery, romance, adventure, and a lot of charm!  All the actors do such a great job, you feel like they are your friends.  And all the folks behind the scenes on this show work so hard to make everything look so real, you think it IS real.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Each song belongs on a &#34;best of&#34; album for multiple artists.  Here you have them performed by the songwriter herself.  I disagree with Ms. King's politics, but her musical genius is undeniable.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This replacement cable does a great job for what I needed!  So pleased to get it and be able to charge my Kindle again!
B0063IH60K|5.0|At first I was a little confused because I never played putting the aces on the side.  Once I asked the app to show me how to win and I did, I really started to love it.  Now I am addicted.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Game is awesome!!!<br />Story line was addicting you have to know what happens. It keeps you on your toes the whole time.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I never remember the game having as many ads as it does now. I downloaded it so my 2 1/2 year old could play but I Have to supervise him on it because I have to click off the ads between every level. It's insane how many there are. I understand a few here and there, and the fact that I only have the free one, but c'mon!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is unlike any other...interestingly historical, romantic and funny.  I cannot wait to watch every episode. The characters are great. The storyline moves quickly so you don't lose interest. Sad to hear that one of the main characters will be leaving.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Looks good in red. Compact, easy to place in purse, easy to use, cleans easily and the price was  right.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I couldn't put it down it was amazing keep writing those books for the kids to read if they love it as much as I did Jeff Kennedy has it going his way
1442359315|5.0|This book is very exciting - lots to ponder. Because of who the author is, it has more credibility than most of the woo-woo stuff that's out there, seems more grounded in reality. Great book, great service.
0061692042|5.0|Book : Excellent<br /><br />Service and communicatin : Excellent<br /><br />Very satisfied customer.<br /><br />Please use other Post Office infuture, if possible - this time was in the heart of Hillbrow!!
B004WR125O|5.0|Pretty simple just plug it in and set up the wireless connection. It works like it should. you can hook it up to the from or the the back of the receiver and it works the same i have the TX 515
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|I totally enjoyed this concert.  I felt like I was right there.  When the sun was shining, I felt the warmth .  When it went down I felt cooler just like I needed a jacket. Andre Rieu is a great entertainer!!!!!
1481251880|5.0|All I can say is after reading a good portion of my life the last 40 years or so this was by far one of the best love stories I have had the honor of reading.  Once my girls are old enough ,I will have them read this story before their first real kiss so they know how it should be.  If its not like this then it's not true Love and they should keep searching until they feel the way it is described in this book.<br />Way better than slammed hands down.
B000ME5B30|5.0|If you thought global warming was a maybe or something natural, you really should see this. I hope it changes your life.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Written in personal style, just as if Ellen was talking to you. Good funny book that was interesting all the way through
0525423656|4.0|For me, couldn't put the books down.  Enough description to keep the interest and imagination active.  Couldn't wait to get to book three.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This was very moving.  The writing style was wonderful and you really became one with the characters.  Would highly recommend.
B000TERDHA|5.0|I WATCHED,'SHUT UP AND PLAY THE HITS'. KNEW I HAD TO GET SOME OF THE MUSIC. THESE DISKS ARE AWESOME.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina is a good writer and spot on with her perceptions of things.  At least for me, I must think like her!
098555780X|5.0|JD was making tutorials and you tube videos long before it hit the popularity it is now. The book is excellent. The pictures are clear and concise. JD continues to innovate. There are a lot of ties in this book that I have not seen any where else. My 8 yr old can follow the directions in this book and easily follow the directions to tie things she has never seen before.<br /><br />There was no skimping on the quality of the materials of the book. The pages are heavy and glossy with excellent clear printing.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish.  Loved his &#34;liberties&#34; with events in history, plus his current adventures.
B008MEM24S|5.0|&lt;3 I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!  &lt;3 LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Such a funny movie.......haved watched it several times already and still laughing. Highly recommend.  Right up there with Brides Maids.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is pretty fun and free. Maybe a little easy, but well worth the price! I would recommend it for sure.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great finale book, to an awesome triology! I would highly recommend to anyone. If you read the first two, Mockingjay is a must!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is totally fun-easy maneuvering with stylus in hand. Will download other simular apps .Are there some you can recommend....
B003UBTX6S|5.0|A friend recommend this series to me and I just love it. This is the second book and it finally pieces together the loose ends from Beautiful Creatures just to leave you wondering more. What's Ridley up to now? How is Link going to handle becoming one of them? Can Ethan and Lena make it through? How does Macon take to his new self? Plus who is John Breed....and so many more.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|The themes are more consistent with the aging process, but her music has brought much joy to me over the years. Kind of like , Bob Dylan or Willie Nelson, I am at least going to think about anything they do.<br />I guess Sade is like another female artist Lucinda Williams, who is always going to give you your moneys worth some are more precious than others. Artists like these become part of the fabric of our lives, like the clothes we wear, the food we dine on it becomes part of our DNA of the Soul.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Being a former squid myself this book was great and it kept me wanting to read it all night until I was done with it. I want to thank Mr. Kyle and everyone else who has served this great country.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|Too many story/family lines to follow.<br />convenient coincidences in tying together characters. Too much detail. I found the length tedious.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Good read....read this book in one day. Anyone who has a friend of family member with mental illness should read this.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of Beatles music. If you've seen the musical Cirque Du Solei Love this album was the inspiration.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|If you don't know anything about this artist look him up! He's awesome, his music is sexual, relatable, and unique. His beats are soothing while some are more edgy and raw. I love all 3 disks, love to listen after a long day and need to wind down.
193609648X|5.0|As an experienced crocheter I found great projects in this book.  Cover shawl is just one of the beautiful patters,
B008BU70HW|5.0|If you need a fix between new episodes you'll find it here.  Love anything about my favorite show and the intriguing characters.
1840224886|2.0|I was hoping for something classic and sensual. It was so uninteresting and a pain to get through. It dragged on. Buy something else!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|The DVD came very quickly through the web site.  The series is extremely entertaining.  You can't go wrong with this.
B00A992W9Y|5.0|Have to say I really enjoy listening to her new c.d. while working out.  There are some slow songs but most are upbeat and fun
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I'm not sure if it's the app or if it's Amazon, but this app did not download to my Galaxy Tab 2.0.  All of the FREE apps downloaded just fine.  This app cost me 14.99 and I still don't have it.  There is nothing on the email confirmation or the Amazon website to tell me how to get it to my tablet, other than to go onto the Amazon app store with my tablet.  When I do that, all I get are suggestions for what other apps to buy.  I'm not likely to do that again, at least not through Amazon.  I think I'll stick with the Android Marketplace.
B004OR199G|5.0|Thank you Kris Carr for writing this comprehensive book about how our bodies work and proper God Pod maintenance.  You taught me things that I have never heard of and did it all in an entertaining, funny way.  Your book is my new bible of life.  I also appreciate the support that comes along with your book via your web site, facebook, etc.  I've since purchased your Crazy Sexy Kitchen and an on my first ever 21 day cleanse.  My God Pod applauds you for opening my eyes to a new and wonderful way of life.  Yes, I highly recommend this book.
0321701763|4.0|The book was used what I thought but it's missing the disc and you need that to complete assignments in the book.  Thank goodness the teacher has the assignments in files but I wont be able to sell it back without a disc.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It held my attention from page one to the end.  There are no ups and downs, every page is equally as interesting as the next.  If you are looking for high drama--it's not here, just an honest, straight forward attempt to disclose how hiking the Pacific Crest Trail changed someone's life for the better.  I highly recommend this book.
0425252868|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the movie or better yet, a 10 part mini-series on H.B.O
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It`s absolutely fantastic - video and sound together  - both in the the normal and the 3D format are a delight , an absolute treat .<br />A definite YES for buying !
B009U9S6FI|5.0|An inspiring and honest look at adversity in life and looking beyond tragedy to a greater purpose in life.  An excellent read starting with the horrors of the holocaust that takes your breath away.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|For a free app Angry Birds is fun, bug free and challenging. A more available explanation of the capabilities of the different bird would have made it better for me.
B004EPYZUS|2.0|The first \\"Mission Impossible\\" feature film was excellent.  Solid cast, good script, and, it worked.  The next two features were only fair, so I was hoping \\"Ghost Protocol\\" would get the franchise back-on-track.  But, i was truly disappointed.<br /><br />The script needed better focus, the entire production was about 10-15 minutes too long, and the cast was only so-so. Cruise's nod to \\"being hip\\" & \\"current\\" with his \\"hoodie\\" image was/is really a stretch !  Could have done without that for sure.<br /><br />All-in-all, outside of a few special effects, \\"Ghost Protocol\\" was a film that I hoped would pick-up-speed, get focused, or, just plain get to the good part of the script...but, alas, that was not to be.<br /><br />Confusing, disjointed, only mildly entertaining...and w-a-y too long.  (Spoiler alert: The \\"chase\\" sequence during the sandstorm could have been shortened by about 2  minutes and might have been good.  As it was, I kept waiting for it to be over !)
B001974DG0|5.0|My favorite of all the Koontz novels. Like many of his readers, I wish for a sequel, but like Mr Koontz I fear it might leave me disappointed.
0765325950|1.0|Yeah, I really want to wait an extra 4 months for the ebook to be released. NOT!  I only ever buy ebooks these days - I move house often, and REALLY don't need more paper to cart around.  Presumably the book is in a digital format before they print it, so getting it out in an ebook format can't be difficult - I can't understand this decision.  IF an ebook is released ASAP, I will remove this review.

B004MYFV0O|5.0|It gives me the basic technical knowledge to draw the prospect drawing. I am sharing the knowledge with my friends who are in my drawing class.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great period show.  My wife and I watch an episode a day.  We will go through withdraw when caught up.
1452110581|5.0|Not just witty but good well written poetry.  Very impressive cat authors.  Fun to read and even more run to read aloud and share with others.,
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you have an HD TV and a blu-ray player, then you need this series. The images are wonderful, and the narration is perfect
B004DM0UII|5.0|This application is much more than any other. It's like having the best long wave/short wave right in your Android device. Works well under any circumstances. Bravo for this keeper!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|toattly worthit probly the best game on earth<br />never repeating this game I rate it 5 stares review<br />I recomand ot to ages 6-18
0525478817|5.0|I've been looking to buy this book for sometime now, and finally caved to try it. Normally, I don't enjoy YA fiction very well because, well, I find them usually poorly written. That is far from the case of this book. John Green's writing reminds me somewhat of Kurt Vonnegut's. Not in the writing style, but rather, like Vonnegut, Green can write work that is easy to read quickly and miss how deep the actual words are. It honestly takes deliberate readings for the words to mean what they were intended.<br /><br />The main characters, Hazel and Augustus, were wonderful. I admit that I didn't much care for them at the beginning. They sounded too self-pitying (Hazel) and pretentious (Gus), but by a third of the way through, I had come to love them both. I love that Hazel isn't worried about being an \\"inspiration to all people\\" in her illness, but rather, that she is just trying to live a life with cancer the best way she knows how. Augustus... what a wonderful character. The metaphors, the smiles, the romancing. He made me swoon, and I'm a straight guy. :D Together, their love story paints a picture that I couldn't even conceive at first.<br /><br />By the way, surprise character: Isaac. He's hilarious, and I couldn't help but feel sorry for Monica for losing out on such a great guy.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I was hoping to read a novel in historic context and felt the book was more interested in soft porn.
B00AHXDECG|3.0|I regret purchasing this whole album seeing as how I only like 2 songs on it. But I based my decision to purchase it off of his last one which was amazing. Unorthodox Jukebox just fell flat for me.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|It would be great for kids or adults. Problem solving without a lot of effort, very relaxing, an easy way to pass the time
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|Enjoyed the move on TV and wanted a copy to have anytime I wanted to watch it.  I didn't realize who the author was so am glad to have one of his works.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Following Charlie was genuinely a warming and thoughtful experience. I can see myself reading this again and again. I only wish the book had been longer.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book sucked me in from page 1. Amazing detail and altogether great premise. A must read for all geekdom.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King, although this is not his typical novel.  It is imaginative as all of his books are, and kept my attention.  There is one small section that was a bit dry, but it doesn't last long.  You won't be disappointed in this one!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Because I got turned on by the sex scenes and by wondering what this fantasy couple would be up to next.  Surely this was written by an adolescent who's been sexually abused.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This wasn't a bod book, but I just didn't understand why everyone was raving so much about it.  I was a pretty much a dumbed down version of Battle Royale.  Maybe if I was 12 years old, I would have appreciated it more.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Unbelievable but fantasy fulfilling--no relationship is ever like this one, so don't measure your relationship against this exaggerated version.  Sex like this may occur at the beginning of a relationship but is highly unlikely to continue like this.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|THIS WAS A ACTION PACK MOVIE THAT DID NOT LET UP I ALREADY HAVE WATCHED IT TWICE<br />AS WELL AS MY WIFE JEREMY RENNER JUMPED INTO THIS ROLE WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT<br />OF WHAT A BOURNE MOVIE IS ALL ABOUT
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is a fun, sexy read.  If one remembers that it is written by the voice of a 20 something newly graduated from college, the simplistic, naive, romantic hogwash can be somewhat forgiven.  I did enjoy the sex scenes, but the rest was puerile and badly written.
B004DM0UII|3.0|I have been using this application daily. It works great for listening to my favorite National Public Radio broadcasts via the west coast. The sound quality in the music broadcast from the 80s channel is not top notch. The music sounds like all the vocalists overemphesize the S sound and are sing in a long hallway.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy series and movies with this theme. It's been awhile since something new has come out and I am enjoying this!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept you guessing.  I never write reviews but this one was worth it.  Read it you will not be sorry
B0099TJ4YQ|4.0|Very enjoyable listening, but nothing really stands out as being that special.  We always enjoy mellow James Taylor music wish there was a little more variety to it.
1616614609|5.0|this game is awesome.  it is actually quite easy to pick up and start playing out of the box, with a steep learning curve and lots of strategy.  very interesting asymmetrical gameplay - one person plays defense, while the other offense.  very slick, unbelievably balanced.  i'm still learning, but i find i like it more and more...
B009GEFXLC|5.0|They are adorable together! Great series..we watched it from the beginning...Amazon Unbox is great cause no commercials! Well worth it!
1589949811|5.0|i picked up this game because i always like the option to play solitaire if possible.  i'm interested in the hobbit expansions, though after playing a few games of this, i will probably wait and get other expansions before that one.  i also picked this game up instead of game of thrones LCG because i heard that AGoT was more fun with more people, and this one scales well (making it fun with two, or even solo).  read up on any of these games on boardgamegeek for lots more info.  happy gaming!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|My original review described an installation signature issue, but I removed the older version and then installed the newer version without a problem. I was disappointed the developer didn't tell us about that, but the app does have a good choice of channels and sound quality is also very good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is THE BEST!!!!!  Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!  The acting is A-1, the costumes are authentic & totally marvelous, the setting is gorgeous, the story line is awesome!!!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Really disappointed.<br />She should return to writing children's books.<br />Characters in this book have no redeeming qualities,<br />Not worth reading
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed Hunger Games.  It grabbed my interest immediately.  I don't  know if I would have read it if it was not for my Christmas gift of the kindle fire he.  The book was very well written and graphical.  I can't wait to read the next book.
B00005NKKV|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas Gift for my mother. She loves and listens to it quite often. She had the album when she was in college and she loved it then.
B009IF82SK|5.0|The much anticipated sixth season has not disappointed. Is it possible that this show just gets better? The characters and writers seem to be in the soft-spot. Great season so far.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|As a college student I don't really have much time to read books for fun. However, I am very glad that I picked up this book over Winter Break. All of the characters are realistic and they have wonderful voices. I've been recommending it to anyone who will listen!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great next plot in the story. Definitely had me anticipating every next word, page, chapter. Can't wait to start next book.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great writing, number one. Good pace, no on and on with useless fill-in.  Gritty story.  And she always has totally unexpected twists.  You can never guess how the story will end, and she ends it well.
1401232590|5.0|To be brief, I loved this Batman story because it was a great mystery and detective story first and foremost.  It featured many Batman characters and I loved the depiction of the dark knight.  I highly recommend this to any Batman fan who loves the characters and universe.  One of the best and most satisfying Batman comics.  (To clarify I am not extensively read in Batman, but have read a few of the standards: The Long Halloween, Dark Knight Returns, Year One.  The Killing Joke and Dark Victory, the sequel to The Long Halloween are on the way.)
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Great movie!  Would recommend it for a great Saturday night stay at home movie with a beer and good popcorn.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I am still working through this book trying to get my book ready for Kindle. I am not having much luck understanding the section on how to include illustrations, and I would prefer the pictures of computer screens bigger. I think my programs are also a little old, as some of the instructions are not able to be done on my computer. I felt it needed more of a simpler approach - after all I am not a computer genius!!
1451695195|4.0|I followed what he was writting about but he got too much into the medical about it. Talking about how the brain functions etc. kind of threw me.  But it was okay.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|My 11 year old LOVED this video. It was well worth the money. Your \\"Directioner\\" will love this tour video.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This version was a lot closer the feel of the comic book. One thing that always bothered me about Stallone's version is the fact that he had to take his helmet off...so, every one could see it was him. Karl Urban pretty much kills this as the main character. The dark humor is looked over in this version...and a lot of the political satire. HOwever, this film delivers the visuals and the action. I really had a lot of fun watching it. Some of the special effects were awesome! Most likely a potential cult classic here.
B008EQIK90|2.0|Funny at times but to vulgar for my ears!  I stopped watching in the middle because of the language and filthy ideas.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|So bad but so good<br />what more can one say about a moive that is so bad but so good
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book? Real or not real? Real. I had a hard time putting this book down. When I did put it down I kept thinking about it. Rarely does a book or series make me think about it after I am finished. I still don't know if I am happy about the way it ended. Would I want Kantniss to end up with the person who I thought she should be with when I started this series or not. I don't know. I think I would have felt conflicted either way. Overall I love this series
1932735410|5.0|This was a great book and just as important as the PMP Handbook in studying for the test. I read it, studied it, and did all the sample tests. I also took a local one week course. I studied for about 3 weeks after the course using this book as my primary tool and was able to pass the test.
0545425115|5.0|Wow what a book. The stuff these poor kids go through. The way they change. I cried so hard at one point that I couldn't breathe. Made me think. Been a good while since I have read something this good. Don't know how the second book could be anywhere as good as this one and I can't wait to see the movie compares to the book. Hope they don't butcher it too bad.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|100% great, the acting, the story, the clothes..it is so exciting while you are watching that you just can't get enough<br />you want more.
0439023491|4.0|I thought that this book was very good even though it started out slow. Some moments really surprised me, some made me laugh, others made me cry. Can't wait to read mockingjay
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Just a vile movie with gratuitous nudity and violence.  Left me feeling sick at the depravity of the characters.  Why do women allow themselves to be exploited in this way.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|great for passing time and it is fun the best comboes plus you will always want to play it so get the game and you will see what I mean
B001NTJTUY|4.0|The theme from the film and the film Somewhere In Time, is one of my favorite love story. Jane Seymour is so beautiful, I have a Screen Saver photo of her.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Amazed at how much easier it is to read these long classics electronically (which I love!) than bulky books.  Jane Austen is one of my favorite authoresses, and this book did not disappoint!  I love this time in history, and this was one of her books I had not read, or seen in mini-series form.  Plan to read more of her lesser-known novels...her style and characters just keep you wanting more....this novel was up to her usual excellence.
0345803507|5.0|my wife's book. She loved it.! She said the Fity Shades Trilogy was the best she has read in a long time. Fifty Shades Freed had her in tears at times.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you love scarey/ freaky this is the show for you. I watched the first season back to back on amazon in 3 days. Couldn't wait to start season two.  You may need a strong stomach for some of this but its awesome!!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I was charmed by the beauty of this book, it took me to places I could only dream of. A fine read
B0063GORYU|5.0|SPIDER IS MY BEST GAME RETRET. NOW THAT IT IS ON MY KINDLE', I CAN PLAY WHENEVER AND WHEREEVER I WANT TO PLAY.  THAT IS GRET!
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|it's an action film . No attempt to make some politically correct statement or make you question your beliefs . Just a good old kick butt fun ride .
B0085A9J18|4.0|I would have gave 5 stars but when i put the DVD in it started scratching. The description said It played fine.. I wiped it and it stopped scratching.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I went for less expensive, which was a bad move.  This case is only a month old and I may have used the stand 15 times.  The stand will no longer hold.  Also there is no place to store a stylus.  I would suggest spending a little bit more for durability and storage.
0765325950|2.0|After the last book being outstanding, i really had my hopes up for this one.  When i read it a book, normally its like watching a movie in my head, this book failed to draw me in and it was more of just reading words.  Some of the base characters went large periods of time without even a mentions so you were left wondering in the back of your mind what happened to them.  The battle got monotonous and it lurched around in a way that left it kind of hard to follow the time table.  When I read the end, the first thought that came to my mind was &#34;Really??&#34;  I don't know if it  was because being pushed to get written and published so fast or what but I would have rather waited a whole extra year than have it end like this.
B008V0OLOW|4.0|Diana Krall has to be one of the best female vocalists around. Her voice and artistic ability on the keyboard are amazing.
B004TI5N38|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Excellent story with lots of twists and believable characters.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Bob still has the ability to draw you into his lyrics. He never disappoints, even when trying out new music styles if he tries styles.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|If you like his other work, you will like this book. Strong character, good action, a few twists here and there. Lots of blurring of the lines between good and evil. The focus here is the old West. Indians, oh, I mean, Ghosts. Gold miner, settlers moving west. Happy trails? Not so much.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books and they were all excellent except this one.  The Panther was OK.  It did not move along like the others.  I had no problem putting it down for a day at a time.  He seemed to repeat himself.  I will read his next book and I hope it is better.  The Panter was like he was telling a story to me and his other books I was there with him.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a really good book. I enjoyed it, it definitely is a curl up on the couch book. Some elements will be disturbing . Older young adult book for sure.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My Granddaughter really loves this game.  She loves all the Dr. Lands spots.  I think is is also educational as well.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Just amazing! I feel as if I'm in a strange dream or movie.. the graphics and the music make this seem like it's real. This keeps my interest and I don't want to stop playing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was very well written and very interesting. I can hardly wait until the movie comes out. A very good read.
6304493681|4.0|The disk is in good condition only minor scratches. My only complaint is that there was some yellow stuff on the cover but it was nothing warm water and a towel could fix.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very important information to have for any healthy relationship. Makes distinctions in caring for another that we were unaware existed.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|We watch these constantly, having them in one box is such a small thing but super convenient. Only wish there would have been a blooper reel.
B00AIBZM40|4.0|Good acting, a monster that I don't see too little, good effects (even if it is all just CGI) and a story I can swallow...we have a winner!  This movie is nothing epic nor did it have the best scares I've seen in a while, but it's a horror movie that \\"works.\\"<br /><br />First time feature director Andr&eacute;s Muschietti  (writer/director of the short film Mam&aacute;) does a solid job with atmosphere and \\"creepy.\\"  The story gets moving when two orphaned girls are discovered in an abandoned cabin in the woods after five years somehow surviving on their own (now they're about 9 and 7 years old-ish).  Their eyes are cold and scared yet somehow predatory, their hair and skin far beyond wildly filthy, and their movement is so unnatural that it reminds me more of a Silent Hill monster than an animal.  More disturbing was the degeneration of their oral skills with the exception of whispering \\"mama.\\"<br /><br />Much to my surprise, the maternal poltergeist Mama was not a kept mystery.  Mama, her appearance, what she's capable of and her relationship with the girls are all presented to us right away.  So when the feral Victoria (Megan Charpentier; Resident Evil: Retribution, Red Riding Hood, Jennifer's Body) and Lilly are taken in by uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain), the movie doesn't rely on us wondering when Mama will pop up and reign terror on the new foster parents.  Instead we watch the girls maintain a secret relationship with Mama while remaining emotionally distant from Lucas and Annabel.<br /><br />But once their child psychologist and the new parents catch on to Mama's presence, simply a psychological manifestation or even a home invader by their perception, Mama feels threatened.  And once the girls begin to open up to the doctor or feel affection for their new parents, Mama gets pissed!  So we find ourselves not only nervous when we're \\"normally\\" nervous in these movies (e.g., walking in dark halls, opening the ajar closet door, looking over your shoulder to see what the girls are looking at), but we're also nervous when things wouldn't normally be unnerving...like when we see Annabel desperately hugging a thrashing Lilly, who starts to find the embrace comforting...I wonder if Mama is watching.<br /><br />What's interesting is how this movie has such a simple story with one simple revelation toward its end, no red herrings and no real surprises--yet, it really works.  I thought they had some trouble making the finale at the end come together, actually I thought it was too drawn out and a bit weak, but overall I was VERY pleased with this movie.<br /><br />We start out feeling edgy about the girls, and as they normalize we start feeling edgy about Mama (Javier Botet; creature actor of all three [REC] films).  And Mama is worth feeling edgy about.  She looks quite contorted, distorted and disturbing, moves like a bipedal yet quadriplegic demon on meth, and manifests an aura of decay.  I felt effectively continuously worried about what this apparition was going to do next, and the pace of the movie never disappoints.<br /><br />I feel like we've been trained to find piss poor acting to be totally acceptable when it comes to horror.  But Mama's cast features nothing but competency and a few pleasant surprises.  Of course, no one should be shocked that Jessica Chastain pulled off the stand-offish girlfriend turned hesitant parent.  But what about young Megan Charpentier?  As the reserved older sister Victoria and her stone cold portrayal of The Red Queen in the latest Resident Evil installment she has all the makings of both one of the youngest Scream Queens ever, but also a talented young actress!<br /><br />This movie was a pleasure with good characters, a monster that I don't see too little, good effects (even if it is all just CGI) and a story I can swallow.  I look forward to watching this with an easily scared date on my couch in the dark.  ;)door, looking over your shoulder to see what the girls are looking at), but we're also nervous when things wouldn't normally be unnerving...like when we see Annabel desperately hugging a thrashing Lilly, who starts to find the embrace comforting...I wonder if Mama is watching.<br /><br />What's interesting is how this movie has such a simple story with one simple revelation toward its end, no red herrings and no real surprises--yet, it really works.

0345529057|5.0|I cannot say much about these books that hasn't been said already however I will say that I have been advocating them for over a decade and have suggested/loaned them to most of my friends and only 2-3 people have ever not caught the bug. YOU MUST BUY THIS!
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This is the old LP back and better then ever .living things brought back my love for there music . It's like hearing them for the first time again refreshing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome read.  Well developed characters.  Not telegraphed, plenty of surprises. Lots of sweet romance while broken, damaged young adults navigate discoveries of a painful childhood.  Stands out from all other romance/coming of age novels.  You don't want to miss this.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|It's a decent connector when you know what it does.  While allowing many external FW400 devices to be accessed on newer macbooks, this adapter sends a very small amount of power to the device itself.  Enough to power most smaller external drives, but nothing more.<br /><br />Firewire audio interfaces WILL need to be used in conjunction with an AC adapter and then everything works just fine.<br /><br />I haven't checked this, but if the device connected to the TB-FW adapter has AC power plugged in, it SHOULD be possible to chain a hard drive or other FW 400 device off of it.<br /><br />Can anyone confirm?
B001P9EQH8|3.0|First, I purchased these two units in 2011. I ran across this item searching today and thought I'd write this quick review.<br /><br />I travel frequently for my job. I purchased some noise-cancelling headphones for travel - they were inexpensive Able Planet ones I bought from Costco. While the Bose sound great, I just couldn't justify the expense. While I liked these headphones, for many music tracks the sound resolution seemed thin. I purchased one of these headphone amps after searching some audio forums.<br /><br />Let me say, the first FiiO was STELLAR! It worked fantastic - exactly what I wanted. More life and resolution in the music, plus it was light and unobtrusive. Easy to charge from my computer while on the road. Inexpensive but good fidelity. This is not audiophile quality, but excellent price/performance ratio.<br /><br />Then...I left my headphones (and the FiiO, which was so easy to store in the carrying case)on the plane. Bummer. Gone forever.<br /><br />So I decided to try again. I purchased some different headphones that turned out to be more comfortable. The price was similar to the ones from Costco, and they were more comfortable and had better sound - [[ASIN:B00372YKMM AUDIO TECHNICA ATH-ANC27 Noise-Canceling Headphones]]. I bought another FiiO.<br /><br />At first, the FiiO was just as great. Then, all of a sudden without warning it stopped working. Light on. Tried different connector plugs to ensure it wasn't the wires that were the problem. NO SIGNAL. Ensured full charge by charging overnight, etc. NO SIGNAL. I take great care of my audio/hi-fi equipment. I think it was a defective unit.<br /><br />I tried to find a website or address or something to get an exchanged item. NO DICE. No help there, even thought it says it has a warranty. There is little valuable information on the enclosed manual. Their website had not useful information.<br /><br />Summary: when the item isn't defective, it works great. But if you purchase and it fails afterthe 30 day Amazon return window, you're out of luck.<br /><br />The new FiiO site is more robust than it used to be. However, their support is still very limited and not convenient. If it is defective...at this low price...it won't be worth the effort to return. :(
0143118757|4.0|I had to have this book for college. I all ready have homework. I like the fact that the book is already highlighted and I don't have to.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the writing. The author ability to present the main characters in so many different  aspects was interesting. Very likable to disdain is not easy to accomplish, and this was done with what appeared to be great ease. I would highly recommend Gone Girl, and I will also be reading her other books.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|I just saw this special and I just loved it!!!<br />Can't wait to put my hands on season 3.<br />I guess I'm getting addicted to this series.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|You can create anything you want from airplanes, to jetpacks to cars.  I would give this 6 stars if I could.  Good game for the entire family!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good read! This second in the series keeps up your anticipation for a long overdue happy moment for the heroine. Maybe that arrives in book three.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A fascinating read. The author gets a little technical at times, which is probably necessary, but which is not as interesting as the other parts of the story. Still, it's an excellent account of his glimpse of heaven and the illness that sent him on that journey. I highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best action packed love story I've ever read<br />With an epic ending this is the hunger games and anyone with a heart will read it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good basic card game. Especially like the \\"Hint\\" button that shows you moves you seem to over look at times.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is way better than temple run!I mean do you see icicles falling from the sky in temple run?I would recommend this game to anyone one likes temple run.SUPER PENGUINS!
B0063IH60K|5.0|the graphics are good on this game. I also like the timer on it. one thing it needs is a quit button
B004J4WLPU|4.0|This book is suspenseful, heartfelt and an overall good read.  The style of jumping present to past throughout was tricky to get used to at first but content easily made up for this.
B005FITIDC|5.0|It's a movie, What do you expect me to say.?  It arrived intact. I enjoyed watching it. What else is there to say about a DVD?
B0083SBMBM|4.0|Action packed almost from begining to end.  Reminds me of when I was a kid and watching &#34;The Justice League&#34; on TV...
B0098G7AWS|5.0|Watched this on our TV AND on our Kindle Fire HD! Awesome is all I can say. My granddaughter and I watched it together for the second time and the music, the fun, the romance...
030758836X|4.0|I am giving this four stars because I was completely captivated by this book until the second part. I even forced my sister to pick up the book because I was so excited about it. The ideas were interesting and the dual narrative was a lot of fun for most of the book. However, it was very difficult the last 100 pages or so to deal with the fact that I absolutely hated both of the main characters. I mean, I wasn't rooting for either of them. But I guess that is a rather interesting dimension to a book...to kind of like both of the characters at some point and then wind up hating them both.  I mean, I really didn't like the ending at all, but since I kept on reading, there's something to it...like an accident you can't turn away from! Read it to see what I'm talking about!!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is a consuming character!!  Once you start the read you don't want to put it down!  Read the whole series!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Awesome! A must watch.  I read the series 40 years ago and was thrilled it was finally a movie.  Can 't wait foe the next one.
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|dose not work with my kindle fire.!!!!<br />cannot find a fix.<br />the program is on the kindle but will not download anything fr my computer.<br />also very slow working on my computer!!!!!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Wanted cost effective protection for my new iPhone 4.  Did not want one of the oversized Otter Boxes, since I carry it in my pocket.  Also wanted something 'sticky' so that it would not slide off my truck's center console.  Has also protected it from a few drops.  Great function for a very reasonable price.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game and am addicted. I will not share it with my kids even though I got it for them originally. I just wish I did not have to work so I could play more, and that I had better wifi access. So is there really too much fun? If there is then this game is it.
B008Y5OW20|3.0|The CD had a lot of old time songs. Nice but wasn't what I expected. It was nice for easy listening but it did not ROCK.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|We all enjoyed this kids movie. The fairies look very lifelike and there is a good story and of course good moral content.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|My children wanted this item more than anything else on their Christmas list. But at the price I paid for it I feel I was ripped off. Their happy smiles at Cristmas wore off quickley when they opened the box to find the pitiful set of Minecraft legos. It is a shame I did not see the product for the waste it was and I am ashamed to tell you how much I paid for it on Amizon. All I have to say is buyer beware and I will do my shopping where I can see the product for now on.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I remember that other, horrible Dredd movie with Stallone, and this is so much better. Look past the stock one-liners, and you might see a richly drawn cyberpunk future.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This is another of the Harry Bosch series, which I personally love.  As usual Harry is always interesting.  This time he is on Stress Related leave from the Police Department.  There has been aan earth quake and his house is damaged ad he is not supposed to be living there, but of course he does.  To help keep himself busy he looks into a closed case and it is very interesting all the twists and turns it take.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has not yet enjoy the Harry Bosch series, you become a avid reader as I have.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|I thought it would be better, but I think that about every Tim Burton film since Beetlejuice (and maybe Edward Scissorhands).
B004LROUNG|5.0|This is a tale of a lawyer that quits his very demanding job as a Lawyer, that means that your work eight days a week ,, and stay most nights.  After a day of drinking he finds himself with two lawyers that do not take the work too seriously.<br />However, it is a very interesting story and a pleasant read.  Finally they all land in the courtroom and the courtroom is<br />truly John Grisham's place.  If you are like me and love the courtroom and all that goes into in, you will really take a lot of pleasure in this book..
B0052RDHTM|5.0|If you enjoy historical fiction, this is a must read. Follet does an amazing job bringing this story and his characters to life. Even though the story is long, it is fast paced and keeps you wanting to read more. I can't wait to read the second and the third book.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Me and my kids love playing uno on the kindle fire looks great, MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT IT DID NOT TELL ME THAT I NEEDED TO DOWNLOAD ADDITIONAL FILES.  Bought game on December 21, 2012 and on January 19, 2013 just about a month later we could not access the game was told that additional files needed to be downloaded.  THIS SHOULD BE NOTED BEFORE PURCHASE LET ME DECIDE IF I WISH TO GIVE UP 90MB.  This makes me suspicious of Gameloft and I will seriously think twice before I purchase another app from them there advertisement was misleading and did not warn you at all (yes I would have bought it if I had known in advance I love the game)this just feels deceptive.
B00AYB20KI|1.0|Wow one of most boring movies I have ever seen . Do not be fooled with the trailer , it's not supernatural at all it's about a girl that was hurt as a little girl that suffered a brain injury and now has unpredictable moods of violence , that's it . Oh ya I almost forgot she's got a brother that keeps her in a locked room in his house and from time to time she breaks out and he has to find her and get her back to the room before she murders someone . Oooooooo sounds scary ??? Nope
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Loved the movie and loved the music and when you listen to it you're reminded of each scene. Good price, also.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was recommended to me by a friend.  It is a simple game, but it is very entertaining .
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|After seeing the movie, I couldn't get the music out of my head. If you like hard rock, this is the best compilation you can find.
B009GX6600|5.0|One would think after 10 seasons that the show would get &#34;old&#34;, but as each season plays, I am just as hooked as I was in season one.  I think its because of the characters who are both familiar and yet still developing.  The writers have managed to keep the show from getting stale.  Good job!<br /><br />If you have never watched NCIS, I'd recommend you start at season one and enjoy each in order... I'd recommend this show for anyone who enjoys crime drama with a pinch of soap opera (without being cheesy).
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a great read. Can't decide which is better----this book or FORGOTTEN GARDEN. It kept me reading because I was so anxious to discuss with my friend who had recommended it. Would be a good book club selection.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Each chapter was devoted to the opposite person (husband & wife) but didn't flow well. Story evolved to a much anticipated ending which was extremely disappointing. This was the first book I've read in years that I absolutey hated. Waste.of.money!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was terrific. It was romantic, suspenseful, it was everything a book should be. I couldn't put my kindle down.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was a fitting climax to the Marvel movies that came before it. This is really the conclusion of stories carried over from Iron Man 1 & 2 the Hulk, Thor and Captain America. That it was done so seamlessly is a credit to Marvel Studios for orchestrating this grand opera. I grew up reading these comics and they transferred them to the big screen the same way i read them in the comics years ago. Not only did I enjoy it but so did my wife, my brothers and their families and my grandaughter and young nephews. Phase one of the Marvel Universe was great, can't wait for Phase Two
B00867GHS8|5.0|A great movie. Very funny and great graphics. Good viewing for young and old. I am sure everyone will like this.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Talking tom is they best me and little sisters love it so much and have so much fun with all thetalking friends I would suggust all they talking friends for anybody with or without kids
1451688091|5.0|What more can I say?  I knew of the historian who wrote the book and I wanted to read it and I am reading it.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|We are enjoying Arrow shows.  We had to purchase some to catch up on the first season.  While he seems to do some things that are a bit hard to believe, like shooting arrows when the bad guys are shooting bullets,  it's still an entertaining show.
B0086700CM|1.0|Very had to control the game. Glad it was free, I deleted it. very frustrating. It just raced right past the corners.
B00633W614|4.0|I thought the characters were well developed and the plot was plausible, for the most part.  I didn't like the assumption that the hero could do no wrong, either morally or intellectually.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|nobody knows how AWESOME this game is. I was the first one to know about this game!!!!!!!!!!!! PS best game ever!!!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|What's not to like w/a 3D, Blu-ray disc of one of the best (western) movies ever made !!! space filler.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  It's an easy to read, feel good book that makes you realize life is precious.  I have enjoyed all of the books by Mitch Albom, he is one of the best modern authors.  I think everyone should read this book!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|love this game......so addicting! Cant even put it down. Even bought additional coins for it :)  others should buy this game as well.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was a Christmas present , my son had ask for it months before it went on sell. Love the preorder, Even got a price match.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Some of his work I like very much and then there are some songs that are just out there. I am still experimenting with Eminem's music. I need to listen to more of his music in order to give a better review.
B00486UF52|5.0|I have given several copies of this book to family and friends. It's that much fun to read - either by yourself, or to someone else, preferably someone who has known the English and wondered why they do what they do.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|i thhink tjat this game is fun a nice brain game to pass the time  but it can get practically impossible but give it a try
B003L77FYS|5.0|Firefly is my husband's all time favorite show. He was so pleased to find Nathan Fillian in a new show. He especially loved the random references to Firefly. I bought these for him and he is engulfed. Great show with a great story line.
B0086700CM|3.0|fine, but not as good as subway surfers get that instead it also has more free upgrades to cool things like Xmas and New York City
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I was a little intimidated at first when I began this book, afraid I wouldn't be able to understand the old English language and terms. But it was easy to read and such a welcome change from all the empty, shallow writings of today. I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This was my first audio book on my new Kindle Fire and thoroughly enjoyed listening to it.  The reader was excellent.  He has an interesting and talented voice.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am downloading on my kindle now but I got it on my iPhone too and its a really fun game!
0765325950|5.0|For the first time, for me anyways, I could really SEE that it wasn't Robert Jordan writing this book.<br /><br />That said, it was a great ending to a great series written in an unbelievably compelling way. The Last Battle was as enthralling as anything in the series. It was The Last Battle we deserved and wanted for 20+ years.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|beautifully sculpted, sound and visually great! It was good to see the other stars from this production also, a real plus.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|First book seem the style wasn't quite there.  Funny to read same replica from the tv show. Inspire by the serie looking the same but not entirely the same.
B0067Q04AM|4.0|Robert Glasper is amazing on his own. Now pair that with musical giants like Lupe Fiasco, Musiq Soulchild, Chrisette Michele & the legendary Meshell Ndegeocello. That's pure genius! Get this album. If you are a true neo-soul fan, you will not regret it.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Finally manage to hae a goos style similar to the tv show without have to the word to words. I like the humo in it and the double and tripple meanning
B001NLKT60|5.0|Lisbeth truly is a fascinating character! It was such an easy and wonderful read and the descriptions on life and goverment in Sweden are fantastic.
B00A1XOPE8|1.0|The magic system seems clumsy and is not intuitive - takes pages and pages to explain. Then the explanation gets repeated 5 pages later.<br /><br />The book is filled with deep emotion and soul searching, but it all feels empty and artificial.<br /><br />I'm a huge Sanderson fan, but I got no joy out of this book.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Such a good read and so informative. I love books that also show the mundane day to day aspects of living in another country. Highly recommend it!
B008FRJ1IW|4.0|I can only say that the pricing was right and the delivery as quick as was promised. I had the box sent to my Daughter in another area of the State so that she could wrap it for me and deliver it to my Great Grandson in person.  I think it was as advertised and no problems were associated with the contents.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Anyone looking at the present state of the economy and the state of the American worker today really needs to view this film. As it was once said, &#34;anyone forgetting the past will be forever condemned to repeat it.&#34;
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Have seen these episodes years ago when they first came out, which is why I bought it.  Absolutely hilarious; John Cleese is absolutely brilliant
B009M5CJI0|4.0|This book is terrific, esp. as it follows Fall of Giants, but about 2/3 way thro I began to feel that Follett was needing to finish and perhaps short-changing his character development.  Also, the dialogue in the last part began sounding a bit amateurish, not up to the level of his other story telling sections.<br />I still look forward to the next installment and hope it is as great as the first.
0066620996|5.0|Hay pocos libros que me han movido a llevar adelante una transformación poderosa en mi y en mi equipo como este, vale mucho la pena si quieres ser grande
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this Apo its great for kids like me I cant imagine me not playing this a lot of kids will like this app
0977326403|5.0|Soc.<br />Straigh clear and realistic and suituiable for this days, social issues will be more and more important in this modern worldwide
B000I04044|5.0|Bringing up Baby is a classic that I shared with my daughters when they were only 12 and 6 and they are now 43 and 37 and when we get a chance, we watch it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|That book was amazing :)  definitely a book I couldn't put down :) I would recommend it to anyone :)
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Just the opportunity to see cloud for a longer period of time satisfies my love for the idea of him. Noticing the extra footage was the most beautiful thing....  I say Cloud Strife way before Clark Kent.... Ive purchased this movie too many times if we consider the &#34;norm&#34;. Spoiler alert! The blue ray version shows Sephiroth with the one dark wing... For all fans its a must have.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Nice and light. Good love story. Would recommend this book to anybody who love stories intended to be not to harsh?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|There's a reason this album is still selling gang-busters.  It is beautiful and amazing.  I never get tired of it.  I can't wait for her next album.
