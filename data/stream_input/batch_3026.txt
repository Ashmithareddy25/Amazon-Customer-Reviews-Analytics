B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Your DVD package was competitively priced, shipped and arrived ahead of expectations as a reasonable price, and works flawlessly, thus far. I've still to get the blu-ray installed due to cable incompatibility issue, my problem. Regular disk works. Thank you.

B000GCFG7E|5.0|Not only a great read but a truly good one, like all of the other Reacher books. I hope I have read all of them.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My first intro to Dr. Who. It's funny, outrageous, clever, space drama fun!  I enjoy Star Trek, Star Wars, Big Bang Theory, more traditional &#34;girl films&#34; like Downton Abby and Brittish humor. This touched a bit on all the types of entertainment I like.
1781162646|1.0|This book is a big disappointment.  After 180 pages, I gave up waiting for the dead body King keeps talking about to actually appear.  The story is populated by boring characters who have little conflict with their environment or each other.  SK was just riding his reputation on this one and phoned it in.  His many fans deserve better.  Save your money.  It's better spent at the carnival.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|This movie was good. I enjoyed the action and the &#34;futuristic&#34; setting was convincible enough to emerge me completely Young Mr. Smith did a great job.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not a reader. I actually hate it. My girlfriend talked me into this book and I absolutely loved it
0307120007|4.0|This book was one of my son's favorites and I had to buy it for our daughter too. It kills me that the book falls apart so easily. Why the plastic binder, I shall never know. I would have forked out for the hardcover this time, but I know we are stopping this child and was cheap. If we were just starting our family I would definitely say it is worth the extra investment.
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|not much on this. it doesn't really justify even loading it. It has potential though with some tweaks or updates.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Awesome hi definition version - I do like the remastered version better. Waiting for the Remastered version to come on dvd
B003VANOFY|3.0|The headset is solid and works really well.The only reason I give it 3/5 stars is because of the software that comes with it. The Logitech software, which is required for the surround sound to work, is really bad. On multiple occasions I would be listening to music and playing a game, when the speakers would suddenly start to produce a static sound. Removal of the drivers made this problem stop.<br /><br />So ya, the headset is great, but the drivers ar so bad that it looses 2 stars

B00EU98VVC|5.0|Nothing new about Tyr in this album really.  But who cares? I loved all their previous  albums and wanted another one just like them.  If I was looking for something new, I'd find a different band to which to listen.  If you want metal with your mead, then Tyr is always gonna deliver.

B005LB1MY6|5.0|I can only speak from my opinion, but I honestly consider this to be the better album of Justice's two bigger albums (the other being Cross). I personally enjoy the disco/80's stadium rock present in these songs more than I do the hard, choppy, aggressive, and very electronic sound of Cross. While Audio Video Disco didn't have as many strong hits as Cross (i.e. Genesis, Phantom, DANCE, Waters of Nazareth), it did have a much more consistent quality. Plus the majority of the songs from Justice that I do not enjoy are in Cross (i.e. The Party, Valentine, Brainvision). I also liked the fact that there were a lot more vocals in this album so I had something to sing to instead of beep, boop, and bopping to myself in my car feeling like an a**hole
B0031RS64G|2.0|I normally start my reviews with an encapsulating blurb - my take on the primary story line, but in this case I'm at a loss. There is no single story driving the action. It's very much an ensemble cast, and we watch them struggle to find their various ways through a turbulent period in the history of their world. That should give us lots to see and do, and it should be exciting. But it isn't. At least, not for me.<br /><br />The problem is that, in order to get excited by a story, I need to become emotionally invested in the characters first. But that just never happened for me here. So many people traipse through this tale, crossing and recrossing each other's story lines, that I just kept getting lost. Who is this, again? Who is he with now and what are they doing? Never mind that there doesn't seem to be a single likeable character in the entire mix. I just can't keep them all straight long enough to bond with any of them.<br /><br />So many of these characters seem to be interchangeable. There's a group of wizards, and a group of soldiers, and another group of wizards, and some thieves and some super-wizards... Most of the players in any one group seem completely indistinguishable from one another, and even characters from different groups seem equally depthless and banal. The magic system seems vague, and yet all powerful. I can't even tell how many races there are supposed to be, because it's not always clear whether this new \\"group\\" being mentioned is a race, or a religious order, or a nationality.<br /><br />The first time I tried to read it, I got about 20% in and bailed. But I've read so many good reviews that I decided to give it another shot. This time I got 98% of the way in - I reached the freaking climax! - and I was so confused and so underwhelmed by the big finish that I just folded up my tent and went to watch some TV instead. If a 500 pg book can't hold me during the last 50 pages, when it is purportedly paying off that 450 pg investment, there is something seriously wrong.<br /><br />A number of people have told me that it really starts coming together in book 2 or maybe book 3, but I'm just not willing to wade through 1000 or more pages of confusing crap to get to the good stuff. And frankly, I have a hard time believing there's anything in the future other than more confusing actions being conducted by interchangeable cardboard characters that I have come to loathe. So why on earth would I want to keep reading about them?something seriously wrong.<br /><br />A number of people have told me that it really starts coming together in book 2 or maybe book 3, but I'm just not willing to wade through 1000 or more pages of confusing crap to get to the good stuff.

0062059963|1.0|I don't often go around writing reviews about how much I hate a book. But, please, if you don't want to waste 5 hours of your life that you will NEVER get back, put this book down, delete it off your kindle, do whatever you need to to rid yourself of it.<br /><br />I am not, as a rule, picky when it comes to reading sub-par YA fiction. I read for fluff, for a diversion, not for expanding my mind or anything constructive like that. I read all of the Twilight books and loved them. Easily amused, okay? I'm no literary expert, as you've probably ascertained from reading this review. But THIS BOOK has ruined my day. I hated every single one of the characters and felt an overwhelming lack of connection with them. Their constantly shifting affections and allegiances have given me a nasty case of whiplash. Their selfishness and indecision is incredible. It's really hard to say at the end of the day who I despised more - Maxon or America. I will say that the author has made me feel more strongly towards these characters than I think I may have ever felt for any other characters in any other work of fiction.<br /><br />The sad part is, I liked the first book in this series, The Selection, enough to continue reading the second book. But, the characters have turned into people I no longer enjoy reading about.<br /><br />Please, don't waste your time. This is no story of love. When you love someone, you do not treat that person the way these two treated each other. For a lovely YA fiction love story, read Eleanor and Park instead - it is so indescribably sweet - you will cry, I promise. And you will love the characters, not hate them. Especially Park's adorable little Korean mother. But, that's a different review :)

0142420891|5.0|Loved. This. Book. As beautifully as Gayle Forman writes from the POV of young women, her real talent seems to be discovering the pov of sensitive, brilliant and confused young men looking to discover their place in the world. This is one of my new top ten favorite books of all time. Hoping for more sequels - Adam Wilde is too special a character to be abandoned.
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|This is quite the departure from the original.  I don't think I would have waited week after week to watch this series.  I did however watch all of it once I purchased it.  It is a unique story line with an odd unexpected twist to the storyline.  Not sure it exactly all fit in.  It's worth a watch but do not expect it to follow the theology of the first series.
014241543X|4.0|Simple, elegant, and the first part of a truly inspired YA series. Mia is a strong young female heroine who lives in the present rather than some dystopian future. But she is equally strong, independent, and compelling and gives new resonance and meaning to the roles of music and passion and family in young adult life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app very helpful! And really fun. Oh yeah! Also go get the fraction one 2! Also pretty helpful!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|As a regular visitor to the Hawaiian islands, and a fan of REAL Hawaiian music, I found this Cd just wonderful. I recognized most of the artists, several of whom are deceased, and they are truly pure Hawaiian sound. Of course, I loved the movie, so hearing the music ,which is so soothing and so reminiscent of our trips to the islands, just reinforced our Aloha spirit. This is a wonderful collection of great Hawaiian sound.
0345472322|1.0|There is something really mindless and borderline about this book.  Splitting is a core concept associated with the borderline personality having to do with their oversimplistic, dichotomous or black-and-white thinking.  Ms. Dwerk homogenized parts of a bunch of popular self-help books into one attempting to methodically develop a genre best seller.  Take a cool word, create a dichotomous relationship (haves and have nots, believers and non-believers, or, in this case the \\"growth mind set\\" versus not), then connect everything good and desirable on one side and everything undesirable on the other, and finally make vacuous associations with such blurry boundaries that it becomes too exhausting, tedious and of questionable value to disentangle her argument and you have MINDSETS: an exercise in self-promotion and the promotion of a pseudoscience and jargon.  I had read this for a psychological reading club and the enterprise will be remembered as one of my life's singularly most valueless exercises.  It is difficult to write any point-by-point review, because there is really no substance to this entire work.<br /><br />As Officer Drebin of the Police Squad movies states \\"Nothing to see here!\\"  There is no model of significance, nothing original or organized or unifying in this work.  If I want to read that people can change or don't beat yourself up after your expectations are not met by the outcomes or if you don't succeed, try and try again, I'll reach for Dale Carnegie who less bombastic and more honest about his work.  I'm sorry if I don't get how this reflects Ms. Dweck's competence as a psychologist and researcher.  She makes herself sound like she is some brilliant person for wrapping such aphorisms into a buzzword and then incessantly repeating that buzzword until you have to keep a bottle of motrin at your desk to get through the reading.  The book does not develop an original or  sufficiently rich model to account in any meaningful way for the interface between how human beings experience the world and should choose their battles and approach optimizing outcomes.  She uses buzzwords like success, but trying and trying is not necessarily about succeeding and succeeding is so much more than simply trying and trying.  Yet this self-promoting book reads like some meaningless mantra for the self-deluded.  Yet she continues to insist that here lies the answer to everything much like \\"The Secret\\" like other charlatans and cure-all potion sellers.  Having devoted my entire life to the study of mental health and psychology, there is a body of work on personality disorders far richer and more interesting than the over-simplistic pseudo-conceptions Ms Dweck is propounding.  If I were Stanford, I would be embarrassed that such trash was promoted from my hallowed halls.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I can't really comment on the overall selection of tunes.  I'm most interested in the classic material from the 60's and 70's, time will tell if the later stuff grows on me.<br /><br />To my ears, they've done a spectacular job breathing fresh life into the old chestnuts.  The remix of \\"Carry On/Questions\\" is like hearing a brand new song,  the old mixes were horribly muddy.  4+20 - gorgeous.  The only remix where I prefer the original is on \\"See the Changes\\", where Stills' excellent vocal is more distinct on the original album.  Love the remastered sound on \\"You Don't Have To Cry\\"<br /><br />Don't worry that \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" is edited.  They lobbed 30 seconds off the end of  the 1991 CSN boxset version, but that 30 seconds needed to go.  The old version did an annoyingly long fadeout, perhaps to mask a jam that was losing steam.  Trust me, the sound is better here, you ain't missing anything.<br /><br />As I'm writing this, \\"Ballad Of Hollis Brown\\" entered my headphones and grabbed me, grabbed me hard.<br /><br />Are others as pleased as me by the sound on this boxset?
B008ALAHA4|4.0|I have two of these MagSafe to MagSafe 2 converters for use on my order power supplies, adapting them to use on my newer MacBook Air.  It is a pretty simple device: on one side, there is an older size MagSafe connector that fits your older power supply and on the other side, there is a new smaller MagSafe to connector that goes onto your computer.  The LED indicator light on the power supply connector still works to indicate green (battery full), Amber (battery charging status) and off (no connection).<br /><br />I thought that the converter would be easy to fall off and lose, but it actually sticks onto the power supply cord quite strongly. I think Apple increase the magnetic force used on this converter so that it would stick on tighter then it does to the regular computer. The other end has the regular strength magnet that holds onto your computer just enough but still comes off if it is pulled. Actually, I find that these converters stick better onto my computer then my &#34;real&#34; MagSafe 2 power supply, which I feel falls off a bit too easily when I move the laptop while I am sitting on the sofa.<br /><br />So far, I have not lost either one of my converters, but I tend to use them for the power supplies that I keep at my home, opting to leave my MagSafe 2 power supply in my laptop bag.  This lets me utilize my previous investment in older power supplies while saving me from having to unplug, coil cords, and pack my power supply every time I want to leave the house with my computer.  My only wish for an improvement in this product would be if there were some type of loop or ridge built into it so that it could be tied or attached to the power supply cord to eliminate the possibility of getting lost while in a bag or outside the home.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Not my best read by far.  Very disappointing.  The hero makes dumb moves and mistakes  and the plot is really stupid.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great sequel. Bittersweet ending. Finally know what happened to the surviving characters and get to know some new ones. Loved it
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really have enjoyed this game and at level 175, without purchasing in game diamonds or items. Friends are great help in the game, don't bother playing without friends.  My problem is my game has all kinds of problems because it needs to be updated.  I can't find how to update with using Kindle.  When I try to update with the game link it takes me to Amazon which just tells me I've already purchased the game.<br /><br />Due to info from some great players here on Amazon, I have found that if you have a Kindle, even though the link takes you to Amazon; go back to your Kindle, go to Apps, then store, then you will see the game with \\"update\\".  This works for me.  Still I give it 4 stars because it is addictive and fun but lots of glitches and customer service isn't very good.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Having read the other books of the trilogy, I've become very impressed with S. Collins writing. This book last book let me down. The writing and story felt rushed and vastly different from the struggle survivals of the previous two books.<br /><br />I did enjoy an insight into the rebellion as well as vastly expanded cast of multidimensional characters who all had their own motivations, some good some bad.<br /><br />Read it if your a fan of the trilogy, otherwise skip it.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I great &#34;take&#34; on the Cinderella story and much more interesting.  Watched this with my daughter.  You won't be disappointed. I like how Cinderella finally stood up to her step mother. fantastic cast!
B003O86FMW|4.0|It doesn't quite keep up to the magic of the first book for me, but it was still an excellent read that I could not put down. I liked the further fleshing out of Katniss and Peta's relationship, new insight into the terrible corruption of the Capitol and the life and death struggle in the games.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to anyone to read especially if they enjoyed the first book.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|As a long time reader of the mysteries of our world I can honestly say this story only surprised me by who wrote it. Philip Corso is exactly the person I would have expected to know the truth. I believe the existence of alien life has been fact well before the creation of humans. The explosion of technology in the last 50 years certainly proves a major change in our knowledge and abilities. For people who have already awakened to the realization that our existence and history is much more complex than we have been taught, this book is confirmation as to some of the mystery. Personally I believe this book to be fact not fiction. I recommend this book to everyone who is of an awakening mind ready to explore a more logical explanation of our technology explosion and perhaps get a glimpse into our entire universe teaming with life yet to be discovered.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|It's amazing. Love that natural disasters movies.I know it's a old movie but is great and keep you at the edge.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions, bananas, and running. All combined in one hilariously FREE game! What kid doesn't enjoy the comical exploits of the cute yellow creatures that follow Gru's every command? In the game Minion Rush, we follow along with Dave, who is competing for the Minion of the Year award by running, jumping, sliding, rolling, and being a little despicable along the way. In the game, you earn bananas, which can be used to unlock different minions, unlock new powerups, and upgrade powerups you already have.  Another helpful item to have is a lot of Gru coins. Using these, you can resume running after you fall, trip, or bump into obstacles, you can buy better minions, and you can buy more bananas. However, unlike some games, you are not required to buy these Gru coins to continues playing; the game is perfectly fine without them. You can buy packages of Gru coins if you wish, but you are not forced to.  I also love the four different locations the Minions can run in; Gru's Lab,  the Residential Area, El Macho's Lair, and the Minion Beach. Overall this is a great game for all people.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Really fascinating and good.  I knew that Irish were indentured and this book gave a good look at what could have gone on in early plantation estates well before the Emancipation Act.  I would highly recommend it.
B00DFBVKCS|5.0|The music is great.  The cover had some water stains or what look like it on the back cover but I came to the conclusion after I return one that it was going to be that way.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This was a book club choice and I kept reading it to see where it would end for the book club discussion.  I would have tossed it aside after the 2nd chapter had it not been for that.  Not my favorite.
B00867GHS8|5.0|the 5 discs are amazing i loved wathching it on blu-ray as did my brothers children. they say it makes them feel like their in the movie with nemo. all around great movie and blu-ray just makes it that much more fun for kids!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|OK, I can't say I've been to that many circuses, but if I were to go, I'd want to go to this one.  The book was a nice balance of description and narrative versus action.  I liked the characters and setting.  I liked the premise.  I'm torn between hoping there will be another book that goes into what happens to the circus after this book ends and not wanting to spoil the lovely reflections I have of the original.  You know how sequels can let you down sometimes?  I don't want that to happen because I liked this book so well.  I'm being kind of vague on purpose because I don't want to overanalyze it and lose the sense of wonder.
B002HML6Y8|5.0|its an awesome movie and being on blu-ray just makes it that much more enjoyable. the picture is great the special features look amazing just a great movie in general the fact its blu-ray makes it that much more enjoyable!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|We are in the process of watching the complete series. The episodes can be confusing and occasionally we have to re-watch it to get the characters straight. Sets and customs are wonderful, the era of history is captivating.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|so glad i could find this movie. in great condition not even opened. nothing wrong with the disc inside and the case is great. amazing product!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This sequil to &#34;The Shining&#34; is brilliant!  I haven't finished it yet, but I only started reading it 2 days ago... and it's a thick book!  Two thirds of the way through, and thanks to the Kindle app on my phone I'm reading it at work (don't tell my boss)!  I just can't put it down!  I'm already seeing it as a movie.  Thank you, Stephen King.
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|All though this one was not one of my favorites I still really enjoyed it.  You can tell it was made back in either the late 70's or early 80's.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|The disc had some light scratches on it. There were a few places in the film where it would not play<br />or skip. Due to the cheapness of the product and the overall quality, I deem this transaction fair.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Even though this is a work of fiction, it gives some great insight into the orphan train operation which was quite an eye opener for me.  I really enjoyed the book - it's a quick read and well worth your time.

B001ILHY2C|4.0|This  is a great start for the series that followed.  I oqn the entire series and it makes for great watching.
B00F91H666|5.0|Didn't read the book - tho now I'd like to - and have to say, I heard somewhere that Brad Pitt had to really fight to get this movie made, and if that's true, I'm glad he did.  It's really great, and I am a confirmed zombie nut and have seen most zombie movies out there, even the foreign ones, and for that matter, I've seen most horror movies, the good and the bad.  This was really well done.  And it would be deceitful to leave out that it was hard to concentrate on the movie 100% because Brad Pitt is one of those guys who just gets more beautiful as he ages.  To say he's doing it gracefully is an understatement.  I think he is light years away more good looking now than he was in Thelma and Louise.  Even if he's not your cup of tea, I think you'll get sucked into the movie and the characters and the action and most likely totally dig it.  Although I may be the last person on earth to see this movie, so I'm probably telling you nothing you don't already know.  But I'm going thru the same thing his wife is, and so I'm a little slower on the uptake when it comes to current events.  Anyway, peace!<br /><br />Beth
B0095ZQ36G|1.0|The premise of this is good,<br /><br />The premise of this book is possible, however the idea that he did not know about the concentration<br />Camps is not possible.  It made the whole book a lie.<br /><br />I watched a part of CBS News Sunday morning's, it was part of the 6th of Oct. program. About then, I know I saw it in Oct. They revealed that they have found about 4,500 sites that were used as crematoriums.  So the idea that pilots didn't know about crematoriums isn't possible.

I can't tell you which of their books I don't like because there isn't one and I can't tell you which one is my favorite because it's too hard to decide!!<br />If you see their name on the cover walk don't run to the cash register.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was really a page turner. It was so well written. After  I reading this book I will look forward to reading others by this author. Loved this story about the turns that life can take and what if we had chosen a different path then the one that we took.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream Theater's self-titled album is the first to include new drummer, Mike Mangini, in the creative process and man does it show! The chemistry in the band is the strongest that it has been in a couple of years. It's clear that Mangini's presence has inspired a fresh flows of ideas and energy. &#34;Dream Theater&#34; is a strong representation of what this band is truly capable of and is the new benchmark of their ever-evolving sound. There is something so new here, yet it's undeniably Dream Theater. The technical proficiency of each member has seemed to elevate since the previous record and I'm excited to see all of these new songs live, especially the album's center-piece, &#34;Illumination Theory.&#34; Overall, I have enjoyed this album immensely and sincerely feel this is the best Dream Theater album to-date (and apparently they do too given the title). If you're a bit of an audiophile, go and get this album in HD. It's too good to not experience it in the best quality possible.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It never suprises me how he keeps comming up with novels that seem to get scarier and scarier each time, this is a nail bitter for sure, you just can't put this one down. If you love Stephen King this is a must read.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love the monthly option and the variety of puzzles offered. Not a huge fan of the background music, but turning my volume down fixes that.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|A compelling story about Henry VIII and the Tudors and their court. Henry VIII ruled his world. What an era in English history.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the best MIND games ever foe even the elderly people.I Give this came an excellent rating
B00821OX98|5.0|Love love love it  But why are you asking for payment for season three  when the others were free ?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good thinking game, you find the clues, save them, then  figure out how they are used to get more clues.
1476729085|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Great pace and structure and am looking forward to reading more from Simsion. More than once, someone asked me \\"why are you laughing?\\" as I was reading.
B00C1S945G|5.0|I grew up watching star trek tng and loved it, now as a 30 somthing man I really enjoy watching them in HD and find myself learning valuable life lessons again about respect, honor, duty,compassion,  sacrifice, though its science fiction I feel I can really relate to the characters and thier situations, if people behaved like officers on the Enterprise the wolrd would be a much better place.
B008602KQI|4.0|I worked at a middle school at time I ordered this movie and had no time at the time I ordered this to read the book. After watching it, I did read the series. This movie came with no delays in great shape.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Hillarious movie to watch, great to watch while having a few cocktails with friends. Great one liners in it for you to use!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The story was very well written...good and accurate descriptions of plantation life/slavery/indentured servitude/white mastery of the times depicted. It was easy to become invested in the lives of many of the characters
B0089LOG02|5.0|My mother was raised in an orphanage and this story rang true.<br />It's a part of the past that brought out a lot of unsavory characters to adopt children for all the wrong reasons.<br />Worth reading for knowledge of the past, also just a good story
0770437400|3.0|Interesting perspectives.  I like the interview format, especially the international commentaries.  But a bit monotonous by the time you get to the end.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|If you keep in mind that sequels often times lose the originality that made you LOVE the 1st movie you'll probably be objective enough to appreciate this movie for what it is.  I cracked up even when things were a bit predictable.  I was hoping for a movie that would follow the same basic theme as the other 2, that would make me laugh & still just be able to stay in for a movie night at home.  It was exactly what I expected & wanted.  If you enjoyed the 1st 2 you'll probably enjoy the 3rd as well.  Allen doesn't disappoint!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you like The shinning, you'll like this book.  Little Danny is all grown up and turns into the teacher.  It is a page turner.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great series. Had me hooked after patch over episode.  The actors do a great job. If u have ever thought about or been interested in a Motorcycle Club, this is a must see!!!
B00B2166BS|4.0|it is a good device. hard connection (usb etc.) is a weak point for the tablet it is frangible. this protects against that type of damage
B008RA3X5E|5.0|All and all I think it is a good product. I enjoy awaking to the music that I can select. and it is easy to set.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a cool and fun game. It kind of reminds me if the game Cityville in facebook. Other than that, you should get this game is all I'm saying.
B00F8L2VO4|1.0|This app was sent under the banner of new Kindle apps so I downloaded it then found out I couldn't use it. Huge disappointment...why isn't this available for Kindles????
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Always love this show, can't wait for next episode to come out. They are the number one favorite ...must see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Graphics r good. All ages can pay it. My daughter's love it. Would recommend this game to anyone any age.
B000KQF6X0|5.0|I love the story of this movie, the main actors, music, scenery, everything that makes you want to see it again and again.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I had not read a S. King novel before, but I thought this was suspenseful, and finally, a page turner. The names of some of the characters were distracting and silly, but the action was intriguing. I enjoyed the first pages, and in the middle it got a bit silly and sluggish, and then picked up, and I raced through the end.
B008220BLG|5.0|I wasn't expecting Warm Bodies to be an outstanding movie (being a zombie film and all) but I really like Nicholas Hoult so I gave it a shot. Right from the opening scene I could tell there was something special about the movie. The writing was great, the acting was great, and the movie was funny, but also really touching and sweet.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Will Smith wrote it. Will Smith and Jaden star in it, and Jada and family produced it. Nuff said! This most likely would have been a made for SyFy movie if they hadn't bankrolled their own movie.
B000I55YV2|4.0|I thought the movie was great!  A great way to spend the evening or morining depending on which shift you work.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game!  I'm wasting hours playing this.  I definitely recommend it.  The graphics are good.  The gameplay is typical of this type of game but it all works flawlessly.  The pay model gets a little annoying but most free gamrsmare like that
B00CL1SQVG|5.0|Have only had this a couple of days but have listened to it on the home audio, in the car and with headphones on the PC. Right off the bat the thing just seemed so cleaned up and every instrument was way more easy to pick out than in other versions I have. I was taken aback at how live Gregs voice seems and how his bass playing is much more noticable , as is everything else on this Wilson effort. The power and playing skill of these guys is so far beyond tame it's not funny! Tarkus is one of my favorite ELP efforts for sure and if anyone is weighing whether or not to get this new SW remix I would say weigh no more and get it! Works for me!
B004A2V3K0|5.0|Over the top what i remember......Best album I have in my collection to date.<br />Awesome Awesome Awesome.<br /><br />Good sound and best of the bunch.<br />Reccomend it.
B004G6TD4S|4.0|Figured I'd get a newer version since I was ordering ELPs First and Tarkus as remixes done By Steven Wilson. Have one of the earlier remasters of Trilogy and the vinyl of course. Amazon tends to gather up all the reviews no matter the version together which makes it more difficult to get reviews of a particular version ....lame... Anyway the sound quality is good on this Sony 2011 version and I really like the inclusion of the Live Hoedown track because it's really exceptional to put it mildly...a seriously good night for being spot on I'd say! The extra track makes it worth the purchase but after also getting the first two ELP release remixed by Mr Wilson I could not give it 5 stars. The sound quality isn't as revealing as the Wilson remixes on Trilogy...I was a sophmore in high school in 1972 and hung around with a bunch of guys who had a decent stereo and we would catch a buzz and listen carefully mainly to be impressed with all manner of bands really and ELP was so bombastic we loved the heck out of every release and eagerly waited for the next one to come along. The mix of styles ,time changes and outrageous talent was a serious draw. Living in an area where they never came close to doing a live show was a bummer but we played the heck out of the records!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this alarm app. It allows me to set up multiple alarms for week day and weekend scheduling. It is easy to add more or change existing alarms and has plenty of tone options and other settings to personalize.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This is one of the Best movies....ever!<br />You will get a kick out of it even if you are not a birder and have never even heard of the real &#34;BIG YEAR&#34;<br />It may even spark an intrest in Birding!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For nostalgic people that take care of their stuff, and that don't like constantly having to dispose of perfectly good electronics, this is a wonderful way to &#34;send your dumb TV to school to earn a quickie degree&#34;. Make your TV get smart in just minutes.<br />Easy to use, and self powered if your TV has a USB port.<br />No more balancing the laptop dangerously over DVD players or cable boxes, and no more having to get up from your bed to reload, or to turn everything off when you wish you could just fall asleep.<br />Best feature is that you can control what you watch directly from your iPhone, and still be able to use all of your phones functions without interruption.<br />I bought three to give as presents to people who love staying at home to bing on TV watching.<br />I recommend it specially if you aren't tech savvy, or a risk taker that wants to go online finding torrents, or too-good-to-be-true websites that offer the latest movies or shows.<br />And because of the price, I'm thinking of getting a couple more to give out for Christmas.
B009IJJ5B4|2.0|dialogues are poor not intelligent and the main character has always been bad. He cannot even carry a certain class that you will ask from a true british Sherlock, so apart from the eastender's accent and the fact that he drives you mad, he cannot make it happen.<br />She is a little bit more convincing but chemistry is not there.<br />The camera is good.<br />I am a big Sherlock fun, reading and watching, but I will not buy more episodes  of this bad experiment.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The movie was fun bringing all the Marvel characters together. The video came in very crisp though our internet connection.
B002RI97IY|5.0|Excellent book to help you peep in to yourself, conquer your mind and improve your life. Buddha said, conquering your mind is a bigger achievement than conquering this world.
B000005J56|5.0|Saw them at the Lisner Auditorium on October 4th -- felt as though I was back in Miami!  I'm not Cuban, but learned Spanish in Panama from a Cuban professor and grew up in South Florida.  Point is, you don't have to be Cuban to enjoy this great music!
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|I recorded messages from my answering machine to preserve cute ones that my grandchildren left when they were just starting to talk.  Worked perfectly with clear voice tone and no static or background noises.  I'm happy I figured out that I could save the messages by recording to my kindle fire before deleting from the old answering machine when I bought a new one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! I play it all the time and I am so glad I can finally play on my kindle fire hd. Thanks.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Great read. Kept me interested entire time. I read after reading the white queen and red queen. Love Philippa Gregory series. Interesting to see the role of Women in that time.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|I had several albums by Elvis that I rarely listen to because there are only two or three songs on each that I like. I like ALL of these.
B009TO99TG|4.0|Fell in love with the song Paradise. Chose this box set to get more acquainted with the band and their music. I liked 3 out of the 4 cds in this set. My favorite out of the 4 is Viva La Vida. It shows their maturity and their exposure to other music and the influence of traveling and performing globally. Love it and listen in my car everyday. Strawberry Swing my personal favorite. PEG
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I would recommend that you find a new author.<br />That is to say that Stephen has always been mine, but no more.<br />He seems to have no more concern with making your imagination soar.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Even if you have seen it before, this movie is worth seeing a second time around.  I just love the Mini Coopers and Charlize is also worth looking at too.  Great fun film.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Lots of characters that eventually come together. I was surprised with the ending, somehow seems to leave you hanging a bit for maybe a sequel.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Refreshing different to what i normally read  love the old photographs and am looking forward to hollow city in December
B00846REIS|4.0|As 50 shades fan i did see resemblance, but everything had a different twist to it which I loved. There where some unusual names but you get passed  then and enjoy the book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It is so awesome that I can not stop playing the game Who doesn't like this game I mean like seriously
B0010SKSTO|5.0|Very applicable to real life. It adds one more layer to communication in my life and I can't wait to finish and start applying it to the working environment.
B0038Z5SEW|4.0|I loved it , I've got people here that hadn't seen it and they liked it too ages in house range from one to sixty all but the very young enjoyed Great Older Movie
B0091REZMW|3.0|My mom played this game before and . Look really fun so I what to try this out my stop playing I do not know why so I am going see why she did that and thank you for this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. It is fun, it is challenging at times. I have told many people about this game. My whole family loves it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've waited for this moment for candy crush to get on kindle fire. Their were games trying to be like that but fail horribly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for a kindle version. I've been stealing my daughter's iPod to play but now I don't need to! Get this app!!!! Five stars all the way. No problems so far
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game kept me entertained!  I liked the puzzles, some were a pain to solve. I am actually playing the game again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down. You know it's an amazing book when the author can take you through the roller coaster of emotions and make them feel as if they were your own.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game seemed to lock up and the third and finally time, I have to look up how to reset my Kindle.  The game completely shut down my Kindle.  Sorry but I had to delete the game!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game I need help lol!!! I play it on my KINDLE FIRE and on my android phone. Anywhere I can get my fix for this game I'm down. Two thumbs up guys!!!
B0071XO8RA|2.0|There were a lot of small details in the stories that didn't make sense. If you are writing science fiction you should have a better grasp of science.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />Why would a 8&#34; x 2&#34; high def vision of a world that doesn't exist make a person complete a mission?<br />Using porters to deliver messages would not decrease people's interaction, it would increase interaction.<br />Why isolate the silos?<br />That is a few questions or ideas I have.
B000001FQ4|3.0|....after all this time, almost 40 years later.<br /><br />I've given a lot of thought to the possibility that my expectations (such as they were) may have been a victim of chronology. Like many kids, my intro to the band was the sublime \\"Jailbreak\\", at which point I started working backwards, wanting to hear EVERYTHING. I thought \\"Fighting\\" was a highly worthy predecessor, though a bit lacking in the compositional tautness and crunching hard-rock punch of Jailbreak; but when I took another step back in time to \\"Nightlife\\", I was just.....aghast. I thought it SUCKED. The years haven't improved my opinion much, though nowadays I might just leave it at \\"It's not their best, try this/that one instead\\".<br /><br />What jumps out at me is the almost total lack of general direction on this record; it's as if Phil was being pulled musically this way, that way and the other way, trying to touch all the bases but ending up hitting none of them. I'm feeling a pretty deep conflict between his soulful/bluesy side (which we saw manifesting previously in cuts like \\"Slow Blues\\", \\"Mama Nature Said\\"), and his full-on ass-kicking hard rock side (hinted at in \\"The Rocker\\" but highly refined in \\"Sha-La-La\\"). One gets the impression that Phil was trying hard NOT to let the hard rocking side win the battle on Nightlife, and what we're left with is a sadly unfocused mess like this. Let me be quick to add also that Ron Nevison's overly mainstream-ish production does the band no favors either. The bottom line is this, though - the songs simply aren't very good.<br /><br />I still haven't fully recovered from the choice of \\"She Knows\\" as the leadoff song on Side 1. Maybe I'm being a little unfair here but even *now* it sounds so wimpy, so half-hearted, so....un-Lizzylike, driven by acoustic guitars and a shockingly tame production. The song itself goes on too long, with its hackneyed chord changes; it's a long way from Phil's best.<br /><br />By the end of the title cut I was really shakingmy head. A straight-ahead blues tune (stretched out to 16- or 18-bars, can't remember which), with STRINGS! Oh my God. What IS this??<br /><br />I suppose the fact that Robbo and Concrete Blonde felt that \\"It's Only Money\\" was worth covering says something, but for me it's a throwaway that nevertheless is the best of the three songs we've heard so far. Again, I know; I'm being spoiled to an extent because I'd been allowed to see two albums into the future.<br /><br />At last! Order is seemingly restored with the magnificent \\"Still in Love With You\\" with its haunting changes and stunning guitar solo. More like this, please!<br /><br />Then Side 1 ends with \\"Frankie Carroll\\" which is the most utter and complete WTF I think I've ever heard in the Lizzy catalog.<br /><br />And so it goes for Side 2. The record is all over the place, and none of it is done particularly well; most of the songs sound like Phil was literally writing them on the spot. \\"Philomena\\" is my favorite track on the second side, with its lovely Celtic intro (restated much more martially in the middle of the song, which was pretty neat); like \\"Still in Love\\", one gets the impression that they actually spent some time working with this one. I can't help but think of how this song would have sounded on Jailbreak with the John Alcock treatment. \\"Sha-La-La\\" is in reality a pretty anonymous, run-of-the-mill rocker but on this album stands out like an oasis in Death Valley. The production on this song rocks much harder than anything they'd done before, and though the chord changes are pretty clichéd, I have to give a BIG shout out for the Celtic-tinged double-lead riff on this song that we would come to know and love so well.<br /><br />This is such an anomaly in the band's catalog that I have to think there were extraordinary circumstances involved. Were the fellows under a horrific deadline to get the record made? Something, somewhere was less than ideal in the band's situation at this time (and I'm notmuch up to date with how things were for them during this time).
B00FKQ38OE|5.0|As always, Paul McCartney has released what I consider a great set of songs. I have to listen to each song at least three times before I get a feel for what he's doing -- I have to do that with every piece of music regardless of artist. I just love what I'm discovering in these songs. I find it so different from his previous work and is of some of his best to date.<br /><br />It's truly McCartney in every way, but really new stuff. My favorites are \\"I Can Bet\\" and \\"New\\". I imagine that several more will become my favorites too as I listen more.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this release to those who love McCartney's music. If you have a sense of what his career has been, you'll love these songs even more.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with his music this is a great release that I think almost anyone would thoroughly enjoy. This guy rocks, writes great slower tunes, and delivers super lyrics with some of the most unusual sounds throughout his music.<br /><br />It never quits with him.<br /><br />Go for it Paul!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I would rate it better, if Google had:<br />- Instructions and normal Play, Pause etc controls<br />- How to link the Google browser from iPhone<br />- Connection to Hulu and imdb
B008JFUR10|1.0|What is up with the accent Idris Elba uses?  I loved that guy on The Wire so I know he can act, but what was he thinking when he took this role?  The characters are wooden, and that's being kind.  The plot is ok but very poorly executed.  The CGI is weak and overused.  There is almost nothing to like about this movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw on the cinema previews that Ender's Game will soon be a movie, so I decided to re-read. I enjoyed the tale once again. It's ten years or more since I read it first and I'd forgotten most of the content. I suspect the movie will be all bang-bang kill the bugs. I hope not because, for me, the strongest thread in the story revolves around Ender's inner struggles and the way he's manipulated by the IF commanders. I'm somewhat spatially challenged, and I'm hoping the Battle Room is well presented so I can see what I struggle to visualize.
B00EA8UEZ4|3.0|I love Gary's work and his sense of humor.  He makes \\"The Course\\" so much more real than other writers have.  He puts forgiveness into what we experience every day.  For that matter, I now see forgiveness and life's challenges as something I can embrace as opportunities and lessons that may help change my destiny.  I love Arten and Pursah and thought that \\"trip\\" they took together was incredible!  I wish I had Ascended Masters so I could enjoys days like that!  lol  Several parts of the book were rather different...meeting Thomas and Thaddeus in person and \\"his trip\\" as I said, and gave some wonderful insight.  I enjoyed reading how the people in his life now, were parts of his life before and will continue again after this life of his.  Helped me see karma and how we treat others in a new way also...they could be around a lot longer than we think so treat them right the first time cause we know what pay back can be!  lol<br /><br />I have to say though, as much as I love to know \\"the author\\" I felt a bit too much time was spent on Gary's life, travels, divorce and re-marriage.  I had no problem with reading about them...I felt it was beneficial to see what sort of \\"forgiveness\\" he'd been put through, but it was too long and I started to lose my interest.  I also felt there was no need to bring in politics to this (although it usually is an excellent form of learning to forgive ..lol) or selling vitamin supplements.  I just found it a tad hypocritical that on one note Gary was saying maybe this country should become more socialist, like the rest of the world, and yet, using the principles of capitalism to sell vitamins or books.  But that was my take from it which doesn't mean that all the readers would see it like that.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book be read as part of his \\"trilogy.\\"
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The movie was ok, but not sure that it lives up to all the hype used to build it up, worth watching.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|An exciting novel with a lackluster finish.  Certainly enjoyable to read, but one could have hoped for more of a twist of fate ending.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Anything with Mathew McConaughey is bound to be good, love his southern drawl.  The plot and acting are well done.  Would highly recommend this movie.
B008MVPF72|5.0|More support and comfort. Not as purple as they look on my monitor. My friends tease me mercilessly for wearing them but I wear them every day. My feet can breathe.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|The movie is good and so is the acting.  Don't listen to the other people..it [is] worth watching.  Would recommend.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed this book - it was a very quick read - kept my attention. I liked that it was a sort-of sequel to the Shining. It was entertaining and kept my interest to the end. I would recommend this novel to anyone who is a Stephen King fan - and if you're not or haven't read any of his books, this would be a good introduction.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|36 years later, Stephen King writes a sequel to his masterpiece, The Shining.  He hasn't lost his touch.  He's got a bit of autobiography going here and you can tell that some of the things he puts in this novel are from his heart.  I am a 'constant reader' since 1975 and still love it!
B00E9P959O|3.0|I don't pretend to be a musical expert, but to my long-time Rush fan ears, this is the same music with a beefier bass. Sorry, but I don't hear any difference. Maybe if I were sitting at the mixing console, but playing this in my car or through my laptop (like most everyone else) it doesn't sound any different. 3 stars out of sympathy and respect for the guys I guess. There were many other ways they could have re-freshed and re-presented this work, it seems here like they took the easiest hands-off path.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|This is my favorite Ring recording.  Not only do I prefer Solti's &#34;muscular&#34; approach, but the quality of the recording is outstanding, especially considering that it's about 50 years old now.<br /><br />I can't imagine how this set could have been presented any better!  It includes a seemingly endless set of interesting extras, all presented in a beautiful package of the highest quality.  Obviously, you don't need any of this stuff if you just want the music.  But for Ring lovers, items like high-quality reproductions of pages from Solti's personal copy of the score, complete with his mark-ups and comments, are wonderful additions to the experience.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants the ultimate Solti Ring.
B001SAO38Q|2.0|I'm sure this was a ground-breaking artsy film, and maybe stunned the film universe in 1960-whatever, but to me, today, I simply thought it was boring. Very boring. I love Michael Caine, I love any film involving cars, but the young Caine's dialogue was unlistenable and the Minis were maybe 10 minutes. I take nothing away from the sensation this must have been then, but the film doesn't have the charm or anything else to be enjoyable in 2013.
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|I love the band, love all their albums so far, I highly recommend it to anyone else who loves Trivium!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|After watching Paul McCartney preview his new NEW album on JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE and LATE NIGHT WITH JIMMY FALLON, I knew I was going to be in for a treat when I purchased the CD.  It did not disappoint; NEW is one of Macca's finest efforts.  Four producers were used: Mark Ronson, Paul Epworth, Ethan Johns (Glyn's son), and Giles Martin (Sir George's son, who has worked on many Beatle-related projects in the past, including the [[ASIN:B000JJS8TM Love (CD + Audio DVD)]] soundtrack).    The Deluxe Edition has two bonus tracks; \\"Turned Out,\\" and \\"Get Me Out Of Here.\\"  There is also a hidden track, a piano-driven ballad called \\"Scared,\\" that appears at the end of the disc, on both the Standard Edition (after \\"Road\\") and the Deluxe Edition (after \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\").    Several versions of the Deluxe Edition are available.  Best Buy has one with photo cards and an album laminate; FYE, and several other retailers, have a version in a light cube where Paul's signature changes colors.  I purchased the Target version, which has a bonus DVD titled \\"A Rendez-Vous With Paul McCartney,\\" featuring highlights from the 2013 OUT THERE tour, and is hosted by the cute-as-a-button Geneviève Borne, a French-Canadian TV personality and fashion model.  Could this be a tease for a future OUT THERE DVD?    Paul indicates in the liner notes that several other songs were recorded that did not make the cut, which will probably be issued somewhere down the road.  One of these, \\"Struggle,\\"  appears on the Japanese version of NEW.    UPDATE:  Told ya so! A [[ASIN:B00LRHK3I4 new collector's edition of NEW]] was issued on October 28, 2014, with the aforementioned \\"Struggle\\" and other bonus material. From Macca's Web site, here are the contents:    COLLECTOR'S EDITION [2 CDs + 1 DVD]    Disc 1 (same as previous version)    1. \\"Save Us\\"  2. \\"Alligator\\"  3. \\"On My Way To Work\\"  4. \\"Queenie Eye\\"  5. \\"Early Days\\"  6. \\"New\\"  7. \\"Appreciate\\"  8. \\"Everybody Out There\\"  9. \\"Hosanna\\"  10. \\"I Can Bet\\"  11. \\"Looking At Her\\"  12. \\"Road\\"  13. \\"Turned Out\\"  14. \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" + \\"Scared\\" (hidden track)    Disc 2    1. \\"Struggle\\" (previously available only in Japan)  2. \\"Hell To Pay\\" (previously unreleased)  3. \\"Demons Dance\\" (previously unreleased)  4. \\"Save Us\\" (Live at Tokyo Dome 2013)  5. \\"New\\" (Live at Tokyo Dome 2013)  6. \\"Queenie Eye\\" (Live at Tokyo Dome 2013)  7. \\"Everybody Out There\\" (Live at Tokyo Dome 2013)    Disc 3 - DVD  01. Something New (\\"making-of\\" documentary)  02. New Interview (Bang & Olufsen Presents The Living Room Tour: Launching Paul McCartney's Album NEW)    03. The Promo Tour  03.1. MGM Grand for iHeartRadio Music Festival, Las Vegas, 21st September 2013  03.2. Hollywood Boulevard with Jimmy Kimmel, Los Angeles, 23rd September 2013  03.3. NBC Studios with Jimmy Fallon, New York, 7th October 2013  03.4. Times Square, New York, 10th October 2013  03.5. The Shard, London, 15th October 2013  03.6. BBC Maida Vale Studios, London, 16th October 2013  03.7. The London Studios with Graham Norton, London, 17th October 2013  03.8. Covent Garden and HMV Oxford Street, London, 18th October 2013    04. Music Videos  04.1. \\"Queenie Eye\\"  04.2. \\"Save Us\\"  04.3. \\"Appreciate\\"  04.4. \\"Early Days\\"  04.5. Making Of \\"Queenie Eye\\"  04.6. Making Of \\"Appreciate\\"  04.7. Making Of \\"Early Days\\"    Total DVD Running Time: 1 hour, 58 minutes    I received the new Collector's Edition from Amazon, and it looks and sounds great. The three new songs on the bonus audio CD are quite good. \\"Struggle,\\" as other reviewers have noted, is a very electronic-sounding track, almost Japanese-like (which is probably why it was originally issued exclusively in The Land Of The Rising Sun). \\"Hell To Pay\\" is similar in style to 2005's \\"Fine Line,\\" but rocks much harder; those critics who claim that Paul doesn't rock hard enough should listen to this track. \\"Demons Dance\\" is another rocker, with a \\"Lady Madonna\\"-style piano lick. The four live tracks from Tokyo Dome are excellent and hopefully will be available on DVD/Blu-ray someday. The bonus DVD is terrific as well; the \\"making-of\\" documentary SOMETHING NEW is fascinating to watch (was the title just coincidental, or purposely named after [[ASIN:B00GJ7ROXY The Beatles' third Capitol album?]]). The subsequent Bang & Olufsen \\"living room\\" interview and the promotional tour segments are also good, although I wish that some of the musical performances, particularly from the Kimmel and Fallon shows, had been retained. Legal issues may have gotten in the way.  And it's nice to finally have the four music videos, and the three \\"making-of\\" videos on DVD at last, instead of having to watch them on YouTube. Initially, I wondered why there was no \\"Making Of \\"Save Us\\"\\" video, but that video simply syncs the audio of the song to concert footage, and is not a \\"production video\\" like the other three.    Whether or not you own one of the previous editions of NEW, this version is worth the extra money because of the nice hardcover book and the extra bonus material. I'll still keep the Target version, though, because it includes Paul's live performances from the OUT THERE tour, and also because I love Geneviève Borne...    Paul has issued multiple versions of his albums before.  Nineteen eighty-nine's FLOWERS IN THE DIRT had several versions, including the [[ASIN:B00FW679II original version]], the World Tour Pack box set, with tour memorabilia, and the \\"Party Party\\" bonus single; the [[ASIN:B003VFU632 2-CD Japanese import]], which featured the exclusive track \\"P.S. Love Me Do,\\" \\"Party Party,\\" and several other CD-single tracks; and the [[ASIN:B00000721G remastered 1993 \\"Paul McCartney Collection\\"]] version, which featured three bonus tracks.  There was the European import [[ASIN:B004HWV67I Off the Ground - The Complete Works]], which had a bonus disc of 12 CD-single tracks; and most recently, there were three versions of 2007's MEMORY ALMOST FULL: the [[ASIN:B000P2A242 standard edition]], the [[ASIN:B000PMLFRU first Deluxe Limited Edition]], in DVD-type packaging, which contained a second CD with three bonus tracks and a Paul interview, along with a fold-out poster with complete lyrics (other MAF editions only had abbreviated lyrics), and [[ASIN:B000XAMCYE the second Deluxe Edition]], containing all 16 songs on one CD, though not the Paul interview, plus a bonus DVD with music videos and live performances.    Anyway, back to NEW.  Whatever version you choose, from Amazon or someplace else, you will love this album; Macca's still got more talent at 72 than most younger performers a third of his age.  And no twerking required (Miley Cyrus, put your clothes back on!)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the only app I've ever actually paid for. I got the trial a while back and finally purchased the full one. I text/email/research on my phone everyday for work (IT professional) and it has saved me 60,000 key strokes so far and that number keeps going up! I recommend it for someone who actively emails/texts mass amounts every day!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I really enjoy the main characters (women) clothing.  Also the scrips contains drama, some humor, and reality. Love the night skyline shots.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Awesome movie, best of the trilogy.  Don't be a fool and go your whole life with out watching it. Boom
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King's books are always good reading, and this one is a really creepy story but it's a winner!  I loved it and would highly recommend it to everyone.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Exaclt as described and the movie in 3D works GREAT! Glad I bought it - Get this in 3D to realize what your missing in the 2D version
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very exciting & suspenseful<br />Characters were easy to follow & visualize<br />The story & plot were exciting but also had plenty of unexpected twists & turns
0385737955|5.0|My brother who does not really like to read started reading a lot recently.  When I was buying my summer reading book my mom told me to order him a book to read as well. He chose &#34;The Maze Runner&#34; and once it came in he started reading it and was done in no time (even abandoned League for a bit to finish!).  When I asked him what the book was about he was very excited when explaining it to me as well.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This show is totally worth the watch.  It will continue to be on our favorites list. Love it, love it, love it!
B001BANK32|5.0|After seeing the movie several times and because a sequel was written, I read this book once more.  The book, as usual, was so much better.  I doubt, after reading this I would ever be able to stay in an old hotel, in the Colorado mountains in winter.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent show. Can't wait for new episodes. Live the off beat characters in the show. The actors all blend well together
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I am huge fan of Angrys Birds Trilogies. My goal is to knock out every level at 3 stars and 100% feather. This one is cute not my favorite out of all of them
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I couldn't wait for this game to hit the kindle. I can't seem to put it down. However I am disappointed that it has not been updated as all the other devices have been. I have this on my iPhone and it's been updated quite a few time so where is Kindles update??? PLEASE UPDATE  want the owl........
0821221841|5.0|Wonderful book for the amateur photographer.  This book offers a view into one of the most legendary photographers to grace the world.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I would recommend this to any one who read (or saw the movie) The Shining. I have long been a Stephen King fan. The young hero/victim is now all grown up, not entirely unscathed. Mr. King doesn't disappoint with this sequel.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Started playing this game and it is addictive. Don't want to put it down. Other than that it is a great pastime and the seasonal update seems really interesting to play with. Just wish the updates were not that time consuming on the kindle fire. All in all a good game though.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Without a doubt this book will leave an impact on how you see the world. Authors are truly the best artists. Love this book.
B001NTFQRY|4.0|There really isn't any other soundtrack out there like this. That said if you're not a fan of the equally unique film then the appeal of this will likely be lost on you. Only a few tracks (&#34;Rachel's Song&#34; & &#34;Blade Runner Love Theme&#34; for instance) are purely enjoyable out of context. The rest are really for the fans who want one more way to be immersed in the world of Blade Runner.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great Read! Characters kept my interest and were true to life. Never knew about the orphan train. And, have read several novels about this important part of American history.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It is a good alarm clock. I like the many options it gives you. Good voice for music selection. I
B00EB6ENXO|3.0|Though the movie had great special effects, plot was predictable.  Would not recommend a buy.  Rent, don't buy.  Clearly disappointed.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|And I still use it. I'm on my 8th android device and this is still a viable office and word processing app.
B000ICZD5M|4.0|I read Frank Herbert's masterpiece in the 70's and was hooked. When the book was turned into a movie by none other than David Lynch, I went to the theater twice to see it. I had the VHS tape at one time, and now the Blu Ray is here. It is fantastic. The extra detail is wonderful.<br /><br />But there is one caveat, and it's a big one. The movie is a valiant attempt at the impossible. There is simply no way that Herbert's novel, now available in mass market paperback and weighing in a nearly 900 pages, is going to fit into a 140 minute film. It's simply cannot be done. And if you are not familiar with the book, this movie will disappoint you. I gave it four stars because it so elegantly captures the high emotion of the novel. But if I was not familiar with the book, I would rate it with just one star.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the trilogy read them twice.  Love the characters!!!!  Can't wait till the movie comes out hope the stars do Christain and Ana justice.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I would recommend this book. I did not know anything about the book when I saw it advertised on my kindle. I was pleasantly surprised.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Fascinating story about 2 women of very different ages, one the survivor of the orphan trains, the other a survivor of the foster child system. Their stories aren't really that different. The majority of the book describes the live of Vivian from her arrival in the US, the death of most of her family and the trip on the orphan train. Interspersed we learn of Molly's life. And slowly, these 2 women so different in ages bond.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Lots of fun.  Different than alot of other hidden object games.  I like the variety of pictures to search.  The only downfall is waiting for energy to be restored.  But for me it's worth the wait
B006BFK5DK|5.0|This album invokes the same heart rush I've always gotten over the years whenever I hear an Earth Wind & Fire song.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Great read unusually written but loved the journey Harold fry took through England! Love stutters style, look forward to reading more!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great story to follow the Shining, typical Stephen King. Love his writing!  Would recommend to anyone who is a fan.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|of course the ordering of the stories is different...story 1 ends the film. and story 2, as i say, IS the film (almost), accompanied with some &#34;real world&#34; context (introduction and final exit of protagonist)...pi begins intelligently, and from that point it extends to always increasing levels of beauty... for minds prepared to appreciate it...for those that are not, as it is also very philosophical, it seems to me that it will require a patience that cannot be sustained... as with all intricate pieces...whether you watch or not is not a test, only whether it leaves you better off than it found you...your call...ciao.
B00CATSONE|2.0|This read much more like a book pitch than an actual book to me. The author sets up a description of what it takes to be successful for the first half of the book then shifts immediately to talking about Tesla--and the two parts felt very disconnected from each other.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This book is written by the master. Very few times in the last 40? years have I not liked one of his books
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I read this book years ago and had forgotten about it until someone mentioned it again so I got my own copy this time!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am reading the second book in the series and cannot put it down. I am impressed with the creative mind of Hugh Howey and a little creeped out as I look around at world events and the conspiracy thinking that abounds. I am horrified but can't stop reading. I love books that make me think and feel. This one does both.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The writing of this book is wonderful  it stretched your mind to understand and yet guides you along perfectly. Read this book, not for the sexual content, but what that content represents: pure love.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This beautifully imagined story had me wishing and believing that somehow I figured into the story as well. What a refreshing reminder that adults may still conjure up worlds and then go there and explore them. Thank you Neil for writing this book. PS
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! Candy Crush Saga is the most addicting game ever. You have made my day. My husband is going to be very upset .
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It took me back to when I first read The Shining.  It was great to see how Danny's life turned out.  Stephen King is my favorite writer & when I read his books,  he always keeps my attention.  Dr. Sleep is a book I definately recommend but of course you need to read The Shining first.
B00012L786|3.0|There's nothing really special about this noir informed by Red Scare politics.  I was expecting more because it was written and directed by Samuel Fuller but he doesn't imbue this film with anything that truly transcends the mundane.  Sole reason to see this film are gangbuster performances by Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and most notably Thelma Ritter in an Oscar nominated turn as a police informant.  Too bad their fine work is undermined by a lackadaisical narrative.
B0033806MI|1.0|Not so good as the books need more background, maybe if extra short stories then it would have been better.
0307277887|5.0|Absolutely love the tv show!!! The book definitely has similarities, so it's not like you're just sitting there watching the first season over again.... Good read if you like the show.
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|* UPDATE 10/21/14: Imposes FLURRY ANALYTICS on device to supposedly MONITOR your game play for help with fixes.  However, after over 1 year of many users reporting Crashes, the Developer has not provided any FIXES via an update.  STILL VER. 1.0.0 proves it.<br /><br />Tiny Thief is a Fun and Challenging game but the main CHARACTER moves PAINFULLY SLOW!<br />Graphics are Cute and Funny at times.  Music and Sound effects are decent and can be Muted but not adjusted.<br />Controls are just fair with Touch or Tap to Move character, Pick up items or Activate objects.<br />Theme is Cute.  Figuring out needed Strategy and sequence of moves to complete each level can get difficult and sometimes Frustrating.  HINTS are available by touching the Book icon on top right of screen but only 1 hint for every 4 hours of play (argh).  Finding Hidden Objects can be hard since you have to feel your way through with no Instructions for each level.  A Tutorial at start of game is OK but just pictures (No text).<br /><br />Overall, it is OK but alternates from being Fun for a while and then Frustrating due to the following:<br /><br />No written instructions makes the learning curve harder than it should be.<br />Controling character movement is not tremendously accurate, even on a 10\\" Tablet.<br />Movements are PAINFULLY SLOW so it affects your accuracy and you get killed often.<br />Finding and touching the TINY Ferrit that only appears very briefly in odd places is annoying!<br />Many users report CRASHES but Developer has done nothing to help them with this PAID APP!<br /><br />NOTE:  BE WARY of future Updates since ROVIO has a Reputation for updating apps with Tons of DATA-MINING Addons.  I own all of ROVIO's previous games and every one had this TACTIC Spoil them so I DELETED THEM!  It also seems to use up BATTERY quicker than most other apps.<br /><br />Could be a decent game but needs improvements that Developer has not addressed after more than a year!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have a five year old and she loves the minions and so do I. I can't stop playing this game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, It was a really fast read, and I couldn't put it down. I always say this, but I hope the movie lives up to, in some small way at  least, to the spirit of the book. A must read for all science fiction fans.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is a master story teller and this novel is no exception.  I can't wait to see how he pulls all the storyline together.
B0081336FO|5.0|We love the actors, The writers, The plot, The cinematography! Always so clever, I don't know how they consistently make such successful intrigue and creativity - but they do. Each one ranks up there with the best movies I've ever seen. Thank you.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|The board is very small, and two of the pieces were already cracked.  I will say my 8 yr old likes it, just because it is his first chess board.  Overall the price was good.
B004YXE438|4.0|Very nice puzzle game. Lots of fun. Just wish that there were more puzzles, because I went through all the puzzles very quickly.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|...which u wouldn't believe it is possible because the older the show gets the weaker the plots usually gets, but...well come on, it's THE. WALKING. DEAD.---'nuff said.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it !!! Just as good as the Shining!!  I couldn't put down. Lots of suspense. And a very fast read.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game has really been fun. I find myself constantly playing over and over again. And the thing is it really is quite simple but has yet to lose my interest instead I just play it over and over again. I defiantly recommend this game!
B005544TRQ|5.0|My boyfriend and I have had 4 shows that we watch (Nikita, Vampire Diaries, White Collar, and Once Upon a Time). When they ended for the season, we had no shows to watch! We went through all kinds of shows but none caught our attention. They were mostly just too boring of a pilot, except for Suits! The first time I saw the advert for Suits, I thought &#34;oh they're trying to make another White Collar,&#34; so I never bothered. But since I have Amazon Prime and could stream it for FREE, I decided to give it a try, and we LOVE IT!!!! It's the perfect balance of wit and downfalls with everyone. It is truly an amazing series, and anyone who hasn't watched it or is wary, just watch the pilot and you're absolutely HOOKED!! Oh also, this is just props for Amazon Insant Video, there are NO commercials like Hulu has! I LOVE IT!!!
B00F9040HU|1.0|Or was very slow and after I got a little way into the game it wanted me to buy the full version. I'm deleting it off of my Kindle Fire.
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|Great album from an all time great!  Sir Paul has re entered the hall of  great music.  Keep 'em coming!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first one was ok, interesting enough to make me buy the second one. Fifty shades darker is really boring. Couldn't finish it. Definitely not going for the third.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The whole Downton Abbey production is great, however I'm not so keen on the very last episode of season 3, we'll just have to see where its taken in season 4.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is one of the best novels I have have read all year.  It was a very interesting story.  I loved how the two characters lives intertwined.  I couldn't put it down!
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|I started the movie on a whim, I wasn't caught up in it immediately so I canceled it.  I did not see enough of the movie to rate it honestly, but it doesn't have a gripping start.
B000YDE43C|4.0|Normally an 8, but I went down a half size and it fits nicely.  Some could possibly go down a full size.  Classic looking boot that should be more than serviceable for day hikes.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy find it a good brain teaser, dont hate it's free fun little game, it could be a little harder
B0063IH60K|5.0|I purchased this game and I love it.  I play it everyday.  I like that it gets harder if you want.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am enjoying the game this far but it would be nice to get hints to help you when you are stuck.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I am HONESTLY blown away. I can't recommend this to enough people. Truly thankful this came into my life.  Eckhart Tolle is a genius.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My children's favorite show!  Good clean fun that is non-violent and funny for children and adults. Very hard to find.  Can't get anywhere else!
B00DW1WR14|1.0|I thought nothing could be worse than backspacer but then Pearl Jam released this album.<br />I've been a fan since '93 but after this album ?? Phew ! I'll stick with riot act and earlier.<br />boring,slow and more of the same ol same ol... if only Eddie vedder would put down that God damned Ukulele and get his balls back !<br /><br />I hope the band makes this their final album or maybe they'll call up Rick Rubin to find their Mojo on the next record.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have been watching Star Trek in syndication since the very early 1970's. My first Enterprise Model I made from Lego Pieces because AMT was not selling the original model. They finally brought it back when Star Trek grew in syndication.<br /><br />I also bought many things through the newsprint, Lincoln Enterprise's catalog, to include Star Trek insignia patches, which my mother sewed onto a blue, long-sleeve, v-neck sweatshirt. I made my hand phaser from balsa wood and black electrical tape. My communicator was made from balsa wood, black electrical tape, and the metal speaker screen from an old transistor radio!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really enjoy all her novels, but this was my favorite.  The most well written, didn't have any gaping holes like the others, and you felt like you knew &#34;whodunit&#34; but couldn't wait to find out all the twists and turns along the way. Definitely recommend
B00499NHLC|4.0|The series is very entertaining.  It brings back memories of a school play.  It took me back  more than 40 years.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I love love live this series :)<br /><br />I also like the style of packaging used by the manufacturer. It should last.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|They make me type a review instead of just rating the book. YES, I loved the characters, the settings, the continued adventure of the young lad who survived &#34;Jack&#34; attack. The book takes you away into the author's world, any book that does that for me is 5 stars. BOO
B000K14LTA|5.0|In this time of religious intolerance Kingdom of Heaven is a powerful reminder that all the major religions of the world are really just a path to the same destination.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Awesome!!! Welcome back Cher!!! Pride is the best!!!! I cannot wait for the tour! Tell the truth! Dance on Cher!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I think if you like books that think beyond the world and people we are, this book is for you.  Myself I like a variety of stories, and this was one of them.  Tomorrow maybe a novel of &#34;who shot who&#34;.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Excellent characters, and a plot that kept my attention.  Unfortunately, many of these children were presented in situations that did exist during this period of our history
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I wish every year, I had no memory of this movie so I could experience again and again as if it were the first time I ever saw it.  Absolute truth!  If you have never seen it and are going to see it for the first time I am completely envious of you!  Merry Christmas!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Good game and great grafics.Very fun to play, pretty cool that it is free, although u need to.spend money if u Want to get far in this game.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|It's amazing that this is a 16 year old girl.  She reminds me a bit of Lana Del Ray, but a sound all her own.  Her voice is beautiful, yet still undone and far from the over-the-top popster voices of today.  I love every single song, and have listened to the album multiple times since buying it.  I had to make myself stop listening to it so often to hopefully avoid getting tired of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Insanely gripping just as the first was! So excite to read book 3 now ! Can't wait to see catching fire next month in theaters!!!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I hate this app because I can not down lode this app I wish they could help me with this app. I hope yup guys will not get this but this is boas.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|DragonVale is a really good game.If you like taking care of things or having something fun to do download this game.Totally awesome!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Its good but i need some help. Why can't I upload my own music every time I try it doesn't work.
B000002NIW|5.0|One of the best album ever of Deftones beside they bring you too the digital album for you cellphone' excellent price! One of my favorite band
B00594XOZU|1.0|Go on the Internet to 4shared.com and create an account. You can then get free downloads such as kik. This what I did and it works a whole lot better for my kindle. But if you delete it you have to go to your downloads and get it again. I hope this helped you.
B00BU18U82|5.0|This game is awesome because it is realistic farming methods and is easy to do<br />F2f g  u u u h  h  th.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's a fun game. Great for killing time. It would be nice if all the guns were accessible without paying real money but all around good game
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was recommended to me friends and I'll admit I was a little leery of the subject matter.  Well, boy am I glad I read it.  I love character driven novels and this fit the bill perfectly.  I became so attached to the characters, that I so didn't want the book to end.  But end it did and I feel like I have a much better understanding of quadriplegics and their caretakers.  There is a whole gamut of emotions that are experienced in this book.  It is a love story with the ultimate sacrifice.  Just read it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game it is so fun can't stop so fun tho crush cans and move to the next Level
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Entertainment in a basic super-hero package. It's like having a comic book in video form. I liked it but wouldn't expect an Oscar nomination.
B008220D7S|4.0|&#34;This Is 40&#34; is classic stuff.  Love it.  Great cast, funny screenplay and hilarious cameos from everybody in the business.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Such a heart warming story. I love the relationship that blossoms between Molly and Vivian and they both led such interesting lives it's amazing. One thing didn't add up for me but the ending was worth it such emotion. Really nice easy read.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Disappointing as I wanted the theatrical release on blu-ray, not DVD.  Only the DVD has the theatrical release, the blu-ray is the unrated. Purchase was for a young teen.  PG-13 is ok for him, but not unrated.  Wish this was more clear in the description.  Could have saved a few bucks and just ordered the DVD.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I found this book to be interesting, entertaining and informative.  I read many books on this era and still there was much to learn by reading this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!!! I've played the Moscow, Bejin and now New Orleans! I'm so addicted!! Every one needs to play this.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|my brothern plays this game on his nexus but i have a kindle and it won't allow me to intall the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank God the developers of Candy Crush Saga decided to make it for the Kindle Fire. I've been waiting for a while. Hopefully they also keep the app updated with iOS and Android and not let it fall behind. Thank you King.com. :)
0316204366|5.0|Gladwell is a master storyteller and David and Goliath doesn't disappoint. I've read some complaints that this book wasn't based in science and they are nonsense. What the people really mean is Gladwell doesn't write with an academic style and bore the reader to death.<br /><br />It's a highly researched book and shatters a lot of paradigms around conventional thinking, such as better schools mean better education, adversity is always a bad thing, brute force can triumph over resistance and David was the underdog when he stepped up to face Goliath.<br /><br />Of course Gladwell isn't a scientist and some people believe that you shouldn't be writing about research and science unless you're personally are involved. This smacks of jealousy and an insular attitude to me. I have read my fair share of academic articles, but the stuff I remember the best is when I'm entertained, intrigued and educated at the same time and there are few better than Gladwell at that.<br /><br />If you liked any of his previous books I suspect you'll love this one.
B007SVPZMW|2.0|Calling this Tic-Tac-Toe High Definition (HD) is not justified when the graphics are not proportionate. Merely stretching 4:3 aspect ratio into widescreen does not make it HD! The amount of space (26+Mb) it takes for a simple game like this which cannot be moved off to external SD card makes this less desirable. Playing against the AI most certainly will result in a draw at best unless you get a sleepy partner to play with. Sorry I cannot rate more than 2 stars! for this game.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I like Will Smith a lot... and I don't think his son did as poor of a job as many of the reviewers on here did. Will also did a fair job himself. Not a typical role for him. You guys have to remember that the acting in most science fiction is cheese almost by definition. You have to overact a bit to sell a fantastic plot.<br /><br />The world they created was pretty cool, right down to graviton-based faster than light travel, but the technology could have used a little more thought. Why we can't grow people a new leg ten centuries from now I have no idea. Neither am I sure why we would use a glorified spear as our only means of self defense. Perhaps there are explanations for those things but on the surface, they just look like holes in the backstory.<br /><br />The story itself was alright; the creatures were cool and the effects were cool. It kept me on the edge of my seat. It had one of my favorite actors in it. All these things combined made it well worth a $5 rental.
B008EL25LE|3.0|I have seen many matching three or more games but this one is very pretty. The presentation and graphics is superb. There is also a very nice storytelling to make it worthwhile to play. I think this game is certainly worthy purchase if you love match-3 types of games. The only factor currently preventing me to rate this with four stars is the price.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Automatically pulls up when opening a PDF on kindle. Runs great and fast. Completes office suite for free without having to upgrade office suite!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't Crush saga is lots of fun. Have been waiting for it and am thrilled that it is finally available on my Kindle Fire! Thanks.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is loads of fun I would recommend it to anyone!  It reminds me of a few other games I like to pay.
B009NXD6JM|5.0|HAVE WATCHED THIS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST.  JUST CAN'T BEAT THOSE OLD MOVIES. GREAT AUDREY HEPBURN MOVIE.  VERY FUNNY.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Great to see Danny again.  Love the tender and insightful way the quantum/psychical skills are treated in King's work here.  Once again King creates character relationships where human love flourishes even under duress and in unlikely places, including the great beyond.  Loved it!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I HAVE JUST STARTED THIS SERIES.  LOVE WATCHING ON MY KINDLE FIRE, AND LOVE THE CHARACTERS SO FAR.  NOT INTO IT FAR ENOUGH TO GIVE A REALLY DETAILED REVIEW
B007V2UGPE|4.0|fun game.  time on my side and easy kill and go on.  free. so even better and I get to kill both samurai an zombies
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed the setting of the story and it was easy to read. I look forward to reading about the new doctor and Lacey.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Every book is such an adventure with Stephen King.  Could hardly put it down.  Keeps you engaged and anticipating the next scenario.  Loved it!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Gabriel Macht defines this show, but you shouldn't sleep on Lewis's character, either! Great show that has quickly become a must-see for me!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Stands PS controller...got it, plugged it in, and started playing.  I'm not sure what else there is to review about it, but would buy again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like doing a certain type of a puzzle, like a connect the dot type game, then, this is a game for you. When i first started playing I wasn't quite sure what the object of the game was. Once i figured out that not only did you have to connect the same color dots together, but, you also have to fill in the whole square with the colored lines, filling up the whole box that is black with colored dots to a box filled with colors. As you may find, as I did, the very beginning seemed like child's play, way to easy to win. But, as you start clearing boards, and, getting more and more colors to connect, the harder the puzzles become, because, of the twists and turns that some lines end up taking from one dot to another, making the game fun as well as frustrating trying to figure out how a line is supposed to go from point A  to point  B without running into a different colored dot, or, a different colored line. It is a lot of fun.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worked great!  Could even stream things in a way that I didn't think possible.  I did have one problem where my older mac couldn't use the interface, but a quick upgrade to the latest IOS, and I was off to the races.  For the price point, nothing really comes close to this in terms of ease of use and reliability.  Still lacking some features like playing videos of media you own from other devices in your house, but for all things online, this is the device you have been looking for.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|It's a good series, I'm sorry &#34;Showtime&#34; chose to put this so the general public<br />cannot see it.  Our world is all about MONEY!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game of minecraft is awesome. I love it. But the update 0.7.6 is horrible. It makes the bows hard to fire. Wish I could undownload it.
074322454X|5.0|What a book!  Makes a person appreciate what these men did for us even more.  They are true heroes.  It's too bad more of them aren't still around.  The wealthy men who made up most of the officer corps are written about and praised and go down in history, but these guys were the guts of the outfit.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Reptilian Monstrosities(aka Kaiju) start coming up from deep under the Pacific Ocean. A War begins that takes millions of lives that, literally taxes humanity's resources for years on end. To combat them, massive robots are made(called Jaegers) which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. When America is on the verge of defeat, it's up to two unlikely allies, piloting an obsolete Jaeger, to put a stop to it once & for all.<br /><br />Folks, THIS is how a proper American Kaiju film should be made. Everything just feels natural in this film, like it's for real. Course, what impressed me the most was the designs for the Jaegers & the Kaiju. Excellent. If Director Gareth Edwards can do this with the new Godzilla film coming in 2014, it will be a resounding success-I guarantee it!. At any rate, despite its' two+ hour run-time(my only serious gripe), Pacific Rim is a blast to watch with tons of action and plenty of(for lack of a better way of saying it..)buttkicking. Guillermo Del Toro really outdid himself this time.<br /><br />Now, hopefully this will jumpstart Hollywood to make MORE Kaiju films.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed the story and how it brought the two lives together with a happy ending.  Well written, easy to read.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I just got this headset a few hours ago after ordering a few days ago, and so far it seems to do pretty well. I can go from my bedroom almost all over the house (the exception being the basement), and to that end, it works just fine. Sound quality's good, and it seems very solidly designed.<br /><br />My one complaint, and this isn't about the headset itself, is that it seems like this didn't come with the promised software CD. Not a big deal since I could just go and download the needed program off of Logitech's website, but annoying nonetheless. If you yourself are without the CD in question, just look up Logitech G930 Software, and it should hook you right up.<br /><br />Other Impressions:<br />- Charged fast, and I could use it while it charged<br />- VERY comfortable, a problem I had with my last headset, a wired $20 set<br />- Cuts out a little at times, which I'm pretty sure has to do with the high amount of electronics we otherwise have in the house. I'll test it somewhere with less interference sometime.<br />- The voice modulation is a neat design, but half of them (3 of 6) are virtually impossible to understand, and the raising/lowering pitch doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />My impression of the headset is great, hence the 5 star rating, but note that the software doesn't seem to be quite as good. It's quite intuitive to use -- which I appreciate -- but doesn't seem super nice otherwise. So the hardware is great, 5/5, but the software is only okay, 4/5 for being serviceable.<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone looking to get a solid gaming headset, which I look forward to trying out in an actual game (using it mostly for Skype calls, myself).
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game u neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed to have this game or u will die!!!!!!!! So get it! U CAN'T LIVE W/ OUT IT
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The entire time I read this book I was captivated by Jack, what a perfect way to tell the story from his perspective!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad they finally made this for kindle! Love this game! Just wish they gave you more lives. Waiting sucks, and some levels are so frustrating it's easy to give up.
1455527475|2.0|In this book Greg Smith will present the reader an inside look into Goldman Sachs, the selection procedure, the rituals among colleagues, the paychecks, ... Unfortunately, the result is an overly long book filled with irrelevant information. It would have been much better if the author would have focused more on the details of his analysis and his actual sales skills, but instead we get tons of stories over sport and his appartment, his friends, his paychecks, him surviving 9/11, ...<br /><br />A missed opportunity in my opinion.
B004HD61KE|2.0|It was hard to stay focused on the story for me. It was not that exciting like his other books, I didn't finish it.
B001BANK32|5.0|This was a very frightening book. I liked it much more than the movie and a must read for any die hard King fan.
B000FA675C|1.0|This sort of book isn't my usual choice. I was trying something different but lost interest and gave up at the point where Langdon and Sophie visits the British ex-pat. There was just too much telling and not enough showing at this point. I listened to an audio version of the book from the library, and while I appreciate the skills of the narrator, I did think that the one-dimensional police inspector sounded like Steve Martin's Inspector Clouseau. The short chapters are a good structure for this type of cliff-hanger book.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|A worthy sequel to The Shining. Stephen King has done it again. I can hardly wait to see the movie!
B002ZBRSMK|5.0|This movie was done very well considering it takes place in the living room of a house. They pulled it off.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|To sum it up this is pretty much a GTA clone for mobile. The graphics are nice and there are plenty of side missions and challenges to keep you busy. I did not experience more than maybe a few crashes while playing the game. I am using a Kfire first gen so I'm sure the lack of ram has a lot to do with it. The controls can be frustrating occasionally and the auto aim doesn't always lock on to the bad guy or vehicle closest to you. If you need a GTA fix but your device is not supported this is an okay substitute.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love that you gain coins even while you aren't playing.love the shake meter and how the prizes drop down. fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been hoping for this to happen. One of my favorite games has made it to Kindle. And, even better, it will synch with your game on Facebook. So I was able to pick up on the same level. WooHoo!!
B007KOYEOC|3.0|Good to finish off the Fifty Shades story, but a lot more of the same thing as the other 2 books. Nice to have a happy ending though!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was a quick read and very thought provoking.  I had to ponder how I would react if I were the main character in this book.  I loved it!
B00821PCJS|3.0|It is alright. I'd like more back story of how the aliens got there but seems like a good story.
B000V6AF5I|5.0|GREAT great great great love stevie wonder he is the best and i love old soul music of most kinds
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|With my wife's family coming from Norway, the history of the vikings have been something that we have always been intrigued about. Even though this series is a bit over the top at times, we still loved that story in general. Not only does the series have great writing, but there is also amazing acting that is in this too. I can tell through watching this that the writers have done their research, and the director has worked closely with the actors to make this as real as possible making the series that much more convincing.<br /><br />I also appreciated that the series brought forth a lot of the traditions of the Vikings. I was not aware of all of them, but in doing my own research after watching this, I was happy to see how close to reality the series was in regards to these traditions.<br /><br />The series itself is definitely one that will engage you from beginning to end. You will be captivated from episode to episode and you will great drawn into both the drama and adventure that the series encompasses (or at least I did).<br /><br />I am happy to see that the series was not cancelled and look forward to seeing where this series will lead!<br /><br />*I received a copy of this for review - all opinions are my own*
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I think this book was classic King. I evaluate every book on it's own, without comparing it to previous work.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Download was easy for the app. Now when I want to download additional ones it will be more convenient to do.<br />Tech was very helpful.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|I can't imagine little kids even wanting to play this game. Is it just me, or are there other people questioning why someone would make an app for kids that glorifies stealing? And why would any parent let a kid get this app? It could just as easily been called 'Tiny Collector' and not had anything to do with stealing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is the perfect continuance of the story of Dan Torrance and I wish every sequel was as easy and fun to read.  No long tangents where King tends to lose the avid reader, it was almost more in the style of Dean Koontz.  Fast paced and energizing with a great new kind of &#34;bad guy&#34; that we love to see avenged!
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Why this calculator is so popular when there are much, much better ones (also free) is beyond me. Maybe kids like this one, but it's not good for adults or college students.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As always, Stephen King has written a novel you can't stop reading.  I love that it revisits Danny as a grownup.  All in all, another success for the master of fiction.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|It is hard for me to properly express how I feel about this book. I read it rather quickly, it was never a chore for me to read. I think the story was unpredictable and I am not sure where it is going (which intrigues me). The characters are relatively well developed and introduced, though I find I don't particularly like any of them. Mind you its not that I hate them, I just don't find them particularly interesting. So I guess in the end, I feel kinda lukewarm about this book.<br /><br />All that being said, I will read the next book. The reason being, I think this first book did a great job at starting to introduce the main story line(though I felt it could have done more) and I feel that the story Abercrombie is tell has the potential to be very good. So reviewing this as a lone book, I would give it 3/5 stars. My hope is that when I read the second book, abercrombie will rope me in with a great story and further develop his characters to make them more interesting to me.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book to others? Well... let me read the second book first.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The author pulls you into the story line until you feel li,e some of the characters could be someone you've known for a long time.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Very rarely does a book come along that so engrosses me that I simply cannot put it down. The plot was fantastic. Complex enough not to be too predictable and yet all the elements were there to put pieces together as you go. A truly great book and I am very excited to see what comes next!<br /><br />My one criticism is that I though the character development started to suffer in the second half, although not so much it took away from the story.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|I must admit, I don't know everything a bout Cher and was surprised to read in another review that she was69 years old when recording this album. This album will grow on you if you are fan of Cher's, like it has on me.  The songs have the current beat to them in the musical accompaniment, and are contemporary to this decade.<br />&#34;I hope you find it&#34; is a sensitive and stirring song that test's her vocal range to the limit. I have tried singing this song along with the album, it is a difficult piece that only a professional can really handle successfully. But that's why she is where she is in the music industry, we can't all do what she does with our voices.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is amazing I highly recommend this and the rest of the Percy Jackson series, and read the Heroes of Olympus
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You won't regret reading this one  much better than you would think.  It was full of suspense, emotion,  and surprises.
B00865P3AS|1.0|Their first cd was better, I like where they are going they need to stick to heavy metal rock songs. Stay away from the sweet, sad songs, or the singing parts. If your going to buy their cd buy their first one, I hope their next cd is better if not this is the end of these 2cellos
B001GA1RFA|5.0|Amazing! Hilarious! I wouldn't have changed a single thing, it really was, by all means, perfect. John Green is a wonderful author, and out of all of his novels I've read so far... Each is different, and each is absolutely beautiful in it's own unique way.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book is super duper AMAZING!!!It was so awesome,cool,and the best book I ever read!!!And it was so great.It was like the title.That is why I give it five stars.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Worth the wait! Once I had downloaded this gem, I couldn't sleep or put it down until it was completely read!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad you got candy crush on the kindle! The game is fun and a nice way to relax after work!! Thanks!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Interesting read. Story takes you behind the scenes and uncovers the dangers our military undergoes and politics that can hinder operations. Proud of our military and special forces like the SEALS.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I thought it was really funny and the characters all cared for the little girl Boo. Heartwarming. Great for kids who don't like violence. (Age 10).
1475143389|5.0|Everything you need to know to jump into weight lifting and make the progress you want.  No gimmicks, no fads, just time -tested methods that will never stop working.  Great for those just getting into weight lifting as well as burnouts like me who have tried everything only to find a book like this and be reminded that the rules of this game haven't changed.  Michael will show you the way, and if you've strayed over the years he will help you find your way again.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Book was a bit of a slow start. But once I got into it, I could hardly put it down, an enchanting, atmospheric story. Kate Morton continues to be one of my favorite authors. Her book &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34;, available at Amazon, is one of my all time favorite books.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is an awesome series and this season cannot be beat for David Tennant fans!!! I had tears from laughing and from some very touching moments of this series. I won't go into spoilers but this is a must see season for Who fans.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Love this series, just enough drama to keep you interested with out sex and lies. Wonderful show that the whole family can watch.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|I have always like Science fiction and fantasy movies since I was a child. When I was younger I used to dream, and spent many quarters in a starfighter arcade game so I could be chosen to help defend the universe. Alas it never happened, but now I can enjoy the memories any time I want with this movie.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|the second disc is almost as good as movie , have watched movie many times, as still as good as first time
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|One of my favorite Fantasy movies from my childhood. I've been wanting to get this movie for some time and I am glad to have it on Blueray. I look forward to sharing this movie with my daughter and hope she will enjoy it as much as I did.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What can I say, a great set of movies, Raiders first, Crusade second, Skull third, Temple last that's how I rate  them.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really loved this book, could not put it down.  I have been wondering how Danny got along after The Shining and now I know.  I like that he found his half sister and all the connections.  Now we'll need the next book to see how she handles her shining.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|They are all great films. But the original three are still the best, you actually care about the characters. The last three not so much. The best actor in the bunch was a puppet, Yoda.
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Never heard of this artist before,saw an interview he did with Tavis Smiley.Decided to check his music out on Amazon. I was totally blown away.  I bought the cd for myself and vinyl for a friend.  Glad to know great music is still being made.  You may want to watch his videos on youtube.  Great performances by Mr.Porter.  I plan to purchase his previous cd's.
B008Q00PHY|4.0|Plot has twist at the end. Performances by actors believable.<br />Hugh Jackman is in the movie for the ladies. But it's all about HALLEY!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was unsure of buying this e-book because of the price. I'm glad I decided to take a chance. The Secret Keeper lays out its story by moving back and forth between the past and the present. The author does a wonderful job of developing the characters and bringing their personalities to life. By moving back and forth in time, you get to know the characters at various ages, which helps the reader become deeply attached to them. Her descriptive writing style helps the reader feel that they are there in the story. I will read more from Kate Morton.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great  grphics and nice UI.  Has some bugs and annoys you with some popups keep it from being  five stars.
159463176X|3.0|Having loved the other books, I was disappointed in both the content and style of this book. Readable, but not as good as his others.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Completely entertaining and addictive almost. Not too over the top drama but enough to keep entertained and the story line going. More realistic too so you can fall into the story!
B0094K20FK|5.0|Easily the best Star Trek movie made! It holds up very well after all these years. Khan is one of the greatest villains ever imagined. I re-watched this after seeing JJ Abrahms &#34;Into Darkness&#34;. JJ's rendition was also superb and left me wanting more. I was surprised at how well TWoK had aged. Be sure to watch the original Star Trek series episode &#34;Space Seed&#34; (season 1 episode 22) . It is the prequel to the movie and is also available free to watch with Amazon Prime.
B008469DGY|4.0|I found this game to be really fun and entertaining, and was blown away by the graphics (mostly fly-arounds while the app waits for you to start playing).  It's got multiple courses to help keep things a bit mixed up, and a couple of modes to play - and arcade \\"score as many points in the given time\\" mode, and a course mode.  There are a handful of courses to play, but in each course the holes don't really change  - mainly only pin location and wind speed change.<br /><br />You score points by hitting (\\"flicking\\") the ball towards the hole, which is surrounded by a bulls-eye like target in which point values decrease the farther away from the hole the ball ends up.  There is wind, which generally increases as the game progresses in any of the modes you might be playing.<br /><br />The problem lies in the fact that the way to score the \\"big\\" points is by curving the ball in the air and getting spin on it.  The more you can make the ball curve, and the more you can make it move once it hits the ground, the higher the score.  It's a problem because, while not really a \\"golf simulator\\" anyway, it sort of defeats the point of golf, which is to get as close to the pin as possible by hitting a good shot.  In this game, you get the most reward by hitting a terrible shot, and then correcting on the fly.<br /><br />That said, I still found it to be a lot of fun... I only wish there was more - more courses, more variety.
B00C5ZORES|4.0|Tye first few tracks are sone if the strongest.  Personally I think Elton John is a bit past his prime for these guys, and I didbt really dig their chemistry.  But overall, I get completely through this album without any urge to skip any tracks.
2067002627|4.0|The gives us a visual picture of the battle fo Normandy.It is a great aid to our understanding of the events
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game !!!! ;) I'm so addicted I can't put it down.this is my favorite game of all the games I play.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|The music was great. There was some A-list stars involved, however the story line left much to be desired. Sorry, but cannot recommend it.
B00FEN1C50|3.0|This movie was given a big buildup. There were parts of the film where they did a fairly good job with the special effects concerning the robots, but the fight scenes between the robots & creatures reminded me of old time Godzilla movies.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I liked the humour. It really is a movie for children, but there was a lesson in it for anyone.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|sorry it cut me off and made me sudmit,but as i was saying,what does he do,eat HAY????<br />okay maybe i am detecting a couple errors with the book.but it was otherwise sooo good.jude did everything we asked,more credit for evan,more attentoin toward ian, and the charcters personalities are back to normal(besides amy)thank you jude,and good luck to the next authors waiting in line
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|loved this book and its vast differences, nobody was the same, from the way they looked, to the story they had to say, they were all different. And for the first time (haven't gone to NY) i felt actually connected with this culture i've always been curious about. Just amazing.
B008VNIA32|3.0|This is going to be a difficult review and I invite comments. I am relatively new to opera---there's your opening, come and get me! I have built a collection of opera on DVD and regularly view them. I listen to opera on my mp3 player daily. I took a course and read a few books. For fun, I read libretti. That's me.<br /><br />I have found that I enjoy a wide range of opera from the early works through to modern opera such as Billy Budd, Nixon in China and the Dialogues of the Carmelites. My preference is to see opera performed the way it was written with the stage notes carried out as intended. I do not like \\"period adjusted\\" performances. In my opinion, that is perversion of the original works.<br /><br />At first glance, after watching the entire 1980s Met Ring Cycle, I found the sets and costumes appalling in this version. The Rhine scene is tolerable but the first appearance of the gods reminded me of the first episode of Gilligan's Island. Those corny clear suitcases and goofy costumes really do not convey \\"gods\\" in any stretch of the imagination. Wotan, blind in one eye supposedly, looks like his sunglasses broke in the shipwreck. Well, Das Rheingold is certainly a three hour tour...<br /><br />By this point, the critic in me came out and I wanted to hate this production. But Wagner is so good, the music so excellent, the themes so powerful that if the music is right, it almost cannot be screwed up. I forced myself to accept this awful costuming and go with the music. The music matters and this music, though at times not well recorded, is certainly superior to the Met's production from the 80's. The voices are stronger.<br /><br />If you are new to opera and want to venture through a Ring Cycle, go with the Met's 80's production. It's a very traditional delivery.<br /><br />If you have some experience and spare change, add this to your collection. It will grow on you. It did me. Still, I just can't give 5 stars to this production because I feel too much liberty was taken with the settings and costuming. The character interpretations are very interesting and I think these characters have more depth than the Met's but those damn silly costumes are distracting.<br /><br />Comments welcome.was taken with the settings and costuming.

B0089EHWQE|4.0|I could feel the emotions that produced the major contents of the story.  It forces the reader to come to a moral decision.
B004TI5N38|5.0|If you like unforgettable action characters then read this one! It's a can't put down page turner in the theme of Jack Reacher!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is so well done, that I find myself totally involved with it, losing all track of time. It seems like each episode is only 5 minutes long.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very clever game. Great for killing time. Very challenging!  I'm ready for more levels to be made available! Great game!
B00ECR7KX2|1.0|I bought this because I have been a Whedoner since Buffy began. I have to say I was very disappointed. I barely got 15 minutes in (if that far). The setting and cinematography was great. However, if you are going to do a modern adaptation of a famous work, modernize the language. The use of Shakespearean language was too distracting with this setting. It was also poorly executed. I respect the casting, but maybe there should have been more rehearsal time.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a great book to share with your children or grandchildren or to read again as an adult. Its a story of the healing power of nature and friendship. Read it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I like Solitaire but it is very aggravating when you get constant advertising showing up after every game! I would not download this app if you hate advertising interruptions!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use this app many times a day and appreciate having it.  For me it is an essential.  I really like how it looks too :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game .This is the best game ever . I play this game on my nana phone . Play this game ever day!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Its great to be able to watch the series in sequence. The quality is excellent  and the interface creative and functional both.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Having fun playing, keeps it interesting, seems like it is getting harder but with out getting frustrating. Good thinking game to play
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Absolutely satisfies those that have waited all these years for this story arc to conclude. It's been amazing to watch Mr King's career, what a prolific writer. One of the first to pioneer and mentor self-publishing, he continues to show the way and set the bar for all writers today. Happy to have gone for the ride with you, sir.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is great game fun f u fun fun fun<br />I love this game it is so good<br /><br /> Grater than other games
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|The title said it all. Worst Will smith movie ever. He should stop making movies with his kid. Jaden smiths cannot act.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|The show was always a favorite of mine during its entire run. I think this season sparked a great human touch with 'Seven', and of course the doctor, coupled with an incredibly powerful female lead cast as Captain Janeway and you have television / DVD brilliance for sure!
B00BP4ZNFM|3.0|I loved this movie when it came out  and saw it several times way back then.  I couldn't wait until I thought my grandson was old enough to enjoy it too.  I guess movies have changed...he was bored with it at the age of 7.  Movies seem to move much faster nowadays.  It was still the same touching warm story but it seemed to drag on a bit...plus so much of it takes place in a darkened setting that it is difficult to get the average home dark enough to make the lighting effective.  Of course the music is the same wonderful John Williams music but tell that to a 7 yr old.....
B007SVPZMW|3.0|Kinda slow moving. But overall a good game.  It. Helps pass the time and I like the three different backgrounds. It's cool
B008OHV5C8|5.0|I got a hand written thank you note with the order form.  These guys care that you’re buying from them. I was caught off guard with level of care.
B000SEI230|5.0|I wrote  this review because this book had an impact on me and it showed me that there is more to life then the huge things.<br />I really like how the authority described the scenes and their feelings throughout the book<br />I didn't like that it didn't say much about  night of Jamie's death. Or her funeral<br />Over all things  book was a nice read and I recommend it to a person who like  a really good love story! And that don't mind crying during a book
034580709X|2.0|It just may be the translation process.  However the plot was good, it tended to wander just a bit.  I will give his next book a try.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book has changed my perspective on many issues I considered important in life. It's a captivating book you can't stop listening to. Buy it and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|One of the best yet.<br /><br />Looking forward to Iron Man IV. Downey is almost likable, Paltrow completes the excentric tycoon.
B00FKQ38OE|2.0|I was really looking forward to this album based on the title song which I heard McCartney do live on TV numerous times. It's very \\"Beatley\\", but the rest off the album sounds nothing like it and none of the other songs are very memorable. I guess it's cool that at 71 yrs. old McCartney wants to sound relevant, but the production techniques just don't make up for lackluster songs. I wish I had checked it out before I bought it and only downloaded the title song.
1416583432|5.0|As a dog owner for 30+ years and a dog lover all my life I found this book absolutely fascinating. Unlike other reviewers who thought it was academic or dry I thought it was an easy read and full of statistics and scientific findings that I wouldn't have believed were true about dogs had the author not had the references to back up the findings. (For example, she often refers to the work of Temple Grandin, which has had a major impact on the field of animal behaviorism.) I also enjoy the stories about her own dog that the author weaves through through the book. Highly recommend it!
B00ECTZKKA|4.0|The Korn of 2013 are hardly the Korn we met way back in 1994. Nowadays, they're a little older, they're a little wiser, but they've also become a little washed-up in the interim. In an attempt to make up for a string of poorly received (if well intentioned) experimental albums, the gang has reunited with guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, who made headlines in early 2005 when he left the band to pursue a life with the Lord. Granted, this remains to be a true reunion by definition (drummer David Silveria is still MIA, with the more than capable Ray Luzier holding things down) but Korn circa 2013 is perhaps the healthiest the band has been in its entire career, which would explain the solidarity and focus that drives much of their eleventh studio offering, \\"The Paradigm Shift.\\"<br /><br />Sounds like: Korn have worked through their issues and are taking a look in the mirror, realizing life is peachy again.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Head's back! The two-guitar attack that gave Korn much of their original quirk is back on the table.<br /><br />- Ray Luzier is a beast behind the kit, and he is finally given an avenue that does his playing justice. Unlike the wonky \\"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\\" and the over-processed \\"Path of Totality,\\" Ray's inclusion doesn't feel shoe-horned or out of place. This album's strength lies just as much on Head's return as it does on Ray's hard work. David can keep scratching at the door; Ray is more than worthy of this position.<br /><br />- This is a mostly no-frills affair. Fans who were turned off by the NIN-inspired \\"See You On The Other Side\\" or the aforementioned dubstep overdose of \\"Path of Totality\\" will revel in all of this album's glory.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Don Gilmore's slick production yielded gold for fellow nu-metallers Linkin Park back in the day, but doesn't allow Korn to color outside of the lines much.<br /><br />- Jonathan Davis is completely spent on topics to complain about, and rather than keep it ambiguous, he continues to scrape the bottom of the barrel. So your son has diabetes? Is that your biggest issue? Just hire Wilfred Brimley to hide in his closet at night. Problem solved.<br /><br />Hits:<br /><br />- \\"Love & Meth\\" and \\"Prey For Me\\" are classic Korn, beefed up with meaty choruses and subtle industrial nuances.<br /><br />- The electronica/dubstep influenced \\"Never, Never\\" was an instant turn-off when it was revealed as the first single, but put in the context of the whole album, it's one of the fresher moments to be found. It's also insanely catchy and is one of the few tracks where Jonathan actually seems to be singing from the heart.<br /><br />- \\"Mass Hysteria\\" plays like a time machine, transporting you back to the glory days of 1999. Just try not to rub elbows with Fred Durst while you're there -- you don't know where he's been.<br /><br />Misses:<br /><br />- \\"Lullaby for a Sadist\\" is one of Jonathan's \\"babies,\\" and though it's different from the rest of the songs in a good way, it just kind of goes nowhere, failing to live up to its potential.<br /><br />- Bonus tracks \\"Wish I Wasn't Born Today\\" and \\"Tell Me What You Want\\" really add nothing to the album and feel like afterthoughts.<br /><br />Best Listened to When: You want to remember who Korn are, before they traveled the path that took them to the other side.<br /><br />Personally:<br /><br />Korn were my favorite band as a teen. I was 14 when \\"Follow The Leader\\" hit and they were the end-all, be-all for me. Fun fact: my first Amazon review was for \\"Issues,\\" way back in December of 1999 (spoiler alert: I loved it, but could only muster a few sentences). Naturally, I've followed them throughout the years and though they've been bumped down the \\"favorites\\" list quite a bit, I will always nurse a soft spot for them. Though hardly perfect, \\"The Paradigm Shift\\" plays out like a reward for those of us who have stuck with them through the thick and thin. Who would have ever thought they'd make it 20 years?!<br /><br />The Bottom Line(s):<br /><br />You liked Korn at one point? This piques your interest? Give it a shot. They've finally nailed the \\"going back to our roots\\" album -- for the most part.0 years?!<br /><br />The Bottom Line(s):<br /><br />You liked Korn at one point? This piques your interest?

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|My entire family is obsessed with this game. My mom stays on her tablet in the living room and my dad stays in the bedroom. Do you people realize that technology is taking over your life
B001NI24OI|2.0|Predictable.  Allegedly shows the real side of high school football in the southern U.S.  If it does, the country is in a lot of trouble!  High school football parents should be outlawed from attending games like these.
0425098478|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  The wisdom is quick and to the point.  The management style is what I modeled and helped me be a better manager.  Highly recommend!
B00499NHLC|4.0|The British Version of Sherlock is much better than the American version.  Sherlock and Watson are much more &#34;Correct&#34; than the American version.
B00136NVH4|5.0|This is my all-time favorite album/songs/artist.  Every song is a winner.  The songs sometimes get long (10 min + on some) but they are well worth it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For me, this was a very good book. I loved the fact that we learned more about Danny and I hope we will see more of Abra. I really enjoyed this book.
B00FEN000S|5.0|If you like giant robots and monsters, then look no further.  As an added bonus, it actually has a plot and decent acting!
B00CFNUC0S|5.0|Our whole family loves this show.  We have a 3 and 5 year old, and this show is entertaining, but not violent or too fast.  It is a great show.  It is nice to have a show we can watch and not worry about inappropriate material for our children.  It also is not too fast, as too many shows are now.  It doesn't flip around a lot.  This is good, clean fun.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Watching this gave ME a hangover. Part 1&2 were good, this one was terrible. Don't waist your time on this one.
630460288X|4.0|a very good scifi action movie, lasers, explosions one on one tough guys, this movies has it all. it would be a good idea for either scifi fans or action fans to check it out
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Awsome show also check out &#34;chuck&#34; tv show about a spy who gets all of the governments secrets in his head
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, it held my interest and kept me curious enough to want to turn the pages very quickly. I chose this book initially because i like the author.I would recommend it to my friends who enjoy the types of books I read.
0385349947|5.0|MY EMPLOYER HAS A LUNCH AND LITERATURE AND THIS WAS THE SECOND BOOK IN THE SERIES. A LOT TO CONSIDER....MAY NOT WORK IN EVERY SITUATION, BUT A STARTER FOR WOMEN.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An amazing book I wanted to rush through this book because it was an amazing book. Best book in the world
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was disappointed because the streaming was very slow and limited. It may have preformed the way it was designed to but not in the way I expected.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read! I need more!!!! This would be an awesome movie or mini series.  I wish it would go on.
B00F52YOPA|4.0|I love it - just wish it offered additional rooms to &#34;make over&#34;!  It kept me entertained for hours.  Haven't figured out the stamps part of the game though - did seem like it was working.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|Despite the production difficulties, the mission still continued. The relationships of the characters became even better and the philosophy still held true.
0143124544|5.0|I had heard about \\"Me Before You\\" but did not want to read it at first, given its popularity. On a whim, I got it on my kindle to read it on my flight from the US to Europe. Best and worst decision ever. The pro side is that it is really well-written, the characters are very rounded and easy to relate to, on both sides. Lou is one of the best female characters I've read about. And Will... he is just so wonderful, despite his condition. It is more of a coming-of-age story than a romance book. You see these two completely different characters change over the course of the story.<br />And be ready for tears. Everyone was asleep on the plane on the economy side, with my light only on, my tears blurring my sight. Yet through the tears, I finished the story in one sitting (took me about 4 hours) and just loved it and thought about it for days. It was the best thing about the Delta Airlines flight.<br />Highly recommended!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I watched the show from the beginning and am still and always will be a Treker. . Roddenberry's philosophies were boldly presented and exciting for those times. With the resources available and the Desu support, he and everyone involved created a fascinating universe.
B008602KQI|5.0|Much better than expected to follow the book pretty well it was exciting without being overly violent I'm looking forward to the next one
0399226907|5.0|I absolutly love this book. It is wonderful for children as well. This is a great way for kids to learn what happens to a catipillar in a fun and creative way. The pictures and the colors enhance the book tremendously and thats what i love the most about it. We loved it so much for our pumpkin parade we made a hungry caterpillar out of small pumpkins!!  We won first place!!!  Highly recommend.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is my favorite alarm clock app.  Love all the setting options and white noise option. The weather conditions is helpful in winter for extra drive time.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Classic... love this movie!  Great action and charcters.  This is a movie you can watch more than once.  Go watch it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I love true stories! This French film was based on a true story of the unusual and unique relationship between two very different individuals, played by two terrific actors. To me, the story of their time together and the profound impact they had on each other should not be missed. It is a film full of humor, cleverness,  warmth, brutal realities, great music, and in some cases, high speed action! After seeing it 3 times, I bought the DVD!
B00CLD65X0|4.0|I love this show, it is very gripping.  I get so involved that i seem to think about it for days.  I gave it only 4 stars because I am still upset that a certain person dies at the end of the last episode.  I cannot believe that they killed him off, he is a very important character and I just could not believe that the writers did that.  I will still watch the next season because I love the storyline.  The writer is excellent and the series is excellent, I am just upset that this happened.
B00C9G22R2|1.0|This was so different from what the previews hinted at. There are not many actual martial arts fight scenes. The movie starts with a big fight scene between Master Ip Man and a huge group of guys. I didn't like how it was filmed at all. Either: too blurry, too close, too slow. Add to that they never told us why they were fighting. I thought the movie would be about Ip Man and showcase his life and arts better. It seemed like he was a side character and the movie was about the character Gong Er (daughter of the retired Grandmaster). She had the best fight scene at the train station and seemed to be more fleshed out than anyone else in the whole movie. They hinted at some interest between the two, but never crossed the actual line with it. Then again, he had a wife and kids that he left somewhere, never to be seen again. This movie jumped all over the place with no explanation on the people we were seeing. Too many half done un-necessary side stories, not enough main character story. I didn't enjoy it at all (except for train station fight). This is not an action-packed movie.
B0017SWSCW|4.0|The story moves right along and even though you know what has happened you have to figure out how the hero is going to get out of his predicament.  It is a good read.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very convenient on my Note 3. The screen size finally makes reading a book on your phone possible. Great combo.
0316204366|3.0|As a 30 year education veteran (Teacher, Principal and Superintendent); I thought the sections on\\" Class Size\\" and \\"Effective Parenting and Resources\\" were weak, and not up to Gladwell standards. \\"Class Size\\" is a variable that is very dependent on many other variables like: Teacher efficacy, teacher experience, teacher expertise (mastery of methodology and content), teacher resources, etc.  For example:  A large class with a great teacher trumps a class half the size with an incompetent teacher. On the second topic there are deep and wide deleterious effects of poverty that can influence a parent's ability to be effective and the child's ability to learn; these can't just be overlooked. However, chapter 3 of Malcolm Gladwell's: David and Goliath Should be read by every college bound high school student and H.S. Guidance Counselor and College Advisor. For more read:  [...]
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Thank you!
B006S08RLU|5.0|The most entertaining movie I've seen in years. Recommend to almost anybody. Very original and charming. Saw it and bought it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very good book. Easy to read. It gave a good visual picture of what these children lives were like and what they went through.
B008602KQI|3.0|For me, all a movie needs to be is entertaining. The 'Hunger Games' was entertaining but not great. From the moment Katniss' sister was chosen you knew who was going to volunteer. You could also know that Peeta would be chosen, that he and Katniss would win, they would threaten to eat the poison berries, the rules of the game would be changed, etc., etc. Good role for Woody Harrelson, not so much for Donald Sutherland. Let me reiterate. I liked this movie and was entertained by it. However, it was more 'same ole -same ole' then 'broke new ground'.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I have been playing this game for 3 days now and I am addicted. It is simple and challenging. The best games always are!

0786956291|4.0|This kit serves as a perfect introduction to the game. Got a bunch of new players involved and they're loving it!
B004I8WD6E|1.0|The screen protector is effective and gets the job done. The case is another story. I was very happy with this case at first; it seems to offer the right level of protection without making the actual case too bulky. However, after a few months, the case started turning into a dirty beige colored. I tried washing it with soap and water, to no avail. I no longer use this case due to how dirty it makes my (white) iPhone look.
B009NX1YT6|1.0|Ok so I do have a clue why I liked this as a kid. As an adult, it is painful to watch. Light entertainment but hard to watch older folks play high school kids.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put this book down! I didn't want it to end.<br />Hope he writes a another sequel to this book!
B002G917ZK|3.0|This is always a cute movie. Not one I would want to see often but it is entertaining for a while. Watching this once in a lifetime is ok for me. Thanks for reading.
B00E95ED32|5.0|Avicii album True is very different music then I usually listen too. The digital electronics was amazing and the different styles make the songs unique. The different artists also make the album unique. I  especially like the song &#34;Lay Me Down&#34; .The vocals are amazing in that song. I completely enjoyed this album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy right now!!! After all this time finally  the real, &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot; is here! Love it!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King seems to know his readers even better than they know themselves. He has managed to catch up with them with this novel, introducing Daniel Torrance as a now grown man. The novel ties everything in a perfect circle, allowing the reader to feel compelled to keep on reading. Great horror and great plot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this Kindle App! Really enjoy spending my lunch break pinning instead of running all over town spending money ans killing time. i've been hooked on Pinterest for quite awhile and using my Kindle makes it that much more fun. Must have for Kindle if you enjoy Pinterest!
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|If you liked the first one, you will really enjoy this one.  Those who are not &#34;Trekkies&#34; even enjoyed this movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once you read the first paragraph it is hard to put this book down. Doctor Sleep weaves a story that captures his constant readers' attention. If you ever wondered what ever happened to Danny Torrance read this book.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Eddie Vedder continues to pay homage to the Ramones in songs like &#34;Mind your manners&#34;. It appears that this group played their butts off and I think they quoted this in the making of this album video found on their website (which i saw afterwards).<br /><br />I love this album very much and would highly recommend. A nice blend of grungy and slower songs too without the songs sounding the same as their previous efforts.
1401937519|5.0|This book was life changing for me. I felt so peaceful after reading it.  I was able to let go of some grief I had about my parents death and it helped to inspire me to honor and love myself more.  I have heard and read other accounts of near death but feel that Anita has a much deeper understanding from her experience and is able to share that profound experience in a way that is easily understood.  I gave copies of this book to friends and they liked it too.
B0019LZV4E|5.0|my best friend is in this movie so I decided to finally watch it. I would have to say I love this film. not just because he is in it. it is just the right amount of terror but it has it funny moments to. also if you like getting songs stuck in your head watch it. trust me I still am sinning most of the songs.lol
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Some of the puzzles are really easy, but it is still fun. It would be nice if you earned coins a little faster. All things considered not bad for a free game.
B00DVT54RQ|5.0|I've had the CD since it came out and saw their final full tour supporting this album.  It's Faith No More, so throw your preconceptions out the window.  I think this would've been an excellent follow up to Angel Dust, it hops genres, rocks out, and has some really beautiful moments. But go read the CD review if you want to know more about the album itself.  I don't have a waveform analyzer, and I can't tell you what it rates on the loudness wars meter, I just have two ears and a heart.  This record sounds fantastic.  The Mr. Bungle &#34;Plain Records&#34; re-releases sound flat, like they were just ripped from a CD and pressed as cheaply as possible.  I wasn't expecting much, just cool to own AOTY without paying $300-400 for a UK pressing.  This is SO worth it.  Dynamic, bass is thumping, drums and snare ATTACK and are crisp as hell, the guitars ring out and Patton's voice is perfect ni the mix.  This sounds mastered for an analog format.  Have no doubts on purchasing this one - worth every penny!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy candy crush is finally on kindle! It works great most of the time it started lagging a little bit but that was actually beneficial because I had to allow down and actually think about what I was doing!
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I gave this as a birthday gift to a lefty.  He loves the watch. It is big.  Impressive looking. Nice.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is where it started.  I had seen the movie but never read the book, which is unusual as I have read many Steven King books. I purchased this to get the 'real' story before I read Steven Kings new book Doctor Sleep.  I am almost finished and will then start on Doctor Sleep. Few, if any authors compare to Steven Kings consistent character and plot genius.
B00DB2JQ7W|3.0|Didn't like the style of guitar playing in this album as much as I have in past CD's. I am sure this style will be well received just not mine.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. The acting is incredible and the plot just pulls you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|No spoilers, but the end of this first episode laft me dying to see the next weeks episode. Very interested in seeing how this season unfolds. We don't subsribe to a cable package that offers AMC so I am very, very glad that we can watch it on our TV via Amazon online streaming.
1401307787|5.0|I bought this book as additional reading for a class I was taking on stress management. While the title of the book seems like a no-brainer, this book really shows you how to be present in the world, how not to get caught up with technology and stress. A must read for anyone looking to increase their awareness of self and of their personal environment.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Usually run right through a SK novel but not this one. For some reason cannot really relate to the character and his folly. Sorry Steve but this one has me stuck in a snow maze.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Beautifully written story that takes place in the past and present, skillfully woven by Baker Kline. An unlikely friendship develops between a goth girl and elderly woman. Would appeal to an older set and teens as well. The kind of story you read slowly and savor. I might never have discovered it if it hadn't been for Amazon's $1.99 sale and email and I'm very glad I did.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love the way this was written. the reader is able to achieve a better understanding of how the undead rising could affect different cultures, countries, generations. I would recommend this to all of my friends.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|I wasn't sure what I was going to think of this album. It was oddly relaxing- perfect for my long car rides (hour commute to and from work). Her voice is very soothing and I love the style.
B006YZHEB8|5.0|This movie is the most amazing Christian movie that we have seen!  Our family watched this on family movie night and had laughs and tears all the way through...
B008JFUR10|5.0|Pacific Rim is a great, fun film. Honestly in theaters I thought it was merely ok. But with viewings on bluray, I've come to love it. I find the fight sequences to be much clearer on bluray. It's not the most original story, but it works great to support the action. Also, if you know anyone who still watches DVDs instead of Blurays, this is the film to show them what their missing. What a beautiful picture it is. And the sound is incredible. If your a fan of director commentaries, this has one of the best I've ever listened to. Made me love the film even more. Highly recommended.
B000SC245E|5.0|Our company does not order lots of desktop ink cartridges but it is still nice to save money when we do need a replacement.
B0085A9J18|4.0|The fight scenes were some of the best I've ever watched. The emotion put into a few grim scenes was enough to make me sad when someone died.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Skip this and rewatch hangover 1. This movie had no quotability (highly important to comedies!) and really just seemed to reuse crap from the first movie but nowhere near as well.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I LOVE this CD. Adele is amazing and I always enjoy her music. It makes for really nice dinner background music as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It will be a movie soon so u should read before the movie comes out! The book was so good I finished it in 2 days. Plot twists unlike anything I've read or seen on tv before. Very refreshing writing
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very good movie ... good acting / plot, etc. Interesting moral dilemma. I would recommend this movie. My husband really enjoyed it also.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Fun, busy and entertaining movie. If u have watched any of Baz Luhrman's previous movies like Moulin Rouge or Romeo & Juliet, this fits right in with his style of movie making. Not to mention tons of great celebs!
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Good little book ... has a some good points. I will probably read it again in a few months. I would recommend it.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Soooo good! Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time reading it. Finished it in just a few days I just couldn't put it down. Some gory details but nothing u wouldn't see on a cop drama.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I'm not really in to Bond movies so I won't say one way or another ... but my husband enjoyed it. It was worth the rental price.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Horrible. Boring, poor plot. I'd rather watch reruns of the Walking Dead on Netflix for some really good zompocalypse action.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I heard the song &#34;kids&#34; at the end of a movie, i think it was &#34; the kids are all right&#34;, and at first I was like, &#34;who is this?&#34; because it definitely had a retro (80s) electronic groove, and so I put MGMT on my pandora station, and I really enjoyed the songs...it was kind of like what if Beck and Wayne Coyne had a love child but with deceptively simple yet incredibly catchy tunes.  I ordered Oracular off of amazon and have just about played it to death in my car.  I don't know how I never heard of this album before, but I'm glad I had the chance to discover it.  it vacillates between deep and silliness, and it's just great music that for me is hard to define, but very enjoyable
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this. So much fun and best of all it is free. Definitely glad I downloaded. Only problem I had was downloading it from Amazons app
B00DMEQP46|1.0|After discovering this band this year between hearing the song &#34;Kids&#34; in a movie and then growing to really dig them through Pandora, I said to myself, &#34;self, this album should rock&#34;.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It doesn't even sound like the same band.  It is really pedestrian and just about unlistenable.  there are no hooks, no nothing.  I didn't look to see if it had the same producer or not, but it was definitely a huge let down.  I barely got through the first playthrough of the album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yessss! It's finally on Kindle Fire yay I have been waiting for the longest been playing it on my phone now I can play it on my Kindle Fire yes I lovvvveeee Candy Crush thanks to the developers and others involved in making Candy Crush it's great and addictive
B00594XOZU|4.0|I enjoyed how fast the holder was shipped to me and the condition it was in. I just didnt expect it to be so white., I do like it, it will take some time to get use to the color.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|loved this app played it on Facebook and loved it and was so glade thar Amazon had come out with the game
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like playing Spider Solitaire online. It is very user friendly and fun to play. Some solitaire games are way too complicated...this is just fun.
034580404X|4.0|Boxed set was in perfect shape.  Pages in very readable paper and print.  No gloss or glare.  Very good quality manufacturing.  Very good price for set.  Received one day earlier than promised.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. So happy with it. The game works well with the kindle fire hd. The graphics are great. So far no problems.
B0013TXA5Y|1.0|I have never seen a more whiny, weak and annoying main character than Clary...she's even worse than the chick from twilight.
B00EZZ77ZM|4.0|This is another great CD to listen to while you are hanging out Sunday afternoon with a drink in your hand.  I am a huge fan and own all of the other CD's this isn't my favorite but I'm sure listening to it more it will begin to grow on me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was one of his best yet. I enjoyed reading the continuing story of Danny. He was so young in the Shining, you can't help but wonder what became of him and Stephen King does not disappoint. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is one of my favorite games! You have to know your emojis thoight, but other than that it is so cool!
B000023VR6|5.0|I owned this album when it first came out.  One day, all of my cds and stereo system in my car were stolen.  I had forgotten about this cd for about ten years.  I forgot how amazing this cd is.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great show, well written and acted. Only issue I have is the seasons are only 3 episodes long.  MORE EPISODES
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This cd is fab i can't stop playing it , its got so many different styles of music you just can't get bored . i love the fake radio station 2 that always add a little fun to the listening xperiance.<br /><br />I give this cd 5 stars the cd was well though out and arrange perfectley......
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Such an engrossing and whimsical story. Fantastic to read and really speaks to the heart. A story that lives in your dreams
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Diana Gabaldon continues to make you want to spend more time with Claire and Jamie. My favourite  book from my favourite series!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This program has allowed me to use things that I had downloaded before when I had a Kindle. So my present table is a lot more versatile than it used to be.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|I never read this book when I was young and I wouldn't have appreciated it as I do now. The text was somewhat expansive but the theme was tender.
0786956291|5.0|This man is amazing. I bought the product as a gift to my son, who wanted to play. He sent everything expected, and even a lot more. I would give him 10 stars if I could.
B0000646UN|5.0|I was a 10-year old girl when Russia attacked Finland il 1939. sInce my mother and the fourr youngest chodren evacuated to a remote village I didn't enperience, first hand, any horrors of war, except Russian bombers rumbling, flying low, over our village to bomb the cities on the west coasi. My oldest brother was fighting on the frontt lines as a messenger, on skis  but never said a word about hid experiences. This movie opens, for me, a window to  soldierrs' experiences at that unforgettable  time, fightingt against impossible odds , ironically mainly forgotten by most if the world. I recommens this movie to anybidy interested in WW II, and as alessom in not giving up .
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I've been a huge Neil Gaiman fan for a long time - Neverwhere is still probably my favorite book - but this was probably my least favorite of his works.  The story didn't feel as cohesive or well realized as most of his other stories.  The narration also felt a little strange to me, perhaps because the story is told through the eyes of an elementary-school aged boy - while I appreciate the difficulty of writing from such a young perspective, it was simply difficult to relate to such a naive voice.<br /><br />I later found out that this book originally started as a short story which Gaiman then decided to extend into a novella, and it certainly had the feel of a short story to me.  I still enjoyed reading it, and still thought that there were a lot of nice aspects to the story, but I was hoping to love it like I did Neverwhere or American Gods, and I just didn't.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The book was okay.  Expected it to be a lot scarier coming from Stephen King although it started out scary.  Normally his books disturbs me to the point that I can't sleep at night or in  a room alone.  It was very entertaining though.  Maybe if I see it in movie form it would scare me as he usually does.  Can't wait to read the next one.  Stephen King is one of the greatest authors ever!!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Destined to become a classic. George Orwell style.  Highly recommend for teen readers. Much better than new classic vampire love stories.
B000I3SYEI|4.0|But it was better 20 years ago. I suppose we all get a bit jaded, especially in relation to movies. Or better stated, we get used to a higher form of art, if you will. Better special effects. Better dialogue. I hadn't remembered how stilted the dialogue was in this. More of a space opera than sic-fi adventure. I couldn't help but laugh at Khan's goons. They looked like hippies play-acting as gypsies.<br /><br />All in all a bit of a farce when compared to more modern, and better written, movies. But, aside from the one episode in the series,  this is where Khan started. And after watching the new Star Trek Into Darkness, I like what he became.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Game is fun to play as Bingo always is but voice calling the numbers is very loud and so far I can't find a way to turn it down.  This is the second game with loud music or speech so maybe it is the norm but I find it annoying.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Another 3D movie I bought to entertain the kids who visit so it leaves adults along.  Yeah, I know, not the best babysitter, but it works.  Great movie in 3D
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My all most three year old son loves this, he plays it for hours or untill my phone go's dead. Now it needs more leavels or up grads.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Bought a 3D TV, so had to have a movie or two.  Love the 3D, love the movie, and good for kids when they come to visit to get them out of adults hair.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|It was a Very cute movie! I definitely think its a family type of movie and the kids will love it!
B00B7FXZQS|5.0|Starts off a little slow but kept us on edge. Didn't see the previous ones so didn't know what to expect.
B00EUM6WI8|5.0|In an interview Mark Knopfler once said in his characteristic low-key, self-effacing style, that he had 'been lucky' with some of his songs. I had to laugh a little bit at that one. He no doubt has a musical gift, but he has been working at it for fifty + years, so it's not accidental. Sometimes when people are amazed by a fantastic musician or great athlete, they say, \\"I'd give my life to be able to do that.\\" Well, that is exactly what Mark has done! He's been writing and playing at the highest level for more than thirty years. I recall the great Bonnie Raitt being nervous before a show, because Mark Knopfler was in the audience; mind you, this was just after Sultans had hit the airwaves. She could instantly tell that this was a musician with prodigious talent, and she was in awe of him. Of course, all it took was one listen to those flying fingers dancing over those strings....look ma, no pick! Who needs a pick anyway, that'd just slow him down!<br /><br />I've been in awe of him for that long as well. There are many qualities that make him such a special artist. One of the most noteworthy to me is that he is first and foremost a serious musician, who has mastered his instruments. I say \\"instruments\\" with the plural because he doesn't just play the Fender Strat, but just about any kind of guitar you can imagine, most notably the classical acoustic and National Steel. Every album he's ever done features his virtuosity on all of these various 'axes'. He possesses such incredible skill that he can literally play any type of music you can think of, and this is demonstrated on each of the two \\"Privateering\\" disks. Honestly, one would find it difficult to identify another guitarist, living or dead, who could approach Mark in terms of versatility and overall excellence in so many kinds of guitar and so many different types of music: folk, Celtic, love songs, ballads, blues, rockabilly, country, rock, lush instrumentals, film scores,...you name it. These people just don't exist.<br /><br />But then we have those songs. I am continually amazed by the intelligence and sophistication in Mark's lyrics. He is a storyteller of the highest calibre. His songs are transcendent in that they take us to another time and place, they open up new worlds to us, and they are able to evoke every possible human emotion. All beautifully crafted and tasteful, by turns rocking, melancholy, uplifting, insightful, bitingly cynical, ironic, hilarious, introspective, fun.<br /><br />This is, to my knowledge, the first double disk studio album that Mark has released. Everything that is mentioned in the paragraph above has been accomplished here. I will be the first to admit that I lack objectivity when it comes to MK. I have always felt that he is one of the greatest guitarists and songwriters who ever lived, and I will eagerly look forward to anything he releases, and will probably rate all of it very highly....at least, that is what's always happened thus far! The fact that it's a double album makes it twice as good.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into this song-by-song, others have done it well already. I'll just say that if you are a MK fan, this album will make you even more of a MK fan! I am a harmonica player, and a (would-be) guitar player, and one huge plus for me on this album is the inclusion of the great harpman, Kim Wilson, formerly of the Fabulous Thunderbirds. It was a stroke of genius to add Kim, and there is more harmonica on this record than on any of the other MK or Dire Straits releases. Kim plays acoustic on Miss You Blues, heavy Chicago-style amped harp on fully FIVE numbers (Don't Forget Your Hat, Hot or What, Got to Have Something (a scintillating fast blues), I Used to Could, and Today is Okay), and plays a beautifully tasteful chromatic harp on Bluebird.<br /><br />Mark does not rely upon gimmickry or tricks or stunts or make-up or costumes in his performances and in his music. That in itself ensures that he will probably not be \\"making movies or be on color TV's.\\" He follows the philosophy of the late, great slide player Duane Allman, who once said, \\"This ain't no fashion show.\\" MK was put on this earth to create beautiful, timeless, mature music for adults. His playing is so enthralling to guitarists because, well, yes, he has incredible talent and facility, and yes, he is so innovative and has such a unique style, but also because he actually 'plays humbly', in that he subliminates the guitar, turns down his volume knob, and thus allows the other musicians to come forward, which strengthens the entire band. A lesser, more insecure or immature player would be more 'flash' and want to be more dominant. But MK is always thinking about the totality of the sound, and he emphasizes the white moments of silence, the sound between the notes, which does so much to make music better.<br /><br />To me, just another brilliant album in a long line of brilliant albums.ing movies or be on color TV's.\\" He follows the philosophy of the late, great slide player Duane Allman, who once said, \\"This ain't no fashion show.\\" MK was put on this earth to create beautiful, timeless, mature music for adults.

B00FPH6M82|2.0|If you are a big fan of Will Smith, or a kid, you will probably overlook the poor acting, inconsistent storyline, and overuse of CGI.  It was like watching a poorly designed video game.
B000YDE4HS|3.0|Consider the size of this boot to be a tad bit too large. But wonderful color and style. You may have to send them back.
B00EQ30RVY|2.0|I listened to samples and that is enough. I would never purchase this Cd. In my opinion the Stone temple Pilots died with Scott getting booted. Not that he did not deserve it, most likely he did. However just aint the same, not even close. I am now going to purchase STP's DVD. RIP STP, you were a great band!!
B007N8RULO|5.0|It has taken me a few days to adjust to the strategy involved, however my grandkids took to it like a duck to water! I am having a very fun time with it and recommend it to my older friends for their brain exercise.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought the story was great.  Very thought provoking and disturbing.  I did not like the ending.  I wanted to know the truth.  I do not like to leave story endings to my own imagination!!
B008JFUS28|5.0|This is about family allegiances and rivalry. What makes the film fly off the screen are the performances of the superb cast. As Tom Hiddleston (Loki) states, \\"Your job as an actor is to find a way of being truthful in those particular circumstances. After that it is simple\\" (NYT 11/10/13, Arts & Leisure:18-19). Hiddleston graduated from Cambridge with honors in Greek and Latin; he and the rest of the \\"Thor\\" ensemble bring sharp intelligence to their roles, carrying the genre to another level. After [[ASIN:B005H9B44A Thor]] and [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Marvel's The Avengers]], this rollicking, intense sequel, by director Alan Taylor ([[ASIN:B007HPO3CC Game of Thrones]]), is even more visually stunning, with extensive filming in Iceland (largest film project so far). Iceland's starkly beautiful landscape, with its mountains and waterfalls,  creates an even more authentic Viking landscape. There are also great historic locals in the U.K. incorporated into this feast for the eyes. Does the film accomplish what it sets out to? Yes! Screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely (writers of the upcoming film \\"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\\"), and Christopher Yost, accurately mine classic Marvel story arcs, [[ASIN:0141000031 The Sagas of Icelanders]], and Snorri Sturluson's [[ASIN:0520012321 Tales from Norse Mythology]] to add depth to the wide cast of characters.<br /><br />During Thor's (Chris Hemsworth inhabits his character) adventures saving the earth from his evil brother Loki (Hiddleston) in [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Marvel's The Avengers]], he neglected to find his love, astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, always classy). Under the protection of S.H.E.I.L.D., she has been lonely and lost. Now, a year later, Thor is Crown Prince of Asgard. He finds an angry Jane and transports her to Asgard. But is his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) happy about this? NO! Meanwhile, scientist Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård, one of the best), Jane's colleague and mentor, isn't doing too well. In the first [[ASIN:B0034G4P80 Thor]], he scoffed at Thor's claim that the old stories Erik grew up with are actually true... Now, in \\"Thor: The Dark World,\\" Dr. Selvig is messed-up from having had Loki control his mind during [[ASIN:B0083SBJXS Marvel's The Avengers]].<br /><br />Thankfully, there is a lot more plot involving Heimdall (Idris Elba), the Asgardian sentry of the Bifr&ouml;st Bridge (in Norse mythology this means \\"burning rainbow\\"). The Bifr&ouml;st Bridge connects the Nine Realms, one of which is earth, or Midgard. And there is more of Frigga (Rene Russo), Queen of Asgard, as she attempts to understand and guide her stepson Loki. Having been beaten and bashed by The Hulk in \\"The Avengers,\\" Loki is now pushed into an alliance with his brother Thor, as they are forced to battle a common enemy together.<br /><br />In conflict with Odin, Thor must fight to save the Nine Realms from Malekith the Accursed (Christopher Eccleston, of [[ASIN:B000E41MS6 Doctor Who]], the ruler of the Dark Elves of another of the Nine Realms, Svartalfheim. In revenge for the loss of his family, Malekith the Accursed works with his trusted lieutenant, Algrim the Strong (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).

B00F35B8F8|5.0|I've seen all except one several times each.  That single not-quite-a-flop was the only one that didn't bring me back.  This one is worth seeing many more times.......
B003V5CFV8|1.0|I was all excited to watch this with my companion, who has never seen this before, only to discover that I could not mirror it to the tv..... I use my iPad so....
B003U4UPHG|5.0|It's a great show that keeps you guessing. I can't wait to watch season 3 me and the kids are hooked.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I do not know where to get support so hopefully someone at amazon will read.  I recently purchased a technical book with equations.  They appear properly on my kindle.  I mostly now use my Galaxy S4.  In that you CANNOT read the equations.  They are TOO SMALL.  The only hope is to highlight them and then select magnify.  This is VERY irritating.  The regular text is fine but the equation text is WAY WAY WAY too small
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book. I hope she continues writing more from the same story. I do not want to see the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is really fantastic . Very easy to use. The installation was very easy ,there was not any problem in installation . I have bought it directly from amazon. The shipment was fast .
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I loved this game.  It is very addictive and I had to keep going and moving forward.  It took time away from other things that I had to do.  I loved this game though
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After seeing so many imitations it's finally good to see the real thing available for the Kindle. Next time Amazon don't make us wait so long.<br /><br />The game play and graphics are great.<br /><br />Hint: When Candy Crush Saga 2 comes out make it available asap.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|How was I supposed to know would only work with a specific kink-brand of games? I thought it was a control for everything. Absolutely disappointing.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This is a great album and the Vince Gill and Paul Franklin are amazing artists.  I have purchased this twice already because anytime someone hears it they have to have it!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great book, sucks you into the story and hard to put down. I read most of this in one night , I could not go to sleep I was so enthralled. Its hard to say a lot about the first book because you give it away but basically this main character is a secret service agent who wakes up in this small town and has little memory of who he is. He tried to figure this out while dealing with the strange characters he meets. Eventually you discover the secret of the town and it changes everything. I would read this book for sure first before the second book, Wayward. I cannot wait for the others in this series to come out so I can find out what happens. I have my theories of what will occur but you never know with these books, they are surprising!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Quick Delivery....Happy buyer......A 1 Seller  Loved this music....can't stop listening to the great music...This was a very smooth transaction....I will look to purchase from these people again....as they are totally professional.....
B006IGZWB2|4.0|When you're talking about the American South in the early 60's you know you're gonna come across the subject of segregation and outright racism.  This story though shows us that not all white folk were apathetic to the plight of blacks and the comedic parts were good ones too.
B005LAIIGW|3.0|I realize that my review will go against the general consensus on this movie. I had wanted to see it since the first trailer. I had high hopes for it. In some ways, I was not disappointed; however, in the ways that matter most to me--the ways that make a movie a frequently visited enjoyment--it fell short.<br /><br />Let me start with what I think was good about the movie. And where this movie was good, it was great.<br /><br />VISUALS<br />The look and feel of this movie are simply stunning. As a general lover of anything set in space, I feel like Gravity is unparalleled in its presentation of both the gorgeousness of seeing Earth from space and the horror of being at the mercy of things gone awry up there.<br /><br />SCORE<br />The music just felt perfect, both geographically (I hope that's still the right word when we're talking about space) and situationally. I'm not sure I have much else I can say having only experienced the film once.<br /><br />ACTING<br />I think I expected a good performance from Clooney (even though I couldn't help picturing a fox in a space suit the whole time). Where I was beforehand uncertain, but happily assured during the film, was with Sandra Bullock's performance. I thought she did a wonderful job, and her character was very believable. For someone who earned much of her showbiz money playing stereotyped female characters (even when she was supposedly playing someone strong), she showed here that she can play the lead role in a movie that is trying to talk about something big and meaningful. Which, unfortunately, is as good a segue as I can make into the next part of my review...<br /><br />Before I go on, let me say that I understand that there are folks who will disagree with me on what I'm about to say. They may take it well, or they may say that I'm incapable of grasping how artfully the film succeeded where I accuse it of failure. Well and good--maybe I am incapable, or maybe there is less potential for objectivity in art thanwe like, and some of us are going to respond less enthusiastically about something that has great meaning for others. Such is life. Do try to be respectful :-)<br /><br />My only real problem with the film is unfortunately a big one. Gravity attempts to go big--to be about more than its amazing visuals and A-listers. We are meant to feel for Bullock's character, and to care about her experiences in space because of her experiences on Earth. For me, I was never given enough of her as a character to feel anything more than a common distress with her as I watched her go through her present troubles during the movie. It's tricky, and I'm not claiming that I could solve the problem better than the writers, director, or anyone else involved in constructing this thing, but I just feel like I needed to get more of her as a character to care about her, and to feel like I care about her victory at the end. And so for me, the film ultimately fell flat, because, at the risk of sounding cliched, I don't think it earned the emotion that its ending demands.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|Fantasy lovers unite! This book was a great read. Everything that I love about this genre is in this book.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|A typical all American action movie, with an extremely trivial premise and predictable execution. Not bad for a lazy weekend afternoon watch.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan and bought this novel the first day it was released.  This book held my attention the entire time and would have read it cover to cover if I had no need for sleep but alas I had to give in.  I still finished the book within a week and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I heard a movie of this is supposed to be coming out I just hope they can do it justice.
B00622B3MY|1.0|Absolutely should NOT be rated G. Just because the characters are cars does not justify portrayal of massive weaponry, torture, and assassination. Just plain not OK. FAIL
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The device works great and was fairly easy to set up. I am very disappointed that I cannot use with Amazon Prime instant videos.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Has awesome features like mine car and new characters. GET THIS GAME. ALSO GET THE OTHER ONES LIKE BRAVE AND OZ.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Yet another mystery as to what happened to it. Oh well, I can live without it. No experience to share. Maybe it's in the mail.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Everything they say about the series is true, great series.  wish it followed the books more--the first is very close, but the next two take the next three books and slam them together.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great product. It works very well , very easy to set up . For the price , it definitely worth it
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Seems a number of folks don't like this novel.  It isn't one of Child/Grant's best, but what's not to like?  Reacher clobbers a fair number of folks.  Little hints are dropped along the way that allow one to match wits with Reacher.  There's an interesting woman involved.  Yeah, there's a little bleeding heart leftish politics. It may even seem a little out of character for Reacher. But it's a novel. It's fiction.  After writing more than a dozen novels, Child/Grant was very slightly off his game.  No big deal.  I enjoyed it much.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Literally one of the best books I have ever read. Both funny and touching. I couldn't put it down once I started reading.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|After Sherlock I was looking for something else to watch.  Dad used to watch Dr. Who on PBS when I was a kid and I didn't 'get it' back then.  But this season gave enough background and good flow and timeline.  Last episode helps bridge the gap to past and future episodes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the first time I have ever seen a game this great. It is the best game ever played!
B00CLT31D6|4.0|The information in the book is dated, but it was enlightening as it gave information on how people do or don't spend their money.
B000WKT6C6|5.0|JJ Cale passed away this year, and sadly, I did not discover him until his death.  Little did I know that he was the heart and soul behind some of my favorite songs - 'They call me the Breeze', 'Cocaine', etc....<br /><br />If you don't know JJ Cale, meet him now!  This is a great starter record!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great movie for kids. Keep advertisements  off the screen please, especially if I paid for the movie. If you were giving movie away for free I could understand but not if I paid for it.
B000053ZRR|5.0|I simply love it!!! I will watch this DVD everytime I have a chance.  Gosh I wish to see them play live...sighs...
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Best movie ever, nothing beats a story that connects to your inner child that wants you to believe in fairies.
B001E6X4W0|4.0|I know that it is in style right now to not like tom cruise but I do enjoy his movies, however I didnt like his character in this move and I didnt like the male companion/closeness, a little embarrassing when you think their about to kiss. Other than that every one else did a really good job. And the movie was very enjoyable.
B00EY7LT9Q|1.0|due to undisclosed technical difficulties, i cannot watch this program because it won't download to my tivo. amazon claimed this problem  would resolve in 2-3 days, but it has not.
B008EL25LE|2.0|Worked great first time using it  came back to it later and could not open it.  I got a white screen.  Will be removing it from my device.  Game seemed fun too bad about the white screen issue.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Every page held my interest, was in my mind when I wasn't reading it, easy to read and I didn't want it to end.
B004B5W27Y|5.0|Even though it's autumn, with people and nature preparing themselves for winter, this album always keeps the spirit of that transition period alive for me. I can only think of one other album that has had such a profound impact on me and that was Radiohead's Kid A album. I don't want to categorize this band into any particular genre as they generate a multitude of emotions with every track on this album. Some songs are haunting and give me goosebumps while others remind me of my childhood and bring me back to a time I can only hope to relive when I have children.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I was hooked from the first book and became a fan! Cannot wait for the next release. I couldn't put down my kindle//I went to book after book after book. This has to be one of my faves so far..I hope this will be a long series of books!
B000W1YYRC|5.0|Much better than the Celtic Monks, or whale songs that people tend to buy for ambiance. This CD will bring you down emotionally as well as bring you back up.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I honestly love this game! You think it, you create it! realistic or nonrealistic, you can do free play or play the challenges. Definitely worth the dollar!
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|My Granddaughter LOVES this puzzle.  Great for a 2 year old.  Keeps her busy and occupied.  Easy for her to operate herself
B00DONJXE4|4.0|Joe Cocker \\"Fire It Up Live\\", made it's debut at #5 on the German charts this past week, which is no surprise as the European audiences continue to recognize the iconic status of one of rocks greatest performers.  This newly released live cd is currently only available as an import, as is customary with most of Cocker's more recent releases, as the record company holds back and delay's release in the U.S., until Joe returns to tour the states.  Having said that, what we have here is a stunning live performance by the 69 year old Cocker.  Eight of the twenty-one cuts are from his new studio cd \\"Fire it Up\\".  Most of these songs actually work well here.  Joe Cocker's voice has changed over the years, and yet he has adapted and improvised the arrangements of some of those classic tunes, that keep intact that vocal grit and intensity, that he can still deliver, as evident in his rendition of \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\", which sends goose bumps down your spine, as Cocker is in complete overdrive during the final two minutes of the song.  His new songs are evenly spread throughout the cd among some of his classics.  Some highlights from his new cd, are his live takes on \\"I'll Be Your Doctor\\", \\"I Come In Peace\\", and of course the rocking \\"Fire it Up\\".  \\"Come Together\\", his magnificent cover of the classic Beatles tune has become a staple during his live performances as of late.  The only thing I was a little disappointing to me was the final tune, the ballad \\"You Don't Know What Your're Doing To Me\\", which comes off as a little bit of a let down, which ended the show after the rollicking \\"Cry Me A River\\", which probably had the audience on its feet.  As usual, Joe Cocker's band is tight as ever and well rehearsed.  Nick Milo Keyboards, Jack Bruno Drums, Gene Black guitar, and Oneida James Rebeccu bass, have been with Joe for over a decade or more now. New guy on the block, Herman Jackson is on Hammond B3, Norberto Fimpel is on sax, and percussion, and Nichelle Tillman and Laura Jones are on backing vocals.  I don't know how much longer Joe is going to be performing before a live audience, but if this is going to be his final live cd, then Joe is going out on top, in front of an audience who adores him, leaving this unbelievable recorded document of an aging classic rocker who can still deliver the goods, and sing with an intensity and grit, that few rock singers past or present can match. This release does not disappoint, and is highly recommended to any fans of classic rock.  There is a companion DVD as well, but keep in mind, that European DVD's are PAL format, and will not play on North American DVD players, so you may want to wait for the domestic release on that one.  If Joe Cocker deserved one acclaim that has eluded him, it is induction into the RRHOF.  In my book Joe Cocker is a Rock N Roll Hall Of Famer!  Who would have thought that almost 45 years after Woodstock,  Joe Cocker would still be selling platinum and gold records worldwide at nearly 70 years old.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is awesome. The set up was quick and easy, it took me longer to open the package than to start broadcasting on my TV.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My son is 19 months old and he loves this movie, it is such a cute story!  I think he will enjoy it even as he gets older.  I have ordered Gruffalo party supplies and I can't wait to see his face light up!
B00000JLWW|5.0|Just finished this awesome movie in amazing quality, and am very well pleased.<br /><br />Titanic is a 1997 American epic romantic disaster film directed, written, co-produced, co-edited and partly financed by James Cameron. A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.<br /><br />Cameron's inspiration for the film was predicated on his fascination with shipwrecks; he wanted to convey the emotional message of the tragedy and felt that a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to achieving this. Production on the film began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. A reconstruction of the Titanic was built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California, scale models, and computer-generated imagery were used to recreate the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox, and, at the time, was the most expensive film ever made, with an estimated budget of $200 million.<br /><br />Upon its release on December 19, 1997, the film achieved critical and commercial success. Nominated for fourteen Academy Awards, it won eleven, including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director, tying Ben Hur (1959) for most Oscars won by a single film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, it was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It remained the highest-grossing film of all time, until Cameron's 2009 film Avatar surpassed its gross in 2010. A 3D version of the film, released on April 4, 2012 (often billed as Titanic 3D) to commemorate the centenary of the sinking of the ship, earned it an additional $343.6 million worldwide, pushing Titanic's worldwide total to $2.18 billion. It became the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide.<br /><br />This DVD is a \\"must-have\\" for any true movie collector.ilm to gross more than $2 billion worldwide.<br /><br />This DVD is a \\"must-have\\" for any true movie collector.
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|AMAZING! This college guy can now cook fantastic French food in his apartment and you will too if you buy this book. Thanks Julia!
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|This book is the most freshest, original and hilariously honest reads I've had in a long time.  If you enjoyed &#34;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime&#34; by Mark Haddon you'll love this.  More than once I found myself nodding in complete agreement with Don's succinct understanding of life and way of problem solving.
0375842209|5.0|Excellent book. A must read for high schoolers and adults. Great price for my students and free shopping was easy on a teacher's budget. Will always check Amazon before buying in numbers.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|I don't know why I thought I could use this app for my android tablet, but it is useless to me and I uninstalled in PDQ.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Makes planning for my day and outdoor activities easy.  I like that I can track different locations. Try it you will like it
B007NZQU72|4.0|It's nice to finally find out why I have always shied away from public events, and why I feel things so intensely.  I have been learning the ways to deal with being a 'highly sensitive person' from the book and I hope to someday be able to go into social events without the accompanying anxiety that I so often have felt in such situations.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I finally started reading it. It was recommended to me by a friend, and I would recommend it to anyone who asks me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game and was so happy they got it on my kindle was playing it on my phone and this is so much better thank you candy crush
B00EP0KBXM|3.0|The film had very good special effects, but the plot (if it has one) was quite hard to follow. I would have to watch it several more times to really get a feel for the story. As far as I'm concerned, the main story should be present within the first twenty minutes or so. Acting was okay but not great, and they need to hire a new screenwriter. BAD dialogue. Never given a film a bad review before, but this one deserves it. Screenwriters, try again next year!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think this app is amazing. I've been addicted to pinterest and I think it is amazing. Try it :) you should
B00340ESIS|4.0|I would have given this book five stars if Blake had covered independent filmmaking more. I'm not into writing for Big Hollywood personally, and most of the writers I know or Indie as well. I'd have enjoyed seeing a couple of chapters covering Indie writing and producing. Other than that omission, GREAT book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a great book but kind of sad I loved it.<br /><br />It had a great ending. I would recommend this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King makes it so you can almost smell the shit in Grandpa's pants. As good as The Shining, and that is saying something.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on the kindle! Now I don't have to download from the web and then onto my kindle. It's perfect! Thank you!!!
B00006AG5N|5.0|NEVER CARED FOR ELVIS AS A KID BUT ENJOY HIS MUSIC NOW THAT I AM OLDER.ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND IN GOOD CONDITION
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|Loved it just as my son did who is in the army.<br />He too had been deployed, so I was crying at the end. Great read
B0089LOG02|5.0|Nice parallel of today's system of care for children and what happened in the last century. Bittersweet ending, didn't want it to end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although I cleaned my tear ducts on this one I would recommend this book to all readers young and old.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an amazing game I've heard of it and have been wanting to play it but it wasn't on kindle an  now it is !!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I read the sample of this book and was hooked. The story unfolds at a pace that keeps you entertained as well as intrigued. We imagine our lives in the future but don't really ever think about how choices we make in the past shape us as well as others.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|need more levels so I can continue with my new obsession. this game is challenging without being too terribly hard to figure out!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Super great game, no wonder it is number 1. Can`t wait for more regions and weapons. Love it that you can shoot a Jack rabbit`s ears off at 500 yards for a couple bucks.
0374214913|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book even though I mostly steer clear of modern literature. It had a lot of interest and humor and was all around a good light read.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I use this in Hotels when I travel and it's great.  I can get full HD/Big screen movies and TV where ever I am.<br /><br />Setup was a bit tricky the first time but mostly had to do with the need to connect the source device (tablet) with the Chromecast on the same wifi network.  Once both devices are there, no problems.<br /><br />For the cost, size and function this device can't be beat.
0061478784|5.0|Very entertaining and engaging. It's a good enough book to read it more than once and brings a lot more sense than the movie does. I still love the movie, but the detail and story in the book are much better.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|not as good as some of his best, but a good one.  I would give it a 7 on the King-o-meter.  The Stand and 11/22/63 being 10's, Duma Key being an 8, Tommyknockers and Under the Dome being 3's.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|Ellen Greene's voice is a bit of an acquired taste. It can make or break the movie for you.  Great cameos and a stellar performance by Steve Martin!
B004GYY714|2.0|many of my favorite stations are not available, i do not use very much, i like ihart better. good day.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Very intriguing.  I thought I would hate it but I was dragged in by my wife and ended up loving it.  The wife of the president is the hardest to believe character in my opinion.  Otherwise I would give it 5 stars
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Very nice follow up from avengers.  Even good after the credits roll.  Hope to see a number four in the future.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Dr. Sleep revolves around the traditional cast of King characters; the good, the bad, the ugly!  While the good folks are very good and have learned how to cope with their demons, the bad / ugly are a bit too predictable and too easily duped to be authentic King characters.<br />However, as a perennial reader of All Things King... Maybe I was looking for too much in the after-read reflection that usually has me wondering, &#34;who thinks of things like this?&#34;
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this second book almost better than the original. It's full of action and will keep you up late reading.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game... It makes my day go much quicker. Fast paced and keeps the mind alert. I would recommend it ,especially for older individuals.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love EVERYTHING Stephen King and this is no exception! Certainly was worth the wait for this one to come out.
0425266060|5.0|Loved It!!!! I totally recommend this series! I read the entire series in 4 days and then I read them again!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I started the first season after it came out. Time got away from me and wasn't able to finish it til now. So glad I did!!! Wow! Loved it!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Entertaining and fun for all. There are a bunch of great maps and humorous clips. Graphics are good, game enjoyable, has me occupied

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see this is finally available for my Kindle Fire HD! I absolutely love this game! About time Amazon!
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|I love Rachel Khoo! I only wish the book was longer.  The cooking channel should give her more air time!
B00526ZKYS|3.0|An interesting twist on love and the government trying to control it. I enjoyed reading this book and am looking forward to reading the next in line.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I really love my Kindle case. I studied so many Kindle cases via reading customer reviews. I always read the<br />1 star reviews first because I knew what I did not want in a case.<br />Granted  I have only had my Case for 8 hours but it seems to meet my requirements: it fits my Kindle like a glove,<br />I have access to the inputs so that I am able to charge my device while it is closed (therefore protected), It is easy to stand up horizontally for watching TV /movies. When I close the cover  my Kindle shuts down.  I love the color ( not vital but aesthetically pleasing).<br />I must give kudo's to all reviewers who provided videos with their reviews!!!<br />Hope this helps anyone searching for a cover for their Kindle Fire HD<br />I have to say for the price I paid I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.<br />Thanks to all who provided reviews to help me with my wonderful purchase!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|been waiting for this movie since karl urban was cast as dredd..ive always love sly but i know he is already too old to play judge.i was floored by the graphics so to speak! gory but in a great cinematic way. although urban should've stayed away from copying sly's poker face, it was still a great movie! hands up, 5 stars!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I  would not put this book down. I cried, laugh, got mad. Great read can't wait for the next book
B00BFV1JZI|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Games and couldn't wait to start the next book.<br />The next was even better but the third is by far the best. a few good surprises towards the end.<br />I read all three in 10 days
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This movie was a good mix of action and humor.  The characters were fun to watch and the combination made for a fast moving and enjoyable movie overall.  This movie did not deep dive into plot or character development but it didn't need to and really wasn't that kind of spy movie.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|If you enjoyed the movie then read the book. It has a few variations but not too mush. Just make sure you have the two sequels ready for when you finish the first. My grand-daughter loved all three
B00000ADG2|4.0|This album is a classic people still talk about so I had to cop it. It is great music from a phenominal artis.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|This book is a great sequel to the Hunger Games and I dare you to put it down.<br />It picks up from the first very well.<br />It has a few surprises and some expected pieces
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Cornwell has written this series excellently. I couldn't put down any book in this series. Most times I would fall asleep while still reading it, and then would wake up and read a few more pages before I began the day!
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Great characters and plot. This series is a winnner and can't wait for the next season to see what develops
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Love love love Adele . So talented and moving. Just love her style and the heart that goes into each of her dongs
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Any time you bring a bunch of egotistical supper beings together it is difficult to get them to work together, but when the space aliens begin to destroy mankind they manage to work together as a well oiled machine. And yes they do defeat the aggressors, sorry about ruining the END for you.
0920668364|5.0|This book is charming thru all the ages. I gave it yo my mother for Mother's Day and she cried. Heart warming indeed.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise as we did not see it in the theater.  It shows the battle between a race of beings that are fighting to protect their planet from greedy earthlings (depicts the worst of humanity)that are willing to slaughter their entire race and anything else that gets in the way. If you liked the last Air Bender, the Hobbit, and yes even Oblivion then you'll probably like this as they all fight the odds.  .
B005LAII12|5.0|If your from Massachusetts this movie is for you. Wicked Awesome!!! The accents are perfect, so funny. A must see.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|If you liked the previous Star Treks you'll like this one.  Kirk and Spock have a falling out, but over come their differences when confronted with an old Star Trek nemesis from the original series that threatens the human race.
B00F35B8F8|2.0|Several of the CGI models were left over from Star Trek. The plot was not believable.  The acting was stiff.  Continuity was lacking in places.  All things considered, it was dissapointing
B00AG472DS|3.0|I like the fact that the story is based on true account, but this one is too long and towards the end it had lost the momentum and connection. Dragging and seems tailored so as to hide or trying to be neutral.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|A fun movie with a few plot twists and some interesting special effects.  It got a little mission imposibish in places but otherwise, ok
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Usually with the star studded movies it is very difficult to find the balance, of exposure and talent. This movie is one of the rare ones that have executed the whole thing almost perfect. I like this movie, Sylvester Stallone is not new to these blockbusters, he is my Father's favorite since I was a kid.
B00A89ITZG|2.0|MacKenzie is poorly informed about Running mechanics. Running 100m, 800m or Marathon requires quite different mechanics.<br />Sprinters do not extend the hip. Middle distance athletes do. Hamstrings are not Prime Movers, they are synergists to the Glutes in hip extension. Hip flexors are prime movers; how else can you flex your hip during swing phase? Try running as suggested in this book and you will move badly and get injured. &#34;Engage your core&#34;......what does that mean? What would Kenenisa Bekele say to that? There are some good points here but The Skill that is proposed for running is simply wrong. Running is not pulling, it is pushing. Running on a treadmill is not like running over the ground; the leg is pulled into extension by the belt, so studying gait on a teadmill is misleading. Athletes should be filmed running on a track, not a treadmill. This is poor science and inaccurate advice.
B004E547D8|5.0|I like the chemistry and artistry of the group, perfect. I like this movie, the story, cinematography and technology. BD for a fraction of price.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. Very vivid story. KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. KATNISS IS A VERY BRAVE GIRL. TRULY THE GIRL ON FIRE
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Once again Guillermo Del Toro shows his outstanding imagination with the creation of a totally unique film featuring kaiju and mecha, a theme created by the Japanese back in the 50's. If you buy this movie be sure to view the features that show just how the film was created as it adds a new dimension to the film itself. We loved it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought the Book after seeing the series because I heard it was a true story! And, being filmed in Rockland where I live was a given. I loved it and highly recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep is filled with the rich character treatment and wonderful flow that keeps you enthralled from the first page to the end. Stephen King does it again.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game more graphics would make it better and if u could also have more in game activities more like a story line
B009F7ORQW|3.0|Barbie toys don't hold up to the abuse that a 4-5 year old can put them through.  She doesn't seem to mind the break, I guess our kids have great imaginations.  None the less, she loves all things Barbie.
1416550542|5.0|Loved the book!<br /><br />This author was new to me, and the story line is different than those I usually read, but it was very enjoyable.  I could barely put it down once I started reading!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|So after fighting with this POS to actually stream something for several weeks I decided to return it, only to learn I missed the return window by a few days. I'm stuck with it and not happy. I'm not a techie, and I tried over the course of a couple of weekends to stream stuff to the TV using this fob, each time giving up as it could never keep the sound and video synced, that it kept dropping the connection, and just in general sucked. Forgive me for being more interested in just watching the TV than in jacking around with tech issues (this was supposed to be \\"plug and play\\" turns out it's \\"plug and pray it works\\" as there's little I could do to adjust anything) - a HDMI cable is cheaper and more importantly *works*.
B00005QAPH|1.0|i was told this was a FANTASTIC film. went ahead and bought it. not what i expected. wheres rourke? wheres bassinger? after 3 loooong hours. nothing happens. like the workings of skizoman on acid. 9 1/2 much better.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen king delights again, master of his craft, a quick easy read that finally answers the question of what happened to that kid from the shining.
B009NNMB70|5.0|If you haven't watched this movie yet, you must. Oh, and make sure you have a box of tissues with you. You will get so emotional and your heart will break all over again. The overwhelming feeling will cause the tears to stream down your face. This is a truly beautiful movie. I have cried at least 3 times throughout it. It is an amazayn experience. If you don't like One Direction, watch this movie. You will change. Trust me. You will.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Finding the app was a piece of cake.  Downloading to my Note 3 was quick. Easy to use. Free is always a great deal and the prices for books are reasonable!
0062213423|5.0|This is a book that you will keep for life, read over and over again, and get emotional. The lives of One Direction all in a book. What more could you ask for? There are exclusive photos that would make you laugh and drool. I love this book, and would buy another copy any day. So, if you want to buy this book don't think twice.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating because the animation was impressive and very clear. The story was very much like the stories from the Tin Tin books. Good for all ages.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air to the music industry, the use of original disco sounds resonates throughout the tracklist, it may not be like Discovery or any early Daft Punk, but they did leave an impressive mark with this record.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I don't know how anyone in the right mind, above the age of 10 could think that this is a good movie.  Sure, it's hilarious to watch because of how awful and cheesy it is, but it is BAD.  It's a garbage story, with garbage acting, a huge budget, and some well-known actors.  If this were meant to be a comedy, it would be one of the greatest of all-time.  The problem with this movie is that it wasn't meant to be a comedy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though I've seen the movie, the book gets better and better every time!! I can't wait to read the next one!!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|As the title of my review suggests, I think that this is one of the funniest movies ever made.  I watch this every Christmas and it never gets old.  The writing and acting are just hilarious.  Chevy Chase is great and his meltdown has got to be one of the funniest moments in movie history.
B001EC2J20|5.0|it is a really good movie if you understand the meaning behind the movie. It really breaks down our mind and the world we really live in and the thought process of the masses.
6304806434|1.0|I honestly don't know where to start with my critique on this.  It's just one of the worst all-around bad movies that I've ever seen in my entire life.  It's one of those movies that I will watch just to make fun of because it's that bad.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it so happy its finally on amazon. Thanks so much. 5 stars!!!!  Already on level 30. I'm level 110 on my phone
B006BQNJR8|4.0|Had a decent story. The cast was good. No real complaints about the movie. I'm assuming they'll make more Conan movies and based on this one, would probably watch them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game so happy I can finally get it on my kindle. Very addicting but love it and really colorful.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I am used to watching movies with my children, but this was not only entertaining and funny, but very thought provoking.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is very easy to play..  I did have a problem having it show up on my Kindle.  Called my daughter.  She tried on her kindle and had the same problem.  After 2 tries by each of us, it finally appeared in the cloud of our computers.  Then we were able to load it.  It is fun to play, and I know my husband (in a convalescent home) is going to enjoy it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I remember my Mom talking about the Orphan Train that came through the Midwest when she was a little girl growing up during the Depression.  I couldn't put the book down.  The author did an excellent job of weaving the story in such a way you felt you were right there.  It was a part of our American history that I hope never has to be repeated.  The lives of those children were changed forever, both good and bad.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Witty, awkward, romantic, fresh, and very very hard to put down. This story had me animated during the entire read.
B003R50FRI|5.0|Such a very interesting story, so very interesting to know how things work in another country. Being a true story makes it so much more interesting. I hope he writes another one.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|It's a good game, just wish it didn't have any limits. But I have enjoyed it thus far. It also does not hurt that it is free.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It is pretty fun and kind of addicting. Also, it is pretty easy, making me feel good about myself. B
B003M6FGTE|5.0|This show is refreshingly different. It entertains on so many levels: drama, comedy, musically and a little bit risque to boot. I just love it. I urge everyone to give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|A masterpiece from the master himself. A page turner from page one. If this is the only book you read this year, make this the one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so fun anyone can play also it is so easy I think this game is a lot of fun I'm glad it is finally available for the kindle hd
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yup, that's me. Addicted to this game. But  I know I'm not alone.  It's rreally a great game. Just downloaded  the app yesterday, but have been playing it on Facebook.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|wont let me install i have 2 GBs free of space please fix it I really want to play it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that you have put it on the kindle,and I love the graphics,and the levels are great,I highly recommended this game for everyone,who is a gamer,they will love this game!!!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Very fun read, still have two of the books left and am looking forward to getting through them.  Highly recommended.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Beginning in Bratislava in 1933 this is the story of Greta, her family and the trails and tribulations of war. The story feels authentic all the way through and, as with all histories, I admire so much the amount of research required for this kind of novel.<br />What impressed me most about this story was the ordinariness of the characters, people going about their everyday lives against a growing backdrop of discrimination, racial intolerance and hatred. The Weissensteiners are just one, small statistic in an ocean of uncertainty but their story is important because, in its way, it is the story of everyone. Through it all Greta retains a fierce loyalty for her family, even when she is so badly let down. I was rooting for her all the way as these 'not very Jewish' Jews are forced into hiding, the colourful characters they encounter and their reactions as the tide of war begins to turn.<br />A thoroughly interesting and enjoyable read, sad and at the same time uplifting, and I learned a lot too.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Great game for the walking dead fans<br />The first time I played the game I was addicted<br />Great game for different ages
B00F8L2VO4|3.0|I just started this but so far looks like it will be easy to use and learn from.hope it helps you
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|This is one of the best renditions of Hamlet I have seen.  Well acted and photographed.  Basically unabridged.  Worth the price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It Is so cool and fun you can build any thing you want but the computer version is better than this
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Felt like Stephen King of old. A fun read and after all these years a nice follow up to The Shining
0321356683|5.0|I don't know how I was developing before reading this. I don't read often, but I have read this book twice. It is that good.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Insightful and courageous. I've been in the tech world for decades and have seen my peers disappear from the work force. It is amazing how few women there are compared to the 90s in management positions. Sheryl Sandberg does an excellent job explaining why.  In my case, I both love what I do, so started my own business in order to maximize pay and flexibility between work and home life. Otherwise, I too would have left. Yes, we need more women in management and executive positions. I concur...the world will benefit from our insights and contributions.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|The hype for the film was really good, but for me, the viewing was not so good. The special effects were really great and that is what made the film and for me to give it 4 stars. I have a lot of the Star Trek series and have enjoyed them all, but I don't think I will watch this a second time.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I gave it four stars because I like a good story based on truth.  It brought the past and present together and I thought it was really interesting.  The author really did her research!  This book made me feel good!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy to use and look at.  I like it.  I still need to check messenger to see how that works.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fascinating psychiatric study.  Couldn't put it down.  I am even considering reading it again.  What more can l say,ey?  Maybe.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Nice to be able to use some of the apps outside of facebook as well.  Would be nice if words with friends turned on the screen, too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fantastic story. I really did not want to put it down. The ending is stupendous. The writing is exquisite. Thank you for reminding me how one small thing can change our entire life.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use, easy to see.  It is the best app I have use.  I just love it so much, it's awesome!
B000GWE44U|5.0|Think everyone has seen this one! If you haven't, do, if you like this sort of thing. A true classic, the music, the filming, everything is superb. I first saw this in a movie theatre when it first was released. While watching the movie, I realized at one point, looking down at my legs, somewhere half way through, that I was sitting on the very edge of my seat, quite literally, and I was sweating and shaking all over. Really a truly frightening movie. This movie is more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. And it is terrifying.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Loving this product. Installing is easy, setting up is easy and most of all watching the digital media on TV from Android smartphone and tablet and desktop is very easy. Got addicted to it. :). Must have gadget.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|No real blood or guts; just real, old fashioned scares. Based in the '70s and on a true story, this film really hit the mark and scared the crap out of us more than one or two times. Great storyline, well flushed out characters and excellent filmography. You will literally jump at a few scenes. Loved it, own it, will watch it again!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Suspenseful until the end!  Entertaining and brilliantly written!<br /><br />Highly recommend this for readers who enjoy suspense and intrigue.  A murder mystery that keeps you captivated from the beginning.  Twists and turns until the very end!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love games like this because you can sit down and relax while playing.All in all its a great game and good for all ages.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Good!  I would recomment this very much!  It is very good!  I am glad I got it!  Thank you! :)
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book especially since a lot of it took place in Minnesota.<br />The characters seemed very real and believable
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Excellent!  I would recomment this very much!  It is very good!  I am glad I got it!  Thank you! :)
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book gives a clear account of Tesla and his accomplishments.  Paramount is the message that greed, especially powerful corporate greed, is the biggest destroyer of innovation around the world.  If not for this, Tesla's inventions may have ushered in a world of abundant, free energy that would have greatly improved life for common people, instead of adding to the fortunes of the obscenely wealthy.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Excellent!  I would recomment this very much!  It is very good!  I am glad I got it!  Thank you! :)
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed the format of following the stories of two orphans from different times and locations.  Although fiction, I found the stories quite believable.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|A bit over the top. King is great at making everyday things scary, but a bunch of Winnie-driving seniors inhaling &#34;steam&#34; from nasties is pretty ridiculous. Not his best, and certainly not &#34;The Shining&#34;!
0439796644|5.0|I loved the human and animal characters, the WWI connection, and the plot.  I liked the fact that it presented bravery, honor, endurance.  Yes, it was a feel good movie but we need this type of film now and then to give us a break from the pessimism of today.
0062255657|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  I think it was too short to be called a novel.  It was more like a short story.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Giant robots, giant monsters. What else do you need?  Some of the best action and fighting sequences I've seen in the entire genre of giant mech.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Very fun not as hard as most learning systems. Keeps me entertained and wanting to learn more. Learning a little every session
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Enjoyed it! I liked the fact it had lots of action and was not bloody. And the woman is the main character.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book really grabbed my attention. I was really hoping the characters would get back together but the ending made so much sense. I had a hard time putting the book down. I haven't read Nicolas Sparks before, but have seen his movies. I will be reading more of him.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Got this model because of the Intel HD 4000 video.  The Windows 7 rating is poo.  But other than that, it works well.  I bought this to upgrade from a AMD A8. 2.9ghz.  Not much difference except the AMD system was a lot cheaper and worked as well, with much higher video rating.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|At first I wasnt into the &#34;True Knot&#34; side story but as Danny's &#34; shining&#34; continued with Abra, it got better. It had somewhat of a bittersweet ending, or things coming &#34; full circle&#34; for Dr. Sleep.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love love love love love love this game it is so much better than the old deer hunter the graphics are awsome
B005IS565S|5.0|Great music, love the drums!  It gives me inspiration to dust off the 'skins and play again.  I'll checking out the rest of FFDP's music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and finally it's in the Amazon app store. It's very addictive and annoying when you're stuck on a level.
B006YTYIXG|3.0|The first 4 Soulfly albums totally rocked.  Since then, it seems they are slowly going downhill. But they are still better than most of the junk out there!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome!!!  The story line was very well written and there were several moments in the movie where there was a &#34;throw back&#34; to the original Star Trek #2 movie if you watched it and remember.  It was very fast paced and had great graphics.  I like how they have made Spock a more physical character than that of the original character (Nimoy).  Great action, great story, great movie!  Strongly urge anyone, even those who don't know the characters, to watch it!!!!!!!!!!
B000002JR8|5.0|I bought this to replace my old cassette. This disk and Vulgar are my favorites from Pantera. R.I.P. Dimebag!!!  Vinny Paul rocks!!!
B000BQ7BX2|2.0|I had to force myself through this set.  These are Mahler performances in a style that is (quoting from the liner notes) &#34;puritanical in their avoidance of self-indulgent rubato and rhythmic emphasis.&#34;  To which I have to ask, &#34;Why?&#34;  It isn't quite as bad as a MIDI score played on a computer, but if you called a literal, mechanical interpretation of the score a 1 and interpretations like Bernstein's somewhere near a 9, this would be about a 4.  There are occasional moments of excitement, but not enough of them.  The overall effect often makes the music sound a little like a German marching band. One reviewer commented after following along with the score, that this was the version that was truest to the notes on the page.  That may be so, but a conductor's job is to see the music that lies between the notes on the score.  Bertini seems to have been adverse to doing that.  And in a sense what these versions accomplish is showing how much Mahler was able to communicate in the scores.  There are some moments, perhaps even entire movements that are successful in spite of the dry musical interpretation.  In summary, I would very highly recommend this recording to anyone studying conducting, because listening to it you will be inspired by what is missing.  For everyone else looking for an inexpensive set of Mahler symphonies, I'd recommend [[ASIN:B005SJIP1E SONY's Bernstein set]] or [[ASIN:B003D0ZNWY EMI's 150th Anniversary Box]] over this one.  Both are available for about $25.  === Update === I found no joy in these recordings so I sold the box.  But since I'm recommending that you look elsewhere, I'd suggest [[ASIN:B006XOBFTM SONY's Bruno Walter Mahler box]]. Although missing symphonies 3, 6, 7 and 8, the box has Das Lied and some other songs.  At about $15 it is a must-have among Mahler fans.  Also,  I recently got [[ASIN:B00JJ9DYMY Abbado's set ]] for about $25 which is an excellent overall set considering both sound and performance.  Some of my favorite interpretations are well over 40 years old now, while not the best interpretation wise,  Abbado's interpretations are probably the closest among recent digital recordings.  Some of the orchestral playing is about as good as it gets.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Facebook app on here it's absolutely terrible it keeps popping up Facebook has stopped working and it's really annoying every time the pop-up happens and pauses anything I'm on
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book helped me understand the world of computers, why I like my IPhone that I bought because it was the best available phone. That's exactly the reason Jobs and his team developed<br />this phone. Walter Isaacson presented a person to whom we are indebted forever. Thank you Steve Jobs for only being satisfied with the best.
B0090EJ99A|4.0|I was not expecting much from this movie it seemed like don't mess with zohan lol and it somehow it is but you will really have fun while watching it.
B00BATKPBE|4.0|A very interesting account of the life of a most intelligent man.  I saw him speak on C-Span's weekend Book TV.  He shares many of my beliefs also.
B008602KQI|5.0|So compelling and cinematically driven!<br />I absolutely enjoyed this movie, i have i say its been a while that a movie in today's day and age that has been able to capture me emotionally and suspensfully. The story was so well done that it had me thinking about it even after i watched the movie. It wasnt like movie it was an experience. There should be more films like this because most movies today are becoming so played out.
B00BXZ3D6Y|2.0|sorry  not high tech person  can not figure out how to use  looked for instructions but not attached to icon
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Here we go again. Rick done it again. a great series starts with a great book. If you haven't read Percy Jackson. Read it first !!! I only read the first  one working on second. I was a bit confused honestly it spoiled a lot. So if you don't like a summoning. up of the Percy series read those first . Great book though
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not quite the old SK, but still great!  Starts out a little slow, but it's worth it.  We're anxious to find out more about Danny, and its finally here.  Couldn't put it down, of course, except to charge the kindle (sometimes I would read with it plugged into the wall.)  I would give it a five, but you can't beat &#34;The Shining&#34;.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|Beautiful doll. She made my daughter's bday. We old quite a few monster high dolls and I have to say this doll is the first one that stands out from the rest
B007SGLZP8|3.0|As are all of John Grisham´s novels, this was entertaining.  However, it is a little far fetched.  Still quite enjoyable.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Keeps great time for an automatic watch.  I had another divers watch for twenty five years before I sent it in to be repaired, that how long Seiko watches last.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read! The funny thing is though I can't quite put my finger on it as to why. Is it the way that Hazel really didn't want pity and just wanted to live her life? The way the Gus loved her with everything he had? The way Hazel loved Issac and Gus? The courage she showed when she called her idol a horrible alcoholic? I'm not really sure. All I know is that I feel like a better person since I read this. Wow. Best 2 days spent. If you do not read this book you are missing out on a wonderful novel!
B002XISFGS|4.0|'m loving star trek. The images, sounds and frames always loved and I've decided colleccionar movies, series, figures etc startrek. I did not like the 16:9 format on my LG tv because, it was ideal to see the image in full screen with no black bars (superios and lower part of the screen). Tdo the rest almost perfect. `` `Peace and long life ^ ^ Greetings
B00F91G5BS|3.0|World War Z is entertaining enough if you want to zone out on something to watch for now, but true fans of movies within the Zombie/Horror genre will be sorely disappointed.  If anything, my biggest gripe with this movie is my same gripe with that the other end-of-the-world films have I suffered through lately... I'm sick of the neverending &#34;Run something is chasing us!&#34; feel.  And the movie suffers from a fair bit of corniness in different scenes.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I find this application to be incredibly useful. Everyone should have it for word processing. Super user friendly interface leaves no one scratching their head trying to use it.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|We saw the movie in 3D and it was amazing so we bought the 3D blu-ray. It really is the great effects that make the film. For anything more specific about the movie go to imdb.com.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The concept of a well educated modern mind experiencing and sharing such a phenomenon sets a stage for a soul stretching story. The author has a believable awkward way of telling the story.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|At first, this story starts out a tad bit on the cliche and predictable side, but it is worth sticking with. Morgan Rice clearly draws much of the influence for this series from Game of Thrones, and consequently may be appreciated by any fan of such. In fact, it's very much like GoT, except without all of the adult content. In this series you will find memorable characters, epic battles, and a riveting plot that will keep you turning pages...
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|The Story of Film is NOT an objective, historical look at film.  Instead, it is the story of one man's love of film and what he finds so interesting and compelling about the art.  Furthermore, it is not a film intended only for people in the United States. Instead it is a very personal project that Cousins shared with people around the world.  If you expect a North America-centric, slick and impersonal exploration of film, do not buy this.  You will , however, miss out on a wonderful story.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|There are a number of blogs I like to check on regularly, but since I am often doing so from my Fire or my Smart Phone, rather than my desktop, it is great to have the Feedly app available in all three places so that I can check in whenever I have a few minutes free.<br /><br />I like the way Feedly makes it easy to sort blogs into categories so that we can choose to catch up on all of our blogs or just a specific category. I also like how easy it is to add new feeds to it.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it.
B0027V6AL8|5.0|This movie is a classic of 80s action/ sci fi. It also features Arnold Schwarzenegger at his finest because he is at his campiest--milking his puns for all they are worth! Richard Dawson,  matches Arnold in his over-the-top portrayal of baddie Damon Killian. Even though  movie is a very loose adaptation of Stephen King's book,  it is still very entertaining! &#34;Here is Sub-Zero! Now--plain zero.&#34;
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love Stephen King and this one is just as good as the old day of reading him.  Glad to have his original writing back
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A recent review suggested the installation of this application caused a battery overheat condition requiring the reset of a Kindle Fire.  I installed this application over 3 months ago and have not experienced the overheat condition the review suggested.  I, however, did have to reboot my Kindle Fire once in 3 months using the 20-30second reboot process (pressing power button).  The cause requiring this type of reboot could not be isolated to this application.  Hope other Kindle Fire users share their their experiences so the developer can receive constructive feedback to help refine the application.<br />  I have found this application very helpful in monitoring my first generation Kindle Fire.  I would not hesitate to load this application.
0938045768|3.0|You can find everything written in this book shown on youtube for free. Look it up, you'll see that this book really isn't worth 40 bucks. You only get about 20 - 30 exercises - most of which are known to anyone who's worked out for more than a year.
B005IQZB14|3.0|It was ok, not great.  It kept me engaged in the narrative experience of someone hiking a trail.  Gave me an awareness of the geography of the Pacific Crest Trail.

B001B6PBBK|5.0|I adore this film and I adore her...she is fantastic.  The story is good, very very good.  The many kinds of love keep it interesting.  The camera work is especially pleasing and the music makes my heart sing.  I truly love Paulo...
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|This app is terrible; it hangs up all the time and gets you caught in the center of the board until the &#34;game&#34; wins.  Don't waste your money on this one; I uninstalled the game the first day I bought it and installed.
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|I could have done without the torture scenes but when the love starts, that's when I got interested.  I've watched it more than four times on my Kindle Fire and will probably watch it at least four more.  Maybe forty more.  Both of them are to die for.

B000FC10MU|4.0|This is an unusual work of fiction and hard to put into any genre. But it has elements of fantasy adventure, elements of occult and horror and elements of post-modernism and fantastic realism. It's also a very good read if you can handle some of its macabre moments.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|I'm in love with my Finis Neptune. Bought this product for triathlon training. Have used it in saline and chlorinated pools, without issue. It's easy to use and holds quite a bit of music.  I can create perfect tempo playlists depending on my workout.  The sound is best with earplugs, but works either way.  The only drawback is music must be downloaded as an MP3.  Meaning if you have iTunes, you'll need to convert your music to MP3 before loading. A workaround: purchase and download music from Amazon (or somewhere else), create Finis playlist, and then import music into iTunes.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|I have no experience of India and obviously this is just one view of a great and ancient country and a darkly humorous view at that. If you are ready to experience a whole different world, this might be the book to read.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|There is no better TV than Downton Abbey and here I am at Season 3 and it NEVER disappoints. There are many wonderful original shows on Cablevision today and I appreciate and enjoy many of them but Downton Abbey is in a league of it's own.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I thought it was very good (at least the 3 episodes I have seen)but difficult to watch.  I would give a better rating if I didn't have to deal with constant freezing and re-starting every 5-10 minutes.  Obviously not a fault of the program but rather the way Amazon streams it.  I had the same issue with &#34;under the dome&#34;.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a truly wonderful idea it works just as expected and frees up space on my tablet I wasn't aware of. It does really work for me so far.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|So our granddaughters are tickled and so happy that they got this DVD for no apparent special reason, just because.  They are a little spoiled.  We made a big hit with them both because this is another of the great DVD's that they watch over and over again.  Perhaps one day they will play it when we are visiting.  I would love to actually see it.  Great for the little ones and the ones that don't want to be grown up...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush for kindle. I have been waiting for this. Now I can be addicted to this game on two devices.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|This really did not have much of a story line.  They could have done so much more with this movie.  It was actually a waste of my money to purchase this DVD.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Sucks that no local file playing available since all cast was blocked.  Slow for net flix.<br /><br />Best youtube experience ever. Lovin it!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great app to exercise your brain with lots of logic, memorization, mathematics, and so much more. My teenage daughter, young son and I spent hours working through the levels and had a great time. Great resource to help expand the minds of both the young and seasoned ones.

B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Are you a fan of the recently retired Showtime television series, \\"Dexter\\"?  That doesn't mean you are going to enjoy the books.  As with many books that have been turned into a television series or a movie a lot is changed and being a fan of one does not automatically mean you will be a fan of the other.  The Dexter television series is about Dexter as well as his family, his friends and other Miami metro personnel whereas the Dexter book is written about Dexter with very little expansion into the rest of the Dexter TV universe.  The Dexter book is written in the first-person POV from the mind of a sociopathic serial killer; it is a frightening and thrilling perspective.<br /><br />The first-person POV in Darkly Dreaming Dexter provides unique and disturbing insight into the sociopathic serial killer that is Dexter Morgan.  By day Dexter is a handsome and charismatic blood splatter analyst for Miami Metro.  He is a beloved brother and a patient boyfriend.  He says all of the right things to all of the right people and lives just under the radar calling very little attention to himself.  This allows him to give in to his Dark Passenger when the need arises and to kill.  He can get away with it because he was carefully trained by his respected police officer foster father Harry before Harry passed away and Dexter is certain to follow Harry's code.  Everything in Dexter's world is going wonderfully, with Dexter committing the occasional murder, until someone else starts committing gruesome murders in Miami and Dexter's sister asks for his help.  Suddenly Dexter is out of the lab and on the case investigating murders that feel so familiar that he begins to question whether or not he is committing the murders himself.  Has his Dark Passenger finally taken control?  Is the Dark Passenger committing murders that Dexter can't remember?  Reading from inside Dexter's mind as his psyche spins and struggles with the curious case is exhilarating!  It is so cold and detached, so far from human.  It is quirky and humorous, in a sociopathic sort of way that it is both chilling and fascinating.<br /><br />The characterization in the first of the Dexter novels is deep in the characterization of Dexter but almost non-existent in the characterization of everyone else.  Readers do meet some of the beloved characters from the Showtime series (LaGuerta, Doakes, Masuoka, Batista, Debra Morgan) but there is not the personality that the show presents.  How could there be?  Dexter doesn't associate with people the way that regular humans do.  He's a sociopath.  He doesn't feel love or even real fondness.  He doesn't have true friends, understand attraction or develop deep human relationships.  He can't.  Since the book is written from the first-person POV the reader can only know and feel what Dexter feels and Dexter doesn't feel anything except for the need to pretend and the desire to kill.  The other characters feel flat and empty; exactly the way that Dexter sees them.  It isn't what readers have come to expect but is exactly fitting for a Dexter novel.<br /><br />Being inside Dexter's mind takes readers on an exciting ride.  Dexter is cold and calculating, quirky and humorous, terrifying yet lovable.  He's the perfect anti-hero with an incredible story.  While a different story than the television series I loved Darkly Dreaming Dexter and am excited to continue reading Dexter's journey.<br /><br />Review by Ashley LaMar<br />Closed the Coverfar from human.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I am really enjoying this book. Very different, I love the mystery. I love books that keep you guessing and thinking.  I don't want to put it down!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|watching amazon prime instant video app is still not available for android devices. Which kind of sucks. This App is nice from shopping and all other point of view but was hoping that they will come up with amazon prime features in this app
0545586178|5.0|I recently read \\"Hunger Games\\" at my son's house.  I read it in about 2 days.  I could hardly wait to get \\"Catching Fire\\" to follow through on the story.  Needless to say, I have also just read \\"Mockingjay\\".  I have not been disappointed with any of these books, which are filled with fascinating characters and events.  Katniss Everdeen is a reluctant heroine but succeeds in all she is forced to do. Put aside a few hours when you start reading because you won't be able to put the books down once you start.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great read. Couldn't put it down. Well<br />Written. Descriptions and vocabulary were amazing. Recommending to friends. Would like to read more of this author.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|when I started this book I was not sure I *wanted to go there*--but am so glad I did. kept me on the edge of my seat- when I wasn't reading I was anxious to get back to see what was happening. enjoyed this story start to finish.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|The best movie ever!!! Lots of action. Lots of violence. Looks awesome in 3D. I could seriously watch it over and over again.
0345529057|5.0|I did not expect to be so drawn in with these books- they have kept me engrossed from book to book. the first 4 left me anxious to get to book 5. George R.R. Martin takes you places, tells a tale that transports you into a different place & time. very entertaining.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game not to long ago and it is amazing it is way better than angry gram run. I like minion rush and subway surfers the same though. Everyone should try this game it's worth it
B005T87QCI|5.0|just from the video I liked it  I have  played it before and I loved it its a good game you should get it
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Very nicely illustrated puzzle adventure in the vein of Samorost, or Botanicula. Fairly straightforward goals with a little bit of pixel hunting. Includes a hint book for the levels if you're really set in getting the best score but can't quite discern what you're missing.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I bought this as a wedding gift for my Lego-loving husband. He really enjoyed it and thought it was a fun build.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game to play and very addicting. Need more levels and maybe a hint button because sometimes it is hard to figure things out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of best games I've ever played. One problem is on iPad you cannot use an item you acquire.<br />Otherwise it's awesome. Don't like timed. Soon I will have to quit because timed will be to difficult to pass
1589795474|5.0|this book was recommended reading.  I have been trying to figure out how some become millionaires, this gives a very good explanation and I am incorporating these practices in my life.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it!!!! I can't wait for the next season and what in store for Downton Abbey and the Crawley house.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I barely remember reading this for the first time. It still is a terrific read. It's hard to imagine a little kid able to do the things Ended had to do. Then wrap it all up and let him heal and get a chance to put his doings right. I'm really looking forward to the movie.
0300169787|5.0|i bought this on amazon because the museum sold out quickly.  this is a fantastic book with high quality photos.  a great companion for if you got to actually go to the exhibit. even if you didnt get to go, you will still be amazed by alexander mcqueen's creations.
B005H2IAM6|3.0|I just finished watching the Japanese live action, Space Battleship Yamato. (In America, people my age would call it Star Blazers).  I want to give props to all of those who put this movie together for a reported $12 million. Some TV shows cost that much to do 6 episodes. And while I believe they got the most out of every dollar, the story telling is too fast in some areas and sappily stretched in others.<br /><br />I think the hardest part to take was how convenient most battle scenes ended in favor of the heroes. Through several battle sequences, you never really feel like the crew of the Yamato is in any real danger as the fighting tactics of the enemy seem inept for a society that has mastered interstellar travel and had no real problems setting our planet on its ass. On Iskandar, heroes do die in a big way, (I won't say who). But I still can't help but feel like the Gamilons would have flunked out of West Point. Speaking of Gamilons, the enemy's appearance has been greatly altered.  I can only imagine that it was cheaper to computer generate the Gamilons rather than pay anymore actors.  As for the acting, I will not label it good or bad. I will call it anime, which is a compliment.<br /><br />For fans of the show, the material is handled with respect and, all-in-all, the movie is a fun ride. It definitely helps if you were a fan of the show. But you will have to let some things go to enjoy this movie, which I was will to do.<br /><br />If Hollywood takes up the cause, I recommend two movies. One going to Iskandar and the other going home. Maybe J.J. Abrams can help us better understand why the villains are doing what they are doing to Earth and not, say... Mars.  Tell us why the trip to Iskandar is so important. I mean, why couldn't our helper on Iskandar send this device of salvation directly to Earth instead of putting us on this long and dangerous trip. Someone from Iskandar did send us a free sample, so why not the whole kit?  They kind of try to explain it, but it lacks full gravity. As a big screen adventure, I see this story's potential. This version is worth watching.  But a better telling can certainly be done. (Keep the person who did the soundtrack. the music is nicely done as were the English subtitles).<br /><br />Given that they made the most of a very small budget, and the reverence with which a nice chunk of the original story was preserved, I give the movie a B-., but it lacks full gravity.

B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I was getting the game and it said I had to mutch storage I deleted all but six my apps I went to amazon and loosened my cloud still not enough space come on glu
1931955085|4.0|This is an excellent collection of Mark Ryden's work. As usual, filled with haunting and disturbing imagery. The one complaint, echoing other reviewers, is that this book is less art prints and more explanatory text or behind-the-scenes photography. However, this book is about a single gallery showing, so it is understandable that one wouldn't be able to compile an entire book from the images alone. Just realize what you are getting if you buy this.
B004YCKJSS|4.0|Great Flick, Did not feel sorry for Dilan, nor fully understand the imaturity of his friends even the hen picked married one.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|We love this movie, especially watching it in 3D. Great movie, great combo pack! Highly recommended for anyone with a 3D tv/blu-ray, even though it's more expensive than the basic blu-ray, it's totally worth it for action/sci-fi movies like this!
B008EL25LE|4.0|This definitely is a winner!  Not only is the game beautifully designed, it's also fun and interesting.  Match games can be pretty dull and repetitive but so far this one has drawn me in and kept me going.  Not sure I'd have paid the $4.99 for it but it was great to have as the freebie of the day.  Thanks!!
B00EXVZW6E|1.0|I have deleted this program. every time I turned on my kindle it told me this program was forced closed. there must be something wrong with program for it to pop up that something is wrong without ever opening it!!!!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so awesome I can't stop playing. When I die all probably still be playing it . That's how awesome it is. MINECRAFT
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I held out on getting this on Facebook, but now that it is on the Kindle, I couldn't resist getting it.  I'm glad I did, since it's a lot of fun!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Great writing about a world of spooky fantasy. Very enjoyable and it was nice that it was short. That made it more fun to read
6305428042|5.0|Exactly what I wanted! This movie has always been a favorite to watch around Halloween! I had my niece watch it and it's now one of her favorites!
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|wow okay so the story line is kind of interesting... father goes off to find a cure for zombies... government treats his family like jerks... but what everyone cares about is of course the zombies and their scare factor... they are fast they are ruthless the makeup job is awesome i give the zombies four out of five stars
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I have enjoyed the 2nd season of Castle. Don't have TV...heard how great the show is, so I ordered the DVD....enjoy everything about it.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This product is awesome! I am a huge fan of doctor who, and both me and a friend got 1 of these each. I don't recommend this to serious collectors though, it is merely a toy, or a cosplayer's prop. Still, I plan to use mine for Halloween, and for making home videos. My only complaint is that if I push the button lightly, then the light will not shine steadily; you have to give it a bit of force. Equip up, it's time to go Dalek hunting!
B008LVCKH6|4.0|This is a charming book, very readable with good plot development and solid humour throughout. A wonderful read overall, highly recommended to lighten your day.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|There are sometimes very few and far between things that are the best things in life that are free. For video games, it has been a far distance in value and fun. Candy Crush Saga has been one of those games not only worth the money in fun, but joy all over. The games takes on the fun that challenges like Bejeweled and Zuma Collapse have had so brilliantly as you tried to match3 or more candies each and every time while making your way through numerous levels of fun, while clearing jelly and using lollipops to master your way to glory. The game is a great download for your tablet and Android device that definitely belongs with the pantheon of greatest puzzle video games like Tetris and Angry Birds. I absolutely love this game, and you'll crunch your way into it too.<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Graphics: B+<br /><br />Sound: B+<br /><br />Control: A-<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+
B008JFUR10|5.0|Best money I've spent on a movie in quite a while. Some very phenomenal action sequences courtesy of Del Toro teamed up with ILM, just amazing stuff even on the small screen. It's nice to see these types of movies done well again considering some of my earliest memories in life were watching those old Japanese Godzilla films on TV. Great casting too, from Charlie Hunnam and Hellboy himself, Ron Perlman, to Charlie Day and Idris Elba. As far as the disc goes I only wish Del Toro had put more behind-the-scenes material on this 2D Blu-ray (and hadn't stacked the two Blu-ray discs on top of one another). Usually he has a lot to say in his extra features but the main one here is under 20 minutes and the rest requires a lot of navigating for some animatics and stills. Great stuff aside from that, especially if you like the Jaegers and giant Lovecraftian horrors of the deep.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The costumes are awesome and the places/ settings are creepy cool.this is the best game in the world trust me
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is one oft he best series that I have ever read, and not just me but my whole family agrees!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Beautifully written, often idealistic, but satisfying in its overall optimism and warmth.  One also understands another culture a little better.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I finally finished this book after 6 months. I love books like these with the experience of the persons NDE but this one I had a hard time with. Maybe because it kept switching back and forth from the dream world to real world? Not sure but I did lose interest and it took me awhile to finish this book. The best book so far I have read that is similar is \\"Many Lives, Many Masters\\" by Dr Brian Weiss. It is about past life regression but sort of the same message. I'm not doubting his journey did occur I just wasn't able to fully connect. I did like his recommendation of hemi-sync by robert monroe though for use with meditation and so on. I would still recommend reading this book to anyone who asks.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Mesmerizing, extremely well done, the myth expands, the mystery takes you deeper.  Great special effects.  Violence is perfunctory, swift and appropriate,  nudity and sexuality are done without sentimentality or lewdness.

B006WAIV6M|3.0|http://soumyagudiyella.blogspot.in/2013/10/the-power-of-habit-why-we-do-what-we-do.html<br /><br />The Power of Habit is a book written by Charles Duhigg. In this book, the author speaks about how habits are formed in individuals, in organizations and societies and how habits can make us better or worse.<br /><br />Habits are brain's way of saving effort. Habits are a three step process. First there is a trigger, which tells the brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. The second is the routine which is physical, mental or emotional. Finally there is a reward which helps brain to figure out that this particular routine is worth remembering. Fortunately, habits can be modified by changing the routine in the three step process of trigger, routine and reward.<br /><br />This book is like an extended thesis but it does give interesting details about the power of habits.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|Great book, a little too many situations that keep Thomas from getting where he needs to be. Looking forward to the 3rd book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love to re-visit old favorite characters. Much different than the original, but very interesting and impossible to put down like all of Kings stories!
1442346949|5.0|This book is a great read and can help develop people's understanding of Steve Jobs and why he was so amazing. Motivating, inspiring and everything I expected and more!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I liked the movie based on this book...but the book is a million times better.  The emotions are so raw and it makes it hard to put down!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I can imagine that I only join a large company of 5 star raters.  I probably have nothing more to add, so I will just recommend these books for any adventure-fantasy-futurist-types out there if you haven't already been convinced by others.
B005PK57NU|4.0|The dialogue is so well written for these excellent intriguing characters; in addition you have very talented actors playing these juicy roles.

B007N8RULO|5.0|Addictive. Fun game. Easy enough to win but hard enough to be a challenge still. Wont want to put it down.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|SAWDUST IS AMAZING! It has so many songs on it that are typical Killers songs along with remixes and Abbey Road versions of songs. I wish this album was more well known because it is awesome! Not quite as good as Sams Town, but its in the top three for my favorite Killers albums!
B006RJTEIC|5.0|GREAT MOVIE FOR ITS TIME. WOULD LIKE TO SEE A REMAKE!  I BOUGHT I SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST WAS RELEASED

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King for years, and I have nearly all his books in my library. I even took a trip to Bangor, Maine to where he lives and visited the scene of many of his novels set in Maine. Lots of fun.<br /><br />This book does not disappoint. It is a tale of his little boy in the<br />Shining, and he does a great job with this book.
B002N1AEMS|5.0|This vinyl shipped quickly and safely. I even got it 4 days before the scheduled date. I listened to it all night. It has a beautiful, classic sound that keeps me listening to it all the time.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|If you haven't seen this film yet, and like classic musicals, this is a magical film.  Hepburn is mesmerizing as Eliza, the cockney flower girl who is transformed into a princess-like elegant beauty.  Rex Harrison plays the arrogant, somewhat heartless Professor who takes the ugly duckling on.<br /><br />The costumes delight.  The music is enchanting. It's a classic story that comes to life most winningly in this film.<br />If you enjoy musicals from their golden age, you will want to see this one.  Note that Hepburn doesn't do her own singing. It is the kind of film I can watch every year.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|What was I thinking!? Honestly I read the reviews and thought yeah why not only to find out that I could not download it because I had not enough memories space. So I decided to delegate some stuff only to still not be able to download it. After reading the reviews I found out that first generation kindle fires could not get the game. And worse I had a hard deleting the God forsaken thing. Finally able to delegate it and get some stuff back. But lesson learned. Read the reviews before you get the game save you a whole bunch of trouble.

B00F35BV64|3.0|This movie was ok, but did not follow the real history of Star Trek.<br />Any fan knows that Christopher Pike did not die but went to another planet with Spock's help.  I think that it was a poor choice not to follow the history.  They could have had any old friend of Capt Kirk's die in the attack on Star Fleet and it would have had the same effect.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I read this book quickly because I am still amazed at this young girl's resilient spirit and her courage, as well as that of her father.  I remember seeing the story on the news about her being shot and the wave of anger that came over me that the Taliban could shoot a defenseless child who simply wanted to go to school and assure that right for other girls.  What happened, as Malala says, is that instead they gave her voice and her movement power.  They thought the bullets would tear her down and, in the end, their evil act created a foundation for her to speak to the world.<br /><br />  The story she tells is one of love.  Love for her home in Swat, her life there and for reading and learning.  It is beautiful to me that her father encouraged and gave her the backing she needed to be educated and outspoken for the educational rights of children.  The book starts with the life changing day she was shot then returns to the day of her birth, giving us an insight to her upbringing and the history of her father's attempts to start schools to assure the education of boys and girls.  The descriptions of Swat give a vivid picture of the area and contain the deep emotions she has for the home she loves and the people and friends she misses there.  Along with the good that her father does with other activists inside Pakistan, however, we see the emergence of the Taliban and their murderous, cowardly ways.  The Taliban begins to rear its ugly head, persecuting women and slaughtering anyone who disagrees with them.  As these young women continue to bravely go to school to receive the education they so desperately want, the Taliban begin to amp up their attacks on schools and those who opposed them.  In 2012, after threats toward Malala and her father, she is shot, along with two other girls on the way to school.<br /><br />  What follows is a miracle.  Not only in the recovery of this young woman but in the outpouring from the world. Here in the U. S. where we have young girls who \\"twerk\\" on MTV and shame themselves for a number one record, we see instead with Malala, the story of a young girl who is almost killed for going to school.  The world sees a young woman who escapes death and continues to stand for the goal she has prayed for alongside her adoring father.  People the world over see a young 16 year old girl stand before the U. N. and denounce the way girls are denied education in her country and around the world.

They didn't take her voice; they amplified it!<br /><br />  This is a great book and one that should be read by students in the United States.  When I saw this story, it really made me realize again how much we take for granted in America, especially education.  It also made me realize the sad role models we have for our girls in the U. S., like Miley Cyrus and Kim Kardashian.  Malala is a true role model.  One who speaks with true conviction for the cause she believes in.  While she is a normal child in the sense that she loves the Twilight movies and shows like Ugly Betty, she also reads \\"A Brief History of Time\\" and eagerly takes her school bag of books with her for her love of reading.  If you want to be inspired, read \\"I am Malala\\".  If you want to restore your faith in the youth of the world, read this book.  If you believe that good can, indeed, overcome evil, then read about Malala.

B00480OHWK|5.0|My son and I read the board book then we enjoyed it so much that I bought the kindle version. We laughed so hard at the Snort. My son still quotes it during our outings. He doesn't know how to read yet, but this helps build his confidence when we read together, laugh and enjoy a great piece for kids and grown ups alike.
B0028NSE3M|4.0|I bought this album for my Great Aunt because she loved ole Isaac since the 70's and had ranted about this album for the longest time.  I listened to it myself one nite drinking with her and I vicariously experienced that wild decade with her through this music. Well worth it!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Just starting to get into trading card games, but this is fun.  Micro transactions don't seem overly instructive.  Can play the game and earn cards or just buy some coins to get booster packs.  I'm ok with in game purchases as long as you are not forced to do so to have fun.
0307341577|4.0|Libby Day was seven years old when her mother and two sisters were massacred in a blood-soaked home invasion classified by the press as \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.\\" It was Libby's testimony which put her then-fifteen-year old brother, Ben, into prison for the rest of his life for the murders of his family. Due to the fact that he was fighting with his mother hours before the event he was the first suspect. Twenty five years later Libby decides to visit Ben in prison where she gets the idea that maybe Ben didn't do it. Libby trys to research the past and find the real killer of her family.<br /><br />This book is a great read with lots of details of what is going on. Each ending of the chapter leaves you hanging and wanting you to read more. I definitely recommend the book to anyone ready for a thrilling book about mystery murder and a torn apart family with one daughter trying to uphold the family name. This book also shows how a family can live with having nothing and the struggle of a single mother trying to save her son and his devilish instincts. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a good easy intense story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWSOME this is the coolest game I ever played this is the best kindle game I have but I do think they need more stuff and faster updating though .
1582701709|4.0|This is a quite nice and very inspiring book. I would like to recommend it to everyone.Thank you  Rhonda Burns.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is really fun but hard to bye New guns. Liked it though you should to. I liked when u see the bullet hit the animals
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Still reading and loving it. More detail than the HBO series and what a bargain! Hope you enjoy the books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much! I have to admit, at first I thought it was stupid, but I'm addicted. This game is so entertaining, especially for the people who LOVEEEEE Despicable Me AND Despicable Me 2! Glad this game was made!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have to say, I'm pretty impressed with the quality that AmazonBasics offers.  The case fits perfectly; there's no gaps, or sliding around the phone unit.  The screen protector that comes with it is another plus.  Put it on very easily with no bubbles or cover misalignment.  I had a Minisuit (Smoke) with circles on the back, and that did a fantastic job protecting the phone, especially from all the times I'd dropped it, but I didn't like the feel of the case.  This case is smooth, has defined edges and is really sleek.  Totally worth the price I paid.  I'd be interested in getting the screen cover separately from AmazonBasics too, if anyone from AB is listening.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun game, my kids and I enjoy playing this game.I could spend hours playing this game, much to keep doing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is really fun and i love the game the prison that crated the game is real awesome and he/she is created the best game ever the best game ever so thank you&middot;
0345530578|1.0|It was like being in middle school again, reading a book you hate because you have a book review due the next day.  No book review due, but a friend recommended this book so I gave it a try. Reading it was a chore.<br />Main problem?  Absolutely no sympathy for the main character.  Wrongly charged initially, but goes on to frame another man putting him through a hell on earth.  The framed man's crime was murdering a \\"dirty\\" judge, not necessarily a murder to my thinking.  More like an extermination.  All the while in on a deal to help a drug dealer with blood on his own hands.  Our hero not only helps the drug dealer, but cozies up to his sister and the whole family of murdering low lifes.<br />And as usual with Grisham, portraying the FBI and law enforcement as the living, breathing embodiment of evil (and the drug dealers as the good guys!!)
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed Orphan Train and thought it was a sweet story. It's a simple read, and I found myself wanting to keep on reading. I would definitely recommend this book.
B008B8DWDU|5.0|Awesome book. Loved it myself and so did my sister and friend who I lent it to.  Really well written. Totally recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read by Stephen King in a very long time.  The Shining, The Stand, Carrie are some of my favorite books and this one is right up there with them.  It was worth every penny.  I lost many hours of sleep because I could not put this book down at night!  I am definitely going to re-read it soon.
B00CD4RPWM|4.0|While I am thrilled to have the Outlander story from Jamie's perspective, and really have enjoyed the book, I do have a difficult time with the graphic novel format. I like to READ a book, not look at pictures. That's odd, because I sure enjoyed reading comic books when I was a kid. The story is excellent, and seeing it from Jamie's perspective is tons of fun. The drawings are excellent. I'd definitely pick this book up to help fill in some gaps in the Jamie/Claire story.
B001BANK32|5.0|Amazing book.  I reread it before I read Dr. Sleep and it was just as good now as it was the first time!
0385350864|3.0|So here's Bridget, back again to  her same old immature, insecure  self,  and with the  same old pals from the '90s,  once again  looking for love and sex...but now, in 2013 at age 51, she's looking mostly on Facebook and Twitter.  She's  also  writing a screenplay about a modern day Hedda Gabler that's garnering some interest from Hollywood and, as always,  is religiously  keeping up that good ol' diary, reporting the day's weight, liquor and caloric consumption and, when applicable, latest Boy Toy relationship status. And wondering why she can't ever seem to find anything appropriate to wear except that same old navy blue silk dress*.<br /><br />So where's Darcy in all this, you ask?  Did he finally realize she'd never grow up, and give up on her?  No,  Darcy's been dead  for five years now, killed by a car bomb while on a do-gooder legal mission to Darfur,  leaving Bridget  financially set for life  and with two little kids, Mabel and Billy, now 5 and  7.  No fond flashbacks to their marriage here or why they left it till their mid to late 40s to start having kids.<br /><br />I find it a mix of amusing and mildly disappointing. Kinda like running into  an old friend and realizing you don't have all that much in common anymore.  Ends pretty much as you'd suspect.  3.5 stars<br /><br />*10/20/13: Went to an appearance by the author today. She was wearing a navy blue silk dress. Very attractive it was, too.
B008P9M614|5.0|All the episodes, of House Md.  All the shows, in a nice little box.  This show is not available on streaming, as of yet, October 2013.  So really, if you’re interested in the show, this is the best deal I’ve found.  I had already seen all the beginning episodes, but have never seen season 7 and 8 and some of 6.  I still never.  I decided to start at the beginning, and get the entire story.  It provides something to look forward towards.  I watch this while I fold towels, and it makes time just jump by.  House is a cool series.
B005M5PENG|5.0|I was worried about how they were going to do the remake of the original since I used to watch it. There have been many remakes of older shows that have failed misearably. This is one show that met and surpassed all my expectations! This show is done wonderfully and I love the cast and crew that brings this show to life every week! Thank you for your wonderful actors, writers and crew who do the original show justice! Thank you!
B00FIYGYKS|5.0|One of their best albums so far, Trivium just keeps stepping up their game, this album his heavy fast and will crush your face!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you ever read The Shining then this is a must read. Great continuation of the story. Sometimes you wonder about characters from books and this really gave you a look into the character's life.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|When it works it's fantastic, but when it doesn't I want to throw my phone out the window!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-it's helped me get to work/home faster and avoid the traffic hotspots plenty of times<br />-it's user-friendly and highlights problem routes clearly (yellow, red, etc.)<br />-it retains your address information so you don't need to add it each time, and it remembers your &#34;favorite&#34; routes<br /><br />Cons:<br />-my voice response doesn't work at all, whether I'm trying to tap & tell it something, or it's sporadically giving me verbal directions. As someone else mentioned, it's hard to look at, submit traffic details, and drive at the same time!! (I wait until I'm at a light)<br />-obviously you rely on other people adding road info, so if they don't add things you can easily be stuck in a traffic jam.<br />-mine seems to crash/freeze randomly...not so much fun when it sends me into an unknown neighborhood in the city!!<br />-the ads in the middle of the screen are extremely annoying when I'm trying to view the map<br />-it takes too long to load when it's rerouting you, and sometimes it doesn't reroute when I think it should.<br />-you can't always tell from the arrows when it's saying &#34;take immediate left&#34; or &#34;bear slightly to the left&#34; if there's a fork in the road.<br /><br />And, on a side note:  the screen disappears when my phone rings (Samsung Galaxy)...so again, have had to stop driving to adjust back to the screen or get lost!<br /><br />While there may be lots of cons, I do still use it, hoping that all the glitches will eventually be corrected in updates.
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|This movie came highly recommended so I rented/purchased it as soon as it became available online.  While the action was strong and the acting solid, the concept floundered towards the middle.  At times I felt as if I were watching a high tech version of Legend (Will Smith) but in the end, the antagonizing force left a bit to be desired.  I would place it somewhere between iRobot and Legend for quality and watchability.  For true Tom Cruise fans, this is a decent watch.  For Morgan Freeman fans, you'd be better served by punching yourself.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Good read, not sure it lived up to the hype though. I can recommend it as a light read.<br />Regards,
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Well paced, filled with action, mystery, intrigue and more humor than I expected, but not in a detracting manner. Quite the opposite, actually. Definitely worth getting.<br /><br />It lacks a bit of the epic feel of 'A Song of Fire and Ice' and 'Lord of the Rings,' but compensates with a strong sense of adventure.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is because, even by the end of the book, the different character plots haven't really intertwined, nor the main plot become apparent. But this hardly detracts from the vibrant story telling, or compelling nature of the book.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|An entertaning suspense that leaves you wanting more! I enjoyed the story of two boys meeting a &#34;hobo&#34; on an island. What could you expext but knives, guns and snakes.
B0000266T2|5.0|This album is a National Treasure. Unique and revised versions of previously produced songs add to the value of this album. I enjoy the sound of the crowd in Central Park as well as the iconic narrative provided by Simon & Garfunkel. Great reunion of two masters.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is so addictive even my mom plays this game and I asked her one day if she liked it and she said that she does like coin dozer and I gave it four stars because of the advertisements
B000MZHW40|5.0|Action & Adventure from beginning to end. Beautiful scenery and landscape.  Both actors have good chemistry and worked well together.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great follow up to &#34;The Shining&#34;.  Stephen King at his best and his scariest to date.  Can't put it down.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Very interesting to learn about the Russian Mafia and how they work similar to the American Mafia as they run a restaurant.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I missed this CD when in came out a number of years ago. I'm glad I ran across it. It has quickly become one of my favorites - certainly the best I've purchased in a few years. From the very beginning I liked the well-produced quality of these bluesy numbers. As some have mentioned, it does not have the spontaneous passion that Clapton can sometimes give us. But still the songs run pleasingly from one to another, reflecting the well-honed skill and sensitivity of the artists in both lyrics and sound. All fans of JJ and Slowhand should have this CD.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I thought this was a quick, easy to comprehend, helpful book. I liked that he put in recipes for fasting days. It's amazing how much veggies and lean protein one can consume on a 500-600 caloric allowance. Veggies are definitely the way to go for fasting days.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read book because children loved it. Very good book. Definitely stirs your imagination. I can understand why my pre-teen children enjoyed this book and the rest of the series.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A NICE FUN GAME TO PLAY.  FOUND OUT THAT I AM NOT THE FASTEST AT PLAYING IT, BUT IT IS A FUN ONE.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|The plot will hold you throughout the read. For law court action<br />this is one of the best.<br /><br />The characters come to life. Mick and Harry should be paired<br />more often.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|AT FIRST I WAS NOT ALL SURE IF I LIKED THIS HIDDEN OBJECT GAME AS MUCH AS I DO SOME OTHERS, BUT THE MORE I GET INTO IT, THE BETTER I FIND IT.  IT'S GOOD!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A worthy successor to the Shining. I was actually mad that I finished it so quickly, hopefully Abra will have more adventures.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is my girlfriends fav book. Had to get when she saw King in NY. But like all books if you read it 10years again it's the same! Must re-read if you are looking into Dr. Seep.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|You should get it sometimes it's easy to pass level hundred TEMPLE OF MONKEY GOD ROCKS listen to me and get it because blooms suck monkeys RULE
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy Candy Crush Saga is back on Kindle. I have played every fake version of this game, and none of them compared to the original. Thank you Kindle for making my favorite game available again.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|love this game but dislike the need to spend actual $$. hate the fact that ihave over 350000 bananas but can't use them to upgrade. yeah I can spend 150k on mom but I don't like mom! the banana aspect is flawed! I can deal with spending a few bucks bu I sense a lot of greed here. too bad!
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you were to ask my family, they would say I'm on Pinterest way too much.  I love browsing through all the pix and info.  Definitely my favorite tool on the internet!
B00F2362IE|3.0|Freezes up my kindle constantly. Other then that it's a fun game. My 5 year old loves to play this game with his dad. If it didn't freeze I would give it a five star.
B009EDUCDO|4.0|Very good movie, great music. Can relate to these characters. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is hilarious in this film. I ended up buying this one.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Another wonderful book by the creator of the Sandman series! Tapping into myth is is specialty and this does not fail to deliver! A wonderful story tinged with the mysteries of the universe and the fabric of existence!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Finally got to watch the first season.  It was fantastic.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat through every episode.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I definitely recommend this movie!  A lot of people complain about how fast the zombies are in this movie and how fast the virus can take affect.  Basically they did not like the fact how the human race can be wiped out so fast and that it was nothing compared to the Walking Dead.  But I loved it and I loved the fact that it was different from all the other zombie movies.
B003SQVI54|5.0|This is a very funny show and I love amazon.com's instant video. This is a very good purchase I enjoyed.
B005LHO274|5.0|If you love the sky and it's contents, this app is a must!!! I only wish my Kindle fire had the abilities needed for live mode!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed the game and the fact that there aren't any hints, you simply have to use your brain and figure it out. Short but plenty of fun for free.
B0074D3CAQ|1.0|I found the story contrived and lacked depth. I found it easy to figure out, early, the &#34;surprise&#34; character in the book. The main character was childish as was the writing. It is an easy read, and if is this is your preference, then go for it. If you prefer character development, a well developed plot, interesting subjects, then find another book.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I caught pieces of this series on TV so bought the dvd and after watching the whole series it seem pretty realistic.
B00EUS6FR0|5.0|When I Heard it, I felt like I was so so away..in the Land of relaxing and enjoying... :D<br />Just Love it!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A very interesting and compelling story.  It's something so unusual.  I couldn't put it down.  I was fascinated by her adventure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'M JUST TICKLED THIS IS FINALLY ON MY KINDLE... NO MORE TINY SCREEN PLAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I will be playing this pretty much constantly.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Great game. A little short though. The only reason I couldn't give it five stars is that the full version is much too expensive.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A very good book. I could not put the book down until it was finished. I would definitely recommend this book
B00C4QFQQG|5.0|One of my favorite movies of my childhood, and one of the first action films I viewed as a young movie-lover. From acting to dialogue to costuming to set design, there is something for everyone in this movie. Warren Beatty does an incredible job bringing Tracy to the big screen, and all of the villains are lush representations of their 2-D selves as imagined by Chester Gould. Any true Tracy fan worth their salt will want to see and enjoy this!
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|this doll is the best of time .Make more plz.I love the dolls so much.omg lol fyi buy it now
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was sooo excited to finally get my Candy Crush wish on Amazon`s Kindle fire HD !! Thanks for delivering again Amazon : )!! Amazing app so fast n very cooperative in terms of response Love it!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is smooth and doesnt cheat like other games...my little sister loves this game and loves the monthly themes they make
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Like: characters, story rack, style.<br />It was an extremely enjoyable read. I don't often get time to read so I was glad it was so good.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Hard to believe that a book on writing could be considered a page turner, but this book is just that.  I found his focus, more on his experiences and how he writes, more motivating than any other book I've read on this topic.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked this book much more than I anticipated.  I had no idea that there was ever an &#34;Orphan's Train&#34; organization.  Perhaps the history is more fascinating than the story.  The paths that converge to bring Molly and Vivian together is carefully charted.  The link between the Train and today's foster system slowly becomes clear.  It will make you head straight to researching the Orphan Train yourself.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|It doesn't show up in Apps either on the Cloud group or the Device Group. Too bad, because I was hoping it was a better browser than the very lame Silk included with the KFHD.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game because I compete against myself. I am always trying to improve my time. Fun time for all.
0143038419|4.0|Any book that claims to describe a journey to X, X, and X will typically get my attention.  I love to travel and the travel memoir is but one way I see the world through other people's eyes.  I debated what rating to give this book - if I were to rate it just on the story, it would be a 5.  Gilbert is a masterful story teller and writer - I found myself drawn into her world.<br /><br />It's a wonderful story of a woman experiencing Italy, India, and Indonesia - exploring her inner world, and seeing herself anew.  I would like to meet Elizabeth Gilbert - based solely on this work she must be a hugely optimistic positive person?  I mean really - divorce, depression, sufficient income to take off for a year to travel, Italy, India, and Indonesia...and oh yea, you get the guy in the end.<br /><br />Now I suspect - the backstory is not nearly as optimistic and bubble-gummy as this.  But honestly as I read other people's reviews I laughed out loud given I had some of the same reactions.  This is important though. One of my fundamental assumptions is that the stories we tell reveal a great deal about ourselves what we value.  We learn a great deal about Gilbert by what she included, what she may have excluded, the tone with which she recollects, etc.  I wonder though if she had blogged her experiences in real time would we have the same tenor to the overall memoir?!  All to say - we learn a great deal about Gilbert in this book.  Thanks for sharing!
0345529057|5.0|I really enjoyed all the books, and after reading them you have to see watch the series, because it is awesome and it captures the idea of what the books were describing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King does it again. Another gripping story with great characters. I really enjoyed this book, it was a great read, kept me interested and wanting more.
B00C2C637I|4.0|This book was magnificently written, and the word choice is impeccable. Sometimes it's a little difficult to figure out what's going on, but a great story by Bradbury.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A great game with awasome upgrades!!!!!!<br />I would recommend this for adults. and children.  It's. great fun!!!!!!! The monster. truck is the best!!!
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Great Double Album. The straight Gov't Mule. Has a mixture of Blues, Soul, and R and B. The second is a mixture of Special Guest that will Blow you Away.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Bought this movie for my husband and he really enjoyed it as did our grandsons. Great time had by all and will watch it again
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Charlie Star and the boys has proven that Southern Rock and Roll is still Alive and Well. Great Studio Album. But Live shows are even better. Check this band out.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love how you can adjust the difficulty to make it as hard as you want when play the computer. the multiplayer option is also very fun.
B000069HZP|5.0|This is a well written, acted and thought out movie. I have bought multiple copies for friends. I just want them to enjoy it as much as I did.
B00EU9VCKO|2.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire mainly cause it was free and I love photography so always looking for new editing apps but even though it did have some cool tools there is as others have pointed out no way to unedit, lack of color manipulation tools, etc...and then to top it off when I was just working on a photo, walked away for a minute and now half of the effects and frames are part of PRO that I need to pay for? Why? If it was free with those tools before then how come you are trying to charge me now? I could see if you added a slew of new tools or capabilities but it doesn't seem that way...so why should I pay even if it is only $1.32. Not happy with free no longer being free...will look for another app
B0044XV3R8|5.0|What a great mind thought of this. The graphics, color and entire ambiance is electrifying. I enjoyed this very much.
B00F91H666|5.0|This movie is so well done.  It moves along well with non stop action.  Thoroughly entertaining.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|Terrible movie. Waste of time. The movie was very slow paced and didn't lead up to anything, no suspense. I'm glad I didn't waste money watching this at the theater. Very disappointing.
B00459GJUM|5.0|Great story arcs.  Wish it was still on.  Does not end in a cliffhanger.  (thank God)  I hate when they do that.
B000ICRKLM|4.0|If you are looking for relief from all of the reality shows and honey booboo this is the place to be. All of the episodes are interesting sci-fi without all of the needless and, in many cases, spectacular [and unbelievable] special effects. Dr. McKay has to be one of my favorite characters of all time. The actors ability to totally change his personality amazes me. All in all, an enjoyable way to pass an hour.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The only thing that kept me from giving it 5stars is that the pictures are way too dark for older eyes to see the hidden objects. Otherwise a really fun way to pass the time.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|I can't wait to surprise some of my friends with this superb anniversary edition of the Woodstock music festival of 1969
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Can't get enough. Need more coins please. Glitch free so far. Got my family hooked on it now. Nothing bad to say about this app.
B008D563IC|5.0|Great Movie!!!  Would recommend this to my friends. Enjoyed watching the old crew together again. &#34;One Time At Band Camp&#34; My favorite line
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart really unfolded well, had great charter build, and totally surprises at the end.  Sanderson is getting better and better... 5 stars for this book!
B0082FPIY8|4.0|My wife suggested this book. I started reading and I couldn't believe that a book about a walk could be so riveting. Its not just about a walk. Its about one woman's journey and is beautifully written. I found it interesting to see life through the eyes of a modern woman too. Highly recommended.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a love story that happened in the early 1900's during the war. It has many happy moments, but more sad events that happened to those who lived through the war. It was informative and gave a picture of life during wartime which was very painful to know about. It will touch the hearts of the readers. This story is interesting to those who have lived and lost men who fought to protect their families. A picture painted by Sophie's husband weaves throughout the story and binds the story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|i loved it sooo much but i hated that gus died it killed me ugh but it was amazing anyways!! i strongly encourage everyone to read this book it teaches you to enjoy the simpler things in life.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is very addictive. The multiple grid sizes keep the game fresh. I think it is worth the cost.
B00D4LKOVC|5.0|My daughter is into mermaids and really liked this oldie but goodie.  I forgot about the bare bottom scenes though, but otherwise it was pretty harmless.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|delightful  The cast was well chosen and complement each other. would like to see again  I am sure I missed some words
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play a lot of biongo games and this is favorite. Just wish it gave more daily credits. I refuse to pay that much money for something like this.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that is truly excellent in every way. \\"The King's Speech\\" is one such movie. Set in England between World Wars One and Two, its principle characters are Bertie (Colin Firth), the second in line to the throne, and a commoner, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist and emigre from Australia. When King George V dies and King Edward shortly thereafter abdicates (in order to marry a commoner), Bertie (as he is known to his friends) becomes King George VI. A retiring man who hates public appearances and speeches because of his speech impediment, George VI seems utterly unsuited to be the ruler who will lead England through the dark days of the Second World War.<br /><br />Bertie's wife (Helen Bonham Carter), better known to the current generation as Queen Mother Elizabeth, takes him to speech therapist after speech therapist. Nothing works until he meets Logue. Although their relationship is sometimes stormy, a bond grows between them as Logue's method begins to work. This bond lasts not just through the duration of the war (during which time Logue is present at every radio speech given by the king), but until the death of George VI.<br /><br />Not only is this a wonderful and heartwarming story, one that well portrays the unusual bond between royalty and commoner, but the performance of all the principle actors is outstanding. This is a movie that is clearly worth watching.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and interesting. Some of the puzzles too creative but challenging. Good game to help pass the time. I would like to see more levels.
B000NTHT6G|5.0|\\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is two stories that are artfully melded into a seamless movie. There is first of all the quirky story of Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), an IRS auditor, who awakens one day to hear a voice narrating his life. The voice belongs to author Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), who is writing a novel in which Crick is the main character. She is, of course, ignorant of the fact that her characters exist in real life. In itself, this is a difficult concept to pull off, and \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" does an excellent job in this regard. However, if this were the sum and substance of the story, the movie would be worth at best four stars.<br /><br />What makes the movie worth five stars is that there is also the story in which Harold Crick is involved in real life. Assigned to audit a suspicious return, Harold meets the lovely Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who bakes and sells cookies in her little shop, and who has refused to pay the portion of her income taxes that go to support the military. Right from the start one senses that despite the fact that these two are in an adversarial relationship, a fire has been kindled between them. Over time, as Harold and Ana have further contact, the fire develops into a full-blown romantic relationship.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it becomes evident that Karen Eiffel, as she works on her novel, is going to bump off Harold, its major character. And so, in addition to the warmhearted romantic story of Harold and Ana, we are confronted with the suspense of whether or not Ms. Eiffel can be persuaded to rethink the ending of her novel.<br /><br />This is indeed a unique and enjoyable movie. The acting is great. (Ferrell in particular steps out of his usual over-the-top role.) And the concept is pulled off to perfection. It's certainly worth watching.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is excellent! There is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't get this game.<br /><br />1: You receive 20 Amazon coins when you install this app.<br /><br />2: The app itself is a great brain stretcher. It really makes you think.<br /><br />3: The whole family can have fun with this game.<br /><br />The object of the game is to solve puzzles and find objects that will help you unlock the elevator and move up in levels. The puzzles are actually pretty hard (but not impossible) and it takes some real thought and logic to move up in levels. I love the variations in puzzles and level difficulty.<br /><br />There is absolutely no excuse...you need to install this app! :)
0312370849|5.0|This is a wonderful story of the fate of a Jewish family!!  I treasure my hard covered book and I will read it again!!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Probably the best game/app thing that I've downloaded.  Fun, easy, mesmerizing, sweet, radical, etc and it was cheap so there's a plus there.
B009YY91QC|5.0|Awesome for my 2 yr old, she loves it!!<br />Calming, yet entertaining, has optional moments to dance and sing along :-)

B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is perfect nothing can top it but for kindle fire the blow challenge would not work<br />BUT BEST GAME EVER!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok this is a awsome awsome game. I however can think that would be cool.<br />-there should be days pass in creative mode.<br />-there should be a option to turn on monsters in creative mode<br />-there should be able to use TNT in creative mode<br />-should be able to craft bouts and fishing rods<br />Those are a few things that are not there and I wish they were is a 1342245424434553 6654665_e 67886678887787777772234663 6654665_the 1167622 3556 star game! Get it. You'll thank me later.
1781162646|3.0|I had higher expectations for this book.  Tempo too slow, not in the least scary.  Only reason I give it a three is because the reader did want to figure out &#34;who done it&#34;.  But even that was not too difficult - only question left was motive.  This is not one of King's best.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|A well written, great story line with interesting characters but what a 'let down' at the end.  Maybe a Gone Girl book 2?
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|A nice, indulgent journey for the band... very enjoyable.<br />Some very strong 80's like sounds and vibes.  Great for the road trip.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game definitely gets your brain working through many different activities. I just wish there were more levels. The best part is how you really have to think outside of the box to solve many of the problems.<br /><br /> .
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book has giving me back something that I have been missing out on. Taking time out to live and love compassionately.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've used this for a year now and haven't found a problem. It works great and its very simple to use. I don't know how it works on kindle fire HD or kindle paperwork, but it works perfectly on a kindle fire.
B0061S073A|5.0|After my 3 year old's Kindle shenanigans (including over $40 worth of Angry Birds upgrades), this was exactly the app I needed!  It not only allows me to block apps I don't want him using, but I can use it to disable the wi-fi and make it lock him out after a specified amount of time, and since it's password protected, my son can't bypass it, bwahahaha!  Mom wins! :-)  Also, the app is very easy to use and set up.  Setting the timer takes a couple steps, but they're quick and easy (quick enough that I can do it with a whiny 3 year old grabbing for the Kindle).  This app is a must for anyone who has a small child, who accesses their device.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This is the first time that I have read anything of this author's work. I have already ordered the next book in this series. Can't wait to read them all.
B005XUC398|4.0|One interesting thing about the movie is that from the very beginning, I was constantly trying to label the good guys and the bad guys, since this the good-bad polarization of characters is typical of most mass production movies.  However, the more I got into the movie, the more I realized that there was no good guy or bad guy.  Every character was a mix of both good and bad.  The way this is presented is very well done in such a way that there is no simple conclusion after watching the movie but just many questions.  Another interesting factor is that none of the major players is exempt from greed, and every character has a way to rationalize that there is nothing wrong with their individual actions, it is always somebody else's fault and they are just caught in the middle.  Of course from a systems perspective every character is greedy and their collective actions is what accounts for the whole corporate greed.  Clearly a movie to make you think about the current economic situation, more specifically about the ethics of wall street.
1593275080|5.0|So many amazing photos with creativity shown, I feel so excited on the content and so impressed on the maker's creativity.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book grabs you at the first page and keeps a hold on you throughout.  The story is a good one, on a subject we don't like to be reminded.  The characters are wonderful.  Reminded me of &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34;.
B00F143QQ0|3.0|I thought the special edition is the core reactor shown on the box is LED but in fact not, but it's not the problem on the seller, just I didn't check the details myself.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I actually like my FB better on the Kindle. The pics are so good and much larger than my PC without having to enlarge them
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This album is fresh and exiting, I here Beatles, Wings and the Fireman in this LP. So let me break this LP by song: \\"Save Us\\" is a great album opener, great ROCKER song. It really sets the mood of the LP. Song number two, \\"Alligator\\" This is my favorite song. I love the acoustic guitar and electric guitar. Paul's voice when the song slows down a bit and the music quiets. That falsetto like voice \\"Could you be that person for me? Would you feel right setting me free? could you dare to find my key!\\" Such great vocals and lyrics. Third song, \\"On my way to work\\". This song I think is about one of his first jobs. I really like the beat of this song and the guitar.Fourth song \\"Queenie eye\\", Is another great song and I think it's one of his singles. I think it's funny to hear Paul McCartney to here him say \\"Dogs and Bitches\\"it's a very upbeat song. fifth song, \\"Early Days\\". At first, when i listened to this song I didn't care for it. Then I listened to it again and I enjoy it now. Why I didn't care for this song is because I thought his voice was a little rocky. I don't mean it in a bad way. I now think his voice is appropriate for this song, talking of the past and aging. sixth song, \\"NEW\\"; \\"NEW\\" is a fun tune and has a good beat. seventh song \\"Appreciate\\",is alright. \\"Appreciate\\" is a bit slower and not as exiting, but not bad. It's a decent Macca song. I had to listen to this song to \\"Appreciate\\" it more! :) sorry I had to do that. Eighth song, \\"Everybody out there\\", is not bad I ,love the lyrics and the vocals. The guitar man, I dig it \\"Everybody out there, Whoa!\\" Ninth song,\\"Hosanna\\". This is my least favorite track on the LP. It's dull and slow, that's all I have to say about this one. tenth song, \\"I Can Bet\\". WOW I love this song, great beat, gets my head bopping. That's the great thing about Paul McCartney's songs, he always cheers me up, with his uplifting songs. Eleventh song, \\"Looking at her\\". I like the guitar at the beginning and I like the lyrics. Paul has to be talking about his wife Nancey. twelfth song, \\"Road\\", is not bad. I had to listen to it a few times to enjoy the lyrics. thirteenth song, \\"Turned out\\". This song really reminds me something off a Wings LP, especially the guitar in it.fourteenth song, \\"Get me out of here/ medley\\", this songs gives you a retro feeling 50s kinda with the guitar. When Paul sings \\"Oh Boy\\" reminds me of Buddy Holly, probably because he has a song called \\"Oh Boy\\",It's just my opinion. in this is also \\"Scared\\", which is OK. Well that's my review, It's one of my first Album reviews, so I hope I did okay. Cheers and enjoy!be talking about his wife Nancey. twelfth song, \\"Road\\", is not bad. I had to listen to it a few times to enjoy the lyrics. thirteenth song, \\"Turned out\\".

B009EHDU7U|4.0|I particularly liked the way historical facts were blended into Allan's experience and his inherent avoidance of politics.<br />It goes to show you that it is never too late to start something new even when you are 100 years old.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Wow, had to watch it again! This movie was well put together. The characters were enjoyable to watch and there were so many twists that it kept you interested in not wanting to miss any part. Can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|It's the middle of the night right now - I honestly couldn't put it down.<br /><br />What a story, and beautifully written! I feel even now as if I was the public that they were talking to, believing one story, then switched completely and believing the other. I enjoyed it immensely and am sorry it had to end!
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I thought most of the actors did a fine job and it stayed with<br />me after I viewed it.  The amazing capabilities of such young<br />men when asked to do the impossible was effectively portrayed.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I love the book! It was action-packed and didn't drag on a lot.  The beginning was confusing, but overall, it was very explainable and emotional! I can't wait to readThe Son of Neptune
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was by far without a doubt hands down my absolute Favorite book of the entire hunger games book trilogy .
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Nice to know what happened to Danny Torrence. Wraps up some of the Shining. It's a good read. There are some really biggish holes and repeated use of deus ex machina, but it's a good read and entertaining. Better than television. So many authors use their AA experience in their novels. Between James Lee Burke and Stephen King I feel like I know an awful lot about AA without ever having gone to a meeting.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Love this game.  I didn't think it was anything special at first glance, but it has given me many hours of enjoyment now.  The rules are simple, yet it is quite different from other types of Tetris.  I like both modes of game play.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this game - lots of puzzles, with several different &#34;action&#34; icons to add variety as the levels proceed.  Fun animation, sounds and music to go along with it.  Definitely a keeper, five stars.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS is AWESOME! great season! Havent finished it yet but looking forward to it! DiNozzo is my favorite character ever.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This is the best hidden object game I have played.  The feel is great - the puzzles are colorful, varied and fun, puzzle levels proceed along the framework of an enjoyable and interesting story, and a really well-done musical background completes the atmosphere of the game.  Five stars for sure!
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very good story. A glimps of a reallitively unknown part of american history.  I have always been interested in children and the various interesting events that formed their future.
B00CHVJODE|4.0|I didn't get to the theater to watch this simply due to not knowing what to expect (meaning I didn't want to potentially spend money on a bad movie if it turned out that way).  I was pleased with the movie.  I have two young children (6 & 4) and they really had a great time watching it.  It was good enough that I wanted to watch it again within a couple days.  I see some people don't like it with the role the father figure gets, but it's poking fun at cavemen.  It also includes a modern tension that arises when the father can't stand a boy (Guy) who the daughter is falling for him.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Can't stop watching.  Love the legal twists and love triangle between the characters.  Everyone is connected and they are finally seeing that
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|All of us are having lots of fun with this one.  The kids  can come up with a lot of the answers and they are learning their letters as they type in the answers.  Some take some more thought which makes it fun for the grown-ups too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft duz lots of stuffy tinkles. No endermen or villages. Very stinkies. Cookoes are fluffy. I wuv minecraft. Oops I pottied in my panys. Buy buy guys!
B000I3UMKM|4.0|Good movie and a great way to watch a movie when no available to watch at home. Love the service.
1609611543|5.0|I FOUND THE BOOK VERY INTERESTING. I STARTED IT AND FEEL GOOD ALREADY. AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS I NEVER MISSED BREAD
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It is well written. Good insight on how the war has affected soldiers and their families.<br />Read it worth the time
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While this is a &#34;Beta&#34; product it is very promising.<br />Easy to set up and use, reduces the need for a smart TV by actually acting as one by transforming a regular TV to a &#34;Smart TV&#34;.<br /><br />There are some bugs and I am guessing they will be fixed, nothing that can't be worked around
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game rocks!!! I wanna B a minion now!!! my bud taught me and helps me a lot. although it gets hard at times, this really is a great app!!!!
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|Hate it. I cannot make it look up specific words without going from a to z to get there. Even free.....not worth it.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I saw this movie on a whim back when it came out in theaters, and loved it so much, I had to purchase it.  Yeah, it reminds me of a knock-off from a mecha anime movie/series, but I think that's what makes it so good.  Plus, there's a hint of romance and jealousy in it, nothing that's too heavy, but it's just enough to add flavor to the movie.  The acting was good, the script well written.  I loved the doctors, they cracked me up so many times.  The kiajus (not sure that's the right spelling) were exceptionally made.  And I loved the little hint into their world at the end.  Great pyrokinetics, and an over all great movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the greatest really but the only thing I hate about it is that you always need internet for it to work or wi-fi but other than that this  game is the best
0345536886|4.0|Took this on a trip and it was a great travel book. Good story and well written. Nothing deep though,
B00364K6YW|5.0|Very well done and can be quite emotional. Every one was wonderful(except Mrs. Bennett was pretty annoying). You just fall in love with Elizabeth for standing by principles. This is by far the best version. Compared to others it's like gold to tin.
B005LAII80|5.0|This was my favorite movie of last year.  I wasn't expecting much, but this movie blew me away in every possible way.  The story is great, the action is brutal and intense, and Karl Urban is PERFECT as Dredd.  Buy this movie, then BEG for a sequel!
B00F56AZK4|1.0|I need something to play on the go. this does not work without Wifi. Please tell me how I can tell the ones that need Wifi.
B00513DGIO|5.0|This book is a fascinating look at human relations with each other and society through debt. I'm not normally a book reader, however I was recommended to pick up this book and I haven't regretted the decision.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I'm going to be honest,the game had me addicted. Maybe the saying is true &quot;Time flys when your having fun but not in this case.It has noticeably dropped my battery down from a 100% on my Kindle fire to 94% in less than 7 minutes,and yes I timed it! It may not seem like a big deal to most people,but trust me that's a bad sign of wearing down the internal battery,and could cause it to lose life twice as fast as usual.(TURN THE BRIGHTEST ALL THE WAY DOWN.)
B0040I09RM|3.0|It's O.K. I plan to continue and watch all the series and believe it has the potential to be really good. Right now it is setting everything up. Actors are great and the characters are matter of fact cold blooded. It beats the hell out of Network Dramas.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|It's free and it does a lot of really neat things.  It has  an incredible database of really good music
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The book was easy to read and made a lot of sense. It helped to refresh my mind on some of the hidden traits that influence relationships.
B00CN3R2DK|5.0|A friend of mine got her and when I saw her I wanted her, too.  I saw Sabrina and Roman Holiday as a child, so the nostalgia thing worked for me, too.
B009X011UQ|3.0|This case was OK.  It doesn't stand up too well when you are using it and it also does not give you great access to your sound or on-off buttons.
0061148512|1.0|Sometimes I feel like someone somewhere decides that something is a classic and that everyone should read it.  In the case of The Bell Jar, I feel that the final tragic event of Sylvia Plath's life and the corollaries evident through the book, make people claim this is a \\"classic\\".  I felt the book was very articulate melancholy.  Ms. Plath was obviously very adept with words and the art of writing.  Yet, I just don't get why a meandering plot, filled with analogy after analogy, after metaphor and after simile equate to a \\"classic\\".  Give me a good story, an epic setting, a captivating plot, intricate relationships and a memorable character. That's a classic.  Dickens, Tolstoy, even Ken Follett.<br /><br />For what it's worth, I feel the same way about JD Salinger's Catcher in the Rye.  Directionless, articulate melancholy. Despite both being on standard high school reading lists, I don't think I would want my teenage son or daughter to experience either and a foray into the dark side of the mind during very impressionable high-school years.  Depression, suicide, and isolation are all topics that should not be glorified in teenagers and are best experienced once more mature.  I can easily see how a different, lonely, awkward, troubled, insecure teenager might relate to the acclaimed stories of young adults and suicide; that are actually written by adults.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|An enjoyable sci-fi story with the human experience at its core. Howey deftly tackles well-trod themes such as the individual vs. society, the need for hope, and other tropes of the human condition. A fun read.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|this game is super!  my granddaughter and myself have so much playing it.  The game causes you to think about your moves, its good for grandma too!
B000RIWAVW|1.0|I purchased this dvd last year. I din't watch it until now and it is either a blank or blue ray. I does not work.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I only do this for the free apdates coming sorry for the thing of appdates I really don't now how to type that word on :D<br />but really I like this APP
B000XXGMRO|5.0|I have no complaints here, loved these boots. I'm ordering another pair in a different color. It definitely exceeded my expectations.
B006546EPA|5.0|It is a very good bargain since it has over 35 hours of music.  He writes wonderful tone poems as well as other symphonies.
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|Justin is truly an versatile artist. Totally disagree with critics that said part 1 was better, personally prefer part 2.
B00FDSV4TA|5.0|Chester does fit in well with STP. It also seems like the other band members have more time in the spotlight (guitar solos finally).
B00E9E4E50|5.0|I have Val's Chopin CD/DVD combo, her Rachmaninov Concertos, and her Debut Recital at Royal Albert Hall.  I simply love everything she plays.  Particularly interesting on here is the Ballade No. 2, played on the Bosendorfer Imperial Grand.  I love the roaring sound of the piano using those extras bass keys as she plays the interlocking octave passages!<br /><br />There's also plenty of the more gentle music of Liszt on here - that would be the Schubert-Liszt Transcriptions, including a wonderful performance to start the CD off with Ave Maria.<br /><br />Please get this CD and support this wonderful artist!
B001ATN3QS|5.0|The DVD n download r the same price n I THOUGHT I was getting the DVD.  When the movie was sent to me in an email I thought no problem...It took FOREVER to download via AMAZON UNBOX took five or six times to get it to play on my computer which is less than a year old Dell.  I tried to send it to my SMART TV but the signal was movie is encrypted n would not play on the TV.  I could see a 4x6 version on my COMPUTER screen with all this other JUNK on the screen so I just shut it down.  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN AMAZON.  I tried contacting them but evidently they don't have any support on UNBOX.<br /><br />THE MOVIE IS A CLASSIC...LOTS OF GREAT CHARACTERS Players. AWESOME AWESOME MOVIE.  A MOVIE I WILL WATCH ON DVD MANY MANY TIMES.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|Becky Brandon is now a mother, and her daughter Minnie seems slightly out of control...she also knows a lot about brand names, VISA, and Starbucks for a two year old. On top of their worries about Minnie, Becky and Luke are still living at Becky's parents house after having multiple house deals fall through and are close to their wits end dealing with parents, a toddler, and the failing economy all at once. Becky has the idea that a surprise birthday party for Luke could turn it all around for them and make everyone happy, but has no idea of the time and expense it will take. This time, Becky might be in over her head with no one to step up and save the day for her.<br /><br />While still a humourous, entertaining, read Becky's lying to cover up messes she's gotten herself into becomes a bit tiring here. You think she would have learned by now that telling the truth would avoid half her troubles, including hurting her mother's and other friend's feelings. She does seem to mature a bit in this one and realize the impact she could be having on her young daughter as well as learn that sometimes leaning on friends and family is the right choice to make. I really hope that there are more Becky books in the future...as long as she matures a bit.
B001BANK32|5.0|One of Stephen King's finest books. The movie did not do justice to this book. So much more entertaining than the movie.
B00FEN000S|4.0|the end is kinda weak I thought, compared to the first 2/3, which actually makes you feel the movie. Quiet suspenseful and the effects are top notch. Definitely worth seeing!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great great misdirection film.  I truly enjoyed it.  Even if you shutter when you think of folk like David Copperfield or magic hacks, trust me, don't pass this movie by.  Great cast and great misdirection overall!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Fast, ergonomic, heavy enough, offers great grip and all buttons provide complete click feedback. Also, this mouse is affordable  Enough said.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book (and the entire series).  The high ratings are well-deserved.<br /><br />The story line is original and powerful. I think in many ways, the appeal of the book comes from the way Hugh Howey plays out the secrets of the silos...  much like LOST, except in this case, the ended didn't suck.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this a very addictive game. I love it and my six year old grand daughter loves it too.  I only wish there was more levels but otherwise it is fun.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Best book I've read in years. Brilliant writing with characters that warm your heart and make you look at life a little differently. A must read.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|i love how it wakes up me the deepest sleeper on earth and how it helps me go to sleep cuz i dont ever fall asleep without something
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|love the show video was great just wish our cable co. provided amc<br />i really don't like doing these reviews just rating would be fine
B00915G6SU|5.0|Amazingly awesome good to see the team in action especially with new recruit Blake, silencer case was my favourite :)
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The concept is great but more apps are needed like pandora, tune-in, etc. Also, you can chromecast web pages but not all video will show up.<br /><br />If you have an older tv with an HDMI input it is a no-brainer as you can make such tv's &#34;smart&#34; (albeit with access right now only to netflix, google music, you tube).  You do need a power source for it, though.  Only the newer tvs have powered hdmi or powered usb (you can plug the unit into an outlet or a powered usb port for power).<br /><br />The other thing that would be nice is if they allow you to play content from a local, networked library (support for MX Player would be awesome).
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|This is a cute point and click puzzle game. Playing on Kindle fire hd. Seems to work fine so far. Music is pleasant. Characters are quirky and cute. The puzzles aren't too hard but do take some thought.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy CCS was added to the app store. I adore this app fun and addicting. Thanks Amazon!
B005KITK6C|5.0|Perfect gift for a five year old that is into building/putting things together. My nephew has been collecting Lego sets since he learned ow to walk.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|We watched this as a reward for my 7th graders at their lunch time and they really liked it.  There is a little bit of cursing but the story is really well written and relatable.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I LOVE Twitter and Instagram and all of that but some times it is annoying and stuff I thought why do I have to get It on my iPhone and why not get It on my IPad so I downloaded it and it works better on my IPad instead of my kindle and kindle fire HD!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A must read. Would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat! Definitely won't disappoint. Powerful and sweet wrapped into one story that you don't want to see end. Tissues required all the way through.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|I was very disappointed in this app.  It did not impact my kindle speed at all. Just moved files around.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm has so many settings its really easy to find one that works for you. I can't imagine waking up without it.
B000W453KQ|4.0|The movie was great. The only reason it received 4 stars is because it would continuously pause throughout the movie from the website.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have ever read. It can be depressing at times but the story is fantastic. It is such a fun ride in a new world. I am not a big fan of love stories in books and I felt this one was done correctly. There are a few errors I found in the book but not many and certainly none of them hurt the quality of the book. If you think it sounds at all interesting READ IT. After I had to stop reading for about 2 weeks because everything I picked up afterwards was horrible in comparison I just wanted to go back to my silo.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|We loved the movie. The picture quality was terrible as the result of too many people in our family using the internet while we were watching the movie.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Used to love it, now it locks up frequently, fails to load content, and just stops working too often to be useful.<br />Kindle Fire HD 7.  :(
0345529057|5.0|I'm obsessed with the TV show and I love to read so buying this seemed like common sense to me. And I'm glad I did buy it! I've just read through the first book of the series and I'm so glad I bought them all at the same time because I'm have a feeling I'm going to fly through reading the rest. It's amazing and I can't wait to read more!
006178480X|4.0|So far I find this book good.  I love quantum physics and glad to see Rollins has weaved this into the book.  Although I have not completed the book it is a good read.  I, however, find that it isn't one that I just can't put down, I can, and come back several days later.
0780648838|4.0|I love this book.. I was not happy because of its ending. It touched my heart. I wanna watch its movie.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Yet again King puts his heart into his work.....absolutely love his work! Hope it goes to the big screen as a sequel to The Shining.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It should update the same thing is getting so boring! The game is really fun but I'm getting tired of the same old thing
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I LOVE that the story picked up where The Shining left off. I was so enthralled (as usual) that I read the book in about a day (as usual haha)<br /><br />This Constant Reader continues to love the greatest fiction writer of all time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is one of the only reasons I bought my Kindle Fire. Was so disappointed, when it wasn't available. Yes some of the other games , Candy Swap, Fruit Quest and a few others are fun. Nothing compares to the original Kings Candy Crush Saga. A must for everyone, even my grandsons two and three love this game. Thank you Amazon Kindle for finally hooking us up with Candy Crush Saga.
