B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I didn't want to go to sleep at night because I didn't want to stop reading!
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Its not for the squeamish. There is violence, Tarantino-like violence. An array of interesting, well-defined, flawed, fascinating characters. Many surprises. Its the antithesis of your standard, pablum, moronic, bland, light, banal tv series.<br />Try it and you may quickly decide its not for you, or, you will become addicted and watch 2 or 3 episodes in an evening.<br />Superb characters, superb acting, and though the situations are far removed from ordinary life, they do reflect the life responses present in all of us.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The fifth season of the Big Bang Theory is a definite improvement on Year 4; the DVD is worth the price just to go back and watch scenes such as the Bachelor Party for Howard with Raj toasting him by revealing some dirty secrets.<br /><br />Raj also has a memorable episode where he has a 'relationship' with his phone and Sheldon bonds with a bird.
B0095P29EG|5.0|Awesome movie and watching it on Amazon was very nice. I can access Thor from many devices. This is one of my favorite marvel Heroes but where is Hulk and Ironman movies?
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|waited til movie out for rental, who wants to get shot or bedbugs at the theater?  This movie was thoughtful, gentle, moving, deserving of any Oscars it received.  My neighbor who is atheistic didn't like it.  I thought about it for days and it helped me feel more loving towards others.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|i realy like is very good and easy to use,im very happy ,I strongle recomend,I BUY THE SECOND ONE ,FOR MY EMPLOE

1891252089|5.0|David Swenson is awesome! this is probably the most comprehensive yoga book I have ever read, he illustrates about 50 intermediate poses.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Saw the concert, had to get the CD of course!  International, lovely ballads, copy to a CD and play in my car all the time.  This guy is a genius!
B009H442DG|3.0|I bought this along with some other CD's with Christmas music.  My wife generally listens to the music but she was not really satisfied with the music but it was okay.  It was not her favorite.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Cliche I know. But I could not put this book down from start to finish. Drizzt is an incredible character, one I hope to read more of in the future.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the book. Anxious to see the movie.<br />This was a really good book to read, thanks
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I laugh ed the entire time<br />I've loved it solo funny.<br />Ps.<br />  You know Manny as a little innocent kid , but just wait
1451696191|4.0|I just finished reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower, so I figured I would write a little review. After all, I have an MA in literary studies. Fret not, though, I will try to keep this as non-academic as I can, which is probably still a bit pedantic.    First off, I admit I am one of those people who had never even heard of this novel until the film came out. As I visit the art house cinema in town as often as the regular cinema, I did not miss the film coming out. I did, however, entirely miss the handful of screenings the art house offered. Fortunately for me, another nearby art house offered a screening some 3 months later and I completely succeeding in attending that one! Just to finish this introduction, which is getting too long, just suffice to know that I very much enjoyed the film and immediately went out to buy the book (or actually I stayed in, because I ordered it on amazon).    So, the first thing to notice about The Perks of Being a Wallflower is that it is actually an epistolary novel, which is a novel written as a series of documents. One of the most classic and effective examples, in my opinion, is Bram Stoker's Dracula (1898). Perks is different from Dracula, though, in the sense that it is more of a diary-type epistolary novel. In other words: we only get Charlie's unique point of view.    Personally, I strongly identified with Charlie. I read reviews on Goodreads of people who find him a flat character, a character that doesn't make sense or who just plain hate him. I disagree with all of those things. Others have said that his intelligence versus his (partial) social inadequacy is due to the fact that he is autistic. I disagree with that interpretation, too. To me, he is just a really smart kid (and who suffered a trauma, adding his emotional instability). As I read it, Charlie simply doesn't have an intuitive sense of social interaction (although he is naturally extremely kind), but because he is so smart he has learned some of the rules just by observing the world or reading enough books. The combination of the rules he learned and his natural kindness results in, among others, his astonishing present-buying skills. But his lack of grasping common social interaction intuitively leaves him clueless in much simpler situations. Heck, I'm 25 and I still don't grasp why people, for instance, want to sit in a pub for hours at a time. But I have learned that it is important to buy great gifts, to ask people about their day, their plans, to give them compliments. So I understand Charlie and I feel for him.    Apart from Charlie, I think my favourite character was Bill. Seriously, how awesome a teacher is he?! Actually taking the time to find and discuss more challenging work for Charlie. I suppose I am actually kind of jealous... :) In fact, I am kind of jealous of Charlie's friends, too. They are extremely kind to him. So kind, in fact, that they seem to have nothing to do with the real world. And yet that doesn't matter. They are believable in the book.    So, overall I loved the book. It did not immerse me as completely as a (very) few other books have done (I will not betray their titles), but I was eager to continue reading. I thought the writing was witty, albeit a bit simple. The story was shocking at the end, and well-developed throughout, just like the characters. All in all, I give it 4/5 stars.    This review was first posted on my blog: [...]
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really liked it.  It held me in suspense.  I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it.  Read it
B009NPA3MS|3.0|My wife and I watch Idol most of the time and wanted to see what the music sounded like.  We listened to it but it was not really our type of music.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed the play better than the movie, I am a big fan of the story and the songs and was thus thrilled that they made it a movie. I thought the directoring was suspect as there were simply too many close-ups (the actors/actresses head took up the entire screen. Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman were passable as singers. I wish they would have picked two others known for their voices. While it may appear that I did not like the movie, far from it as the storyline and songs are topnotch.
0316228532|5.0|I usually try to read extant reviews before writing mine, but I'm a bit daunted by the 3000+ ones on this book.  Still, I doubt many have reached the same conclusions as I have.  I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that many should look askance at a book so different from Harry Potter books--it reminds me of some American Idol contestants who take a big risk, trying on a style extremely different from their usual one--as Angie did this week.  There are some downsides to this book--esp. the very large cast of characters--but then [[ASIN:1400079985 War and Peace (Vintage Classics)]]has even more. Interestingly, no two have the same first name.  I actually made an MS Word crib sheet to keep them straight.<br /><br />Overall, this book is extraordinarily well-written and the characters are sharply drawn and multidimensional.  It almost reads like a mystery novel.  The psychological aspects are astounding--you are shown first one side, then other sides of individual characters throughout the book.  This may bother you.  I found it quite intriguing, however.  In addition, it's rather dark--possibly quite disappointing to one expecting a Potter-like work.  I suspect it might shake up a dedicated Rowling fan--breaking through the reader's Halo Effect and common leniency errors.  This could easily produce an extreme reaction--per the Pendulum Principle ([[ASIN:B0006S374C Knowledge management and information technology: Know-IT encyclopedia]]).<br /><br />Basically, it's reminiscent of the movie [[ASIN:B001M432XA It's A Wonderful Life]] with the variation that the character (Barry Fairbrothers) dies and then one is shown the multiple effects (mostly disastrous) of his death on the people who knew him directly and indirectly.  The ploy used is the Parish Council seat left vacant by his death (thus the title of the book).  This book is not for the weak of heart.  If tragedy turns you off, you might want to consider avoiding this book.  But, if you want to understand the experiences of a highly varied group of people--both up and down, though it includes the seamier parts of town as well as the seamier aspects of people from the \\"right side of the tracks,\\" you might be very impressed.  Be prepared for tragedy--I'll avoid spoilers here.  I have to admit, however, that the ending is a bit heart-wrenching.  Still, overall IMHO it's a dark masterpiece--displaying the shadow side of humanity--esp. people's narcissism and self-centered orientations.  It doesn't raise your faith in humanity--it's too starkly realistic (in many ways) for that.  I think that to appreciate the book, one needs to be prepared to accept the realities of the human condition--especially how (as described by Alice Miller in [[ASIN:0465062873 Prisoners Of Childhood: The Drama of the Gifted Child and the Search for the True Self]]) traits are passed on between generations.  Yet, deeply considered, it also shows how individuals can break out of their heritages and grow--even if it takes a Significant Emotional Experience to do so.xperiences of a highly varied group of people--both up and down, though it includes the seamier parts of town as well as the seamier aspects of people from the \\"right side of the tracks,\\" you might be very impressed.

B003NTSBUG|5.0|This movie got me on my thinking caps, this is the only movie i've seen so far that i deceive myself i get it but i really do not because everyday different people come and they have different sides of how the story is in shutter island and it makes perfect sense. This is the only movie so far that if you do not pay attention to all the tiny details from the very beginning then your'e gonna get lost and probably like some other people , very annoyed. Great psychological movie that plays with your mind and hooks you suddenly, shown a lot of my friends this movie and I love to watch the different interested expressions they deliver.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app if you like Solitaire. And it was FREE! I have had several others but this one is the best.
B0073COMUW|5.0|These super-white bulbs are perfect for a work area where you do not want yellow tinted light.  I would not advise using them in a living area or bathroom for the same reason.  They are plenty bright, definitely comparable to a 60w and being ceiling mounted in my application it doesn't matter that most of the light comes out the top of the bulb.  They do get a bit warm though, but won't burn you like grabbing an incandescent bulb would.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wonderful 'summer read.'  After completing the book, I understood how difficult it can be for an actor to shed a character or a time period after performing.  I was so engrossed in this story that for many days I saw the world as though I was a time traveler.  This was a very interesting phenomena and, for me, is a testament to the strength of this Stephen King novel.  .
B005HED11Y|4.0|i was never really a trekky, but my kids and husband can't get enough of these shows. they are mostly appropriate, enough so that i don't worry about it anyway.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|This definitely a children's movie.  The plot and characters follow the typical pattern. My youngest child liked it (10) but there was not much to keep the adults interested.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I am not a big fan musicals but have always loved Les Miserables ever since I saw it on stage in London back in the ‘80s. This film version brings it to life with some tremendous performances, especially by Hugh Jackman. Excellent production.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|So far, it's great! Very clear, very easy to use, and accurate! Took me a bit to figure out how to adjust time, but was my error. LOVE it!!
B001ECPJZO|5.0|3 year old had fun learning to tie a shoe. thought it was more of a game. also came with instructions for the easiest way to teach child.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging to work out the puzzles. It's frustrating sometimes, as well, because I am not the most logical of people but I'm improving and I think this is helping.<br />The game works very well on the Kindle Fire. I haven't run into any issues. The only problem is knowing when to stop playing.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|She burst onto the pop music scene through You Tube and a Tweet from Justin Beiber saying how much he liked her.  Great songs and great new artist.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We liked Season 1 very much, however, Season 2 is becoming more like a soap opera.  Season 2 still holds our interest, but not as much a Season 1..
B003BA4CAU|5.0|From the first 5 minutes of the movie I cried, laughed, cried. I have to say it was one of the best chic flix I have ever watched!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|After scratchning my head over why my Kindle would not charge, the Kindle tech staff nailed and solved my problem on the first try. They even called me back after its delivery to make sure that the problem was resolved. Amanda, at the tech site was very professional and freindly.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had a problem because I downloaded then deleted several camera and photo apps.<br />As a result, the original photo section didn't work anymore.<br />Some residual process also drained the battery.<br />I tried process killers and battery savers and file managers as well as process monitors. It didn't help.<br />Then I downloaded Clean Master.<br />I did a clean sweep.<br />It freed 500MB and more important, it killed whatever was eating my battery and whatever blocked the photos.<br />Clean Master is a MUST have.<br />You'll see how much space that you don't need will be freed.<br /><br />PS: I am not affiliated with the developer in any way.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a cute little game. There are hints about how to do each new task that comes up. There are games within the game that will get you more goodies. My only complaint is that I can't find anything on the menu that will allow me to exit the game when I'm finished playing. I have to shut the Kindle Fire off. Not a big deal but annoying if I simply want to go back to the Home page.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Great album! Glad I bought it! Am listening to it over and over again on my commute to and from work. It takes me to another place!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The movie is definitely an adult movie.  The  main and supporting characters all gave great performances and there was great character development.  Good mix of humor and compassion.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am loving this season of walking dead... even though there have been things that have happened that I don't agree with but that's what makes a good show.
B0091REZMW|5.0|more like the fb version than before with the separate yard and basement coming. some things are hard to select on my kindle without hitting the bottom band and popping up the kindle taskbar. the game is challenging in a good way. wish I could play my fb game on my kindle, especially since I'm at a much higher level there. sometimes it seems that I don't accomplish anything for days, and then suddenly I'll get an item that sets off a domino effect ans several quests complete in succession. it's really nice to have a portable version of the game and kind of nice to see the story evolving from the beginning.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I have 2 cities that I check regularly. I like the way you can see the weather in the background, whether raining or snowing. The temperature is usually the same as the local TV channel weather!
B004YXE438|4.0|I haven't played with this a lot yet but what I've done is very good. The puzzles are as challenging as you want them to be. There are different levels of difficulty and different numbers of puzzle pieces. You can combine them any way you like to get a puzzle that is at a good level for you. There is also the ability to compare your results with others to see how you rate. The game works very well on the Kindle Fire.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is a well done production--acting, photography, panoramic locations, costumes.  First rate adaptation of the books.  Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really good movie.  Not my favorite genre so I planned to skip it but I'm glad I watched it on a friend's recommendation.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It doesn't always load when I open it (sometimes takes multiple tries).  If you work on a puzzle, you have to select the same exact puzzle using the same number of pieces - that gets kind of annoying; would appreciate it if it asked if I wanted to open the last played puzzle, or at least had it as an option.  Also, it takes a minute to get used to the slider bar for the puzzle pieces; but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.  Otherwise, good for a free game!  The pictures are lovely & you get quite the variety.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I recommend this app with enthusiasm and confidence. You won't be sorry you tried it.<br /><br />I started using Evernote and it's satisfied almost all of my requirements. I needed something that was easy to use, and accessible on my work PC, Android phone, Kindle Fire, and MacBook Pro. The stall was that my work laptop is restricted for security purposes, and I was unable to install the app. (I was trying to use Google Docs, which was slower and not as user-friendly. I was uploading Word files more than I wanted, and then it was extra steps to use it on some of my other devices. And keeping my information synced was manual, which is unreliable.) I use the Web version only on my work laptop, and the installed app on my other devices.<br /><br />The key was &#34;jumping in with both feet&#34; first. If you use it for only some tracking things, it's just another app that you have to track. Try using it for everything, and it's brilliant.<br /><br />I would like to see more options in formatting.<br /><br />I'm using the free version, but I expect to start a paid subscription.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So cool works great on my kindle fire HD the graphics are great  it never glitches or freezes it has a great price I,m glad  this game is free if you like building games you should get this game I luv this game
B0012FHGCW|5.0|This is an excellent movie. It is now in my top ten all time favorites. Really makes one think about what is most important in life.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I really have a lot of fun with this. Good graphics smooth game play controls are not bad. Would give 5 stars but there is no story and it gets a bit repetitive
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Tennant as the Doctor is again undeniably incredible...however I was never a fan of Catherine Tate as a companion.  As the season moved forward, she grew on me - but her loud and obnoxious behavior became a little hard to handle being played against Tennant's soft hearted Doctor depiction.  I liked the fact that they were only 'mates' and there was no love interest involved, which made the escapades feel more like a 'buddy flick'.  Good season - definitely a must see, but take Catherine with or without salt.....<br />ON a side-note - Catherine Tate on her own is a BRILLIANT comedian and improvisational actress.  If you happen to catch her show on YouTube, she has some really funny bits.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|If you're looking for a movie to watch on a slow evening, then this is it.  The story line is descent and the action is great but my only issue is Jeremy Renner.  Tom Hardy or Logan Marshall-Green would have been better suited to carry this movie.
B003DT19F0|5.0|This is a really fun video - a lot of action - very wholesome.  My kids love it and I love to watch it with them.  It exciting and fun to watch Tinkerbell get into trouble once again except this time she meets  a lovely little girl.  Very fun and sweet, I highly recommend.
1780873808|5.0|When I could not order this book through Audible I was delighted to find it in CD format.  The book was intriguing and the narrator was excellent - Scottish accent and all.
1451695195|4.0|I recommend this to readers who are interested in accounts of this nature. The documentation makes it seem to be true or I think someone from the people mentioned would have disputed the claims. Personally..........I believe,my choice.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Who would guess history could be so interesting?  Of course there is liberal use of drama, irony, amazing characterization - all of coming together to form truly enjoyable entertainment not found anymore on network television.
1400032717|5.0|The tittle is correct, I LOVE IT! It arrived very quickly. And the book is perfect! I had no problems what so ever.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Too many words saying the same thing.  The author spent a long time trying to justify what he was trying to say.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book and was completely immersed.  What a journey to be taken on.  It was suspenseful and intriguing all the way through.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I have no idea why I did not read the reviews this time. The product I received was a fake, cheap and broken from the moment I opened the package. Don't waste your money.
1892005034|5.0|This book offers a blueprint toward developing  my attitudes and approaches  to everyday encounters with my surrounds. It offers exercises in evaluation and formulation of responses to help develop individual responses and process of evaluating situations that arise in my life. It offers this to the reader no exceptions, across preconceived religious, ethic, or social, situations. The reader will benefit from exposure to the blueprint and to the extent they choose to develop use of the techniques and set about implementing them in everyday encounters.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I didn't see the movie but anxious to see if my mental visions came close to film.. Couldn't put it down
1401929281|5.0|This book is just what I needed to help me to enhance my healing ability.  Will be definitely be tak!ing Vianna's courses!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an unbelievable relationship that should never have happened.  If you are willing to suspend your disbelief and poetic faith, you can see the terrible angst Flynn creates. It is a difficult read, but a challenge to see if it is possible to guess the outcome. Probably not. Well worth the time to read it. A study is psychopathic sadness!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app all of the time.  I love all of the available devotionals, discussions, bible translations, etc.  I highly recommend it!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Trying to update this app for the last 2 hours. 3 download failures at 99% and the update is huge. I'm on WiFi and it takes forever. After getting it to finally download, I get 2 forced shutdowns while installing. Talk about frustrating!<br /><br />The game itself is great. There is no need to pay for anything in this game. The ones that say you have to pay to play are mistaken.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Baldacci again forces you to read on.  He is able to surprise you with his quick turns in action as you try to figure out how his characters are going to untangle the web.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|I usually have a 3 song minimum before i buy and album.... this CD is great!  Well worth the $$!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy playing this game.  We have several match 3 games for our Fires and this one rates right up there. Since we are seniors we like the untimed version.  Waiting anxiously for the next one!!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Can't wait for the sequel to see how Travis' and Paiges's story continues. I would give this story  5  but the 4  is because Paige fought too hard against their attraction and made me mad. Still good story and I love Travis.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Every show something you don't expect happens. British accent is not very strong so easy to understand. I am unable to see this show on cable so prime is a great way to watch.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I LOVE this film, Peter Jackson is a great director and only he could of done this story such justice. His passion for the book shines through.<br />The DVD arrived in a couple of days, Iam disapointed that the Ultra Violet copy is restricted to Flixster, that is not explained in the sales garb.
0375851569|5.0|My son loves the pictures and when I read to him. It is a great starter set. Definitely recommend this set.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|The album is great, and I got a great deal on it for only $3 (Black Friday sale plus $2 Amazon MP3 credit that they're always giving out). Love her & can't wait for the concert.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been using this exercise tape for the last four weeks and have lost 5lbs.  I am 56 yrs old and have been walking 3-5 miles a day for the last year and have lost 10 lbs but I have come to a stand still until I started using this tape.  I still walk but have added this tape to my workout.  At first I couldn't get through the beginners workout but kept on using it each day and I am now up to the intermediate workout.  It is still quite a workout but I think I may start on the advanced workout next week.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's awesome, action packed and has a great story line.  It keeps us on the edge of our seats each week.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great story.  Interesting and suspenseful.  Looked forward to reading it day after day.  Have not come to the end yet.
B0000047CX|5.0|This was a gift for my husband, he is Portages and understands the language. He is enjoying the music and the lyrics.
B0094K1YHK|5.0|I'm not the type that will pick a film apart, I follow one test: did I enjoy it or not.  Sky Captain was a cool movie.  Push aside any preconceptions, get a friend, popcorn and some suds and just enjoy!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Awesome way to spend time with my boys. So much fun. We compete we each other to get to the next level.
B009UZBLSG|3.0|I am on my third slimport adapter.  The previous two have both failed within a month of using them.<br /><br />I am using it as an adapter for my Pioneer AppRadio2 car head unit.  The adapter sits in my center console and is connected when I drive my car.  So I'd guess maybe 10 times a week is it connected and then disconnected.  Because of a short drive to work, it gets used maybe 30 minutes a day.  The last one I had lasted thorough 4 weeks of use.  No idea what could be causing my apparent rapid failure with these devices.  Company offers no direct consumer support, so it's swap-n-pray with any issues you have.<br /><br />There is only one other slimport adapter available on Amazon and i'll be trying that one if this fails again.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/6 - I finally got a good one.  It's been almost 8 months since my last failure.  Moved the review to a 3 star.<br /><br />UPDATE 2/26/14 - It started acting up again a few months ago.  If I unplugged/replugged it enough times, it would start working.  Today it just won't stay working.  Screen goes from fine to flickering, back and forth.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I always have been the type of person who reads the book before watching the movie. Once I finished the first book, I was hooked. I was slightly disappointed with the movie, but I digress. I couldn't stop reading the series. Three days, three books.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A book that is hard to put down once toy start, and one you continue to think about when ou are finished.
B000002JOH|5.0|I really don't have anything to add, I just wanted another 5 star review for this album. This is one of the best metal albums of all time! When it came out nothing had ever sounded like it before...it was revolutionary in every way. If you don't like this album, you don't like metal. PanterA will live on forever.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Be sure to watch some Youtube videos before you buy or try to use this to be able to get better results.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Brings inspiration to the reader. Reflects on how faith can change a life. Shows that there is goodness in the world despite the headlines.
B0053426AA|5.0|Sit back relax and be taken to a new world where angels sing and play. Perfect to listen to anytime anywhere!
B006WAIV6M|4.0|A very interesting book, it is insightful about both the individual and organisations. The habits of organisations is something that anyone in a leadership role should read.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Really beautiful presentation. The optional commentary was fun and informative. Works well with the Arden Hamlet book - read an act at a time then watch the dvd.
B008XBHIEY|1.0|This is the most over-rated film in movie history.  Hokey plot.  Terrible acting.  Amateurish production values.  Even the special effects suck.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and slightly addicting. Very good special affects although it can be slightly slow. Can't wait to update the tour!
B0035LJF2U|5.0|I have seen this about a hundred times over the past 20 years and it never gets old-truly a classic!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Perfect for new and old pink Floyd fans. start your collection with one of the greatest bands ever and you'll fall in love again.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I was convinced by all the positive reviews and I saw all the features I thought were very good for a price range, like the interchangeable weights, braided cable, extra buttons, and the LED color changing. Very cool and nice features for a well functioning mouse for under $50 I thought was a very good deal. I was on the fence between this one and the Razer Abyssus, but that one is only $9 cheaper and had no extra features like this one.<br /><br />The only \\"flaws\\" and personal issues I had with this mouse was the plastic shell on the outside.<br />The palm area and the main buttons are coated with the soft-touch plastic which is great, but the plastic on the outer-parts is just a semi-glossy black plastic. But it's not the kind where you see finger prints, but it feels like a more \\"cheap\\" plastic where it feel like it's been coated badly and looks \\"cheap\\" too.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic mouse, very comfortable in my hand and with cool features.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I absolutely love this series! The picture quality of the DVDs is awesome! I highly recommend This series! Every season in this series brings something new and different with twists at every corner
B00005KK4P|4.0|I have never been too fond of symphonic music but heard the 6th on the radio and enjoyed it. Working my way through the other 7.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|The Tudors Season 2 continues to deliver the excellent quality entertainment that Season 1 provided.  There's even more action and intrigue ( and heads rolling!!)  I loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Will definite read it again! Looking forward to reading the rest of this amazing series and sharing them with my kids!
B0018AM1YY|5.0|The sound of a generation yet it still resonates our feelings today. Good music is always good throughout time and space!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|this was a quick fun read.... Easy to follow along and difficult to stop till I was done..Had my Mother in law add it to her reading list too.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Why did you change this.  I was quite happy before you update.  Not its to much info I dont need
B007XF4J70|5.0|One of the all time great movies. Normally don't like B&W movies but this is so exceptional I can overlook it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So easy to use! Love it...recently started using it to bid on things....and now I can't stop!!  Love it tells you immediately when you've been outbid- no delays equal great chances of winning what you really want!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Good good season! Course BBT never seems to get bad season anyway, but still.  Have just about all the episodes on my Kindle and it is good pass time fun. Just buy this season.  You can thank me later.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Excelente pack, además viene con los DVDs de la temporada completa y con subtítulos en español. También el despacho fue rápido.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Touching story built around the meaning of flowers.  Interesting characters with some twists and turns in the story. Uplifting with kindness a major theme.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After I finished Hunger Games I couldn't wait to read the second book. I read the second book in just a couple days. And now I am anxious read the third book. But at 11:30 p.m. it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|Disney classic - enough said. Part of my collection to show to my grandkids. Looking forward to more Blu-Ray releases of the classics.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I found this series very interesting and well acted.  It covers World War I from the perspective of a wealth family and their staff.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|funny, sad and awesome!!!! You must watch the outtake at the end!! I would recommend this movie to anyone!! great!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a wonderful show! I am enjoying every  minute of it. I am excited to see what future seasons bring
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Just as good as the original. The sound is very good. This is one of my favorites for Pink Floyd
B009X01FJS|4.0|This case met my expectations and it does everything advertised except it does not turn off the kindle fire hd when lid is closed. that isn't a deal breaker, but just something I thought it was supposed to do. The bright pink makes it easy to spot and the stand works for both landscape and upright mode. this case is tough but I wouldnt trust it to protect from a drop...its not a rough and tumble case, but thats not what I wanted anyway. overall great case!
B005OT2YVA|4.0|It was what I expected. I still don't understand how the main character always ends up with models... but other than that it was good. His parents are funny. The action sequences are entertaining.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I get that some music lovers will simply not enjoy this classic. For them, it's other qualities that matter, maybe for them it's Springsteen or ska or R&B. It's not really uplifting and the lyrics are rather simple. But for me, the song sequence, production, arrangements, solos, and pot pouri of sounds simply makes the best rock album ever. I can't mark it down simplify because a certain remaster is bad. In all honesty the MFSL, Toshiba Japan, 20th anniversary, SQ quad etc etc versions are all good, some are just really good. I can't hear any awful remastering in any versions, though I did grow up on the Australian quad vinyl and it was odd to finally hear the \\"real\\" mix years later. This album doesn't belong in the mp3 era, it must be heard in full with no gaps and no compressed sound. It is the ultimate \\"lights out and a glass of red\\" album. This was a time when the band was making band records, before Waters took charge. It all works. Waters himself did add some extras that suited the theme of the album, Gilmour's guitar work is just stellar, Wright did some of his finest keyboard composing and Mason's drumming is typically sparse and precise. I will say that the Immersion edition had a big packaging problem, already mentioned by others. This was utterly inexcusable given the price. But for musical content it is without peer, and I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording ever since 1980 when I first heard it.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Such a great album. As a die hard P!nk fan she has yet to let me down. I love her honesty.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|\\"Redshirts\\" was an attempt to parody an old television show that was already almost a parody of itself. The premise is not hefty enough to make it worth reading and John Scalzi's normally excellent dialogue, which is the main reason I read his books, seems forced here. I deleted it from my Kindle about 1/3 of the way through.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|It changes how I look at food!  Unfortunately, these big companies don't really care about us or the poor animals!
B00A17AD36|5.0|I heard &#34;Wicked Games&#34; and bought this album based on 1 listen of that song.  Best album I've bought in a long time.  30 songs of pure bliss.  He changes things up throughout the album but always stays true to his sound.  This guy will be great for years to come.  I read a review tat called him as musically enlightened as Michael Jackson, I say he surpassed that already.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I watched without knowing what to expect. I did not even know a basic plot line - but that made it kind of fun. I thought it was worth watching.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Maybe I'm a bit too old for this kind of movies, I didn't think much of it. My kids love it though, ages 3 and 8, they sat through the whole movie. Maybe was the colors or maybe the racer girl. It's a safe movie for children.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book has to be one of my favorites for 2012. I fully enjoyed the watching Abby and Travis find each other. And I love how Travis is basically a bad boy with a heart of gold. If you want a great story def read this. Travis is ..... one of a kind. I can't wait to read book 2 !!
B00BF11STU|2.0|This thing is over two hours long and the only part that had any  real action is the last 15-20 minutes.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very well done.  17 more words are required so I'm typing a bunch of stuff right now it doesn't matter
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This auther was new to me and I'm always afraid to take a chance on an unknown (to me).  I was pleasently rewarded with a very good read.
B005H9B44A|4.0|This was a good movie and I enjoyed watching it. I think it will also give background for the avengers movie... so I wanted to make sure I had it covered.
B0035G0U2O|1.0|Started the movie and watched about twenty minutes. I paused the movie and when i started it back up it told me the movie is not available on ipad. Can you say unacceptable!
B00A3AUGEW|3.0|I really like Phillip Phillips, but some songs could have been better for his first album.  Good enough to buy, but not to love.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Lots of old school video game memories that I had forgotten about. It was cute. Was definitely a heart felt kids movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a sucker for finding an omnibus edition of books and buying them. In this case I am extremely glad I did. The Silo Saga was an interesting and refreshing read. I spent too much time reading this series rather than sleeping the night before work. I was enthralled from early on and it kept my attention. Was it perfect? No, but it was extremely well written and I look forward to reading the sequel. I hope Hugh Howey continues to write. He will only get better and I look forward to whatever he comes up with.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I live in the high desert with extreme weather changes. I check this app on my Kindle Fire several times each day and have done so for a year.  Since the update, I'm frustrated all the time. It's slow.  It doesn't update. It won't refresh.  I don't like it visually.  Why does the location list have to be showing all locations all the time when the drop-down menu was fine. I could go on but it's basically awful now.  Bring back the old version!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I think I have rated all of Grisham's books with 5 stars. This one wasn't quite as gripping, but still worth a read.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|OneRepublic is my favorite band, and I've been waiting for years for them to release a new album. Their sound is unique and they play with a lot of different styles, so their music always feels fresh to me.<br /><br />Counting Stars - A catchy start to the album in which Tedder's voice is front and center, accompanied by the kind of beat that makes you bob along in the car while listening.<br /><br />If I Lose Myself - This song demonstrates one of the band's strengths: dreamy music with lyrics that ache with longing, segueing into an electronic dance beat, and finishing with Tedder crooning while a subdued piano plays in the background. It doesn't seem like the sort of combination that should work, but it does. Try to listen without tapping your feet, I dare you.<br /><br />Feel Again - The first single off the album is an upbeat, hand-clapping song about redemption by love that has a classic, arena-rock feel to it.<br /><br />What You Wanted - Sounding like a bit of a throwback to the eighties, this song is stripped down, Tedder's voice set off by an electronic beat, some background crooning, and a chorus featuring a lush, trilling electronic piano run, with a lovely, muted piano solo near the end.<br /><br />I Lived - An anthem to a life well-lived, this song feels like a chant, one guaranteed to get a crowd singing along and bouncing. It starts off with some simple guitar and adds some bass and a drumbeat. The chorus adds some background vocals singing in harmony with Tedder, which gives it a nice depth, then the song finishes with an acoustic sound, voices singing wordlessly in time with the beat, giving it a folksy feel.<br /><br />Light It Up - This song has officially replaced Secrets as my favorite by the band. The grungy sound coupled with the twanging guitar and thumping base is fantastic and when coupled with the raw sound of Tedder's falsetto, the song becomes sublime.<br /><br />Can't Stop - Tedder's plaintive falsetto and the longing lyrics blend seamlessly with the distorted feel of the song, creating a driving pop sound filled with romantic angst. This song is the sort of pop perfection that's made Tedder a favorite of collaborators like Adele, Leona Lewis, and Beyoncé.<br /><br />Au Revoir - Melodic strings and piano provide the backdrop for Tedder's sad lyrics and the hopelessness expressed in his voice. The overall effect is stark, desolate. Need a sad song to listen to post-breakup while crying and eating ice cream? This is the one.<br /><br />Burning Bridges - Pop music at its finest. Polished and slick with catchy, swooning lyrics, this song reminds me of what I love about well-crafted pop music. It would make a great addition to the mix tape you're making for your crush.<br /><br />Something I Need - A lively tribute to love with a sort of chanting chorus featuring some nice vocal harmony, a march-like beat, and some simple piano notes. There's a sort of old school feel to the song that's very appealing.<br /><br />Preacher - Adding yet another dimension to the album, this song shines with soaring gospel sound. Tedder sings earnestly about his grandfather, the preacher, accompanied by a choir. This song has one of the best lines on the album, Tedder crooning that \\"he was a million miles from a million dollars, but you could never spend his wealth\\".<br /><br />Don't Look Down - A short finish to the standard album, this song weaves dreamy electronic sounds with Tedder's voice singing in the background, and adds in a chorus of voices singing wordlessly.<br /><br />In short, this is exactly the album I've been waiting for. The more I listen, the more I appreciate the variety of styles OneRepublic has brought to the table with their album. Though the wait was worth it, here's hoping there won't be as long a delay between this album and their next, especially because this is a band that seems to get better and better with every album they release.
B007M45PMU|4.0|Not as good as Mumford and Sons, but along the same vein.  Some songs are awesome, others are good, and a couple are just, eh.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Book 5 just doesn't seem as well written as the previous four in this series.  Not that it really matters - If you've read the first four of course you'll read the following books.  I just find I'm not quite as eager to pick it up.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Anybody that has ever gone to high school can relate to something in this book.  I did feel sorry for Clay. Hannah just wouldn't let him close enough to help but I don't think anyone could have once she had her mind made up. I would recommend this book.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I am not that excited about this book.  I am about 1/2 way through and find it to be nothing much.  I had expected it to be fantastic since the movie is supposed to be great.  I feel it is not written that well.  I will finish the book, but do not recommend it to anybody at this point.
B000PY6BBI|4.0|It's always fun to watch something from the 80's if for no other reason than there is nothing like it.
1451673442|5.0|Rhonda Byre's  the Magic is a 28 day life changing exercise in gratitude. research shows that if you do anything for 28 days, you have changed your way of thinking/doing. We seldom think to be grateful for the basic of things in our lives. Byre encourages us to be mindful of everything in our lives anad to appreciate ALL.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love the Tv show and wanted to read the books. I gave a five because  I loved it. Would tell anyone to read if they like mystery.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|What a great movie! Even if you do not l Ike musicals, give it a try. The actors are fabulous the songs tell the amazing story of a good man making good on his word.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love how Flynn was able to convincingly write in not one, or two, but three perspectives. Each chapter, I kept wondering what was going to happen next since the narrators were definitely flawed characters. The book was engaging, entertaining, and so much fun to read!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I loved the book and series.  However, I found the ending to be very unsatiisfying. Since there are so many characters and story lines, I had hoped there would be closure.  You are left wondering what became of them!
B0014NDXGA|1.0|A waste of $300. The V2 worked for 90 days, ran out of battery life, replaced batteries, lasted two days, completely dead. Surprising for a product with a 30 minute infomercial promoting it when I bought it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is really fun...however, it gets more difficult with each level!<br />I never give up trying to achieve a better score.
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Rubbish in one word.. .... waste of money.. .. ..... don't buy it.. .. finished it within an hour need more for a bought game if it was free fair enough .. but......
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would have to admit this is one of the best game I've played yet .I don't know about you'll. but I'm telling the truth
B004XIZN5M|5.0|The difference that makes this better than most other bodyweight-only exercise books I've seen would be that while others are laid out more like a dictionary of exercises, this one has things broken down into useful progressions. Instead of just showing you a bunch of things you can't do yet, it shows you a solid progression of intermediate exercises that start with variants anyone can do that will help build you up to where you're able to the ridiculously hard variants.<br /><br />My only problem is that, at times, the writing style can be a bit cheesy and overhyped.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|I chose this form of protection for my nexus 4 because, well, the back of this phone is just too pretty to cover up! It does all that it's built to do, or so it seems. I haven't dropped it from any considerable height yet, and hopefully I won't. I'm not one to upgrade my phone every chance I get, I can think of far better ways to spend money. Having said that, I take exceptional care with my phones. My last phone (an iPhone 3GS) lasted 3 &1/2 years, and looks MINT out of the case.<br /><br />This &#34;Bumper&#34; fits like a glove, and unless one were to know better, it looks as if the phone was just made this way. My Fiance' was slightly taken aback when I pulled the phone out to clean it, as she didn't realize it had a bumper on it at all.<br /><br />So far, a month now, and it shows no signs of wear and tear, so the build quality seems (in these early stages) to be exceptional. No complaints here.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, I'd recommend you go ahead and make the purchase. They were out of stock on the Google Play store, and I happened to find it here on Amazon for a very reasonable price, considering they were going for double and sometimes more, than they were originally priced on the Play store.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a great watch, at a great price. I am more then pleased with my purchase. I have already recommended it to a few people. And I would gladly recommend it to anyone.<br />Michael
B007N5YIUS|1.0|It isn't worth the time to download with all the commercials. This is proof positive there is no free lunch. If you like this game skip this version or shell out some money for a version without the commercials.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I'm able to find everything I'm looking for. Gives a wide variety of choices to choose from. Glad I made the choice.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I get asked to help people on their computers all the time. They need me to get on their computers and get stuff done for them.. many times I can not be their to help them, so I get on my computer with teamviewer. I then started to use the kindle fire app, and its awesome! I can work on computers from anywhere!<br />I do wish it would work the other way around, be on a computer and run a kindle. never the less, its a very cool app!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a really fun game.  It is pretty similar to temple run but has more power-ups.  It's a good way to have fun when you can't go outside and be active.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I truly don't understand the hype.  This was like watching a 3 hour meeting.  It truly has no climax; no reward for watching talking heads for almost 3 hours.  It seemed to be trying to lead up to Lincolns death and then....... nothing happens.  You hear about the slaves being freed and Lincoln dying but this is supposed to be a movie.  We should see it happening and being acted out on screen, not listening to it on a radio or reading a book.  This movie was perhaps the worst I've seen in the past year and frustrates me that I spent the time to watch it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I look at it several times a day if I want to know what the weather will be anywhere in the country. Love it!
1878424319|3.0|This was a really good and helpful read to make you think about yourself and how you live your life and portray yourself. I think it's a useful book that you can get a lot out of and come back to a year later and pull even more from it each time you read it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Though I have played this ever changing game for a long time ,Subway Surfers continues to entertain. Like similar games such as Temple Run , the main goal is to amass hordes of coins, character upgrades and high scores. Unlike TR however, Subway Surfers does not use device motion and can be played anywhere effectively for that reason. Furthermore, fast paced action and constant close calls allows for an addicting experience. Lastly, Daily Challenges, a bright color scheme and the newly introduced World Tour makes Subway Surfers a great game to pick up whenever one needs to pass time or simply relax.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I used to love this app, but then they changed it. I used to love the layout, but then they made the &#34;tablet&#34; layout, which is stupid. it worked amazing before, but now the layout sucks, and it turns so its harder to read. I cant change the layout, because when I do, it freezes it unless I have it up where it wont want to tilt. Sad that they had to go and make this app not work good anymore
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Poor Harold has had a very miserable life, But his pilgrimage leads all readers to share in his blossoming at the end.
0061537969|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift from our aging dog to my husband.  We read the book together.  We laughed, we cried, we hugged our dog.  I really think this book helped my husband deal with the loss of our beloved Beauregard when he passed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|An enjoyable past-time! This game can be addictive as well and it's fun to play. It's an old standby that will never lose it's intrigue.
0060527986|5.0|This is meant to be a companion to Paulo Coelho's &#34;The Alchemist&#34;. The book is written and structured in a similar manner to the Tao Te Ching. It is not meant to be read all in one sitting, although you can, as the book is quite short.
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple run is pretty cool ,I have played it a lot more than angry birds or Pack man I like it.
1451695195|5.0|A very good book and I really enjoyed reading it.<br />It makes you want to live a better life. Heaven is for real and we don't want to miss it!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I am a Castle addict.  I have the first 4 series on DVD and am eagerly awaiting series 5, although living in England I shall have to wait.  The writing, editing, casting and situations are all superb, although I must confess some of the plots are a little contrived.  What I really enjoy is the way all the actors bounce off each other.  They look as if they are enjoying acting it as much as I do watching it.  It is difficult to believe it is just a story.  The acting, particularly Nathan and Stana, is unbelievable at times.
B007SGM084|5.0|nice twists, loved the story line sad to see it end, shocking and intence at times, would not recommened for children reading, adult content.
B009O2XY12|3.0|It's not as user friendly as some games but still enjoyable to play. Sometimes the balls are hard to put where you direct them.
0062502182|5.0|I adore this book! It has become a source that I quote from and share with as many people as I can. Paulo Coelho's writing is excellent and this story touches on many universal themes. I would recommend this book to older high school students and up.
B00C0P08CI|5.0|By episode 4 I'm hooked. By the time the episodes finish I'm left wanting more. Can't wait to see the next show.
0790742780|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie Falling Down.  It is strange to see Michael Douglas in this tpe of role.  You would enjoy this if a Michael Douglas fan.
B008Y7XNAK|4.0|Eraser was good from beginning to end.  Arnold is one of the most classic \\"tough guys\\" in Hollywood history, so if your looking for action where someone can completely own everyone else then Eraser is a good choice.
B00BWJB5H0|5.0|I only paid for one episode that I had missed.  Easy to download and watch.  I really love watching this show.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like the fact that I can read different translations. It took me awhile to navigate it at first but I'm finding it very useful. It's not as easy to go to different passages in a hurry, though. But I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read the Bible and keep a daily reading log.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great story, serious subject but an enjoyable read.  Wanted to read it before watching the movie.  Definitely worth purchasing it.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Ok who here can't love the old top gun, Awesome. . . . . . . . . . .
B0018TLRTU|5.0|Just what I wanted, only a few key tunes missing but better than the alternatives. The remake of L.A Woman is very good.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great game.  Fun to play.  The levels are challenging yet my 5 year old great nephew can play it too.  we both love it
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The Blu-ray Original UK version is the best. Season 3 had a great story line and we really look forward to Season 4. The few extra minutes in each episode really makes a difference over wat was shown on PBS.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It easy to use and helpful in many situations. Easy to read numbers,etc. and has many different functions which I find useful.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Its good but not the best. I think its time Cruise moved on. Lots of the plot was so predictable
B004L35GAQ|4.0|Used when I bought it and looks and plays like new. All the songs are good on it, listen to it all the time
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It was great, but know it won't let me into it. :( I try to open it and it kinda loads but then it just goes back to my home screen. Please fix it
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I was almost put off by the length of Shawshank, but that would have been a big mistake. I'd seen it years ago when it came out in theaters, but today it is as fresh and gripping as ever. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Clancy Brown as the evil prison guard (trivia tidbit: Brown is the voice of Spongebob Squarepants' money-hungry boss, Mr. Crabs.) are all brilliant in their roles. We are rooting for Andy and Red (Robbins & Freeman) from the moment they establish their lifelong bond, and their ultimate redemption from a decades-long life in hell is one of the most satisfying experiences in film.  A brilliant screenplay masterfully brought to the screen -- see this movie. You will not be disappointed.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was my first military type book that I read and it was addicting.  It was told in such a familiar 1st person voice which made it very easy to read and interesting - as if the Chris Kyle was telling me the story himself.  Hearing first hand the secret ops he was sent on and what those SEALs go through is mind-blowing.  My heart goes out to his family as he survived many miraculous close calls on the battlefield only to be killed back home in the US by someone he was trying to help.  Thank you Chris for your incredible service to the country.  And thank you to his wife and kids for supporting him even though it was clearly a strain on your family.  An unforgettable story and book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is addictive! I love it. It's a lot like &#34;bejeweled&#34; which is what I wanted to be able to have on my Kindle.
888370536X|5.0|I got this little book for my son to write his music ideas in. He was so excited when he got it and writes notes from songs that he figures out how to play.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Juliette Binoche was awsome in this movie. A fun movie to watch. DVD was used when I bought it and was in awsome shape.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I absolutely loved The Tudors series...great acting, writing. Wonderful representation of the time period!!! Love, love love, cannot say it enough
B00846REIS|5.0|I really loved the Crossfire Novels.  I read the 50 Shades of Gray trilogy and I enjoyed it and I am looking forward to the movie.  However, I REALLY LOVED these novels.  Yes, they are similar to 50 Shades but with any books you are going to find similar settings and characters.  I loved the story, characters, the relationships between characters and the naughty scenes.  I liked the \\"naughty scenes\\" more than the S&M of 50 Shades, they were more believable and realistic.  I am looking VERY FORWARD to the 3rd book and I hope Ms. Day doesn't stop there.  Sylvia Day has definitely not gotten the recognition she deserves.

0385349947|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"lean in\\". It was both informative and entertaining. While I will need to write down some of her most important points of how to advance, I will never forget her story of discovering head lice on her child while flying in a private jet. I hope Ms. Sandburg plans to write a second volume with more advice on how to manage career advancement. We all need to take her advice seriously without requiring so many humorous anecdotes to keep us immersed in the topic.
B00358ESI4|5.0|I love Mel Gibson, I loved the fact that it was based on a true story. It was on one of the best movies I've ever seen.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|For being a 60s & 70s music teenager, listening to some of the new sounds out there today can be disturbing, but this is ok, but not something I would keep buying or listening to.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Having lived in the era of Hitchcock's &#34;Psycho&#34;, it was marvelous to relive that time and see behind-the-scenes info on Hitchcock himself.  It contained both humor and insight into his personality, at least some of &#34;what made him tick&#34;; his methods and his madness, his strengths and his inadequacies were well-portrayed.  Finding out more about his wife's contribution to his success was also enlightening.  All-in-all:  a delight.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I recommended to whole family , most were already watching!!<br />Love the characters, the historical background<br /> - couldn't wait for the next season , watched it all on Netflix in couple nights
B009CG96QM|5.0|Well cast, excellent cinematography, kooky plot and lots of blood. Only negative? Brad Pitt's accent. It is NOT Tennessee. More like Texas.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|she is such a brilliant writer and, though it leaves a lot to the readers imagination, thid holds true to her wit and romantic sensibilities.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Thisis a very fun game! Kid friendly but also adult entertaining. I love the concept of rescuing animals from poachers and keeping them safe.

Get this game.It gives u more and more stuff to do.Me and my brother love this game !!!!!!!!!!!!!  &amp; best part it's free. I gave it five stars. It's so fun. For kids I think.

B006YTTVHO|5.0|As someone who has spent my entire life struggling with recognizing and displaying proper social skills this was a wonderful read and really eye opening for me. Thanks so much for making this available,I'll definitely be highlighting portions to reference in the future. :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|What we need is just some minor stuff, like:<br />Buckets, Redstone, minecarts,  enderman, and defiantly need villages, abandoned mines, and etc. It's not that bad it is very good, fun to play while on road trips and friends!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love love love this book! Loved the book dso much I saw the movie.  The movie is slightly different, but loved the book better!  Nicholas Sparks is a great writer.  Good luck!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Well written and scripted.  Story builds in multiple facets and keeps you on edge and eager for more. For more explanation, for more intrigue, for more twists, and for more of their new unexplored life.  Well done.  The last third of the book was well set up by the beginning two thirds.
B003D83DPA|4.0|If you're a fan of Dire Straits' early music, this concert is for you.  Filmed in 1983 in England, three songs really stand out: Romeo and Juliet, Private Investigations, and my favorite Telegraph Road.  The Blu-ray doesn't help the 30 year old video, but the dolby 5.1 sound is great.  If there is a DVD version, I would buy that instead of the Blu-ray.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted is a bad boy, but he is so cute and funny. I also liked the pure friendship between the main character guy and Ted. But I don't recommend this movie for kids.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|nice graphics, interesting storyline, but gameplay can get a bit repetitive. otherwise this game is pretty cool and contains alot of levels. however, i can't say that i would have bought it had it not been free.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Everyone says this app does not work on the Kindle Fire. Guess what. I'M ON A KINDLE FIRE. It works perfectly fine and one reason it might not change your inventory is because you didn't leave your world. All you have to do is go to the Home screen of Minecraft PE. It will be in your inventory not the bar on the bottom of the screen. Also it's not just an inventory changer, you can change spawn,time,and switch between survival and creative, which I find great. It has never glitches for me and the bought version, you can spawn animals,mobs,and the whole kazoo.  I hope this was helpful.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Half the time I'm wondering where the author its going with the story line. The rest of the time I'm annoyed that Ana is so ridiculously jealous. Doubt I'll read the 3rd book.

B0064MPXFA|4.0|I have 35 years as a trial lawyer. It is a fast paced exciting life that takes its toll on the person and everyone around him or her.<br />This show does a pretty good job of showing a compelling picture of one woman's struggle to keep life together while being an effective advocate for those seeking justice.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a heart-warming true story. The movie had a wonderful plot, moved a good pace and left you emotional charged with awe, love, and tears.

B000ZM7VVO|4.0|The music of flogging molly is uplifting and fun to listen to. I have heard their music for the first Tim  from my brother in law last year. I decided to order it when I seen it.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The special effects and scenery were great. I especially liked the storyline. I had always wondered how the hobbits had first become involved as they did not seem to be warriors.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|kind of original type of series, can't wait to see more episodes, maybe the plot will be just as good
B000H4TX9I|4.0|Not sure, but it was addicting. It was goofy, a little hokey and over the top. The premise (Western genre) was silly but somehow it worked and I enjoyed it. The 26th century technology was, let's say, underwhelming. It's too bad they cancelled the series.

030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl is a taut suspenseful psychological thriller wherein both partners of a marriage are so into mind-*uc* games with the other that I couldn't tell if either of them really knew when the game went South. This book is fascinating.<br />Nick, the tall handsome husband, in the beginning does and tries to do everything he can to make his more than perfectly beautiful in every way wife, Amy, happy. He is the perfect husband. If he isn't sure about what to do to accomplish her happiness then he asks her. And for her part, Amy, just by being with him is the perfect wife. This seems to work until both of them, writers, are laid off from their jobs in New York City where Amy was raised by wealthy writers of children's books whose stories were based on their precious little Amy.<br />Nick takes Amy back to his hometown where his mother is dying of cancer, his father is in a home with Altzheimers and his sister still resides. This makes Amy very angry and an angry Amy is not someone to mess around with. So there they are, neither one with jobs and Nick stops trying in the marriage. This makes Amy even more angry. She begins to plot and when Amy plots she doesn't mess around. This woman is brilliant! Before we know it, Amy has gone missing and the clues all point to you guessed it: the husband Nick.<br />The book is written in a very different format. Our author has taken it chapter by chapter and alternated the telling of the story from the POV of Amy, then Nick, back to Amy, etc. Strangely enough it works.<br />I lost sleep in the reading of this book. I can't say that it was a great book, though I gave it 3 1/2 stars out of 5, but I will say it is a fascinating read and it definitely held my interest. However I did find the ending strangely unsatisfying even though it rang true to the story. I don't think that all will like this book but the ones who do like it will really like it. There is not anything boring about it.
B0027BVMSY|2.0|I almost wish I could unsee this movie.  The action sequences were so fast and disjointed that it was very herd to know what was going on, which wouldn't have been so bad but the dialog was almost nonexistent in this movie.
B00821OX98|5.0|If you're a fan of science fiction, then this program won't disappoint. Since each season is relatively short (10 episodes), the people behind this show are able to pack in excitement and drama in each episode. Plenty of humorous moments as well. And the actors really have seemed to give it their best shot.
0785165975|5.0|Hit-Girl may serve as a bridge between Kick-Ass 2 & 3 but definitely stands on her own as well as completes the series if you plan to have the whole Kick-Ass story.
B0040HO01Y|2.0|Entertaining if you have nothing else to watch, but the plot lines and script are a bit cheesy at times.
0316044938|4.0|\\"Inside the snow globe on my father's desk, there was a penguin wearing a red-and-white-striped scarf. When I was little my father would pull me into his lap and reach for the snow globe. He would turn it over, letting all the snow collect o the top, then quickly invert it. The two of us watched the snow fall gently around the penguin. The penguin was alone in there, I thought, and I worried for him. When I told my father this, he said, \\"Don't worry, Susie; he has a nice life. He's trapped in a perfect world.\\"\\"<br /><br />Thus begins The Lovely Bones. Susie is a young girl of just fourteen years when she is taken, raped, murdered and dismembered. Instincts tell her father who committed this crime against his child whose body is never found. He goes to the police with his suspicions and though they investigate the man they need evidence which they are unable to find.<br />One would think this a difficult book to read but this reader did not find it so. It is told from the perspective of Susie, the victim, who is in heaven. A heaven such as I, who believe in heaven and hell, have never envisioned. It is rather a casual place and Susie's enjoyments on earth are also her enjoyments in heaven. And Susie can see and hear what is happening on earth, within her families and others, even her murderer. But she doesn't spend all of her time in this way. There are times when those remaining on earth feel the presence of Susie near them.<br />As Susie tells her story the horror of it does not become negligible but she tells it in a way that one can accept and move around it and remain within the story. Not just the event.<br />This is the story of how a family deals with and yet cannot deal with the tragic loss of a beloved child. And Sebold tells this tale in a masterful way very different from those you have read on like subject matter.<br />The climax of the book may not be what you expect, need or desire. But it suits what comes before.<br />This is my second Sebold read. I am only saddened that there is only one more currently out there to read. I highly recommend The Lovely Bones and rated it 4 out of 5 stars.am only saddened that there is only one more currently out there to read.

B00BETX5PS|4.0|Very fun action film.  I'm very fond of Daniel Craig as Bond.  However, there are some weird moments in this film that seem a bit out of sync with previous bond movies that took me out of the action.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|This reminds me a bit of ZZ Top in places, before they discovered/were discovered by MTV.  The sound is big, and music among Clutch's smartest.

B0049WHNLO|5.0|Recordings in the studio or at a Jazz venue are usually an artwork in themselves if the musicians and the recording are first rate! However, at a concert, maybe the recording might be extraordinary -- but maybe not! In this case, the orchestra's performance is extraordinary and the recording itself is, also, exemplary. I have read in the original liner notes what history the technician must have felt he was preserving for jazz fans worldwide! (My introduction to this recording was in my first year(1957) at boarding school listening to this album belonging to another student!)
B00169N0BK|2.0|I've had ColorMunki for about a year. It is generally accurate at calibrating color. My issue is it's compatibility with Windows 8 and my Epson 3800 drivers. I have calibrated profiles for my papers, then when I go to do prints, the calibration profiles I have created are not showing in the printer interface--the profiles are merely blank lines. I have worked, worked and worked trying to get decent prints and am very frustrated with the results. X-Rite needs to update their drivers and produce something that creates a working interface with printers.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|Very pleased with quality of item and service of company. The item arrived when promised and made a great gift!
0345803485|1.0|I just simply join other reviewers who thinks this book is not worth the time reading. After a few chapters I caught myself rolling my eyes for the seventh times. I do realize though why other people enjoy it - my Mom lives and dies fantasy movies, the more ridiculous the better. But for me they are tiring.<br />Probably she would enjoy this book. As for me I will put aside after 6 chapters. Will just pass it on to my Mom to feel better about the money spent.
0312370849|5.0|this is such a great book! I would def. recommend this book to any one who is interested in the holocaust.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Would die without this app!! :) my only suggestion would be to make the news bar to include comments made by your followers instead of having to find out through email.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My granddaughters played this game on someone else's Ipad and liked it so much.  I was delighted when I found it and so are my granddaughters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's great. a bit annoying because you can't build straight under you. but I'm officially addicted. it's worth seven bucks.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I got this when it was the free app of the day but I would have happily paid for it because it is such a good game. Challenges your puzzle solving ability as well as your physical reaction time. Beautiful, smooth graphics and a soothing ambient soundtrack. It's awesome!

B002VECLVO|5.0|Quite moving and very emotional at times. Really enjoyed it and thought Colin Firth was really brilliant in that role.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game has been really inspiring to me I have been playing it ever since I got  My kindle Fire hd. It was the first game I ever got. But my 1st favorite is Minecraft even though I am a girl. But subway surfers... man you should really get Minecraft pocket edition and Subway Surfers. Subway Surfers is kinda like Temple Run (if you play it). Also get Temple Run. All you do in subway surfers is run away from the guard dog and try to not get hit by trains while trying to get coins. Sorry if this was a long review.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is a cute movie and my granddaughters love it.  I wish I keep up with the number of times they have set and watched it and still laugh.
B008ZCWFEE|3.0|Why does Amazon even sell apps that aren't compatible with their own devices?  I was very excited about this app and ready to pay $6 for it, but it is not compatible with my Kindle Fire 2nd generation.  Frustrating to shop in Amazon's app store when they sell things I can't even use.<br /><br />ETA: Learned about this app from Commonsensemedia.org.  They even list it as Kindle Fire compatible.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it is my favorite but i liked the suspense and the story behind it. Very sad but a happy ending :)

1594744769|3.0|I liked this story but feel others should be prepared. This book belongs in the young adult genre. The photos add a lot to the story. I got the hard copy and it is a beautiful book. Don't know how the sequel can mix the photos again and feel the story would be lacking without them.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I was reading this book for a class assignment. I went into it as just a boring reading assignment, but when a read the description of the book it really grab me. The book ended up being amazing. The character of Hannah was interesting to see her journey, while I really felt so Clay listening to her story. It was well written and took me just two days, the only other book I read that fast was Catching Fire because the story is so intriguing and you can't but it down.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was only watching it because someone else wanted to and I ended up really liking the movie. Anthony Hopkins does a fantastic job at playing Hitchcock.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is one of the best Nicholas Sparks books I've read since The Notebook. It was full of suspense and I didn't want to put it down. I gave it four out of five stars because I wasn't sure how I felt about the ending. Other than that, it was a great book!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun game great graphics!  One of the first I got from the amazon app store and I love it.  Works great on my HTC Evo LTE.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This app was really fun, but the ads they put on are inappropriate, especially with how many kids play this. The game also freezes up a lot, so I would only rates this a three stars.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|None of us made it without the assistance of others, of a culture, of a time, a place, a weird opportunity.  This book makes us look at success from a different perspective.  No denying person initiative, but factors can change everything.  I will read it again...and again.
B0053TWW1I|4.0|I thought this was a cool movie. Gedde is great as Duncan. I like erotic humor and horror together.do not forget to add the little umbrellas to your drinks... Always. \\"Class\\"... Corey
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater and went out and immediately bought the soundtrack!  I finally got around to purchasing the movie and adding it to my musical collection!
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I just bought a new Apple Macbook Pro 15 inch laptop and despite improvements in other areas I noticed that the volume listening to music with my Bose MIE2i earphones (excellent earphones especially for symphonic music) is significantly less than on my 5 year old Macbook Pro.  You have to play it at the highest possible volume just for it to sound somewhat decent with the highest volume setting about four or five settings below what my older computer is capable of.  In fact my iPhone 4s puts out significantly more volume than the new Macbook Pro.  And for a DVD movie the music sound track on the new computer is less than inspiring. As a music lover and a professional musician this was a major disappointment for me.<br /><br /> One of the people at the Apple store suggested I get the FiiO E5, but having never used an external amp before I was skeptical.  However I was pleasantly surprised  to find that this little amp makes a really noticeable difference.  With it music on the new computer sounds significantly louder, fuller, and more dynamic.  Qualitatively it's like going from a subpar stereo system to a really good one.  I can also hear a significant boost in volume when I use it with my  iPhone, although it isn't absolutely necessary there. I've shown this to two people playing music on the computer with and without the FiiO5, and they both could notice a big difference.  I'm completely happy with the sound now, and this significant drawback with an otherwise excellent new computer has been completely solved to my satisfaction.  And that it only cost me $28 is pretty amazing.  It's the best $28 I've ever spent.  I highly recommend this product and don't see how you can go wrong with it.  Maybe it isn't designed to be used with $800 headphones, but it sure worked with mine.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Wanna feel good?  See the film first, &#34;Searching for Sugarman,&#34; about this songwriter who slipped past us in the '60s and '70s.  Great poet, great voice, and even greater true spirit of living life simply.  He supports my philosophy that Christ comes back every now and then and we're just too busy to notice.  Rodriguez may be this era's visit.<br />And the albums are superb.  Let the film introduce you and you won't be playing anything else when you drive anywhere.
B000002I77|5.0|Wow, 70s fusion at it's most aggressive! There will never be another line up like this. I can't believe I waited years to buy this classic fusion album.
B00063F8B2|5.0|My kids are so much into the Polar Express movie and songs, that this tape was a must have.  We like it a lot, nothing else to say, the colors are vivid and the movie is just the best!!!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Jimi Hendrix was an innovated and simply awesome. This is well worth the price and more. I only hope we can get more!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great interactive game for old + young horse lovers who either own or are not able to own their own pony.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Has nudity, drugs, drinking and lots of language.  Not a family movie in any way. I would say more but dont want to ruin it.
B009UI7VQY|1.0|I watched about half of the movie and decided I had better things to do with my time.  I kept waiting for it to become interesting but it didn't.
B000002KET|5.0|I never liked this album growing up, but have come to appreciate it as an excellent piece of work - better late, than never
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love this game and it helps me learn about horses. I think any one would love this. Hope you enjoy this game!!!!
B00BHMF578|3.0|Slow and had one cleaver line.  Ben Affleck did play a character I have never seen him in before.  Other than that it was very slow moving and could have portrayed the suspense better.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Now I know why this book is considered a classic.  Although I remember my teacher reading it to the class during story time in early elementary school, the true joy is to read it and cherish its captivating richness and simplicity.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Great game for passing the time...when you have it to spare or just feel like having a few minutes of fun. Can be addicting.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|beat it in one day on Xbox 360 it took a month to beat it. it is a great game and I love it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Could hardly wait till this one came out! The third in a series. I practically inhaled this one! These guys certainly know how to write a good mystery!
B0002IQNAG|3.0|Dawn of the Dead is such a great movie, a kickstarter, but Amazon misinform the details of the product. It doesn´t contain spanish audio or subtitles.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Story was very good and well written. Kept you wanting o read. However there were some excerpts that were somewhat confusing as to whether they were just one's thoughts or part of the actual story.
B004VWH3KI|5.0|Bradbury's Mars reminds me of something out of a Ronald Reagan fantasy--a world where people sit on porch swings and sip mint juleps after a hard day's work in the fields while the aroma of Grandma's homemade cookies wafts out the window. Considered as a sci-fi classic there really isn't much science here and not much in the way of plot either, but as a collection of mood pieces dripping with nostalgia for a vanished way of life that has somehow been transplanted to Mars, this book is without peer.<br /><br />The Martian Chronicles started out inauspiciously as a series of short stories, but Bradbury had trouble finding a publisher for the individual stories. Eventually one publisher told him that there was no market for short stories but there was for novels. Bradbury realized that he could write a few more stories about Mars and use that idea to tie all the short stories together and make it into a sci-fi novel. The result was one of the most beautiful, evocative, and moving sci-fi novels of its generation. Bradbury used the concept of Mars to throw into relief almost all of man's and society's problems: poverty, greed, corruption, racism, the constant threat of war.<br /><br />Mars becomes first the symbol of man's hope for a better life, and ultimately the hoped-for answer to his problems, although the aged planet Mars and its dreamlike natives and culture leave an indelible impression on the immigrants from earth, each whom is affected in his own way.<br /><br />A personal side note here--I heard Ray Bradbury speak once when they brought him to my junior high school in West Los Angelos 35 years ago. He's a good speaker, actually, and a bit of an eccentric. For example, he admits to being deathly afraid of flying and therefore drives a car everywhere. But he said he would get on a spaceship tomorrow and fly to Mars if he could--something surely more dangerous than a typical plane flight.<br /><br />Anyway, Bradbury himself turned out to be quite a character, and perhaps some of that gets into his stories like this one. The Martian Chronicles shows Bradbury at his best, in a story that ranks as one of the greatest mood pieces in science-fiction and as a story of a people's hopeful, romantic, but failed vision of a new life in a new and unknown world.<br /><br />Bradbury lived to a ripe old age and was still writing in his later years, but he'll always be remembered for novels such as this one, Fahrenheit 451, and The Illustrated Man, the later two being made into movies that made Bradbury even more famous and one of the science fiction icons of his generation.perhaps some of that gets into his stories like this one.

B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome but they need to make it like the computer version so that you have all of the redstone-machinery.
B0063M22QO|5.0|totally relaxing way to while away the time waiting on friends, appointments, lunch break ...enjoy this very much and appreciate the different levels and types offered
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|great movie. What a difference the movies of today are compared to then. Nice to see what once was. The acting was great in those days but the special affects and production is much better today.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Game of thrones is a series recommended to everyone above age 15 , it truly gives you some isight as to how the medieval era operated not to mention the gripping storyline and continual plot development. I am amongst thousands who cannot wait for this spring for the nest season to come out . A show definitely worth watching and sticking with it in the beginning despite a  slower story line
B0053KWDES|4.0|I've been looking for something to make my Galaxy Tab sound as good as my ipod when i connect it to my car stereo.  I tried two lower end Fiio's before I ended up with this one.  It uses standard headphone connectors and a small USB connector for charging.  The battery is removable which is good because mine is used, but doesn't last very long so I keep it plugged into my USB car charger (not included) when I'm not using it.  Which leads me to its only drawback.  It will not work while charging.  Some lower end models from FiiO will, but this one must be unplugged, the red charger light goes from red to blue, then it will work(Lights are very tiny and not distracting at night).  While on the charger no sound passes through it at all.  Also there are is a setting to increase power that can be used to conserve battery life.  The volume control has a guard that is also nice.  The whole unit is about the size of an Iphone 4s in a case.  It will not blow the doors off of your car, but it will bring your android device up to par with an apple device connected to the same stereo.  I would recommend it for anyone looking for for 20 - 50% more volume from their mobile device.
B003DXSXCI|4.0|This movie has one of the best car chase scenes ever! Its a fun movie to watch over and over again.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Great way to find the meaning of words.  Like the pronunciation feature.  The word of the day is also a great feature.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|This movie was great the way that they combined two totally types of dancing and put them together. The way they danced together was just amazing!
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|Takes up a ton of space and is extremely choppy on my near empty Fire.<br />I deleted it within 15 minutes; which is as long as it took to load!
1589946634|5.0|Anyone who knows warhammer 40k universe, is bound to agree that it's a very grime future. It's about the Adeptus Astartes and their fellow legions of Imperial troops, countless planetary defense forces and the Inquisition fighting against the ever present aliens, tyranids, and the chaos forces. This card game captures that future with it's almost impossible to win game mechanics. But sometimes you do beat the enemy, but at a heavy cost......<br /><br />Well about the game itself, the cards are of good quality and the tokens too. Rule book is ok. But there are some gaps.... Certain card details are difficult to interpret, so had to check out the fantasy flight games' website for its board game forums. Now all seems to be good.<br /><br />But I love this game, since I am a big fan of the warhammer 40k universe. Wish they will make a card game for the Horus Heresy era too. Sorry I am not a miniature game fan.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I was looking for an easy to use notepad type program to store some information on my HTC Evo 3D and this app filled the bill. Easy to use and I really like it.<br />I highly recommend.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I haven't finished reading the book but so far nothing like the movie but then I am only on the first hundred pages.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|No big deal, it sure wasn't what it was cracked up to be blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B008KYWMZO|4.0|I received these jayna crocs and while i ordered a 9 medium I got a 9 wide. The fit is a little loose but workable but in the future I would like to receive the size I ordered.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|The special effects were awesome; the story not so much.  I wish I had seen it in 3D which would be incredible.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Scenery, and acting was realistic;  story line was intriguing and believable. I highly recommend this series to any history buffs.
B00BF123WG|2.0|No big deal, it sure wasn't what it was cracked up to be blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I have found this to  be a hidden gem in that I would have been a regular viewer if I had known it was originally aired. It's dissapointing to know there was only one season as the story lines were refreshing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is my fav show but if I had to rare season 3 from 1-10 I would give it a 9 and a half, season 2 was my fav season
0316223239|1.0|I couldn't get in to this book because of the ridiculous wording. The story could have excellent if the mother had told it.<br />Having two young grandsons, never have they talked in such nonsensical sentencing structure as the author had this five year old speak. I think the author was trying to make him seem intelligent and very much still an infant. Sentences such as \\"I sat down on Chair after I hurted Finger.\\" (That wasn't an actual sentence, but you get the idea.) made me wonder if the author had ever been around a normal five year old.<br /><br />It had to laboring to write an entire book in such a way. And then,how much does a child of five recall in such detail anyway? It just wasn't believable to me.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|This is a neat and gripping storyline. The characters are complex and interesting. The plot is exciting. The personal conflicts are intense and interesting. The problem is there is excessive and graphic nudity and sex. We won t bewarching more episodes
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I found the book difficult to \\"get into.\\"  For the most part, I enjoyed the read.  I thought the ending was the best part.  What a surprise!
B0081HLM2E|5.0|Very clever, headlong pace, satisfying throughtout.  The bad guy is really the good guy. and the good guy is simply awful.
0307276902|1.0|Boring is an understatement when it comes to this book. Day after day in rehab is the same. You wakeup the same time, you eat, go to group, have free time, eat again, more group, take meds, go to bed. This is what goes on in this book, page after page. I'm dumber for reading it. The staff treatment wasn't believable, the characters were uninteresting and it was maddeningly boring.<br /><br />I was in rehab and could sum it up in about four pages. And that includes a woman I was in rehab with that upon her release<br />killed her boyfriend two days later. We saw her on the news. She even bullied me into giving her one of my sweaters before she left.<br /><br />I wish I could find one piece of information from this book to pass on to anyone that might be encouraging. The author just droned on and on with the same thoughts and daily routines  It was so disappointing, I threw it away. Having been in rehab, I should have realized how uninteresting and uneventful a personal account could be. The redemptive thing in this is that the author found sobriety, which is the ultimate goal. So good for him.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I'm not an IT professional, but this kit met and exceeded my expectations. Good, quality build, felt sturdy in the hand.  The bit selection is great, the case was as expected- not the sturdiest for a plastic case.<br /><br />Would recommend, esp. for anyone serious about getting taking electronics apart with the intention of putting them bak together.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Well produced, well acted and pertinent to the headlines of today. I love stories that present moral delimmas, and demand character growth. I enjoyed the presentation of a problem that demanded sacrifice and action  from ordinary people, that became extraordinary through their willingness to take a risk to help others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you like romance, hidden secrets and  emotional roller coasters. This book is for you. This was an amazing book, it made me cry I was so caught up in it.
0307476464|2.0|I am a pretty big Murakami fan, but I found this book to be a disappointment. Like others have mentioned, it definitely sounds like Murakami, however it seems like he got carried away with himself and the editor let him. The book is too long, verbose, and oftentimes boring (it picks up pace here and there but has large lulls). I also questioned some of the plot lines. I won't give anything away for those who want to read it, but it seems to me the plot is more weird, just to be weird as opposed to offering anything poignant or symbolic. In my opinion some of the themes were just uncomfortable. I kept waiting for it to improve or morph into something else, but was ultimately disappointed. I read the book because I loved a few of his books and enjoyed many others, but I wish I would have just stopped reading it and moved on to something else. For anyone has started it and is not sure whether or not they should continue - my suggestion would be don't. And for anyone who has never read one of his books certainly don't start here. My favorites are A Wild Sheep Chase and The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|In my opinion Joss Whedon's greatest creation.  Powerful characters and fantastic adventures. If you have some free time I definitely recommend getting lost in the world of Firefly.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|We all love this game. My kids are 8 & 5 (twins) and all three can play this with no problem.  It is the most violent they have ever been allowed to play, I just don't think its that bad. The sharks eat fish, other sharks and people (that the violent part) .
B00001QEE7|3.0|Although, I am happy I received this in a timely manner I am disappointed I spent as much as I did on a product that can not go more than 2minutes with out getting stuck on a scene. I will have to take it to the nearest DVD store to see if they can clean it up.<br />I am a bit disappointed I can not watch the DVD once without problems.<br />Thanks anyway.
0062082353|5.0|This book gave me an insight into what and how our men and women in unform have to sacrifice to give us the freedoms we enjoy and sometimes take for granted. An excellent book and I recommend it to everyone. This man gave most of his life for us. His untimely death brought me sorrow and my thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
0451228731|3.0|If you're at all nervous about computers, you should think twice about reading Daniel Suarez's Daemon. This technothriller chronicles the attempts of a band of terrorists to do nothing less than take over the world. However, instead of the terrorists being bearded jihadis with assault rifles, these are sociopathic geek geniuses (led by dead sociopathic geek billionaire Matthew Sobol) using society's own electronic connectedness to bring it down.<br /><br />Suarez's point - with everything connected to everything, it doesn't take much to seize control - is played out by a sprawling cast of characters, some of whom are fleshed out more than usual for novels in which the technology is the real star. Even the point-of-view \\"bad guys\\" get unusually thorough introductions and looks into what drives them to join the cause, although once they sign up with Sobol, they become mere cogs in his machine and rather less interesting.<br /><br />A prime motif of this story is how online game worlds overlap with the real world; in essence, Sobol (a game developer) has turned the real world into a game level, and his AIs (artificial intelligence game characters), once given a physical presence, can roam at will across the planet, while the real-world conspirators can use the online game environment to meet (via Skype and avatars) away from prying official eyes. It's really not that far-fetched, although you'll probably appreciate it more if you've spent any time online playing World of Warcraft or Call of Duty.<br /><br />For a story that happens as much in cyberspace as in meatspace, there's a lot of real-world violence, at least four big action set-pieces and a surprisingly high body count. The conspiracy's sheer inventive brutality can be stunning at times. The action sequences are staged effectively and cinematically. In general, the settings are well-described and convincing.<br /><br />Be prepared for a great deal of tech-, game- and hacker-speak, which sounds authentic enough(I can't tell how much of it actually means anything, even though I was in IT for over a decade). Suarez is skillful enough to cut off the heaviest techtalk flurries just before they become annoying, and even if you don't cause yourself a mental cramp by trying to follow it all, you'll still get what's going on. You'll need to suspend disbelief at about the same level as you would for a pre-Daniel Craig Bond film in order to accept the various toys Sobol causes to be built and deployed, such as killer drone cars and Edward Scissorhands motorcycles. To be fair, some of his proposed tech (such as the driverless cars) has now come into existence in the labs.<br /><br />With all that, by the end you'll have the vague feeling that it was all too easy and that the bad guys seems to catch all the breaks. Well, that's not unusual in a thriller; the bad guys get their way until the dice turn cold on them, usually in Act 3. The biggest problem with this book -- the one that cost it at least one star -- is that it doesn't end, it just stops. That's right, it's The Empire Strikes Back. We're left at what in a one-volume work would be the middle of Act 2, facing the prospect of two more books to wrap up the story. As much as I liked Daemon, I'm not sure I'm prepared to plow through another 1200 pages of it to reach the real ending.<br /><br />Daemon is a big, busy technothriller set in an exotic world with a sizeable cast of often-interesting characters. It'll give you a workout. You just have to be okay with the idea that finishing this book won't mean you're done with the story or even reach any real resolution. If that doesn't scare you, then dive right in - it'll show you a good time.
B0091REZMW|5.0|even though u have to buy diamonds if u make friends and request items I get lots of each also I have lots of friends in various levels so I get tips and get to pay it forward was a little frustrating at first but play daily
B00785P2QC|3.0|Very fun game play it all the time.wish you could make money faster but over not bad at all. I would say it a lot like the old Sims.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Hey...Denzel Washington! What a great actor, and from what I hear he's a good guy too.<br />Off hand I can't think of a single movie he was in I didn't like. Sure some where better than others, but most are good, and wouldn't have been as good if he had not been in them.<br />This movie was great, and my Wife and I enjoyed it. Maybe not quite as good as Training Day, but one of his better ones IMHO.
030758836X|3.0|Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl is another of those books that are easier to admire than love. It's hard to review without littering spoilers all over the yard, so I'll have to speak in generalities.<br /><br />Technically, it's a home run. It features dead-solid character building and voices that are perfect for not only the outides but also the insides of the characters, even some of the minor ones. Then when the twist comes - and it's a sailor's knot of a twist - Flynn manages the quadruple-jump-10-for-technical-difficulty feat of completely reversing the characters she's built so painstakingly in the first half. So, as a master class in character development, it's hard to beat.<br /><br />And yet...this book has the highest percentage of truly repellent characters of any I've read lately. The personas Flynn builds in the first half are not merely annoying New York types (be it resolved: New York writers are hereby prohibited from writing about New York writers) but also totally geared to lead us down the path into a Lifetime TV movie. Then there's that twist, and the freak show goes completely out of control. Flynn has no hangups whatever about making her characters highly hateable. As a writer, I could appreciate the sheer bravado of what she was doing; as a reader, it felt like those times when I've watched a History Channel doc on the WWII Nazi-Soviet front and found myself wishing there was some way for both sides to completely annihilate each other so neither would win. Perhaps this was the intended reaction. Just to round things out, this book has the bleakest ending of any I've read in a long time, including the ones in which everyone dies.<br /><br />Is Gone Girl worth reading? Again, as a technical exercise, it can't be beat. If you like wallowing in psychosis and dysfunction, this is for you. You'll never lose sight of the fact that the author is messing with you on every page. If this sounds like your kind of read, then run - do not walk - to get a copy. If, however, you want to like or identify with any of the characters in the book you're reading, or perhaps simply not wish all the characters would die, then move on; you won't find that here.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|This is pure Clutch! It has all the balls of Pure Rock Fury with a grown up sound. Not to mention a slow song that will give you goosebumps.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|It was the best movie I've seen.<br />Very beautiful.<br />It reminded me of the game in Halo.<br />It was the best sifi movies ive see.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I don't know how accurate the movie was, but it sure kept me on the edge of my seat. Was is it about Affleck? Is he not turning into one of our best directors or what? I like his acting and I like his movies. This one did not disappoint.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I downloaded the movie to kill time during a flight and it was the best movie i have seen in a long time.  Well told, acted and visually stunning.
B009JZVT70|5.0|Good show. My wife and daughter love it. It goes round and round without resolution (like a soap opera) but it's fun for the whole family with just a touch of scary to ensure a good cuddle from teh little ones.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|This is an amazing movie.<br />I have watched it again and again and I haven't gotten tired of it.<br />Angelina Jolie plays her role perfectly.
B00846F1YW|4.0|The storyline of this game is weird, long and drawn-out. The creepy lab guy in 16 insists that Laura has a drink and a cigarette, and asks you to find a vodka bottle, cigarette, and a lighter. Really, is that necessary? Otherwise, game play is fine, though repetitive.  Playing on Kindle Fire HD and no glitches or image quality issues as others have mentioned. Hasn't forced closed either and I'm on level 17.
B004M2305O|1.0|Erroneously shows the nazis as human.  Anybody who has studied history is aware of how they brutalized American soldiers as well as all of Europe, especially gypsies, Jews, mentally ill,...  Nazis were the worst scum of humanity.  Losers w/o the governments guns giving them ability to torture and kill.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Held off on the movie until I had read this book . . . it was so well written, so deep, intense and so totally understandable.  What a great story, one that I got for my Kindle but now want the hard cover for my library, as well.  I did see the movie, and it was great too.  A movie can't get into all of the thoughts and scenarios of a book, and even though it had it's differences, it still made the point and was entertaining.  I'll be watching for other Matthew Quick novels.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I love baseball.<br />Clint Eastwood is a great actor and doesn't disappoint.<br />He is also the director for the movie.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|One great performance as Lincoln. A man with high morals working to restore a nation. Every member of Congress should be made to watch this movie, twice.
0307719774|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my son's birthday, slowly approaching the big 40, and is saying where did the time go!?.  He is very expressive, and loves writing, and hoped this would inspire him to write, then look back and reflect on his feelings 'back when'..  He was quite moved, sent word that he loved the gift and felt it was one of best things he had ever received, so have to rate this as 5 star product for sure.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is one of the best ever.  I couldn't stop watching it.  I told myself I would watch one episode and then 4 episodes later I had to stop or I would have spent my whole day watching it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Some of the best acting I've seen in a long time.<br />I love history so this was a great movie for me to watch.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|First off, the Amazon streaming service was great, so from a technical standpoint this gets 5 stars.<br /><br />For those looking for my review of the movie:<br /><br />&#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34; is about a video game villain that wants to be respected by the other game characters and in order to do so he must gain a medal by doing something heroic. The problem is that in order to do this he must leave his game which has the possibility of making his game out-of-order.<br /><br />I'll admit that &#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34; is not my kind of movie. Despite the video game premise, I just couldn't relate to it. This is probably because it mostly references arcade games. Although I will admit there is a scene involving Ralph going into an FPS, that is admittedly awesome. If you've never seen it before, I recommend renting it, but you probably won't feel the need to watch it again.<br /><br />With that said, I think this is a perfect family movie. It's not offensive nor is it insulting. Young and old can enjoy watching this movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I just love this book. I heard about it and thought to myself I should buy it and read and until before I knew it,I was on part3. I love it and thanks to the author for making me<br />questioning
B004GJYR7I|4.0|My wife loves it and I bought it for her birthday!  I also like watching it with her as it is very funny!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This is a must watch for any Johnny Depp fan.<br />It is hilarious.<br />Any member of the family will enjoy this movie.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Lots of laughs and drama, gorgeous scenes and lovely period clothing make for a great series. If you like Downton Abby, this wil be a delightful series to catch!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a nice game and very addictive, wish there were more opportunities to get acorns. Would recommend game to others.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|My husband enjoyed this a little more than I did. Graphics were impressive; the movie was entirely too long for the subject matter.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is a truely amazing movie!<br />Well written and acted with a brilliant cast.<br />Liam Neesom is an excellent actor.
B005IQZB14|2.0|I thought there was too much compaining and self- indulgence on the part of the author. I was hoping for a story about nature, hiking and camping, but that was not the focus.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Like I said for Book Two, I liked the storyline but could have done without all of the sexual content.  I just wished that it would continue with them and their family after they got married and what has become of their parents and such.
0394721772|5.0|I like so  much to cook, and better if it´s different, I loved this book, it has easy and complete meals,appetizers, meats, soups and desserts, you can find anything you want to cook! very good written and explained, it is easy for me to follow this instruccions! I recommend it.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. I enjoy hidden object games. This was an exciting game. Loved it and definitely recommend this game.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Just an ordinary account of what was an extraordinary mission.  I have read other books about navy seals that gave a much better account of these heroes.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked the storyline, just didn't need all of the sexual content.  But loved the storyline and would read it again and suggest to friends that wouldn't be offended by all of the sexual content.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I recommend this series to anyone that loves true romance and drama. I've watched it three times already. Can't wait for season 4!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books show much of our society today the good and the shadows.  To cease all the games and live each day in peace with gratitude.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Cant wait to see it each week.<br /><br />The character development and twists and turns just keep you guessing. My whole family is hooked.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. Based on the previous Hobbit movies, I expected more. It looked more like a Johnny Knoxville movie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read every king book, every koontz book, every Jordan, goodkind, every fantasy, fiction or sci-fi I could get my hands on over the course of the last 35 years, and this guy is on par with the best. Don't worry, you aren't signing up for some trite trash pulp fiction here. Even in the shorter segments, you will not want for character development, action, romance, deceit, defeat nor triumph. I hope Mr Howey's chosen genres bring him the credit he deserves! I've read this omnibus and 2 of his 3 Shift books this week, I can't put them down, and the bastard has virtually guaranteed I'll buy all his other books and read them while I wait for this series to complete. Easily the literary superior to the film version of any other post apocalyptic I've ever seen. That said, I'm open to suggestions. :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So much more better than the first temple run and definitely more addicting. Would definitely recommend this app to anyone.
B006885EFE|5.0|Love it,  very real and fact based story.  No fake low budget bs,  even uniforms are what they are supposed to be
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Super Slick.  I'm so glad we have the ability to watch passed shows.  This show is GREAT!!  Looking forward to more.
157421327X|5.0|At first I was surprised that 'Zentangle Basics' was so slim.  NOT TO WORRY...the book is so informative; a superb guide to what has become one of my favorite creative, introspective art hobbies.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|First book was a bit fast-paced to the point that it left the reader wondering \\"wow, does this kid have everything?!\\" However, it was pretty contrived (the inexperienced and untrained main character saves the day at least half a dozen times, among other things) and that's why I hesitate to give 4 stars--although I'm confident some other readers wouldn't hesitate to do so. Overall, not a bad read.<br /><br />Unfortunately, where book one has a fast moving plot with many (and somewhat unnecessary) developments, I found book 2 to be pretty slow and book 3 just painful to read. However, for $2.99 it's hard to complain!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I heard a lot about this movie before I watched it, was O K for me but wasn't as good as it was built up to be. I would still recommend watching it, you might love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game. I would tell my friends and families. thank u for the kkvfcnjxdhjknhczax xdjjkkfdv dsgjkmc<br /><br />mhcsfbzdvnj gsbjhgdgjkv nhcgmmnv
B00B935SUY|4.0|This was a trip back into my past - while I wasn't much into rock and roll in the seventies, I was every bit as much into music and an audiophile.<br /><br />If had grown up around a music studio like Sound City, there is no doubt I would have been hanging around, trying to get to play with that awesome sound board.  Music was everything in those days, and sound quality was king.<br /><br />Being a Seattle native, having Nirvana pass through the sound City doors was nice treat.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I started this book several times and for some reason could not get past the first few pages. last week I happened on a review of this book and decided to give it another try. Well I started reading at 9pm last night it is now the next day 10:50 am It's a great book.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This book was very good leaving us in suspense at some times, but with a happy ending. So are we going to get a fourth book??<br />  -SD
B009GEFXLC|5.0|there is a 2-part episode, that is very similar to the movie &#34;Taken&#34; with Liam Neeson...the cast in the show even make reference to it when they talk about Castle. Great show, great season, worth watching.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie - the acting was superb and it had a comic quirkiness to it that worked really well.<br /><br />Helen Hunt is terrific - she does her scenes with such calm and command.  Probably the only unbelievable character is her husband.  They should have either developed his character more or left his scenes out all together.
B00007KWHN|5.0|This is a no-brainer!  NO collection is complete without this outstanding piece of work from the guys who re-invented the Prog-Rock  genera!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I cried though this book.  She creates empathy and information about Alzheimer's in a novel form.  I definitely recommend it
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the book, although I felt all the video game and 80's pop culture references early in the book were laid on quite thick, distracting from the story itself. Eventually though, those references start to get further and further apart leading back to character development and plot development. I would still recommend the book as the story was interesting, the characters were likable, the setting was neat, and the book had that good blend of video games and pop culture (if you discount the heavy amounts of it at the beginning of the books as I mentioned).  Definitely give it a shot!
B009CPEOC4|3.0|I love Katy Perry, and her music.  This was a interesting look behind the scenes of a grueling tour and public life.  It was clear from the clips of them, that her marriage to Russell Brand was a train wreck - he appears so immature and she seems to be in a make-believe fantasy relationship.<br /><br />I was glad to see her leave him but, her latest love interest - Mayer - is no better.  He will use her and move on to the next pretty young woman that smiles at him.
B00007KWHO|5.0|I discovered this LP during the Vietnam War stationed in Thailand in 1973 and was very taken by it.  The cover of Ritchie Havens &#34;No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed&#34; is fantastic but the one number that really captivated me has always been &#34;Astral Traveler&#34;.  This is a true Gem as the 2nd (and last) LP by Yes to have Peter Banks on guitar before Steve Howe was recruited.  Well worth a listen!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|My son - who is a total Xbox 360 gamer - is even addicted to this. CAUTION Unless you have time to kill - do not play this game. You can't put it down.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Really cute movie. Full of action from the start to the end.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My daughter love it she saw it in school and wanted me to buy it for her,Igot it for her for xmas2012 and she look at it over and over again .I must say it more reasoinable on line then in the store around the hoilday thks GREAT MOVIE
B003OUXECE|3.0|A good spot of fun if one is a fan of the first two games. Well-written not in the sense that the prose is mellifluous and daring, but in that one can't always expect this kind of tie-in thing to be crafted very carefully. But it was lacking the sort of bland description or awful, every-line-of-dialogue-just-ends-in-he/she-said thing so many commissioned works of this sort can. Having said that, the story is a bit incomplete insofar that it seems to know no one reading it is going in cold, details are glossed over and this can leave holes if you don't remember every bit of in-game myhtology perfectly. It had been a while since I'd played either game, and I found myself occasionally confused. Still, good enough for what it is.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Their style reminds me of a certain UK legendary folk group; the Lumineers are the US Lindisfarne! Superb album, not a bad track on it.
B00BLGZDVS|1.0|Could not finish watching it. It is just too painful watching a bunch of stupid/insane/dysfunctional people walk around bumping into the walls of reality and careening off in a random direction.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series isn't as bad as some think. I have read books more raunchy than this. I love these books. But if your old fashioned you might not want to read.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|The touch sense is stupid like you touch the screen and the monster will go flying. When I say touch the screen I mean move your finger less than a inch.
B00AY0A71I|3.0|It was funny, but not anything special.  Basic predictable humor.  The acting was OK , but certainly not Oscar worthy!
B00009P1MP|5.0|This is a great collection of Don McLean's songs; he sings so much more than American Pie and Vincent, some I heard for the first time on cassette tape. The only thing is that whenever I listen to it, I can't get American Pie out of my head!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is not as raunchy as I thought it would be.i would recommend this trilogy to everyone. If you are faint at heart they are not for you.
0847835073|3.0|Book is beautiful, only problem is when Monica picked out all the photographs there are none from behind.  (Well maybe one in the entire book, and from far away full clothed.) She is obviously self conscious about her south side.  Would have been better if an editor helped her pick out the pictures.

B00BY6XM36|5.0|Rick Steves is an amazing host. He has an uncanny ability to capture your attention and bring you to Europe. Whether you actually plan on traveling or not, his skills are absolutely top notch. He'll throw in a little history and culture tid bits. He shares his secrets in planning, packing, saving time, and getting around with all the right tools and efficiency with his 30 years of European traveling experience under his belt in his Skills series Parts 1,2,& 3. The HD quality of his PBS broadcasts (and blu-rays) are spectacular enough that if you own a nice big TV, there's actually no need to go to Europe since he does such a good job bringing it to your living room, hence this product would be ideal for someone who cannot travel/fly. Way to go Rick! The only other guy comparable to him is Rudy Maxa. Rick's shows are limited to Europe whereas Rudy ventures to other continents. With someone who as such knack and talent as these 2, you can't lose with either one.<br /><br />This blu-ray Collection Edition Box Set is presented on 12 discs, 1080i 16x9 HD format (note: these shows are not closed captioned). The complete list of all 70 30-min each episodes (which includes his Travel Skills and Specials) in this set are listed on his website. His 30 older standard definition (SD) shows are NOT in this set, but are in his all 100 shows DVD (SD) set.
B00B2064IY|5.0|I bought this as soon as I found out it was available and haven't gone a day for the last two weeks without listening to it. Some tracks are better than others but as a whole well worth buying the whole album. Just a reminder of how tragic his death was and what might have been if he had been able to be with us long enough to really grow as a musician and performer.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Saw this in the theater and loved getting it so soon after it quit being played at them. Great in blu-ray.
B0014JERXM|5.0|biffy clyro is all over the place, great musicians.  this album is great.  can't believe this band really isn't bigger state side.

B00AX7PGQS|5.0|`Holy Motors' has been that one film released this year that has garnered so much critical attention for its mere being that I was convinced all year it was going to be the best thing I'd ever seen.  The amount of outlandish and unrestrained hyperbole that was spewed all over this film for months had me anticipating the second coming.  It has me recalling when `Margaret' was finally released after being shelved for like five years and people saw it and claimed it to be the most remarkable film they had ever laid eyes on.  That was just a year ago.  Already people have abandoned that notion and moved onto Leos Carax's `Holy Motors'.<br /><br />The similarity between the two entities doesn't die there, for my reaction to each over-hyped masterpiece is the same; they are both the best and worst films of their respective years, which leaves me at a bit of a crossroads as far as my own personal attachment to the piece is concerned.<br /><br />The main focal point of almost all the `talk' surrounding `Holy Motors' has been the fact that absolutely no one has any idea what this film is about, and so by virtue of that sentiment it must be about all things at once, thus becoming the only film in the history of cinema to say everything there is to say about absolutely nothing at all.  I concur with this assessment because, when all is said and done and the limousines have stopped talking to one another I feel as though I have experiences something completely unlike anything else and yet I have no idea what it is that I have just experienced.  Somewhere between the makeshift parade through the streets and the Disney inspired swan song in an abandoned building this film gained and lost and then gained me again and yet I'm still struggling to put any of it all together.<br /><br />The basic gist of the story follows Mr. Oscar as he travels in a limo with Celine, his driver, from one appointment to the next.  At each appointment he transforms into someone different and causes chaos of some sort, whether it be emotionally or physically.  Each segment flows into the next, each feeling somewhat cohesive despite being drastically separate and by the end of the film they all seem to become a part of a larger whole.  The many themes approached by this film are as varied and as complex as the many genres that the film tackles, explores and exemplifies.  If balances the style with the substance in a way that I've never seen a film do before because the substance becomes a part of the style and visa-versa.<br /><br />For the sake of trying to makes and tails of this film, and for the mere fact that that is what we are supposed to do with films like this, I'll throw out some random thoughts I had while watching the film and see if any of them stick.<br /><br />Carax, to me, seems to be exploring the death of cinema.  That was one of the more overwhelming feelings I had while watching the film, as if Lavant's Mr. Oscar represented cinema of the past and his journey to the film's end was like watching it slowly become corroded by new entities and whims and eventually die out.  It became conformed and `tired'; stripped of its life and buoyancy thanks to the weighted feeling of change.  In a way, I felt as if this signified a deeper stance on the more universal feeling of life's progression in general, the way that we as individuals fear adaptation and grow `tired' of the pressure to conform.<br /><br />But there is more.<br /><br />Within each segment, we are introduced to various characters, not only through Lavant's multi-faceted performance by through the various people he comes across.  In each of these pairings we are shown another side to Mr. Oscar and thus given a chance to evaluate the themes of the film.  The remorse of lives unfulfilled, the pain through stunted conversation and the tragedy of misunderstanding loom all over these acts and display a form of humanity that feels authentic and raw without becoming betrayed by theatrics (despite containing moments of outlandishness).  The use of masks and makeup as a way to transcend daily routines give an air of melancholy with regard to the mundane quality of life as we live it and the need or desire to make it something more agreeable.<br /><br />And yet I'm brought back to the central theme of film itself, for `Holy Motors' is above all else (at least in my eyes) a film about film and the love of film and the passion behind keeping film alive.<br /><br />All hyperbole aside, `Holy Motors' is an experience.  Depending on how you react to that experience will of course shape what it is you actually take away from it, but there is no denying that `Holy Motors' is a film that defines film, whether that be in a good or bad way.  There are few films that can rest on that merit alone.  Whether you love or hate this film, the bottom line is that you lived it.  Say what you must, but the film's greatest asset is probably the fact that everyone walks away feeling something totally different, and so it has the ability to become all things to all people while seemingly being about absolutely nothing at all.ntaining moments of outlandishness).

B00499NHLC|5.0|I love both actors that play Sherlock and Dr. Watson- the chemistry is great.  My son introduced me to the series and I am totally hooked.
B003A97PV0|5.0|when i found out about biffy clyro, i bought a few albums, and this was one of them.  i wasn't let down whatsoever.  great stuff from a great band.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|There is alot more hearts and flowers in this book. Good read if you enjoyed book one, fifty shades of grey.
B0000JCFPE|4.0|I remember when I first saw this.  I was about seventeen and the hype surrounding a singular scene had me anticipating a film that was about as trashy and baseless as they come.  I was expecting porn, to be honest, and at seventeen my expectations were not met and I was pretty much let down.  I mean, all that hype over a crotch shot?<br /><br />Seeing this film in my adulthood has certainly paid off, for my expectations and my personal gratifications are different.  I got far more than I bargained for, since the only memory I had of this film was mere apathy.  This last go around I found a film that has not only aged well but has transformed itself into something almost classy; a film that flirts with the edge of seduction and desire but in a way that is transcendent and almost respectable.  In the capable hands of Paul Verhoeven (never thought I'd say that, but this is his wheelhouse), a film with a reputation can and does become something else entirely.<br /><br />This is a clever, tightly woven thrill ride that titillates where necessary and takes the viewer everywhere they desire to go.  Murder and sex are intertwined in a way that blossoms on the screen thanks to the very iconic performance delivered by Sharon Stone; a forcefully delicious mix of mystery and carelessness.  Douglas is a tad underwhelming (or more than that) and some of the details can come off silly at times, but the way that Verhoeven styles this soap opera is just pitch perfect, allowing the audience to forgive the obvious faults.<br /><br />For a film that let me down so hard as a teen, it has fully redeemed itself in my adulthood.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|One of my favorite all time Barbra movies.... To watch it cleaned up on BLU-RAY HI DEF..... And remastered soundtrack. On Dolby surround sound.... Is a dream come true....
B00BLLXGS0|5.0|i'm always weary of double albums, but this is worth the extra $5 for the &#34;deluxe&#34; version.  i mean, with a band like this, why would you 'not' want to hear their extended tracks during this recording session?  awesome new album, some great new songs, this band has really come a long way.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|A lot of love went into making the show and a lot went into making this exhaustive set. It's much more than just the shows with many director's and writers commentaries.  Has Razor extended cut and Pegasus 40 minute extended versions.
B0095P29EG|4.0|It's very entertaining and the graphics look great in HD. I recommend this movie to families with children over 5yrs. Good clean fun.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie was amazingly well done. I enjoyed its pacing, its plot, and the characters. To be honest there was nothing to not enjoy, and I actually praise that Disney really took the time to make a movie about being a video game.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I love Luke's music, each song makes you wanna move.  Spring Break is worth the money and is reasonable priced.

B000AQJPQE|5.0|Bought this for my son and he loves it. Very well made product. We had so much fun putting it together and hanging it up. It was very simple. The light works great as a night llight to help him sleep and it shuts off automatically.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great read, literally like you were with him chilling out and listening..You couldn't ask for a better written book...Certainly a huge loss to America and the Lone Star state, Chris Kyle is and exemplary human  with morals and stead fast character... Do your self a favor a read this book... One of my favorites.... I sure all who have read this and the community of seals, certainly believe that the light of day became dimmer with out his presence...  And the proceeds of this book go to a great cause....
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Disney Pixar do it again,great animation funny movie,was well worth the purchse price.Shame product arrived with smashed box,DVD was fine though.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|Classic movie for anyone.  This movie is funny, sad and dramatic.  You can watch this move over and over and never get bored of it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A good game when you want to sit down and loose a few minutes and relax. Straight forward and easy to pickup, practically SimCity but at least you don't have to worry about crime an  pollution and civilian unrest! Only drawback is how much Facebook interaction is seemingly forced onto you, lot of the missions have me posting a photo or liking their page which is just pointless. That is however my only complaint!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Do yourself a favor and have a box of tissues round about the mid point...  The book opens up very slow with tons of background info and sets the stage for what is to come...  I don't know any of the men in the book but when your done reading you felt as if you lost your best friends on that mountain side..  I read threw the first time with a huge lump in my throat fighting rage because of the ROE's and fighting to stay calm as you read threw the accounts... I was as if the pages were flying by in light speed rate...  However having made such an impact I sat my children down ( the older ones) and began explaining to them the real definition of HERO! I get kids can pick and choose who their idols maybe and what sport they might play but they will never have earned the respect as these men and so many other veterans have... I read to them the accounts of Operation RedWing and got about half way threw and lost it.. had to leave the table, to leave them wondering what was wrong with dad...  If you  have to explain VALOR,  then those words are wasted you cant explain it, its unfair to say there is a definition for it, I feel it is just who you are.. These guys will teach you what Valor is and it doesn't involve Websters dictionary... DIetz, Axe, Murph if hope I grow old never to forget your names and what you did... Fair winds and following seas...  Marcus hold tight to them, calm the storm move forward, never let their names die... You were the Lone Survivor, Gods plan for you lays out there somewhere... Stay strong, cry often, and like any great Seal fall as many times necessary because its not how many times you fall but how times are you willing to get back up....<br /><br />See ya Down Range at SOFREP

B004W1GCQO|4.0|This program has a similar premise to Downtown Abbey but with a lot more sexiness and color! Def a must see!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Even though this is geared to children, adults will love this movie as well.  The message is universal, and one everyone should hear.  The visuals are stunning, and the writing superb.  All the voiceovers are extremely well done.  A must see!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is one of the best story lines ever! I loved the fifty shades trilogy, but I love this one more! I would recommend this to everyone! Can't wait to read entwined to you!!! I will go crazy waiting!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The out side case for this item is wonderful, and they really did a great job on this Blu Ray. Worth the money IMO to get this one on Blu Ray. The up converting made a huge difference and the sound really jumps off the page now.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Interesting plot with fun twist. Anyone enjoying a decent plot, lots of action, and characters with depth might enjoy this movie.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Matthew McConaughey and the rest of the cast were very engaging.  An interesting and refreshing take on lawyering.  Marisa Tomei was excellent and brought a strong female presence to the screen.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is great! Though the topic may seem dull at first - sort of a recycled Upstairs Downstairs that aired in the 70s on BBC, the fast paced converstations and intrigue keep me glued to each episode. Hope there will be many more seasons of this.
B002M9WW30|5.0|All the Rocky Movies on Blu Ray. Worth the money as this epic tale takes us on a journey. These movies take me back to my childhood, and the remastered and upscale make these movies even more brilliant.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|If you're looking for a movie with lots of action plus a plot that could be followed then you'll enjoy Dredd. The devistation effects are pretty awesome as well.
B00004YRQA|5.0|We recently purchased a new PlayStation 2 slim, and I almost forgot to purchase a memory card. These are absolutely necessary to save your game. Installing these merely requires the simple plug-in action you are used to with a wired game controller. From there you are on your way. I think for most casual players or those only involved with a few different games, the 8 MB size will be more than sufficient (its capabilities may even stretch beyond that, but this is the way I use it).
B005FC49MS|4.0|fun film to watch. people have said it they dont get it and some do. none of that matters if you like his work than you know what your going to get.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I had to have this on Blu Ray. I love these movies, and the casing is very good on this item. I thought a lot of creativity came through on this design. The movies in Blu Ray where awesome. I understand that some people wanted the triology to remain without the updates in technology, but I enjoyed the up covert to blu ray.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I have been a life-long fan of Keith Richards.  I read Life when it was originally released and am now re-reading it.  Keith Richards was so forthright about his fascinating career and personal life.  He has many aspects--yes, the drug-using outlaw Keith, but also the gentle and caring Keith, as well as the great musician Keith.  All of these aspects are revealed in his book.  Life is a great read, not only for Keith's fans, but also for anyone interested in rock & roll.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really enjoy this alarm clock, it gently wakes me. Very nice. All I ask from an alarm clock.<br />  Hopefully this will help.
B003IY48PS|5.0|what a great film. classic. a must own for any horror fan. will watch over and over again bruce is great
B002T9H2L0|5.0|What can you say about a movie where one spy beats another spy to death with a baseball bat and than get the rest of the men captured to give up all there information. I call it awesome sauce. Tarrintino is the man, and his movies are awesome on Blu Ray.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just a perfect calculator app.  A simple display, no nonsense, Nice big buttons and a scientific calculator too!
B009KEN87O|4.0|Really enjoyed the graphics and classic fun. Reminds me of old school arkaid games like centepied. The 3d action is a nice add on as well. Ghis is definitely a down time fav.
1582701709|5.0|This is a copy i sent to a friend in order to share the power of the message. i have my own copy, which i've read at least 6 times in 3 years ... i love this book ... it came in a timely manner and was in excellent condition, according to the recipient who is in Australia! I am grateful to the shipper for sending this item that far! Thank you!
B0015XHP4K|5.0|Action movie Blu Ray's are amazing, and well worth the price. It really brings some of these movies from the 80's and even the 70's and earlier back to life. Really happy that Blu Ray is so amazing.
B007QJ9CR0|5.0|An all time classic. Opening credits run for several minutes into the film, which is subtle and entertaining. Story is very spooky and film is terrific.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great  Calculator!  Easy to use.  I tried a couple of others and this was the best one by far!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|The product was a little shorter than I wanted, but is still very good.  I don't know what you want from me
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Speilberg and his trilogies. I had to pick this up, and Back to the Future both of these are great trilogies and worth adding to anyone's collection. These movies are timeless.
B009AMALLM|3.0|They need to stop rehashing the same series of events and scares and take it all to the next level vs this incremental unveiling of the expanded plot. If this were a TV series then okay... but to simply stretch out a storyline in a movie series is starting to get stale for me... if there isn't enough there to tell the full story then end it and search for something that can sustain an expanded universe of story material.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|A cute movie for young children. I watched it with my Grandchildren. It was old vampire meets the modern world.
0307474259|4.0|The book is very good, gives me what i need to lose weight naturally and permanently, thanks gary taubes<br />a
B008MIMWOO|5.0|All 3 Austin Powers movies for 15 bucks. I normally don't go with comedy for Blu Ray, but at 5 bucks per movie this is well worth the price.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Life of Pi was a lot more than I expected.  It was suspenseful, magical, and had a message.  I would recommend highly.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great writing and great actors. I watch on my Kindle and don't want to put it down! I hope the series continues for a long time.
B000HZD168|5.0|One of my favorites of the Star Trek movies with the original cast in them even has a young Kirstie alley in it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife talked me into watching Downton Abbey. I thought I would humor her and watch one episode. I was hooked and we are going to stream season 3.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I just picked this up without knowing anything about it, and was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Although the main character struggles with mental illness and has his share of ups and downs, he keeps trying to improve and move on. The story is well written and realistic. I found myself cheering for the him and his family and hoping things would work out. I recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the series and can't wait for season 4. I really like all the actors and the storyline. I was really sad to see Mathew what he looks like to be dead after all they went through.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What's not to like?!  This is such an excellent series.  Love it and will spend many afternoons watching the entire series over and over.
B008NABUU8|4.0|This is a really good construction game. Music is nicely done. Elements of different materials are well done. Like the truck and car concept.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|An absolutely amazing distraction. I never had a problem. Very high quality game. Frequently updated. You get a lot for the price.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Enjoy playing. Not complicated.Would recommend to anyone who enjoys match three games or any arcade game.Go get it soon. You won't regret.
B008RTE08E|5.0|It seems to be the fashionable thing to trash this movie, something that it doesn't deserve.  Yes, the Beatles were amateurs and probably in over their heads in trying to make a movie on their own, but the result was much better than it was given credit for.  If Monty Python had put this movie out, everyone would be ranting and raving about how great it was.<br /><br />This film was a precursor to the Monty Python style of comedy, as well as music videos in general.  If anything, the Beatles were ahead of their time in making this movie.<br /><br />I watched this DVD soon after purchasing it.  This was the first time I had seen the movie since it was originally released.  The quality of this DVD, both sound and video, is great!  After watching the movie, I watched the track with the commentary by Paul McCartney.  I don't know what group I will be placed in for saying this, but I really enjoyed this movie.  It was fun, it was funny, and watching the Beatles perform their music was such a treat.<br /><br />If you're not a Beatles fan, this might not be a good choice for you.  But for those of you who are, you need to have this in your collection.  Be sure to watch it, and don't let all of the people who make fun of it stop you from enjoying it!!
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|I will always buy any new music from Bon Jovi, and being able to download it for 5.00 was great
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Everybody loves this show, including me. The cast is very believable and so is the situations that they keep finding themselves in. One of the most exciting shows I've seen in a long time. Seems to have equal male/female appeal because my wife and I both love it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a good book from beginning to end. Somewhat predictable but a good read more the less for when your waiting in line for something.
B00328R21C|5.0|My son loves the land speeder and having a Luke Skywalker minifig. It's a Star Wars must have for all Star Wars fans.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Loved it! I can't wait to start the next book!  It made me giggle out loud at times. Thank you!
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This was an absolutely fabulous and heart-warming movie!!!  I could watch this movie over and over again.  Will be in my movie collection!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am not quite through the entire season yet but it is really good. Jessica Lang is great in this show, and I love horror. This show is always fun and exciting-you never know what is going to happen so it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to post any spoilers but I was shocked at the hint of an alien abduction in one episode!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. Literally anything can happen  - they are not married to a specific plot or a specific set of characters. Expect the unexpected -- brilliant, and only getting better as the series pushes on.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This was a good book but it did get confusing at times when the story moves back and forth from time periods.  Parts rambled a bit but for the most part, I enjoyed the book.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I bought this to use for making bottles into decorations/gifts.  Cut my first bottle with ease after scoring and then separating with boiling water from my teapot followed by cold water from the faucet.  I will have to buy some more sandpaper, but that's easy to find.  So glad they included multiple cutters to extend the life of the product.
0425252868|5.0|The actual event of what Stiegler did was, by itself, amazing.  The story of how Brown and Stiegler met, despite the odds, was even more so.  But the detail of each pilot's background before, during and after the war was even better.  I cannot say enough about the superb detail and writing by these two authors.  I thought my top book was Unbroken, but A Higher Call is now my favorite.  My mother was a German war bride, and the hardships she suffered were much the same as Stiegler suffered after the war.  I had assumed (wrongly) that the pinnacle of this book would be the actual encounter between Stiegler and Brown.  I was very wrong, the book for me was spellbinding in every way, leading up to  the emotional gathering in Seattle.  I thoroughly compliment Makos and Alexander on their research and writing skills.  I have shared this book with friends and all have loved it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Fox consistently makes huge mistakes with their programming decisions and this was the biggest mistake they ever made--followed very closely by the cancellation of Arrested Development. Firefly had such a great cast of characters, a wonderfully unique setting, and amazing special effects for its time. Admittedly I was a late comer to the show, but I would've likely discovered it had it ran past the first season. The Firefly, Futurama, Arrested Development, and Family Guy cancellations are proof that Fox television execs have their heads up their rears.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|big fan of chiklis<br />the series is great with good cop and really bad cop<br />and michael happen to be a really bad cop it worth<br />watching

B006GWO5NE|2.0|very slow at charging but it works ,to bad i ordered 2 by accident , just order the original charger ,because this is just the usb cable.
B004UHSB5A|1.0|It is hard to get tiles from rack to playing board. I thought there would be instructions and tips. It said if any questions go to menu. I could not find menu on my Kindle.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|Fun way to learn algebra...great for kids and adults!  Highly recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshed as well.
B00AC8ZA3M|2.0|This movie would have been much better if it had more action.  The story line was very slow, difficult to follow, and not enough action.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|Best work from One Republic.highley recommended.the beats to the songs are very crafty. Every song on the album is memorable.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Finally, a slim set of headphones that won't fall off while I run.  They are fine for small heads/ ears.

0061992860|4.0|Same old stuff as in others but in a compact size. Easy to pack or put in a vehicle survival kit.
0205632645|5.0|I love this book.<br />It's a beautiful tool.<br />It's a cook's favorite knife.<br /><br />Between this and Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" I had everything I needed to start and finish my first novel.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was very well done and good for all ages.  For the adults, it has great 80's references, good cast, and is funny.  For the kids it is very entertaining.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|this is an awesome game. it starts out easy, but the further u go into the game, the harder it gets. hope they make more like this one. well worth the money.  buy it !!!!!!!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I've never had a creative writing lesson outside of high school. When I decided I wanted to write a book this was the starting place most recommended, by both my friends and my internet searches.<br /><br />I couldn't have been happier with it.<br /><br />I'm not a great fan of Stephen King's novels, granted I've only read his earlier works, but this is one of my favorite books. It didn't just help me write a book, it helped me feel that I could do something else with my life. It's real and inspiring with great, practical advice. After reading this I always say Stephen King is my favorite author; not because of what he writes, but because of his attitude toward the craft. Early on in the book, he recommends Strunk and White's \\"The Elements of Style,\\" saying it has little detectable bulls***. I say the same about \\"On Writing.\\"
B009AJDDQU|2.0|I was excited to see this movie and was expecting some good special affects.  The movie started as expected, but quickly lost its luster for me.  There was so much potential here for a good sci-fi and special affects.  Instead it was dull and I could barely wait for it to end.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|green day is one of the most prolific and insightfull bands of the 90's yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

1455519006|5.0|I love all of David Baldacci's books.  They are full of action and suspense. The characters are true to life.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|This app has every music video there is. If you are tired of YouTube (like me) this is the app for you
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a good game. I highly recomend it. The game is very fun~ interesting~  and entertaining. Theres  a lot of juming and collecting coins.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is fun but some of the games are hard to finish other then that it is an over all good game lots of different things youngan play.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen the concerts of the music from Les Miz on television and always wanted a movie version.  This one fills the bill.
1449410243|4.0|Book sold where casual gifts are found.  Also a good coffee table book.  The poster is one to hang prominently

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|my 12 yo and 9 yo had fun solving the puzzle. its not in my top 3 (with nightmares and abyss) but for sure top 10. maybe top 5. having the monkey helper was a nice touch.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Kindle Fire HD (KFhd?) app-store and found fairly quickly by searching for Digipom (Inc.)...  free version installed and then (not sure about \\"widget\\"...) first time running- defaulted to highest resolution (.wav) recording.<br /><br />Lowering to the middle (.mp4) and most disk-space-saving (.3gp?) formats, kind of sparse in choices, but immediate (estimate) of # hours can record (based on free space on device) helpful gauge.  Simultaneous playback and recording, and eventually attaching to e-mail and using VLC on (desktop-replacement) notebook computer only downside- the .3gp file unable to jump/skip-ahead; but with ~30x accelerated playback, still usable.<br /><br />Like title- simple, but very usable.<br />-abcj1
B0095P33IW|4.0|There are a couple of slow moments, but not that many! For today's action-type film, Captain America is actually a pretty good one. It's also refreshing to see a movie with a little bit of un-apologized-for patriotism! (Do we really have to go back to a WW2 film to find a bold statement of loving one's country? Now that's sad!)  Regardless, this is a noble film for an action movie. The acting is good, the effects above average, the message is welcome!  I also find it refreshing to view a film that doesn't rely on expletives to fill half the movie's dialog. (Thank you, filmmaker!)  This is one that I'll probably watch again on a rainly Saturday morning.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Nothing beats Star Wars.  I would recomend this to anyone although it's kind of sad that the originals we had on VHS are not in this version (Jabba the hut in CGI is lame)
145470246X|5.0|This book has absolutely beautiful projects!  It is not a book for beginners; the projects are varied and beautiful. Each project has steps to guide you from beginning to end to make stunning designs.  There are some fairly simple projects, and LOTS of inspiration!

B000001FQQ|4.0|I had bought this CD on March 8, 2013.  \\"Hide Your Heart\\" AND \\"Forever\\" were the songs that I was most familiar with.  It is one of their LONGEST studio albums, that feature 15 songs.  It is also approx. 58 minutes long.  I'm going to offer my viewpoint on each of these songs, as follows:<br /><br />1. \\"Rise To It\\"...Pretty good album opener & I like it.<br /><br />2. \\"Betrayed\\"...This song has a good message to it & I like it.<br /><br />3. \\"Hide Your Heart\\"...This song rec'd some radio airplay, but it wasn't a huge hit like \\"Forever\\" was.  This is one of my favorite songs on this album, even if the meaning ISN'T that uplifting.<br /><br />4. \\"Prisoner Of Love\\"...This song grew on me, real fast, & now I like it.<br /><br />5. \\"Read My Body\\"...This song can remind me of \\"Keep Me Comin\\", from 1982's \\"Creature's Of The Night\\" album, because of it's meaning & it's tempo.  And I like this song, too.<br /><br />6. \\"Love's A Slap In The Face\\"...I like this song...it's pretty good.<br /><br />7. \\"Forever\\"...This song was the Top 40 hit single, reaching #8 in February 1990.  THIS song reminds me of their previous & MINOR hit from 1987...\\"Reason To Live\\".  I love BOTH of these songs, EQUALLY.<br /><br />8. \\"Silver Spoon\\"...I like this song, it's pretty good.<br /><br />9. \\"Cadillac Dreams\\"...This is a real good song about money & dreams.  Kind of comical @ times & enjoyable, for sure.<br /><br />10. \\"King Of Hearts\\"...Decent song, which I like quite well.<br /><br />11. \\"The Street Giveth & The Street Taketh Away\\"...Note how the \\"HEY Man\\" part sounds a lot like David Bowie's 1972 song titled \\"Suffragette City\\".  This song, by Kiss, is pretty good.<br /><br />12. \\"You Love Me To Hate You\\"...An odd song & title, but I really think this song is DECENT. Silly, but true...but I think that Ozzy Osbourne OR EVEN Alice Cooper could be GOOD on this song.<br /><br />13. \\"Somewhere Between Heaven & Hell\\"...this song is pretty good.<br /><br />14. \\"Little Caesar\\"...Passable song!<br /><br />15. \\"Boomerang\\"...I like this song.<br /><br />NOTE: I really LIKE this album TITLE \\"Hot In The Shade\\"...I only wish that Kiss recorded a SONG of the SAME name.  I think it's a decent album & I would recommend it, definitely!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|A horribly boring movie & depressing. Is that what we Americans are really like... disfunctional & cluless as to what the real problems and solutions are? A total waste of my time and money.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I expected this movie to be a docu-drama about the raid to get UBL. Although this is an accurate characterization of the last 20 minutes of the film, this 2.5 Hour+ film covers helps us see the efforts and challenges that were faced by those who ultimately located him. It helps us see their dedication without being overtly (or overly) patriotic.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Pat People's is great... I watched the movie, but as always, the book is much, much better :) I recommend
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Having taught Elizabethan Drama and loving it, I am a great proponent of emotional and imaginative investment in stage productions of any kind. Having said that, and, additionally, having seen &#34;Les Mis&#34; produced on stage quite a few times, I am amazed and delighted by the visually stunning scenes this movie brought me! With the sole exception of Russell Crowe, [well past his prime as an actor and never having had a prime as a singer], the voices  were sublime, the acting totally wonderful, and the few changes (e.g.the Innkeeper and wife's final &#34;solo&#34; at the Ball, near the conclusion), I found myself completely rewarded as a viewer and lover of the story.<br />I am equally pleased to own it in blu-ray DVD; I switched over to Amazon's listing to compare a few lyrics and was struck immediately by the degradation in sound quality and visual acuity.  I invest the extra money into blu-ray for this purpose only. Certain movies deserve this treatment, others, not so much! Am I pleased to have invested $23.into this magnificent production? You betcha! Do I recommend buying it? Yes, if you like this type of production: my neighbor was quite angry after going to see it on the big screen, knowing only that it was quite loved by many, but NOT prepared for 2 1/2 hours of &#34;just singing&#34;. I have heard all the criticism of the play/opera for 20 some years and do not wish to argue basics.I enjoyed the movie very much.<br /> Would I have enjoyed it more if Russell Crowe had jumped off the bridge before signing to play this pivotal role? Oh YES and yes again! But having said that, WOW! What a movie!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was ok...I don't have a whole lot to say. It appeared to be a book on porn. That's about it.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I have always enjoyed looking things up on Wikipedia. It usually answers most of my questions. That's why I downloaded the app for my kindle fire.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not as spellbinding as others but still good. Can not wait for another. Still one of my favorite writers. Hope you enjoy.
B005LAII08|5.0|I love this movie.  I'd like to buy a copy for every little girl in the whole world.  It's the classic mother/daughter struggle and the headstrong, capable heroine doesn't want a prince!  Sure to become a classic, this flick is one the whole family will enjoy, over and over.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I loved reading this book. I had a great time relaxing and just enjoying the story that the author created.
1613821654|5.0|How fab this was!  Particularly the version which has all sorts of additional information, including a great bio of the author, and notes on the differences between the original version, which is what the text is, and the 1831 version, which is the most widely published.  Plus a short fragment written by Byron.  I must say that his style of writing is so like the book that I can see how many others have questioned its authorship.  And how different from the 20 or so movie versions I have seen.  This is easily the most filmed novel in movie history.  The book is not about the monster at all, who is never named, but is quite intelligent and literate.  It is about Victor Frankenstein.  \\"Prometheus\\" says it all.  A Titan in Greek mythology who stole fire from heaven, gave it to man, and was then tortured for that action by Zeus.  So we see how dearly Victor paid for that gift of life to the monster.  Only Ernest, his brother, is left at the end, a student somewhere.  Plodding, overdone style, which is in keeping with the writing of the times.  And if Victor wept once, or shed tears copiously, he did so 100 times.  He was ALWAYS weeping.  Plus I think there were many mistakes in the novel's plotline.  Many inconsistencies, but it doesn't matter at all.  Poor Victor!  He played with fire and got burnt.

You will need to carve 8 plus hours out of your day because you aren't going to want to stop watching. My husband and father love it too!! Wish Prime Members could get Season Three free.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This book was straight out porn. I didn't really see a plot and I really didn't understand why this book was written.
B0055IU4GM|2.0|This album is certainly not horrid but if I had it to do over, I would not have purchased. Kind of country without his usual soulful style. If you compare to some of his other albums, this one is a loser. You know how when film directors direct something that later they don't want to be associated with, they take their name off, well that's what Hiatt should have done with this one. This one just doesn't cut it and certainly is way down the scale in showing his talent and style. If you like Hiatt and want some of his music forget this one. I wanted to share with a friend and while playing I felt bad because my friend was uninterested and so was I. I had the sense to purchase another better album that showed Hiatt's skills later, so that made up for this poor choice plus showed my friend what I had spoken about regarding Hiatt's music.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I cant explain how much i love this game its so amazing first game i got on my kindle SO AMAZING LUV LUV LUV LUV THIS GAME ,MAKE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS PLEASE
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I kept hearing everyone talk about this show, but I didn't really know what it was about.  When I read the description, I was still a little sceptical but decided to try it anyway.  I was hooked after the first show.  It is just an amazing cast and script.  Can't wait to start season 3.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I loved reading this book. I had a great time relaxing and just enjoying the story that the author created.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I love Art House movies and his other works, but this one was a total bore-feat.  I finally ended the absolute torture of this movie when the lead started banging his head against he wall because he could not walk through it.  I wish he had, disappeared and put the rest of us out of our misery  Do yourselves a favor and skip this one and save your money-I wish I did.
0307361012|4.0|I've read the entire Harry Hole series, of which, The Bat is the first.  That this is the first is somewhat on display.  Nevertheless, for Harry Hole fans this is a must-read.
B000ICXQS8|5.0|I read the short story by Annie Proulx a few years ago, and it made me cry. I didn't think the movie would be as powerful as the story, but I was wrong-- it is every bit as haunting, heart-breaking, and darkly beautiful. This story isn't just about a love affair between gay men. It has a deeper message and meaning that is as powerful and clear to me as a lightning bolt. In essence, it's a story about how we choose to live our lives. Do we live the life we think is \\"right\\" even if it wasn't meant for us (and suffer in silence for years), or do we follow our hearts for a chance at happiness? I find it sad that so few of us do the latter, though it's certainly a much harder path. Still, there are risks, consequences, and sacrifices either way that none of us can predict. Though I'm a woman married to a man, I see so much of myself in Ennis, and I'm making a conscious effort not to be like him. I want to live life authentically, and in a way that will cause the least amount of regret. This, I think, is the hardest thing we as humans may ever have to do. And, everything else aside, it is the heart and soul of this story/movie.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The book was ok...I don't have a whole lot to say. It appeared to be a book on porn. That's about it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I decided to read this book because it is a bestseller. I was in for a surprise. Halfway through the book, the author does a 360 on you and you have to reevaluate everything you thought. Just when you think you have it figured out, another twist in the story appears. The characters are crazy in a genius way. Loved it. It's a great read, can't stop, good for anyone kind of book.
B00632HWOG|4.0|yahoo Mail  is Like all the rest of the E-Mail once you get so you can find your way around they upgrade it and change things but if you did not upgrade then we would complain because you didn't upgrade so I GUESS I'M SAYING I LIKE IT BECAUSE I USE IT ON MY LAPTOP AND KINDLE
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I just finished watching the third series via Amazon Prime.  Great cast with unusual story lines.  Reminds me a bit of the old X Files but better.
0385333846|4.0|I had to read this book for my college English class. I'm not a big reader but this book I read in 3 days. It has a great story and keeps you wondering whats going to happen next.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, enjoyed all the characters and how they interacted with each other. Easy read and could be enjoyed by all.
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|This was OK.  I watched it online, so I didn't have the issues people had with the new projection technology (I never saw Gandalf's contact lenses, for example).  I know the writers altered the script to anticipate &#34;The Lord of the Rings,&#34; and I have issues with that.  I still think expanding the novel to three movies is strangling the golden goose.<br /><br />The cast is good.  I always enjoy Christopher Lee, and Martin Freeman is an engaging actor.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show has lots of plot holes, but overall, it is fun to watch and is based on an interesting concept.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I first purchased this companies product for my Sony Clie many years ago and 3 years ago for my Motorola Droid and carried it over when I got a Droid Bionic.  It worked great then and the preliminary test on the Kindle fire seems that they are still tops in that area of apps.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I used to watch old school Doctor Who on PBS when I was a child, first the one with the scarf, then the one with the broccoli boutonniere.<br /><br />I had seen clips of the &#34;reboot&#34; over the years and it didn't pique my interest.  Something about it seemed a little too corny to me.<br /><br />However, I decided to check out the first season because it was free with my Amazon Prime membership.<br /><br />OMG IT WAS SO GOOD.<br /><br />The writing stayed true and consistent to the original - it wasn't a reboot at all, it was a continuation.  Immediately, we empathize with Rose Tyler and her mundane and rather ordinary existence.  She couldn't be some rich glamour queen or else we'd never be able to understand the Doctor through a commoner's eyes.  I also enjoyed that we could see the multiculturalism of London through her relationship.<br /><br />I won't give anything away when it comes to the story line, but there are some very interesting concepts that the first season deals with, including the return of some old foes.<br /><br />I very much recommend Season 1 to anyone who loves good storytelling, history, science fiction, and fantasy.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This was a great movie.  Fun, tragic, and triumphant all in one.  Can't say enough good about John Hawkes and Helen Hunt.  They were superb.  The rest of the cast was excellent as well.  A must see movie. Just an amazing story.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|The only reason I give this one star is because I got the message that this game is not compatible with my Kindle Fire.  I have downloaded other Angry Bird games with no problem, but can't get this one.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I had this app on my Droid and now on the Kindle and I haven't found any other app that comes close to this for the job it is made for. The graphic field strength chart and listings have tons of information on the Wi-Fi routers it finds, including signal strength, type of encryption and more.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a good, quick read that I really enjoyed.  It was a nice book to read going into spring.  The middle sort of got strange but the rest, I loved.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I heard a lot about this movie during the awards shows and decided to watch it here. Some of this movie's portrayal did not jive with history though
140123769X|5.0|Fables has been one of my favorite books since it came out. Recently, however, I felt the series was lagging somewhat. With this book, Willingham returns to form. The story is tightly wound and packs a whallup of a punch. The cub's characters come to life nicely. I hope the series goes forward with the energy from this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow...what a story! I couldn't put it down!!! Lots of surprises!!!! Expect the unexpected!!! Gillian Flynn is my new favorite author!!!
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|Theatrical sets throughout, beautiful costumes, great love story. Jude Law is not the sexy one in this it is the other guy!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This ap is very good for weather conditions, forecast, and radar.  Would recommend this ap to keep track of local and remote weather, I use it when I am traveling.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Please read my review under Season One for the entire series..its covered entirely there rather than commenting on each season.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love the story, scenery, costumes, and most of characters, but there's definitely an undercurrent of homosexual agenda.  It's one thing to intimate that Thomas is gay, quite another to show him kissing a guy. There was no reason to show that. Ick.
B009JZVT70|4.0|On vacation with about an eight hour flight both ways, &#34;once upon&#34; is the ideal fun thing to watch.  Enjoy.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was such a gem. I can watch it over and over and never grow tired.  The characters are loveable and the plots are interesting and they really draw you in.  I'm ashamed of myself of not supporting and watching this show while it was on TV.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story was a great YA book.  I especially liked that it was set in Indiana, and that it was a different kind of book about cancer.
B00BU2TEGS|5.0|Martin, if you're reading this, for the love of God, bring Alan back.  Your music is strong, it's always been.  The departure of Alan Was obvious since Ultra.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Truly devoted fan since 1985,<br />Ireneusz J. Wojcik
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Its a good way to pass time. The graphics and pictures are great. I would definately recommend this game!
B00BLGY8X2|5.0|Kind of a sleeper. Didn't quite know what to expect. Very impressive acting, Don't read too many reviews - allow yourself to be pleasantly surprised.
B00459GJUM|4.0|This is a departure from other seasons of stargate, and a move to more character development. I think that  the subtle character development is done very well. The development of relationships was also interesting.
B00BUI6D2A|4.0|OKAY I'LL ADMIT I'VE NEVER HEARD THIS ALBUM, BUT GUESSING FROM THE REVIEWS HERE IT'S ANOTHER BAD RAP ALBUM.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|my daughter loves this app. she is a huge my little pony fan so it keeps her busy on long car rides
B0055B7IPE|5.0|We'd seen UP before, but my wife and I decided to watch it again - a nice respite from Breaking Bad and The Walking Dead. It's a wonderful film and as a bonus, our new eight-month-old black lab was riveted to the screen during the dog sequences. We also give our new dog, a city shelter rescue, five stars.
B00BUL1HJ6|5.0|OKAY I'LL ADMIT I'VE NEVER HEARD THIS ALBUM, BUT I HAVE A SPECIAL GIFT OF MUSIC, AND I PRESERVE IT BY AVOIDING THE RADIO.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Probably a more accurate account of one of the more important military operation in decades.  The book read smoothly, and a good job explaining operations.
B001UAX56A|5.0|Definetly a great buy as a big fan of Lauryn Hill. :D I highly recommend to other fellow hip hop lovers  :D
B002N5N5M0|4.0|This is my first four star rating of the tv show Dexter because of certain things within this season of Dexter.  The main issue being the ending to the season...you'll have to buy it to see what I mean. But like my other reviews of Dexter tv show I will give you fans main highlights of the season.  Dexter is now a father and the personal life, marriage life is affecting his work life.  He is feeling the need to want to kill again but can't seem to find a good victim to kill, plus we have the police force trying to solve so much at one time detracts from the storyline.  This season the police force has to main cases to solve \\"the vaction murders\\" and what detective Lundy from season two is back trying to get the person known as \\"The Trinity Killer.\\"  Dexter tries to get closer to the person actor playing Trinity in order to kill him.  But as Dexter gets to know him he realizes he is just like him, stress gets to him and ends up killing an innocent man. A few episodes seem to drag on but still added to some of the storyline but seem forced, also Dexter wants to kill Trinity himself so misleads the police until police really find out who The Trinity killer real name is.  But like most season we already know Dexter gets his man and dumps him in ocean, so you have to watch this season to see what I am talking about.  But one big spolier Debra finds out who Dexter boligical mother is and what his real name was before Harry took him in.  Lara Moser, which she figure out his brother was Byran Moser from season one the Ice Truck Murder.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Katie tried to avoid personal entanglements until she met the widower, Alex and his two children. Gradually, Katie let down her guard and we become intoxicated by the vivid, true to life, mesmerizing idyllic obsession of new love, the drama that emerges and develops, that, tried and tested, develops into an even deeper well of desire and total commitment. We can share the laughs, tears, love, the luscious provocation of all. Excellent.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Don't listen to the people that say it is hard. I'm 12 and beat in a few days.<br />Definitely recommend it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I had the original game, but somehow it got corrupted on my phone.  I then downloaded again.  The challenge is to make sure you get three stars on every level....  The game will last awhile before you have that accomplished.
B00B5SGXRU|5.0|I just heard Heaven for the first time today, and the first thing that came into my mind was that it sounds like something John Lennon could have recorded in 2013 if he was still with us today. I would truly hope that Depeche Mode and their fans would take that as a compliment. It's definately got elements of John's \\"MOTHER\\", and \\"I Want You\\" She's so Heavy. Kind of different for Depeche Mode, but couldn't stop playing it.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|Right about know I'm not the biggest fan of Amazon or this app.......because I purchased this app via Amazon's \\"1 click purchase\\" thru my account on my kindle and never got it, so as it stands right now (15min after purchase) Amazon has stolen money from me.<br /><br />After my 1 click I followed the onscreen directions of going to my home screen and then clicking on the app button, then your to push the cloud button and then just click it to download to the device. Well guess what......it's still not in my cloud or on my device but I've got a receipt from Amazon show in  I'm out $1.99<br /><br />I have yet to go through the 200step process to get an Amazon rep on the phone(gonna give a few more minutes to see if it's just as slow as a Pentium 1 chip from the 90's)<br /><br />This is just the latest in issues and complaint's I've had I've  the last week with my brand new fire hd so I'm sorry if I come across kinda harsh.<br /><br />UPDATE: I woke up the following day and the App had finally decided to install itself on my Fire HD. I upgraded it's star power from 1 star to 3 stars because I can now actually use the App, but I do remember (haven't really used it since downloading) having a prob with the App's sleep function or something. I'll go back and fully use the App when I have time and put up a final review for all to see.
B0007LXPBI|3.0|This is a great movie and i got it for my 4 year old daughter and it skips the dvd 1/2 way through
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Something so real and relatable in this work of fiction I loved. Keep me guessing and hooked. The characters are who really made me love the book.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Instead of big dinosaurs....well, big other things.....  Out there a ways, but a fast paced, seat of the pants, can't quite set it down yet book!  Sort of a &#34;Land of the Giants&#34; (late 60's TV) with better toys!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I have a 4 year old that likes to play it. Not crazy about eating a person but kids think it's funny
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I needed this App to put on my phone.  Down loaded fast and works great.  Would recommand this App others.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My sis introduced this to me<br />I find it very addictive....I play it  nearly every day.  Helps my day along.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Great job of building tension throughout. The last thirty minutes were amazing Anne suspenseful. Really well done.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|Clutch never fails to deliver the goods to the loyal gearheads out there.  Earth Rocker is a sound marvel, with the unstoppable rhythm section of JP Gasser and Dan Maines, clearly the best in the business; Tim Sult’s guitar barrage, and the incomparable Neil Fallon’s soulful howl and always creative lyrics.  Listening to Earth Rocker transports you to another time and place; this band is aging like fine wine only getting better with time.  All the tracks are standouts, but Crucial Velocity, Cyborg Bette, and DC Sound Attack are all sing along anthems that will get stuck in your head.  Earth Rocker leaves no doubt why these guys are considered Pro-Rock!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Ok, so the movie won't win an Oscar (if you're looking for highbrow film, go elsewhere), but the laughs just kept coming.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very addictive.  Increasingly difficult levels.  Good for a four year old or a forty year old.  Got it free bit would have paid for it.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, you have a treat awaiting you.  It is utterly captivating, winsome, humorous and deep.  An unwed mother with a child comes to a provincial French village to open a chocolate shop during Lent of all things.  The Mayor of the town is not pleased, but the townspeople are enchanted by this compassionate, intuitive woman who metes out just the chocolate and advice they need.  She is able to change their lives, giving them exactly what they need.  Of course, the Mayor is furious that she is going against religious and moral protocol. He is uptight and frustrated.  But, with the aid of chocolate, she just may be able to win him over.<br /><br />Inspired performances by Juliette Binoche, Alfred Molina, and Judi Dench.  Johnny Depp plays a great rogue gypsy.  It is a movie based on a novel by Joanne Harris. There are some differences in story line but quite similar; the novel is worth reading, too.  I love movies in which characters are transformed.  This is a heart-warming and charming tale.  The scenery is gorgeous, too.  It was filmed in villages in France.<br /><br />I have seen this movie many times.  It's the kind of movie you can watch again and again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Must watch show. The writing is pretty good, the characters have really come to life in this season. The plot hasn't run dry, there is pleanty of progress to be made. It also stays pretty true to the novels while still going in it's own direction. Keeps everyone happy and interested.
0920668372|5.0|I got my copy of this book in 1986... Written by Robert Munsch. It's a beautiful tearry story about a parents love for her child. I now give it as a baby gift. So glad I found it on Amazon. Arrived on date I was told it would and in perfect condition!<br />If you have never read Robert Munsch, now is the time to start!
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Mariah and her vocal range makes this a powerhouse release. Got it for my 8 yr old who knew about it even before we saw the film. She loves to hear it over and over.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I enjoy reading my Kindle books on my tablet. My problem with the app is that I cannot find a way to return to the Library page (the equivalent of the \\"Home\\" page on my Kindle). Once I start reading a book I cannot exit and return to the main page. There must be a way to do so but I have been unable to maneuver from the book to the home screen. Other than that I am very happy with the Kindle for Android app.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|And I never would have guessed it going into the theater.  It's a perfect blend of nonstop action, great story made new and fresh again, and a cast of characters you come to care about and respect within the first 15 minutes of the film.  It is raw and real, which is what makes it so emotionally strong.<br /><br />Battle Los Angeles is a war movie classic, in my opinion, and far far better than critics and some viewers give it credit for.  I wonder if we were even watching the same movie!  And no one could do the acting job Aaron Eckhardt did as Sgt. Nantz.  Bravo!
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Would any of you guys happen to know when an extended version of the movie maybe release like they did Lord Of The Rings?
0060589280|5.0|This is a really great book, after reading the Alchemist and following in love with Paulo Coelho's literature, i decided to go onto this next book. Luckily for me, his next book I picked up was also just as good as the Alchemist.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I love having easy access to the weather forecast on my tablet.  This app is great and gives me all the info I need.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|An amazing story with a beautiful ending. Chicano rock at it's finest!! This movie will touch your heart if you love music. Worth seeing it again!!
B00633W614|4.0|Suspenseful sequel to the first Clifton book.  Liked the suspenseful ending that makes you anxious for the final book to be<br />available.  Jeffrey Archer does a good job of making his characters seem real.
0061122416|5.0|This is a really great book and very inspirational, it allows you to focus on your dreams and move towards them. This is my favorite book and one of my favorites from Paulo Coelho.
B00846WWVM|5.0|My son loves playing this game.  He's 5 and is better at it than me!  If you like Angry Bird style games, than you'll probably like this one.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great movie, Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, and Rebel Wilson are all awesome together. Love the characters in this movie, is a must see for any girl's night out.
B000GCFBQU|5.0|This is as multi-layered a book as I've read in years.  It's a story about a minister and his young child, grieving the loss of their wife/mother.  It's about the minister's faith journey through struggles with his child and his congregation.  Written in omniscient voice, the reader  is immersed into the interior lives of at least four characters, all struggling with human foibles that most of us would recognize within ourselves. The characters are multiple and complex, including the town— a corporate character that will require its own redemption.  All of the characters are searching for meaning or redemption, or both.<br /><br />This is an intelligent book.  Strout weaves quotes from philosophy and theology beautifully into the story, through the minister's thoughts and excerpts of sermons to his congregation.  That said, it is not a religious book but one about a spiritual search.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I was skeptical at first but after watching it I have to say this was another great performance by Denzel Washington. Powerful in relation to ethical choices and the limits of people in how far they will go. Glad I watched it.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It's a light, it's interesting, but doesn't do much for me.  I don't really use it, but I didn't pay for it either.
B0082Z447U|3.0|I really liked it for the first half of the book because of the language.  But, then it became laborious and lost its appeal.  I did skim through many descriptions and long paragraphs.  The plot was good and so I finished it.  I took several twists and introduced new situations.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves the true English language
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Pure genius. The writers are so creative. I just can't get enough.<br />The only issue was I had to watch the first 3 episodes to be into it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series! The show is fast paced and character development and plot twists abound. Nice to see in the zombie genre!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Buy it! Rent it! Love it! This movie is a must have in your library! Daniel Craig is the MAN!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Love this actress - Romola - she is great in everything - and the lead actor, I remembered him from the Lonesome Dove series.  He is great also.  Very well produced.  Well written.  I watch a lot of period pieces, and this is top notch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never thought I would become a pinner. Pinterest is a great way for me to save information, recipes, tips, reminders, and more!  Thank you forthis service and for having it in a mobile application for my Kindle Fire!!!!!
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought this to find out what all the talk was about. It is a ridiculous story filled with sexual encounters and characters far beyond reality. Unfortunately, many young females are buying and reading this smut. It gives them a false perspective on love and sex. The only redeeming factor in my purchase is my ability to deter other poor unsuspecting females from reading this series. James is an embarrassment to my gender. Shame on you for capitalizing on young women in such an insidious way.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|Best movie i have ever seen. Grabs your heart and opens your eyes. Very graphic, but truthful.  Very humbling. .
B0098460O4|5.0|These kids have fantastic voices. Everyone should see the You Tube video of their first appearance on Britain's Got Talent. The reaction was very similar to that of Susan Boyle when she first appeared on that show. Once again, don't judge a book by its cover. Although I usually don't listen to classical music, I could listen to this all day.
B008M7JODC|4.0|i really enjoyed the plot of this show,very reminsent of the X-files.it is certainly full on fringe science. if your all out of tv shows to watch and have not checked this series out,give this one a watch.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition is the greatest game in the world!  if you want a action pack super cool game this is the game to get!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book and I would recommend it for all ages. I could not put it down! I think it would make a great movie.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|One of the most clever games I've played in the last 10 years. Even the levels that come across as frustrating are very gratifying when you final solve them. After playing through the game which takes hours to finish it is fun trying to complete the OCD achievements even though a few currently feel like they border on the realm of impossibility!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Would of gave it 5 if it let actually continue to a win gives draws way to easy but otherwise good fun and helps beginners learn but challenges even the best players
B0091V6TF4|5.0|I got this for my brother-in-law that is a HUGE Bond and music fan.  He loved it!!  Putting this collection together for the first time was a great idea and any Bond fan would love it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, I had a hard time putting a John Grisham novel down. I enjoy his plot and character development. His cliff hangars at the end of each chapter make it &#34;just one more chapter....&#34;.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a great read - kept me reading late at night to find out what was going to happen. It's an easy ready, good sci-fi with some unexpected events along the way.
B00BF11STU|3.0|Personally I was disappointed with this movie after all the hype and political overtones that the media had promoted. It was just okay. I sure am glad that I only paid $3.99 for it online rather than the big bucks it would have cost me to take my wife and myself to the movie theater. Seems to me only the topic made it an Academy Award nominee - certainly not the quality of a movie that I feel should have that high marker.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|I like adventure games.  It is a little slow trying to build levels for multipe players.  I would like it better if I could chose who is first to strike in battle.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Latest episodes in this continuing saga.  While Season 1 had the best writing of all, and Season 2 accurately depicted World War 1 era issues, this season is focused on intimate issues of marriage, class, and family economics.  Startling family members die off (not our Maggie Smith!) and new careers are sought by the former Chauffeur as well as middle sister Edith.  The Earl loses a fortune on bad stocks, but Matthew devises a way out.  Mary finally gets her wedding and tries valiantly to get pregnant.  Sybil leaves Ireland and wants to have her baby at Downton.  Falsely imprisoned Bates finally gets help to appeal his murder conviction, and new staff are hired downstairs.  Young kitchen maid Daisy, widowed during the war, thinks she might be ready to find love again since her supervisor, Mrs. Patmore, seems willing to add romance to her own busy life as Downton Abbey's Cook.  Matthew's widowed mother might have romantic options as well, while a new character, a wildly romantic 18 year old great niece of the Dowager Countess, makes her first appearance.  As in life, not all characters' adventures lead to happy endings.  Instead of eagerly desiring new episodes for a vividly realized production, this series ends on a note of sober reckoning.  How long must characters wait for equal opportunities?  How can we continue to care deeply about a series which kills off our most beloved characters?  We hope that after waiting a whole year for another season, the writing will improve its outlook for all characters -- instead of continuing to plunge us into grief and doom.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|This is the WHOLE series, and I highly recommend you buy it this way, rather than getting it one at a time. There are no other books to this particular family. I read Souless as a Manga first, which I thoroughly enjoyed. This series is a really great read if you are looking for action, adventure, a little bit of romance, a little bit of ridiculousness, and an older view on vampires and werewolves. Never before have they ever been exhibited as complete opposites before this series to me!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I installed it for my grandson and he really likes it. I even play it along with him and we both enjoy it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It requires skill and a keen eye but it is entertaning.  I won't rate products if I have to have a certain amount of words.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love the Vampire diaries. I know these are not a Blue Ray dvd's that's why quality it not that great but still love it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|What a fabulous movie! I laughed, I cried (more than once) ... nature can be brutal. I wouldn't hesitate to see it again. 5 stars.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|My wife and I have enjoyed this movie on multiple occasions.  There are multiple quips which many would call politically incorrect today but are humorous to those with a sense of humor.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I confess I did not care much for this show when it first came out. I have always been a die hard ST fan and I just couldn't get into it. Granted, at the time I was very busy so it was very easy for me not to give it much of a chance. A year ago I watched it for the first time beyond the first 3 or 4 episodes. I must say I enjoyed it and was sorry it didn't run as long as the other ST series. One thing I hated, at the time it first aired, was the intro song. All the other ST shows had full orchestrated music that was fitting to the grand nature of the concept and shows. Now, years later, I can appreciate it as a transitional phase. In the ST universe, &#34;we&#34; were emerging into the galaxy as explorers. If you think about it, people weren't so different in Enterprise as they are now. They had not fully evolved as they had in the other shows which were hundreds of years later. Now, I think this series shows a kind of segue from our current rather primitive state of being (wars, greed & power struggles we currently endure) to the next step of cowboy Kirk and beyond to the enlightened era of STNG and beyond. The characters are fun and seriously, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because, try as I might, I really had problems with this Angelina Jolie Vulcan. Wasn't crazy about the weapons guy either but the rest of the cast made for some interesting stories. I have to say I am a big fan/supporter of Scott Bakula and wish he could have been Captain for 2 more years.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Enjoy this game, keeps you on your toes. For a person my age (85) it is a good work out, mind and body.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|I'll be brief (you can read more in-depth reviews on the story elsewhere).<br /><br />Many period piece flicks try and recreate an era, such as the 60s, and fail miserably. These movies LOOK like they're TRYING to recreate the era. \\"Taking Woodstock\\" is the first movie that actually looks like the era it's trying to set up shop in.<br /><br />I feel like I'm watching my childhood late 60s / early 70s summers unfold before my eyes. If you've ever been disappointed by a period piece movie that fails to FEEL like the era it's trying to replicate, then watch this movie. It IS 1969.
B005D4Y4H8|5.0|These Glenn Gould DVD's are treasure trove of transcendent playing. He plays with a spiritual depth that is surpassed only by Yehudi Menuhin among players of the twentieth century. This set should be part of the foundation of any serious classical DVD collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a must have app to get! I read the other reviews and still was a little unsure but I downloaded the game my daughter loves it and she is 7 and I like it also. It is fast moving and gets addicting :)
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|His books are the best action packed that you can read. You cannot put the book down as you want to know what is next.
B00BC3IKWE|4.0|Early Alt Indie Punk influences with a modern sound. Well mixed great guitar work. I like it glad i downloaded the full release.
B00BGI076M|5.0|I love this new show this is Kevin Bacon @ his best. The story plot is amazing, this guy \\"Joe Caroll\\" gathers a group of young people and turns them in to these crazy, psyhcohotic killers!!! & makes them belive that he's innocent OK. And i love that you think that theres only.... lets say 3 follower's the crazy babysitter, two fake gay neighbor's involved but wait theres more! turns out theres a colony of like 100 or more creeps & crazy's wanting to b just like him. And just when you think you can trust anybody bamm!!!! You can't. Watch it your b hooked
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the second book and can't wait to find out what happens in the final installment!  A MUST read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it looks good and I like the girls.<br />It is hard. Tell me to be a little bit of the girls are in need of the honda accord floor and I think that the government has not only
B000PMLFRA|5.0|the sound quality has improved magnificently. and a great series of movies<br /><br />A New Hope: Awesome and revolutionary for its time.  The special effects still hold up well today and the story is great.  Every single one of the characters are likeable.  There is really nothing i can say about this movie that hasn't been said before. 3 best parts 1. The gun fight that han solo gets in leaving the mos eisley spaceport 2. The battle of yavin 3. The whole Cantina scene. this my second favorite movie of the original trilogy.<br /><br />Empire Strikes Back: Meet more awesome characters, special effects have are even better. Story is even better than \\"A New Hope\\".  You get the new mind blowing planet of Bespin which is such a beautiful city that you won't see anything like it in another film.  3 best parts 1. The lightsaber duel between luke and vader 2. when han solo opens the door in bespin and shoots at vader and vader blocks it 3. the battle of hoth. Best of the original trilogy<br /><br />Return Of The Jedi: Awesome movie again the best action sequences of the original trilogy.  You meet the emperor sadly you meet the ewoks who take little away from this great film. 3 best parts 1. Action scene outside of jabba's palace 2. Lightsaber duel between luke, vader, and the emperor 3. Speeder bike chase. least favorite of the original trilogy but great movie nonetheless.<br /><br />1. The Empire Strikes Back (5/5)<br />2. Attack Of The Clones (5/5)<br />3. Revenge Of The Sith (5/5)<br />4. A New Hope (5/5)<br />5. Return Of The Jedi (5/5)<br />6. The Phantom Menace (2/5) (it sucked)
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I enjoyed this film! Besides the fact that Matthew McConaughey is beautiful, he does a great job as a lawyer.  The movie has a good plot and stays interesting for the most part!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I switched over due to google reader supposedly going away this summer. I love Feedly. It is very easy to use.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was interesting and full of romance. I didn't want to take my eyes off of it! I know others will love it as much as I did.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Awesome; star wars on blu ray. All the movies have amazing quality and sound. Now I do a small review on the movies.<br /><br />The Phantom Menace: Terrible movie, so childish and dumb I liked it until I turned 10 or 11 years old. Lucas thought he could release this and get some good money off of it and not try to make a great movie like the original trilogy.  3 good things in this movie 1. The Character of Darth Maul 2. The Character of Qui Gon Jinn 3. The Final lightsaber duel. Defiantly the worst in the series.<br /><br />Attack Of The Clones: Gigantic improvement over the Phantom Menace. It brought back what made star wars fun again and reminds me of the perfect \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" You got the clones, Jango Fett, and the acting has drastically improved 3 best parts are. 1. The Lightsaber Duel 2. Jango Fett vs. Obi Wan 3. When the clones attack during the battle of geonosis.  My personal favorite of the prequels.<br /><br />Revenge Of The Sith: Awesome movie again.  Very dark movie defiantly the darkest in the series by far. Has the most action and is at its best.  So many lightsaber duels and yeah. 3 best parts 1. The Final lightsaber duel against obi wan and anakin 2. the order 66 order from palpatine 3. Mace Windu vs. Palpatine.<br /><br />1. The Empire Strikes Back (5/5)<br />2. Attack Of The Clones (5/5)<br />3. Revenge Of The Sith (5/5)<br />4. A New Hope (5/5)<br />5. Return Of The Jedi (5/5)<br />6. The Phantom Menace (2/5) (it sucked)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is an awesome calculator app. I use this everyday whether I'm at work or at home. I love this app!
B007SUW24W|4.0|I was introduced to Ed Sheeran through a free download of the song &#34;Small Bump.&#34; I really love this album. There is something catchy yet not so mainstream as to be obnoxious about his songs. I also like the acoustic feel to most of these songs, it feels very ... organic (for lack of a better term).
B0097C8XL0|4.0|This is the best game ever ans I just can't stop playing it I am playing this game every single day
B00650SSDU|3.0|I liked this movie because it didn't follow the typical romantic comedy recipe but there is still the happy ending.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Recommended this to all my friends. Loved this book.  Couldn't put it down!!! Can't wait to read the third book.
B001MM28JG|4.0|It's wonderful to have one of my favorite movies in the cloud.  It's just so easy!<br /><br />This movie is more than a spoof of the old Star Trek, but clearly pokes fun at it.  Has-been actors who played the roles of a starship crew are put into a position to actually have to man the pretend ship -- now real -- of the small screen.  It's great fun.<br /><br />Great cast.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show and all of the characters. The time period is so interesting and Maggie Smith is awesome!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is awesome! It's easy to use and many different features - notes, bookmarks, tons of different Bible versions, and networking. I love having my Bible with me wherever I go!! Definitely one of my favorites!!!!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Excellent Series.<br />My DVD could not skip to episode 2 from the main menu<br />There were a few recordings stops in the first disk.
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|First, let's start by admitting that season 2 has been a disappointing mess (I keep hoping Jimmy will be hit by a truck or at least fall through a trapdoor, never to be seen again). There's a reason Smash was moved to the purgatory of Saturday evenings and will likely be canceled. Which is a shame because season 1 rocks.<br /><br />The cast is amazing (Katharine McPhee, whose voice is incredible; superb Angelica Huston and Debra Messing, a very hot Jack Davenport, etc.) as are the songs (the Bollywood number alone is amazing and the 'Don't Forget Me' song has been stuck in my head for weeks). This show started so well, and had so much potential, it's a real shame they screwed it up. But no matter what, Season One is definitely worth watching.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|Fascinating account of the investigation by Chinese and British police into the murder of a young British girl in China in the period just prior to WWII when Japan was flexing its muscle, and foreign delegations were attempting to remain neutral.  Relates the decadence that existed within the  expatriate community of the time.
0060730552|5.0|Great read.  Brings up the darkest questions but that's one of the reasons people climb.  No flowery proses, just a book with true grit.
B005K17RU0|5.0|my husband loves having this to let us onward what we are facing on our one hourctrip to our grand-daughters
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great series! I wish I didn't have to write  so many words to describe why I like this series so much. It's good, watch it. If I continually pay for each episode I must be loving it.
1455508977|5.0|What a great book. Nicholas Sparks keeps you on the end of your seat wanting more and more. Great movie too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This well written tale deserved five + stars. The author crafted a well written tale that drew me into the end result of a world so very different; however, humanity has maintained those intrinsic qualities which make us humans. Each character has been crafted in such a way that he/she hasn't lost that sense of humanity. And im not talking about that over the top character but the warts and all human. The hereos represent the best of humanity in a way that others can identify with. The villains represent the worst kind of actions in a way that leaves you asking if you would, should or could make another decision if you were in their shoes.<br />The situations are never unbelievably fabulous or mundane.  and you are still impressed with the magnitude of what is required to maintain the vestiges of mankind, in a way that makes it clear &#34;this is the new reality and this is our everyday, we're living it&#34;.  I loved this omnibus and I immediately purchased the shift omnibus; even though, I hadn't intended to do so at this time. But I just can't wait to see how this all came to be. Thanks a ton Hugh howey.
B004WY2K12|5.0|I have cooked through most the recipes in this book.  I have converted them to gluten free recipes and found them to be delicious.  My oldest daughter loves the Cookies and Cream Cheesecake recipe on page 104 (we used Ktoos cookies by Kinnikinnik as our gluten free cookie).  I love, and use quite often, the Brown Sugar Pound Cakes on page 60 (I used Jules Gluten Free All Purpose Flour as a 1:1 sub).<br /><br />This book offers a lot of variety, good staple recipes for icings and cupackes and is a good addition to a cupcake kitchen.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|This is a fixed review. in my previous review I said that the concert dvd is a 4:3 ratio, therefore it's a square screen with black bars on both sides. but now I'm watching it on my dvd player instead of my pc, and it's a wide screen picture (dont know why, maybe the windows media player shrinks it??). great concert, a must have for any Maiden fan. the documentary dvd is 40 min, short but interesting, \\"12 wasted years\\" is a classic documentary from 87', promo videos were already released on the visions of the beast dvd.
0525422943|4.0|I started the first of this series and literally could not put the book down.  This is the continuation, and I can say I didn't expect the ending.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|Films like this one need to be made more often in our time now.  The meaning and depth is worth everyone's time.
B004BSFC46|1.0|These look so cute.  When I was pregnant I bought them thinking that my son would love them.  Frankly he could not have cared less.  When he was not able to move he never noticed them.  And now that he can move he doesn't care about them.  These quickly became an impulse buy I should have avoided.  Don't get me wrong.  Super cute idea, super cute product, fun to put on your baby for you - but the baby does not need these.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This was a good book.  It helped to see where your partner is coming from, and gave helpful suggestions on how to &#34;speak each other's love language&#34;. It also helped me to understand why things seem so great in the beginning of a marriage, but changes over the course of a marriage.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The story lines are more complex and the characters are getting fleshed out, so we can feel more deeply about them.
1616550414|5.0|I've been a fan of the series since it came out. There's a lot of really cool information in the book, also a ton of really neat concept art.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I have 2 horses, Beauty and Perfection. I am not sure what my stable name is.
B008GWSS6W|5.0|Best mixture of western gendr and comedy. Not his greatest but showed all sides of his acting ability in one movie.
B0086700CM|1.0|I tried this game by mistake, and it seems absolutely pointless.  I like a game with something more than just running. It is my fault for not reading more before I tried it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very good acting from not A list actors. A courtroom drama combined with political intrigue plus a good dose of sexual tension makes for real characters coming to life on my screen.<br /><br />Plus, I definitely appreciate how evenly the audio is in comparison to most drama's sound tracks. I don't find myself continually having to adjust the volume as I do in so many movies these days. Just when the volume is right for the voices - WHAM - BAM - way too much noise is working hard to 'entertain' me.<br /><br />One of the better drama series I have seen to date.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|If you want an easy watch, with an overall great story line this is a great show to watch.<br /><br />This could be considered Television lite, there isnt a whole lot of brain power involved in keeping up with the main story line.  While at the same time the science introduced in each episode keeps you involved and interested.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Lots of gore but somehow it is funny instead of gross. Very addictive. Each week you wonder what cast member will be zombie dinner. Horror, drama, comedy and sci fi fans will enjoy this series. Never been anything like it before all in one series. This is the first series that I can't wait for next week.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I have read all of George RR Martin's Fire and Ice Books. Great  stories.  I have seen all episodes thru Season 2. The HBO series is true to the books but I would rate it higher if 1) some of the smut were toned down (it's porn with a great story),  3) more was done to help you to transition from one map location to another and 3) if more were done to explain the relationship between the characters as in the book. It is very difficult for people who haven't read the books to understand what is going on.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love it and have now watched all the episodes for the past three years.<br />The only problem was that I should have paced myself and not watched back to back episodes, just too easy.
0525478817|5.0|I am on a never-ending quest to find good books for my middle-schooler to read. Reading is my passion, and it has proven more difficult than I ever imagined to engage my 12 year old in reading.  Since he is required to read five books per grading period, I am constantly on the lookout for something to engage him.<br /><br />Although I bought this book for my child, I ended up reading it prior to passing it along.  This was an incredibly thought-provoking book which although the subject matter on the surface is grim (children dying of cancer is tragic, no matter how you look at it), it ended up being a life-affirming book.  I found myself marking passage after passage as my \\"a-ha moments\\".  Somehow I wanted my children to understand what I had found compelling about this book when it is their turn to read it.<br /><br />The most overwhelming message I took from this book is that we all matter, and we're all important.  Most of us would like to be remembered for some kind of huge, front-page contribution to society, but this book reminds us that every single one of us touches others lives in ways we cannot even imagine.  Just by living, we're creating a legacy for ourselves, and it is our jobs to live well, no matter what the situation.<br /><br />My oldest picked this up last night and said \\"ugh - a love story - no way\\".  I suggested that it's much more than a love story and that he read fifty pages of it; if he is not interested, forget about it.  My hunch is that he will be compelled to read this through to the end.  I'm looking forward to having some meaningful and substantive discussions with him when he's finished.  Then, it'll be on our shelf until my youngest is old enough to wade into it.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Great quality streaming.. This is one of my favorite shows. Neil Patrick Harris is great!! I wish I was on this show. It awesome!!!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This is one of the iconic American novels of the twentieth century.  Vonnegut's personal experience<br />in the bombing of Dresden in World War II combined with his black humor all wrapped up in a science<br />fiction tableau is an American classic.  This novel and &#34;Catch 22&#34; capture the lunacy of war as no others.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed the plot and his spiritual journey. The insights into man and animals kept my interest. I wonder how the movie will compare.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Laugh out loud in places, and still good with the science! Well done, Mr. Weir. Well done! Highly recommended read.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Awesome graphics and tons of extras. The update let in some much needed upgrades. You will enjoy the weapons selection. It can be little pricey if your not careful.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Addictive at best.  We watched all seasons and can't wait until the new season comes out.  Everything about it is wonderful.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Even if you're not a zombie fan, this movie is worth watching. It's funny without being over the top ridiculous...even though Zombies and Bill Murray are involved.
B0067Q04AM|3.0|I got this cd after hearing Robert Glasper interview on NPR. I thought, man, this guy's criticism of popular music is spot on -- and he's not just complaining about it, he's doing something about it.  He's coming up with refreshing, experimental, and new.  I loved his smooth jazz piano sound, but after getting the cd felt that it was a lot more mellow than I was expecting.  The talent is there but I think it would be better if it were more energetic and upbeat.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i love this game... i was ul all night playing it..... the only problem is i cant close it.... the second i close it and go do something else i lose everything and have to start all over again. please fix this! other wise this is probably my favorite thing on my kindle i never stop playing
B003GJSUPY|5.0|I saw J Geils Band twice during the time period that this album was made, and it captures them perfectly.  Some may prefer the &#34;Full House&#34; live record - excellent in its own right - but this one ranks right up there.
B007SGM084|3.0|This book is very good! Intense, thrilling but... A person really has to be careful reading something like this. It can be very corrupting to your mind! Young kids have access to this and others like this .... And that is appalling to me! This world ... With the media... Music... Books... Movies... Takes innocence from children at a very young age!
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it will surprise people after seeing it.  I think Gerard Butler is very good in this part.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, because it showed that no matter what you currently believe or standards you live by, can and will be challenged at any time.  The question is what will you do?  Will you stay the same or will you change?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Powerful story lines supporting powerful characters. American TV producers miss the boat with the reality TV junk. This is true entertainment. The story draws you in and the characters draw you too them, all the characters.  The cook and the Lord both have appeal.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The movie was exceptional,.i was blown away by the cinematography<br />And the story had me thinking all week. I could figure out whether or his story was true<br />The movie is very engaging also an captivates your mind , making it<br />Feel short
B005VSRFEA|5.0|She's got a very open-minded view of sustainability and operational strategies.  It's sort of a lofty, lighthearted take on business.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a great game at first but eventually gets really boring. This used to be my favorite game. Make sure you don't buy anything on this otherwise you will regret it. It is good that it is free.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Very little Wayne, more Fonda, but this is about the story.  The woman who loves two men, two very different men.  This is not a love story or a shoot em up western (although there is some of that).  It is really a story about a story, an attempt to explain how life events events and perceptions can create a story on there own.  Events run away with life and the real facts fly around reality never quite touching what is real.  All in all this story is offering proof that history is never quite the unvarnished truth. What is not to love about that?
B008D30K7E|4.0|Just a joy<br />low key humour and a wonderfully wry analogy of life,<br />Each character finely and affectionately drawn, making for a enjoyable read.
075669812X|5.0|My son is crazy for these books that include the special Lego figures in them.  The price is very reasonable too.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The disk is perfect, the case is perfect, the outer case was perfect but had a sticker that came off without leaving residue. The movie itself is a breathtaking journey if you have or have not read the book. A great use of three hours. This movie is too engaging to just be background noise though.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Terrific film. A little long but I was riveted throughout.<br /><br />Does it show torture? Yes, it does and that is not comfortable. And there are other things that do not put America in the best light. I admired that.<br /><br />I was not a fan of Bigelow's The Hurt Locker, which did win Best Picture, but I am a fan of this, which lost out to the vastly inferior Argo.<br /><br />It's not easy to watch. There are a ton of convoluted names tossed about (thank God for subtitles) and there is some violence that is very hard to watch. But as a procedural, this works as well as any I've ever seen. It is even better than Zodiac.<br /><br />Complaints? I really wanted to hear Bigelow do a commentary on the film, though. And a more thorough 'making of' documentary. Minor complaints, though.
B00746TURW|5.0|I may have been so engaged with the subject of abandonment and survival because of personal circumstances.<br />The prose was cinematic and stark, marvellous.<br />it is without sentiment.<br />In book club it was a particularly lively discussion as it had some many different resonances,<br />The most pertinent point I can make is that I will re read and have no doubt will find more intriguing aspects.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game on kindle fire! The pc version is even better! I've been addicted since version 1.3 back in september! And if you are complaining about the price think of it this way: people pay $50 for call of duty games and they never complain about the price. Pc minecraft is only about $30 yet people still complain and play cracked minecraft. So stop complaining and spare a dime, will ya?
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The movie is wonderful, a must for any LOTR fan. Even those who don't like fantasy couldn't shun this movie, there are enough songs in it for it to be classified as a musical. The protective outer case is of great interest, it has a holographic sheen to it that is not described, really a nice thing to look at.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I liked this movie more then I was expecting, some scary twists. I recommend checking this on out if you like scary movies.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|While the storyline is pretty fun, the game itself is way too much fun. It's just challenging enough to keep you playing, yet still yields the difficulty people look for in a match-3+ game. All I know, is that in the first two days of playing, I stayed up far past my bedtime trying to get all 3 stars on one section. I was happily sleep-deprived the next day.<br /><br />I got this during the 'Free App of the Day' deal, but I would pay the money for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this one. It will take a while for me to do it because I just got It yesterday.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I am almost 50 years old and really do not like history,but I have always found Lincoln very interesting. This movie told me a lot about Lincoln that I did not know.The stress that this man had to deal with and he delt with in a way that they should have wrote text books from him on how to handle the ultimate amount of stress and was a true gentelman in every aspect of his life.A very good movie !! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I've really enjoyed listening to this album.  The sound and vocals are very unique and engaging.  My kids like it also.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book. Jack reacher is amazing! Cannot wait to read the next one!! The suspense is killing me, downloading it now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Pretty cool game, but when I tried to upgrade it from Rio to Rome it wouldn't let me so I had to delete the game n download it back so I lost all my progress.  But overall it's a pretty sweet game.
B009G78EE2|5.0|For $5.99 on Amazon, you get 18 solid songs? I don't love Hip Hop but I felt this is a beautiful album. Macklemore delivers such emotion and conviction that reminds me of Eminimen but minus the hate and anger. What Mackelmore delivers is passion from his experiences but also touched upon a topic most rappers stay away from. Macklemore says F*** it, this is what I believe in despite the repercussion of possibly hurting his career. He doesnt rap about about bling and material things and is message is one of hope, learning, and being a better person.<br /><br />Beyond the lyrics, the beats that Ryan Lewis produces is refreshing. \\"BomBom\\" although instrumental, is so tranquil and such a great way to infuse something different into hip hop. I like the transfusion of electronic, alternative, ambient sounds into the tracks. This should be what hip hop is about. Album is so damn catchy. Amazing and I feel like paying $5.99 for this album is not enough. I'm ripping off Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I was very, very anxious to see &#34;Lincoln&#34; in the theatres but was unfortunately unable to. Once it became available for home consumption I watched it twice on the same day. I have always been a huge fan of Stephen; I'd love to meet him someday. His work has never dissapointed me, and this, the 11th of his films that I have seen (Jaws, E.T., all four Indys, Close Encounters, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan are the others) is just flat-out beautiful and left me crying a bit at the end.<br />  Daniel Day-Lewis is wonderful--and very human--as our 16th President. He gives us a Lincoln who's got all the homespun stories and is kind and loving on the one hand, but on the other, can turn on the political charm when he needs it to do the proverbial arm-twisting necessary to secure key votes that will help the 13th Amendment get the required 2/3 majority to finally pass the House. And Day-Lewis' Abe must still be a husband and father in a family not devoid of issues--particularly eldest son Robert's desire to join the army--which neither his father or mother Mary (Sally Field) wants. Field's First Lady is still dealing with the loss of one son (Willie) to a well-documented illness and is still on edge. Eventually, Field and Day-Lewis go at it in a good-old domestic nose-to-nose. Sally Field's always been great. She put herself through quite a bit to perform this difficult character, but she damn-well did it--and she deserves all the accolades she's already received for the job she did.<br />  And then there's the Cabinet--led by Robert Straithorn's icy and ascerbic Secretary of State Seward. Straithorn's perfect for this role. He plays these types as well as anyone. And eventually, Day-Lewis' Abe eventually is driven to go ballistic by his own closest advisors as he must deal with not only the urgency he feels for getting the Amendment passed, but the timing of a Confederate peace offer that Seward's not too pleased about and is quick to lethis President know about it. And yet, Straithorn also shows great respect and restraint when, in the Lincoln death scene, he quickly and quietly delivers the most famous thing Seward ever said: &#34;Now he belongs to the Ages.&#34; It sounded almost as if Straithorn must have felt it was something he didn't really feel he deserved the right to say--even as an actor.<br />  I wish Hal Holbrook had had a little more to do, but he's a treasure in any case.<br />  But there are two things that truly steal this film for me on top of everything else. How about Tommy Lee Jones? His Thaddeus Stevens absolutely kicks ass--not only the character's personality, but the way Jones just nails it. And there's a little surprise Jones provides for us once the Amendment passes.<br />  And then, there are the locations. The Richmond-Petersburg area is like a second home to me. I went to VCU, worked for four years for the Commonwealth as a young messenger/delivery man while in school, began my media career there and still have many dear friends there. The scenes shot in and around Capitol Square really hit home, because I could recognize many things close-up that, of course, had to be shot tight to begin with. The scene shot near Washington's statue in the rotunda of Jefferson's Capitol had me saying &#34;Boy, if I had a nickle for every time I walked through that hallway when I was making a delivery!&#34; I still visit Richmond at least once a year to see my old friends. It's always been a beautiful city and I'll always love it. It served Spielberg well.<br />  My only question...is the computer animation that turns Jefferson's Capitol into a newly-reconstructed (completed in time for 1865) U.S. Capitol completely accurate? Was the top of the Capitol dome ACTUALLY blue in the beginning and then painted white later on? Didn't know that. Oh well, that's a little thing.<br />  And with that little throw-away line said, this film, on the whole, is another Spielberg masterpiece.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is probably one of the funnest games ever! I play it with my cuz Fletcher all the time. Get it!!!!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Not as good as I expected from the makers of cut the rope but still very very honorably good :)
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Uhhhh it's Tron? what more do you need? Seriously, why haven't you bought it yet? Stop reading this review and just buy the damn movie!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I'm a real Grisham fan but this effort was not up to his high quality.  Looking forward to his next book.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My daughter likes to play the angry bird games on my Kindle.  She says this one is hard but fun!  She would recommend it to any child that likes to play angry birds.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is totally awesome I would play it every day I love this game. Love it.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Glad I found this series. Thoughtful and engaging.<br />Viewing it on Prime has been a joy. Fast loading and excellent picture quality.
B00BESIKWM|4.0|I chose this rating because I liked the movie. I can't remember anything that I didn't like about the movie Yes I would refer it to a fellow movie lover.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was my first reading on my Kindle and I read the first of the trilogy because my daughter loaned it to me.  I wasn't excited until I got into it and the I wanted the second book as soon as I finished the first.  I loved the ending of the third book, made me feel that truth, justice and goodness prevailed.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book had me on edge. Never did I think that reading a book could actually give me chills. I felt as though I was in the courtroom,as though I was actually going through all the ups and down of the book. This book was unbelievable.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I am not reviewing this...I just did this to submit the rating system on here.  I don't think this is ever necessary!
0380730405|5.0|An old type story so well written that it stayed in my mind when I wasn't reading it.  I got the video after reading the story... of course, it wasn't as good, although enjoyable....
B00BJ64FU0|4.0|I have read many of the Holmes short-stories and novels, some on my Kindle, and some in paper-form. This edition is unusually clear and well presented. It is illustrated, though sparingly.<br /><br />A good value for the price.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I am not reviewing this...I just did this to submit the rating system on here.  I don't think this is ever necessary!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it! My sister showed me this game while she is visiting on Spring Break. :) Thank you, take care.
B0020PJJHS|2.0|I don't really like Pierce Brosnan as 007.  The script isn't very clever.  Wonderful stunts as usual.  Nothing memorable.  Nothing horrible.
B008J34466|5.0|I am not reviewing this...I just did this to submit the rating system on here.  I don't think this is ever necessary!
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|I thought this movie was a really cute and enjoyable movie.  I enjoy movies that are based on true events or mirror the actual lives of true people, so this was fun for me to watch.  I liked it!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|The quality of the Bluray disks is excellent. I've read other reviews which make the accusation that these are pirated disks--I sure can't tell any diminished quality of the video, audio, or the disks and packaging. Audio and video quality are first rate. Yes, they are made in the UK, but mine all state that they are \\"Distributed by Warner Home Video, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment UK Ltd.\\"  For me, there were no skips, jumpy frames, drop-outs, or any technical problems.<br /><br />Every disk has some extras: behind the scenes, bloopers, cast interviews, etc, and they are all well done. The video is full 1080p, with dts or Dolby audio. Since the disks are not restricted to a particular region, so they will play on any Bluray player sold in any part of the world.<br /><br />Overall then, this collection of 5 seasons of one of the best modern sitcoms was a great value, and great quality.
B007V508CC|5.0|I am not reviewing this...I just did this to submit the rating system on here.  I don't think this is ever necessary!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I used to LOVE temple run, but now I LOVE temple run 2.Even though I love it sometimes I cannot get onto the app.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|Not sure what all the hype was for this movie and definitely not oscar worthy.  The sound was horrible.  I had to turn on the sub-titles so I could understand what they were saying.  The film also needs to be edited because 2 1/2 hours is way too long for this story.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I am not reviewing this...I just did this to submit the rating system on here.  I don't think this is ever necessary!
B0009MAP90|5.0|Bob's first - a classic. The only album he's done that's mainly covers. It shows his folk and blues roots.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Was intrigued by the story but the movie is somewhat bland. I'm a Denzel fan and he as usual does a good job. Only two stars...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Oh my gosh I have become literary addicted to this game. I love this game because the concept is funny. You don't have to remember where the controls because you use your fingers. And it's freeeeee! Buy this game.
B000002TP7|5.0|Had to replace my older CD- had too much use and too many scratches.  Sounds awesome in my new car stereo. Perfect!
B0081336FO|5.0|I've been repeatedly tired at work from being unable to turn off this show.  If only the kids would go to bed earlier...
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game except all my friends never draw back.Probably because I am so bad at drawing it scares them away. :) JK Get this app it's free!
B000002HD5|5.0|Just what I was looking for - added to my Whigs collection and now it's close to being complete.  Great!
B002B0FLOM|3.0|This is no Harvest.  Or Harvest Moon.  But it is a (mostly) acoustic Neil Young album.  If that kind of things works for you, you may likes this.  If not ...
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Beautifully crafted and balanced… great songs, sequenced nicely, sung in harmonies so tight - by three artists whose voices go so well together - it’s almost frightening. There are wonderful little surprises that make you listen to the songs again and again, each time to hear something new - some simple, gorgeous detail in an arrangement or to once again appreciate how well the lyrics are crafted. These folks have talent and imagination. Some songs are happy, others sad, some of warning, some of hope. A thin thread loops through the album of whether we do well in life to learn to appreciate the “driving” or have to learn about “arriving.” How the three struck such a good balance between their voices - on each song and the song sequence - is truly a feat… one that hints at the respect they have for each other and for wanting to succeed together. Clearly, each is a strong musician on their own, but there is a wonderful quality about their work together that is equally worthy of attention. It’s been interesting to watch these three musicians, artists truly, take a leap of faith and create this band together. More than interesting…inspiring, really.
B000002GF8|3.0|The cd is clear however it is extremely scratched.  It is in the worst condition of any cd I own in fact. Disappointing
B0029OVFM2|4.0|This is really a very decent effort from the Fleetwood Mac gang but -- for whatever reason -- it doesn't seem to be much in vogue.  Give it a whirl.  You may like it.  Or not.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this story, great writing!!  All 3 books are great reading material!!  A must read.  Once you start you cannot stop.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game. Like the story lines and how the game works. Mysteries are always a good way to spend the evening.
B00138H1MS|5.0|A great compilation.  It shows all phases of Elvis' career.  Kentucky Rain is a special highlight in its unedited  form.  Not to be missed!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show. It has something for everyone. I love the character development and interaction. I don't know much about this time period let alone what is like in England then but it sure is a good setting.<br /><br />Looking forward to Season 3 although I've seen parts of 1 or 2 of those episodes sporadically on our PBS station.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This is an amazingly simple well executed game. The controls are as good or better than the most expensive games on the market. The action is relentless. Great job!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn masterfully takes the reader on a journey that keeps you guessing at every turn.  I don't want to give anything away but this book has more twists and turns than a roller coaster.  When you finish it you will want to talk to anyone you know who has read it in order to get their take on it.  Well done!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I struggle falling asleep because my mind will not shut off. The selections and the ability to create my own composition of music allows me to calm down. Works better than many of the sleep aids on the market.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I gave this a five star rateing because of the action and story line.<br />There is nothing that  I dislike about the movie
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Although I tend to enjoy some more extras, Peter Jackson's LotR extended editions have wonderful extras (as I am sure The Hobbit's films will have, which I'm sure will have extended releases after all 3 are completed.) But what is included was enjoyable enough to make the purchase worth it!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great game. I wish it wasn't as addicting as it is though because I have more important things to do.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Gave it a five star rateing because of the action.<br />There is nothing that I dislike about the movie<br />I recommend this movie to others.
B008JFUNPK|1.0|The Croods, as stated by many, is similar to Ice Age. That is an understatement. Dreamworks pretty much took Dawn of the Dinosaurs and Continental Drift, gave it a caveman theme instead of an icecap, and called it done. The characters are nothing original. The daughter is just another girl looking to change her fate (against her father's will), the father is the overprotective type, and Guy is just another adventurer. Talk about typical. I guess I could explain more, but you've already seen most of the plot in Ice Age and other movies. I will say this, a lot of the jokes were stupid and repeated. The father smiles when the grandmother mentions how she might die (expressing his hatred of her), and he does this throughout the movie. It is incredibly wrong, and when he does this for like the 5th time it gets really old. He even says it directly to her face. The baby is basically is a pet. Seriously, not like a pet... an actual pet. She growls, barks, shreds stuff, and pretty much was the opposite of funny. The visuals were average. Save your $20 bucks and go see another high budget like Despicable Me 2 (which is going to be awesome!).
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Easy to use and I especially like being able to speak a work I'm looking up.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a dictionary.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Super movie so I gave it a five star rateing.<br />Nothing to dislike about the movie<br />I would recommend this to others
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Open your mind and let this world engulf you. Pay attention though as the details all end up having meaning. Special effects are just stunning.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well worth reading - if this guy doesn't work for NASA I'll be astonished. Spot on with the science and the fine detail, very cleverly done.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|It's a modern feel good comedy. it's funny, entertaining and Harrison Ford plays a different role from the ones I'm used to seeing him in.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of my all-time favorites!  I refused to watch because I thought a show about zombies would be silly like all that I had seen in past.  So glad I was scrolling through the channels and saw it was on.  I watched 1/2 an episode and was hooked.  Went back and watched the first two seasons within a week to catch up to Season 3.<br />The zombie become a minor part of the show.  I am interested in the plot and the characters.  I tell everyone to watch.  Can't wait for the season finale and then for Season 4.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|A captivating second instalment in the Century trilogy. Will have to continue exploring Follett's back catalogue while I wait for the final book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you like period pieces from the early 20th Century, if you are an Anglophile, if you like intricate costumes and setttings, you will love this show.  I have to say Season 3--the following season-- was a bit disappointing but I have hopes that next year's will redeem the show for me and everyone I know who watches it.
1595828753|5.0|My nine year old girl loves these books! She can read them for hours, really gets into the story, & the characters
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I admin alot of pages, and with this app I can read my messages, look at notifications, etc. The only problem I have found is that it had a 'network error' so I had to reinstall it. But other than that, I love it and it works great! I've been waiting for this app for awhile, and it was worth the wait. Definitely get This if your an admin thats always on. :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This performs all of the operations of a basic calculator. It's not a substitute for Mathematica or a sophisticated analytical program, but it works great on my Kindle which does not include a calculator by default.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it. pretty challenging at times and makes the time fly by. only drawback to game is the constant down time when you run out of energy and have no diamonds left.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|It was so good. I loved how they jumped from time to time. I couldn't put the book down. Another best book I've read !!!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I fell in love with the movie during the trailers that's how cool it is.<br />The graphics and realism of this movie are beyond awe inspiring. Dreamworks definitely reaches higher levels with each movie that they release and this one is a prime example.<br /><br />I would say that you'd have to have a really stiff mind to not feel like a kid again while watching this fantastic story unfold. Feel the real emotions during the ups and downs. Cheer when the guardians win a battle. Cry when their hearts are crushed. I dare you not be moved by this story while watching it. And I recommend getting the blu ray and DVD pack so that you can watch it with either system. I watched the blu ray on an HD TV and had my mind blown again it is so beautiful.<br /><br />The little eggs that come with the limited edition are so simple that they are cute, even for adults. I don't have little kids but, I'm sure they would enjoy them just as much or more as I do.<br /><br />You haven't put this in your cart already? You haven't bought it yet? Well get a move on!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best of the series I have read yet! Hope the next one can live up to the expectation this one has set.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Very historic and beautifully done.  The acting is superb, the costumes are beautiful.  I am only sorry it only went for four seasons.
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|This movie had a typical Rocky type flavor to it but was extremely watchable and I enjoy the gender of film.
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|I wrote my review before I understood the long term effects of this travesty. Yes, I lost 15  lbs.  But then, I found that I could not stand the idea of fasting anymore. What happened is that I just could not do it. OK, fine, at least I lost weight. No, what happened was such severe cravings that I gained it all back. I tried again, but the DIET Didn't WORK. I ended up losing and gaining 15 lbs. 2 X!  I can't recommend this process to anyone.Do not try this. It messed up my life, and I am further down the fat toilet.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|You have to try again and again to improve your skill as well as earning coins, patience and technique are both needed to play well.<br />But really a great fun to play.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I have tried everything I can think of to try to understand what I am supposed to have to do to use Adobe Reader.  I have been unsuccessful.  All i want to do now is delete it.  I can't find the button for that or it would be gone.  i downloaded it on my kindle per instructions so I could watch live streams of the golf matches.  no matter what I do I still get the notice &#34; you must have adobe to stream&#34;.  I have it.  I'm done
B0053O89IS|5.0|I loved all the new episodes.  I watched every episode and I will continue to buy each season that becomes available.  The case is broken
B006LSZECO|3.0|Just not my kind of book.  Did not like the ending.There must be lots of normal people out there with interesting stories.
B000050HTO|5.0|This is probably the best compilation of Bob's  numerous albums and hit singles from all the years. An essential addition to any collection when you just want to get &#34;Dylanized&#34;. The price is terrific too.....
B00992CF6W|4.0|Very creative game making buildings. My daughter loves this game, and plays it all the time. Definitely worth the purchase!
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|cant' find where it is downloaded on my tablet. says i bought it, but it is not anywhere i can find it.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The zoom is essentially non existent.  Hidden. objects. in the dark.  Could have been a great game if it were not for this.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like it. Get to do it with my husband.<br />I advice people to review the video before your 1st workout and all get the techniques down.<br />Be nice to your knees work up to it as your knees get stronger.<br />Also continue with your cool down static stretch for a little longer after the video is complete.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show is intriguing, i love the characters added this season, and look forward to continuing the series next season
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Fun game for ALL AGES. Another proze gift for a raffle. I heard rave reviews so went out an bought it for myself
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great cast with wonderful interactions and amazing double roles, fascinating plots, and amazing special effects!  Great show for sci fi lovers!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|very enjoyable game even my 5 year old son likes it. relaxing music and gentle chime when you earn a pearl. I like that I can turn the music off as well. gets increasingly more challenging keeping interest up. I recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games that are not too stressful (no timers or buzzers) game
1556438850|5.0|This book has so much information to illuminate your understanding of teaching. It is clear and practical and easy to take small bits and incorporate into your teaching style and make authentic for your class.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is totally awesome the part where you can collect Easter eggs is cool but very hard I just got that update and I already got 4 eggs. Yes I was being sarcastic I have only 4 eggs and I'm trying to get more. Man this game is so fun soon I have to go to the dentist and I'm not happy about it because I'm not allowed to bring my kindle fire HD with me so I can play subway surfers
B0015346OM|5.0|Looking for an amazing war story, this is it. Its a little slow for the first 50 pages but then it gets really good and will keep you reading.
B00063F8B2|5.0|We bought this audio CD to add to our Christmas entertainment collection.  The grand kids love all the songs and have tried to recreate parts of the Polar Express movie.  The written lyrics can be easily found with searches.  It is especially fun at Christmas time but is enjoyed at other times too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good book. It is a real tragedy that Chris has passed.
B00447G29S|5.0|This Combo version checks your hardware for 3D capability, alerts you if it does not find 3D availability and then plays the movie in conventional Blu-ray.  We bought this video to add to our Christmas entertainment collection.  It is a great way to followed up the reading of the Polar Express books with the grandkids (great messages about caring and thinking of others needs and using one's imagination).
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|That pretty much sums it up; sub-par for Disney and Pixar.  Insufficient tension, no real connection with the heroine or her struggles, too fanciful and scattered with the witch.
0395389496|5.0|We bought this book to add to our Christmas entertainment collection as a companion for the Trip To The North Pole.  It is a great way to encourage the grandkids to read and is also just wonderful, magic fun when followed up with the video (great messages about caring and thinking of others needs and using one's imagination).
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I didn't like this movie the first time a saw it, but the second and beyond have all left me rolling in laughter.
1599290634|5.0|This book was recommended to me by one of my teachers. It is a great way of seeing the current work for many great artists, and what is trending in the industry. For those of us who have children around, this book is not for them. In the back of the book there is a list of all artists presented and their websites. I highly recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grisham's best books with a great ending.  I've read most of his and over the years have often been disappointed by the ending.  This one was excellent.
B00AESN8XY|2.0|This is a very interesting strategy game.  I enjoyed selecting the traits of my disease, but the choices were very limited unless you pay about ten dollars. You can unlock the features if you win the game at the intermediate level.  Strangely, just as I was on the verge of doing this the game locked up and shut down my Kindle without saving my game.  .
B00BHMF578|4.0|The film lived up to the hype and had my attention from start to finish. Very dramatic and not too many dull scenes. Would definitely recommend watching.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|This is the same song as used in Combat Rescue a cable show about PJs picking up wounded soldiers. Very cool song.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I would recommend this book if you are interested in intrigue, suspense, treachery, and back stabbing as well as romance.
1878424319|5.0|This book has changed my life.  I know it's been out for quite awhile but I just read it about a month ago.  It makes so much sense.  Simple, yet profound.  The second agreement put my life into perspective.  Take Nothing Personal.  Deep down I think I knew this but to have it spelled out and explained in such easy to read prose, it resonated with me like a bolt of lightening.  I have been telling everyone about this book.  Read it.  Period.  All four agreements are spot on in living an authentic life.  I adore this author.  I have watched a number of interviews with him on You Tube since reading this.  What a gentle, loving soul.  If only the world would embrace these concepts.  So elementary yet lacking in today's society.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The story starts slow. Thought process from the author jumps all over the place. Could not finish wish is not my style. I was not intrigued at all.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|I actually did not like this program. My new kindle certainly didn't like it. I liked the full page layout, looked just like it would if I were on my full sized computer, but it made my brand new kindle freeze, and would not allow me to go back to my original page if I tapped on something to open a certain section. Too bad. Really liked the regular computer look.
0670026638|4.0|A novelist in BC, Canada finds a diary written by a sixteen year old girls, Nao, who lives in Japan.  Young Nao is bullied at school, has a suicidal dad and a distant mother.  The story could easily have veered toward soap opera ( or worse, an after school special).  Instead Ozeki decides to go deeper, connecting the torment of Nao's life to the government sanctioned bullying young student conscripts received to toughen them up to fly planes into US warships during the last months of WWII.  Is there hope for humans with this kind of senseless violence flowing through their blood streams?  What's the antidote to cruelty?<br /><br />Enter Nao's great grandmother (and the conscript's mother), Jiko. She's a Buddhist nun living in a  monastery by the sea.  I won't deprive you the pleasure of reading how the woman's kindness and strength of character transforms her great granddaughter.<br /><br />The novel flits back and forth between the diary and the novelist.  The goings on in BC can't compare to what's happening in Japan; perhaps they're meant to be a time for deep breaths.  And once or twice the Jiko character just seemed a bit too wise (as baptists put it, So heavenly bound they're no earthly good).  The author might exceed the MDR of whoo whoo but maybe there's more whoo whoo in life than we realize.  All in all a delightful novel.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Watched this movie with my 4 year old grandson.  My other 3 year old grandson watched with his Dad.  Both kids & adults really enjoyed.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|This appears to be the finally in the Kurt Wallander series. If you have read the others this is a must read. Hopefully Mankell continues with the series with his daughter Linda.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|Picture quality was great. Ease of use if the Amazon Instant was super easy. Movie was perfect for the whole family.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is a great book, and a great story.  The protagonist is well cast at both stages of his life, and the story -- not a fast-paced one -- proceeds at an appropriate clip, without boring the viewer.  But perhaps most important is the stunning cinematography that Ang Lee is so known for.  The story of Pi will stay with you, and the ending is wonderful, but what might be most memorable is the brilliance and unbelievable beauty of every shot.  In that regard, this is basically Mother Nature's response to Avatar -- and she wins.
B009BJAZBA|2.0|Upstairs Downstairs Season 1 Review was disappointment but then i may have been comparing it too much to Downton Abbey
B008XX6J4C|5.0|maybe not for everyone..but the music inspired me and was easy on the ears. I look forward to their next c.d. I WOULD recommend this to anyone that prefers easy-listening. I will buy their next c.d.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Intelligent writing which through excellent plot lines and humorous interplay among the main characters makes for brain worthy viewing. Bravo for the outstanding acting of the lead character.
B00BUI5GW8|1.0|This album is trash. The only good songs are the songs that are played on the radio. If you must have it, just download it for free somewhere.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I never read this as a child and started reading it with my 7yr old daughter. What wonderful characters and life lessons. Amazing how 100 years ago young girls had pretty much the same problems as today. A wonderful journey to take with your daughter.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|A continuation of Secret of the Ages.  Gave me a further understanding of the depths we can go to in understanding the mind.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book is fantastic it is a great thriller you should really read it. I loved it it was fantastic and full of suspense and mystery I give it an A+
B007CGNOAI|5.0|If you ever thought teachers were overworked and underpaid, after watching this movie, you KNOW they don't get nearly the respect they deserve. Once again, Adrien Brody shines.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I did like this movie only problem for us was it was sometimes hard to understand what he was saying.  The scenery was beautiful but would not need to watch it again.  I like movies that I can keep and want to watch over and over again.  Husband had same problem understanding what he was saying at times.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I was amazed at the condition of the used DVD's.  I had never watched the 2nd DVD on the Monsters Inc of the making and all the background work.  AMAZING!<br /><br />I am seriously a fan of the used DVD's provided on AMAZON!!!!
B0099114WO|2.0|Just not for everyone subject matter not what I expected.  Was hoping for a funny movie. Would be for  adults only since it deal with sex
B002NNA9N0|4.0|with an all star cast , and obviously a lot of improvisation by all, this film is very good.,,  set in brooklyn new york which is where i am from, it is an accurate depiction of the real estate business in an urban setting....great Pacino , Lemmon and Spacey ..<br />Spacey admitted that during filming he was personnaly affected by Pacino and Lemmon callling him all the curses..<br />A very ,very good film........
B000FC13Y0|5.0|This is a really entertaining book. This may be one of the first times I have come to the end of a book and wished there was more. I like that it is a fast read, and full of adventure. I knew how the ending was going to turn out by chapter 3, and I really enjoyed watching the story unfurl. There are parts of the story that I wish had been elaborated on a bit more, not because I was left needing more to understand, but because it would have made for a wonderful extra chapter. It is a wonderful High Fantasy story, and I enjoyed every word.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show is a must watch for anyone that has an inner bad-a$$. A great show to get caught up in !
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|My family likes all his movies but this one is towards the top of our list. great environmental theme. Save the planet from the evil industrialists!
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I'm sorry, but whoever gave this one star is out of their mind. Her voice is simply amazing, the lyrics are so moving and beautiful. Guess they must have been a Belieber cause this album knocks it out of the park! Definitely listen to \\"Empty\\", \\"Lost & Found\\" & \\"Gone\\" for some heavy ballads. I love \\"Forget\\", it's fun & upbeat. I don't know how more people don't know about Lianne but I'll continue to spread the word about this truly talented artist!!
B001XVP9CY|5.0|Seeing this in HD after all these years was a real treat. Completely and utterly incredible. I am too young to have seen it on the big screen and DVD quality does not do this movie justice. Also I think this \\"final cut\\" is definitely an improvement over the original director's cut, and a huge improvement over the original studio version.
B009KEN87O|5.0|runs fantastic on my droid x2. definitely recommend the app if you are a fan of space invaders.  Think of it as an improvement on a classic game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover did it again, she got me hooked from the very first page and I just couldn't stop reading. It took me a day to get through this novel. I wanted to know more about Sky and Dean from the very beginning whether it was them as a couple or individually. Their stories were compelling and they continued to develop though out the book and take you on an emotional roller coaster until the very last sentence of the book.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover truly has a way with words and this has been proven through Slammed, Point of Retreat and Hopeless. I look forward to reading many more books from such a talented author!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about Downton is quality.  The plot, the writing, the acting, editing, etc.<br />It's what TV or movies should be.
0553801473|2.0|too hard to figure out how to read with the other books. I am a great fan and still had a hard time. Just gave up.
B0049VZ222|5.0|WOW  Hadn't seen this before so it answered a lot of questions.  The quality was excellent  recomend this to all
B008HJGPVO|5.0|She loves it uses  it mostly for games but still works better then a  finger. Probably really needed for old folks like us who find that these young whippersnappers print too small.
B00AA0U05A|2.0|I really liked her performance in Songcatcher. The movie didn't seem to gather as much credit as I felt it deserved, but I think its a pretty good analysis of Americana if your looking for some history of the various cultures in Appalachia.And some easy to take old Scots Irish music.. You won't believe Pat Carroll, the elderly Comic from the 60's. The songs and rendition on this DVD are I think a little underwhelming.
B007N6NGYG|2.0|This game was by no means a 5-star game right outta the gate, but through the first few levels it seemed as though it had a lot of potential to be fun and interesting. After about 20 levels, it was clear that this game was hugely flawed. There are obvious signs of puzzle solving and quick thinking. However, the game starts to throw those concepts out as it becomes a guessing game too. Hiding the tracks from the player with unmarked tunnels does not qualify as a puzzle to me;  nor is it fun. Even if tunnels were marked, I could manage to guess timing for crossing tracks hidden from my view, but there is actually a level based solely on sending trains into one of many tunnels to choose from and HOPING it comes out in the right place on the other end. This is pure laziness in terms of design efforts. Save yourself the frustration and money - don't bother with this glaring example of how not to make a puzzler.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I would definitely recommend!!...  lots of levels!!... and its free!!.. and lots of fun!!... if you like match games you will like this game....
B009E9R2OK|5.0|Really we should all be using this format. CD's & 180 gram vinyl LP's are all very well--but what happened to improving quality??<br /><br />Down with MP3/AAC. It suuuucks!!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I purchased the narration for this book and was pleasantly surprised at the fluidity of the narration. while at times I noticed the narration stopped short of completing sentences, the most important of which was the final line of the book. Other than that, I enjoyed reading along. Baum was a very clever writer and the reader has the pleasure of seeing into the imagination of this great author. I also recommend the rest of the Oz series to anyone who enjoys smiling.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great fun, quick read. Characters are developed well and there are good twists and turns. Much different and better than the movie. I highly recommend the book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this! I was hooked on spider solitare before I got my kindle. There is something addictive about it. It seems silly to just play one game after another, but that's what I find myself doing. I work part-time at our hospital gift shop and it is very handy to take it along and play between customers. Also, many tv programs don't require your full attention and I often find myself playing at the same time (or at least during the commercials, which seem to be getting longer all the time).
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Haven't read fully yet. Read on the plane. Format and all works well with iPad. Will get more classics. Great value for free!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Quite possibly the best book I've read up to now and I've been reading a long time. It touches your heart in a million different ways and let's you love Holder and Sky almost as much as they love each other. I strongly recommend this for everyone no matter what genre you prefer.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Last in the series, The Dark Knight Rises is a great ending to a trilogy of Batman re-envisioned in the modern day. Love this movie, incredible story, music, and acting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been many years since I enjoyed a science fiction book as much as I enjoyed this one.  I grew up reading the incredible fiction of Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Robert Silverberg, Farmer, Bradbury, etc., and &#34;Wool&#34; holds its own among the best of their books.  Howey is very talented.  I wish him a long and successful career.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|The app is similar to the website on a computer desktop, I can move around the site nicely. I have not tried to purchase through it yet. I imagine there will be no problems. I am now a great Amazon fan!
B00BESCJII|4.0|A good story line, both entertaining and moving.  Well acted portrayals of slightly off-center characters.  The ensemble result was completely enjoyable.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I spend monies very nicely with this app! I like that that I can run my finger up and I can increase the light and down to decrease. After a long day on a computer at work it in nice to come home and use this app to increase the size of the wordage by pushing out with my thumb and idex finger, I also like the bookmarking and looking up words. If i used this for studying i can highlight also.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Great challenge,  good graphics,  could be  more variety  to the individual screens  but enough to make it enjoyable. I'm on level 55  out of 100.  So  plenty of play.  If you like match  three  type  games...Go for it!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I have been with msn.com for years and love them, I am using their outlook on a computer, but the outlook app didn't do well on my tablet. Tried the hotmail app and it works beautifully! My only concern is that msn will make me use the hotmail.com instead of the msn.com I have presently, because I chose to use this app. This app is really user friendly...no instructions for most apps so you learn to run as you go! Once I learned how to change folders and how to refresh them to make them appear in your change folders and went and tweaked some of their default settings I am good to go.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|Although I have all the tracks that DA did for other artists, still this set is great, because it contains tracks that cannot be found elsewhere. The gems of the set are three Escorts, two Allman Joys and a Delaney and Bonnie track. Never mind the Grateful Dead live track. Most fans can get it as a bootleg. The sound quality is superb. The commentaries were well written. Not much that I do not know about DA, but still it's a great set to have. Now, how about releasing the rest of the other 53 Escorts tracks recorded by Lee Hazen?
B00881VLCE|2.0|I did not like this magic puzzles, to easy, not enough puzzles to many ads, must put in 5 more words
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Great story--classic characters!  Hazel-rah and his leadership; Fiver and his insight and the rest are each memorable and brilliantly illustrated by Adams.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Quick few swipes will hone out any dings or blemishes. Then draw your blade through the 'fine' side to gain a razor-like finish. Don't own a serrated edge, so &#34;no comment&#34; on that aspect of this product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What's there to say but another awesome book! I am so glad I decided to read the books before watching the movies... I cannot wait to read the next book! Bravo!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|this is a great movie, lots of action...kept you on the edge of your seat...great acting by the young actors, recommend for 13 and older...enjoy like i did
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great CD!!!! I love the way he flows. can't wait to hear more ofhis music in the future. Awesome CD
B003R1B9MW|5.0|You don't have to like golf to really enjoy this movie, it is about beating the odds and with humor too. I love the spirit Eddie has and keeps things in line even though he is only a small child, but with the soul of a much older person.  The story is also about family, the relationship between a boy and his father and a different relationship with his understanding mother.  This movie has many different sides and keeps you pulled in to cheer for the under dog.
0140157352|4.0|negotiation practices......Ury and Fisher break it down for you in a very simple approach.  If you find yourself involved in a conflict that is having problems reaching a settlement, this is the guide you need to help facilitate a solution.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a pretty awedome hidden object game for free. u can play for free or spend money, but i can play it forever for free.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I love this diet! I feel great, weight creeping down, and everyone at work raving about it as well. MUST TRY for everyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|omg I will play this game over and over and so fourth if I did not have so much to do
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I enjoy reading a lot of books. Romance being my favorite. This is by far one of the greatest books I've read in a long time! It sucks you in and you NEVER want to put it down. I can't wait to read the next one (coming out soon!!)!!
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I loved it.  I like historical novels best, and this is one come to life.  All the pageantry and costuming and beautiful scenery all put together with lots of drama and sex.  And it's mostly all true!  What's not to like?
B000J159N8|5.0|It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  For those that didn't live through the Viet Nam era, this like others of the VN generation, it is a stark look back.<br />Not for the faint of heart.  Blood, death, fear are all present.<br />Not for viewing by children.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|It was hard to follow the story line and a bit disjointed despite all the star power that the film had!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Love thismovie and so does my 7 year old.  It came on time and as expected.  I would definitely buy more movies from this vender.
B002PZ8YCO|4.0|Didn't know anything about Beatrice Potter before watching this movie which was charming. The scenery of the English countryside alone makes the movie worth watching.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Die Applikation funktioniert sehr gut mit dem kindle. Die angezeigten Werte sind sehr hilfreich. Die grafische Darstellung ist sehr gelungen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is the best book for a middle school student to read right now. There are, of course, the classics that will be enjoyed by everyone forevermore, but if you know a preteen, you should recommend that they read The Hunger Games, as it is the best young adult fiction novel on the market. If you have a few days to devote to a book, because you’ll need to set time aside as you won’t be able to put it down mid-chapter, you should read it, too.<br /><br /> The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins follows Katniss Everdeen, a  tribute from coal-mining District 12 of Panem, the totalitarian government that exists in what was once known as North America. After spending the last few years illegally hunting in the Appalachian Mountains to provide for her family after the death of her father, she volunteers to fight in the Hunger Games in the place of her younger sister. The annual Hunger Games pits twenty-four teenage tributes from the districts of Panem against each other in a battle to the death, a gruesome reminder of the strength of the state. Their horrific deaths are televised nationally to the entire country, most of whom are being forced to watch their children kill and be killed.<br /><br /> The Hunger Games is a reflection of our nation’s obsession with reality television. With current reality television shows like Survivor and Toddlers & Tiaras that exploit and manipulate both the contestants and the audience, where will our society draw the line? Collins’ ability to present these ideas to a preteen audience and force adults to contemplate their own role in the reality television phenomena while creating a plot so riveting and characters so alive is commendable and will be rewarded by a reading of the sequel, Catching Fire.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Doctor Who is amazing!!!! This is one of my new favorite tv shows! I can't wait to start watching season 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should get this app it is really fun to get money and jump on buses it is also fun to be a robot and i love getting mystery boxes:)
B00AWTTUHI|4.0|Part I was awesome and you could rent it.<br /><br />Part II came out and your had to BUY it to watch it. That makes me a bit angry at Amazon, frankly, since I do notice a trend of them doing little things like this. However, as a consumer, it is my choice as to whetehr I wanted to see the 2nd part of this, and I decided to.  It was pretty well done.<br /><br />Part I was better, but Part II was pretty good.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it, but it should be more like on the X-box and computer. if it was, I would definitely play it more often.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|Pretty much, if Sam Raimi does it, I will check it out.<br /><br />Fun movie. Not headed for the Academy Awards, but a solid horror film with disturbing images, scary stuff.<br /><br />And, it has the actor who played 'The Comedian' in the The Watchmen&#34; movie. he is a pretty good actor.<br /><br />Overall, worth a watch.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|I usually like Tommy Lee Jones and actually did in this film, but it was slow moving and derivative and I didnt finish watching it.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I've enjoyed the beautiful sounds of Enya for 20 years now.<br /><br />I decided buying it digitally was a good move since I wanted some relaxing music right then and there.<br /><br />Lots of her best stuff over the years, plenty to enjoy, and it sounds fantastic as ever.<br /><br />If you are new to her, this is a wonderful place to start.
0393327345|5.0|I loved the movie, so i wanted to read the book. the movie made the story more simplistic, but the book was great. even though it skipped around alot, it still made sense in its own way. Now and forever, before i do anything, I will ask my self, WWTDD. What Would Tyler Durden Do?
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is an easy enjoyable game to relax with.  I use it on my Kindle fire when I am waiting for an appointment or in the evening to just relax.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|Great fun, great music, good family movie-not for under ten though. Glad it's still around to enjoy-awesome photography as well!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Easy enough for my 3 yo daughter and still entertaining enough to keep me happy for a while. Not the most thrilling of games but it's a good puzzle.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is an easy read and kept my attention throughout.  My heart goes out to the main character and there is an interesting twist.  Very much well worth the Kindle download!
B004YXE438|4.0|Different levels of difficulty make this a good, all skill level, game. My 3 yo plays on the easiest and it is a little challenge  for her. Something to keep us busy while waiting at restaurants, doctor office and such.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|love this album! I wish I had heard it in the 70s when I was young like Sixto. This guy is a poet.
B00B7XGFO4|5.0|Bought the DVD about 2 years ago but the video portion was not so great. This remastered one has the video that the DVD should have had. &#34;Jane Eyre&#34; is my favorite movie, and I enjoy watching the different makings of the movie. Trying to collect all the different movies of &#34;Jane Eyre&#34;.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gripping tale that is told very well. I was a bit disappointed in the ending, and didn't really believe it, but it's Flynn's piece of work, not mine. So be it. Despite the ending, the writing is very good and it's a page turner.
B001VEHZZ2|4.0|This short book is about shifting personal and national identity and Hamid does a good job of exploring both. It is a pleasure to be able to read a full novel in about 8 hours and The Reluctant Fundamentalist covers much territory in a shorter format. There is a primary protagonist telling his story to an American in Lahore Pakistan and as the tensions grow in the primary narrative, the tensions grow in the relationship between the protagonist and the American, who the reader must envision since he never speaks a word of text in the story.  In some ways it is a coming of age story as a young man succeeds at an Ivy League college and courts a beautiful young wealthy girl. The protagonist shifts identity gradually due to the crisis of 9/11 and the emotional and mental unbalance of his girlfriend. It is the relationship with the young woman however that sensitizes the protagonist to his propensity to shift identity to please those around him. The novel speeds up to break-neck speed in the final sections as the relationship between the protagonist and the mysterious American man becomes more foreground in the novel. Even to the last page of the novel we see the shifting aspect of the protagonist's identity but we see that whereas he initially would shift identity in an effort to please those in power around him, he has now learned to shift identity to hide and obscure his true mission. The book does a good job of revealing to Americans how our wealthy, power, and culture may be viewed by those in Islamic countries.  It does a good job of getting into the frame of reference of those outside our culture who come to America seduced by wealth, power, technology, but come to take a second look at the priorities our society places on these forces and incentives.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|I've been wanting to hear more of fun.since purchasing some nights album, and aim & ignite is just as great as it! Now I have more fun to listen to!
0743270754|5.0|Excellent!<br />Nina
B00BF123WG|2.0|typical hyped, overrated.  historically interesting but poor storytelling.  central character couldn't carry the film.  for this genre, there are better films.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|The movie had me laughing from the beginning.  Gerard Butler's character was amazingly funny.  The narration and story line  were both great.  I love this movie.  Can't wait for RockNRolla 2 to be released. (Hurry up Guy Richie)
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I can buy paper books from Amazon but yet cannot buy digital books? You are forcing me to download pdf books while I am willing to pay for the content.
B007EE564U|5.0|A well written action book starring Mitch Rapp. There is never a dull moment and Rapp shines even brighter than in the earlier novels.
B008XDSUNU|5.0|When listening to music on the web, I like this kind of music, because normal pop has me finger snappin, hand clapping, and ditty boppin all over the kitchen, so I don't get done what need to! (except fun) This type of music melds well with surfing the web!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|did not like it not for me I really like the puzzle games the match three or more.  but not this one
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is great to play on the Kindle Fire HD. You can do a lot without making purchases. Very entertaining.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of my favorite all time books.!!!!  Keeps your interest from the beginning whether you are a dog lover or not. I am .
B00899F0G8|3.0|I believe the story line is lost this season ... I used to like it . I got addicted to the first season but then everything seems to have a loose end and no real answers.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched Downton Abbey before it became really popular but have been so busy, I was just now able to finish Season 2 and what a season it was.  BBC killed this season..a must watch for any BBC fan!
B0030F5W5K|4.0|This is a classic great movie that can be watched over and over.  We watched it with the kids for the first time the other day.  They thought it was slow at first, but enjoyed it in the end.
B00008CMR6|5.0|I love all of this great American and true patriots movies. I've always been a real fan and will always
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great Movie, glitch was my best character. Wreck-it Ralph is now my favorite movie to watch with my cousin and friends.
1616550414|5.0|This beautiful hard cover coffee-table book is absolutely worth every penny if you are an avid LoZ fan.  There is a ton of art, including unused concepts, and much of it has never before been published.  The best part, to me, is the chronology of all the games.  It goes into great detail explaining the various forks in the timeline and some of the events that take place between games.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This is your basic alarm clock.... I gave 3 stars due to the fact that ads keep popping up obstructing the view of the time.... overall it is a decent app. I still have it on my Kindle Fire.
B0076HNMU0|4.0|I watched this when it first came out in the 90's and at the time it was cutting edge stuff for network TV. David Lynch was a master at making you feel like you were a voyuoer of some strange world, while wondering if he wasn't poking fun at the real world at the same time.<br /><br />If you are going to start the series beware...it gets stranger and it's addictive,
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was superb! I loved the way the words wrapped themselves around the reader. It was difficult to read, but it was also glorious. I have read many WW II books, but this one totally touched every corner of my heart. Mr. Zusak, thank you!<br />Karen Schiffman
B0042MEQVG|4.0|I came to the Twilight party late, but finally read the books this past year.  I was able to rent the first two movies, and would have rather rented this one, but that was not an option on Amazon.  I think the acting is getting a little better with each movie, and am looking forward to seeing the next two.  Unfortunately, right now, only part 2 is available to rent, and I need to see part 1 first.  Why not available to rent? Consistancy would help me to enjoy my purchases of this series more.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|It is incredible that a short story can be turned into 8 hours oh film, great movie for all ages
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I had never heard this story before, and found it very interesting. I enjoyed the actors, and found there was enough tension to keep me wondering exactly how it would end.  But I don't really see how it beat out Lincoln for best picture.  I just think this movie was on the same quality level.  But I recommend seeing it.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|BrOs no one has ever completed the dictionary except the editor and he made a lot of money 11 =
0439023491|5.0|Once pulled into the 'Hunger Games', you must read this sequel. It didn't disappoint!  A thrilling read.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It is hard for those of us who really liked the original to see why a remake is even needed. I really like the original Judge Dredd so when I saw the release of Dredd, I wasn't expecting it to hold up. I was completely wrong! I enjoyed this movie as much as the first. The story lines are completely different from each other, which is why I think they did such a great job. I wasn't watching actors trying to reinvent or copy the original actors of Judge Dredd. There is a lot more violence in this movie over the original and some sexual scenes as well that you never saw in Judge Dredd, but it has been almost 20 years between the two films and a lot has changed in Hollywood.<br /><br />For those who liked the original or want a fun action movie, this is it.
0316228532|2.0|There was nothing in any of the characters that I liked.  Most of them were small-minded.  Decided I had better things to do than finish this book.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I really enjoyed reading The Hobbit so when they finally decided to make it into a film, I was excited. My only major issues with the movie is the fact when it released it wasn't clear movie studios were going to make this into a the part story. The novel is as big as Lord of the Rings. It stands on it's own and can be read in a matter of hours. I was a bit let down at the end realizing I was going to have wait for the next two films to release. However, it did explain why the beginning was so dang long, a bit too long in fact. Overall, I loved what they did with the screenplay. The movie of course has added things which are not in the book and characters from Lord of the Rings that never were part of The Hobbit do show up, but they wove it all together well and so I wan't upset with this changes in story line.
1400052181|5.0|Learned quite a bit about science but it was wrapped around a story of a family that suffered a great deal of hardship.  I couldn't put it down.
B002RVCD0U|3.0|I thought I was going to like this show a lot more than I did. Yes, it is pure entertainment and if you just want a great action packed movie were you can sit back and let your brain relax this is it. I like mindless action movies as much as anyone, but I to me the Terminator series is more than that. I do have to say this though...it was a lot better than Terminator 3, but the first and even second films will always be my favorite.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy this game. I like the points you get. I also enjoy the different levels I cant figure out what to trade in to get bongo points
B0040HO01Y|5.0|the characters are all well developed and draw you in with each episode. Period costumes, and language that isn't offensive is very refreshing. Situations are true to the period. Very enjoyable entertainment. Glad I signed up for Amazon Prime.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|You don't truly understand his music until you see the movie.  Unless you were there when it all started, you have no idea the pain behind and feeling behinds the words.  Highly recommend.
B00594M53M|4.0|I like this movie so much... I have seen it twice, with a couple of year in between, and the second time I could not remember most of the details. That was good because I could enjoy it but that means that the movie is not very remarkable and it does not catch you and captivate you like some of the amazing movies made in Paris. The photography of the city is insane by the way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very very very very much fun so get it<br />And you will have a lot of fun
B008FWHGYS|4.0|I like the movie, it has really nice moments. However, I thinks there are better movies that tell a lot of histories in a more complete way. This movie feels like it is missing some connection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a fabulous story, love all of the characters and the actors are wonderful.  I am looking forward to watching Season 3.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I loved it! I have read and loved many books by this author and this one is no different. Very descriptive and easy to read, I read in one day because I just could not put it down!
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is so addicting I play it 24/7 but having tnt and not being able to use it is really bugging me. I don't get why it's in the game if there's nothing to light it with. The price is a total rip off, but after they update it then it will really be worth 7 bucks. You're better off getting it for pc. The price is higher but it's way better and worth it.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Plants Vs Zombies is on everything, and now your phone or tablet? The port from PC and consoles to Android is very well done, and worth the pick up for first time players, but doesnt bring much new if you've already beat the game elsewhere.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|One fantastic entertainer. I  loved the show from start to finish. Cher's &#34;adult humor added a lot to the experience.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|This is a great little movie with a very personable protagonist, even though words are far and few between. The later section can be a bit heavy handed feeling, but it's not a bad message for kids to understand, if they even pick up on it at all. Overall I love the movie.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|EVERY CD I HAVE EVER PURCHASED NOW TAKES A BACK SEAT TO MUSIC FROM  STEVIE NICKS.  MY HEART SWELLS EACH TIME I PLAY THIS CD.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've broken a lot of headsets in my day, simply because the headband is made of plastic. This one has metal in it, so the build quality is higher than the average headset, which is great, but the sound quality is also really awesome. I'm also a big fan of Logitech universal software that integrates my keyboard and headset in to one suite instead of needing multiple programs. unfortunately the drivers included are outdated and wont work, you have to get this suite from Logitech's website, so initial set up was a bit annoying.<br /><br />EDIT: Some minor niggles are dropping my review, and I would likely suggest the wired version (G400 series). A lot of interference causes loud beeping as the headset temporarily disconnects and reconnects to the dongle. Also the Side tone slider resets all too often. Finally on occasion the headset refuses to stay recognized by my PC causing the USBin and USB out sound to play back to back rapidly on my Windows PC for anywhere between 10 and 120 seconds, which can be rather annoying.<br /><br />Still not broken, which is much better than most of my last headsets.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE SINCE 1968.  THIS FILM IS THE FIRST OF THREE - I CAN HARDLY WAIT!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The continued iteration, updates, and improvements makes this the keyboard to beat. Accurate and now implementing a swype style option called flow, SwiftKey is the ultimate android keyboard.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|EVERY CD I HAVE EVER PURCHASED NOW TAKES A BACK SEAT TO MUSIC FROM  STEVIE NICKS.  MY HEART SWELLS EACH TIME I PLAY THIS CD.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I like the twists they put on this game. I find it fun and approachable, especially since I'm not good at these types of games.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|EVERY CD I HAVE EVER PURCHASED NOW TAKES A BACK SEAT TO MUSIC FROM  STEVIE NICKS.  MY HEART SWELLS EACH TIME I PLAY THIS CD.
B002VCR03A|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable read which left me captivated and searching for the next instalment.  The story is very well written and descriptive without drowning in detail.  Highly recommend.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|AWESOME Book. Really looking forward to the Movie this summer! The story flowed perfectly and all the characters were believable. Kept me on the seat of my pants and I couldn't stop reading it.
0767817664|5.0|It's so good to have this classic piece of horror history on DVD. The picture is clearer and the sound fantastic. Same cheesy story as ever =)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I've play many a puzzle in my day but this is the absolute best. definitly worth more than the asking price!!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Thanks for the DVD, it shipped quickly to me and plays great in my DVD player! No scratches or smudges.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey's wit and charm make this a laugh-out-loud page turner.  I was sick on a dirty, uncomfortable train between Aswan and Luxor, Egypt and this book made it a pleasant trip!  She's delightful!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|All 4 seasons were wonderful.  I'd stay up some nights until 2:00am.  The costumes were spot on.  Well done Showtime!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is a talented author who tackled the complicated series of events and characters with such ease, making this important piece of American history accessible to all Americans.  Absolutely wonderful!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It's a temple run mixed in the world of Oz.  With the new upgrade the dark forest it's a lot of fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I choose this because it is one of the best series I have seen in a long time.  It grabs you and makes you want to see more,
B008P3SPVU|3.0|The true parts of the story I liked but how we get there is a little cliche.  The characters are only portrayed fairly well.
055358894X|3.0|It was fun, until the end.<br />In the end I was puzzled by the fact that all the brilliant schemers in the book were failures.<br />I probably won't continue with the series.<br />Also, I can't think of much character development.<br />Locke is still just a careless brilliant schemer, too clever for his own good. That's about all I know about him after 700 pages...
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|who cares about the story line.  This is just a funny movie with enough of a love story to make it interesting.
B00ANAC32U|3.0|I've had this bumper for a few days now and I just can't get used to it. It has a cheap, plasticy feel to it, and the edges protrude sharply from around the phone. It also makes the phone feel just a bit too fat.<br /><br />One nice thing about the bumper though is the buttons on the bumper feel like actual buttons when you press them, where as other cases just make you feel like you're pressing into the case.<br /><br />Altogether, I think I'm going to return the bumper and take my chances on another case, which stinks because there doesn't seem to be a lot of good covers for the Nexus 4.
B00865P3AS|5.0|Who would think two cellos could knock out Highway to Hell so majestcally?  I now want to purchase more cd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all three books in this trilogy.I had heard so much about them and it is a love story more than just about all the sex. There is a good story as to why both main characters are the way they are. I could read them again!
B001XUPGLY|4.0|I saw this when it first came out in the theatres.  It was great then as it is great now.  The original Start Trek cast are my favorite.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Thus far this game has been very enjoyable. I have found no glitches after clearing the first level. I recommend. this game.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|This is by far my favorte book and movie. I really do not care about the acting.  I just love it.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Really enjoyed the first season.  Second season was generally kinda dull, with more than a few episodes focused too much on bedside care of several sick and injured characters.  (Yawn).  Third season, everyone's stuck in one of two places - Woodbury (Camelot wannabe?), and an abandoned prison.  The walkers/zombies continue to excel in growling and gurgling, which has been the most exciting part of recent episodes.  Seems like the writers can't figure where the story needs to go.  Maybe things will step lively in season four.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|I would recommend this book for everyone who wants to expand their world view and their understanding of the universe around them. Meadows takes a complex topic and builds it up in an incremental, accessible and applicable way. I've seen this book change people's perceptions.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|QUICK turn around!!! One of the best ever to deal with. I highly recommend them, as you won't be disappointed. You'll see!!!
B001JU4S44|1.0|This movie is as bad as Ghost Protocol is good . . . just laughably awful.  If all the slow motion action sequences were played at actual speed, this movie would be about 35 minutes long.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|QUICK turn around!!! One of the best ever to deal with. I highly recommend them, as you won't be disappointed. You'll see!!!
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Fabulous- It's great to be able to see all the episodes back to back,so I am happy with this purchase!
1400069807|5.0|Everyone should read this book to learn how the big food companies are manipulating us and are the direct cause of many of American's health problems.
B001M0HGR2|4.0|I rented the Amazon Instant Video HD version and watched via iPad from a hotel room during a business trip.  'Great tale and no hiccups during streaming.  The only disappointment was with a lack of closed captioning, especially since some of the dialog was muffled by the background music or mumbled and incomprehensible.
B000FC0P9E|5.0|Loved the story love the girl love Stephen king! I don`t think I could have survived when I was 9 and I was big for my age.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Awesome. In every way. Please watch this and prepare to be amazed. Tell your friends. So crazy fun to watch
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|Interesting enough to get me to see more pictures and see if they go into different ones next time when I play
B008Y5OWMK|2.0|This is an extremely self-indulgent exercise in inner-vision, murky musings by a director who, I believe, was not focused at all on telling a story to an audience. It strikes me as being Cimino's private pipe dream -- deeply felt by him, but not actually intended to be shared with the public.<br /><br />This film had exactly the same backstory as \\"Shane\\" -- the Johnson County, Wyoming War of 1892. Even though \\"Shane\\" never mentions the true names and historical events of that war, it captures the essence of the conflict beautifully and clearly. I have only seen the full, complete 219-minute version of \\"Heaven's Gate\\", and my first and chief criticism is that this movie does not bother to tell the story. The directing is about everything except the story -- beautiful scenery, beautiful Isabelle Huppert, remarkable camera shots, and, most of all, about longeur. About 1/3 of the film seems to be dialogue in a foreign language without subtitles. But who is who, what happens and why, who says what or decides what when, and how it ends, are hopelessly butchered, in my opinion. It is like a \\"trip\\" movie from back in the days when many people thought LSD was harmless and life-enhancing.<br /><br />Cimino appears to be an excellent student of Eisenstein and Kurosawa with respect to establishing and vividly exposing (often at great length) symbolically powerful scenes or moments. Unlike these masters, he substitutes sheer imagery for storytelling. The point of that poignant symbolism is lost in the long, long, long, shots -- there is no sense of pace, of event following event in sequences that matter.<br /><br />Similar to the over-rich imagery, the acting is mostly terrific; Huppert, Waterston, Bridges, Walken, Hurt, and Kristofferson all manage to make you care about what happens to them, for better or worse, but what they are doing when and why, or what actually does happen to them, is treated almost as irrelevant by the auteur. The characters become used kleenex.<br /><br/>In the end, I have been deeply disappointed that Cimino has so much great material to work with -- the War itself and what really did happen, a very fine cast, and some spectacular cinematography -- and managed to make a mincemeat pie out of it.<br /><br />Mitchell
B00ATPVA78|3.0|I liked the game, short one to two days if you had things to do then back to it but its Ok.
0307120007|4.0|I love this book for babies because they can touch all the different textures.  I just wish it was more durable.  It seems like a comb binding might not be the best choice for a book intended for the baby/toddler age group.  Other than that it's perfect.  It's a book most of us had as children and it's a classic.  I bought it for my son for his first Easter, and hopefully he doesn't tear it apart too quickly.
0767812387|5.0|I love this movie because when I first watched it I saw how he fell in love with her and it was the way he looked at her when she picked him up at the bus station. One of my favorite movies. I can watch this movie over and over again. Love the dancing champion ship at the end too. It was here when she knew she fell in love with Chayene.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I feall<br />I really loved this game I play a lot of ho games and this is one of the best cant wait for more
B00BI73CVI|1.0|They took a great story and reduced it to absolute rubbish! They focused on all the negativity of the story and drew it out to ridiculous proportions!  Just because a few big name actors are in it, doesn't mean the movie is good. Stick to the older versions of this story of how the human spirit can triumph in adversity.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I think it fits in great with the genre. I wish it would have lasted longer. Love learning the origin of everything
034580404X|5.0|Opened up a whole new way to look at romantic novels and novellas for me.  Not to mention the erotic aspects of the growing relationship between two people.
0743216385|5.0|It is well written and documented by a wonderful writer.  I was kept on the edge all the time.  I will now read other books by this author.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Julian Fellowes wrote 'Gosford Park' along with Robert Altman & Bob Balaban.<br />Fellowes was asked if he could turn it into a series and did.<br /><br />What more do you need to watch 'Gosford Park' as a fix while waiting for the next season of Downton?<br />Oh, I'll give you more anyway: Dame Maggie is delightful in this one, too.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|SUPER FUN!!!! I love how u can use Blue and Jewel in some of the levels. Sorry, g2g. (got 2 go) MUST PLAY!!<br />I recommend this app to everyone that loves Angry Birds
