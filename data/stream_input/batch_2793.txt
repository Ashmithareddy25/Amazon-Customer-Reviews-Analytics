B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best TV serial that has come out in a long long time!  Love the charactors, the story line and of course, the setting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very cute and easy to play. one of the most responsive games I've played in a while! graphics are also top. notch!!
B001UREJWM|5.0|This is an incredible piece of work by the heavy metal legends and an amazing swan song for Ronnie James Dio who goes down as possibly the greatest metal voice of all time. The production on this CD is fantastic, very, very close to perfect. The drums may be a little low but for me I don't even notice it. Ronnie sounds stunning and Geezer and Tony on on fire. Personally I believe this is their best release since Dehumanizer (also incredible!) with some absolute classic tracks that stand neck and neck with the all time greats. Bible Black is so freakin' good you will want to immediately play it again after your first listen. Simply incredible. Other favorites include Fear, Rock And Roll Angel (rediculous  Iommi solo!) Atom and Evil, Double the Pain, and Breaking Into Heaven. What a treat for metal fans to have this and then the recent 13 release with Ozzy back in form. Metal WILL NEVER DIE!!!! RIP RJD!!!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Law from a business side is great, better than criminal side i.e. law and order but that's great show too
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I'm extremely pleased with Native. It is infinitely enjoyable from start to finish. Any fans of OneRepublic should be very happy with this effort.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I cant stop playing..  the only thing I would change, is having to buy  this or that...  if my pockets where deeper I could get thru the levels faster.
B002C6A6F4|3.0|If you like Hannah Montana, you'll be sure to love the Hannah Montana movie. Great for kids and teens who love Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is great  my kid can help set it up with her favorite color and song, and then its the nightlight too...  what more could a parent ask for...  she loves it...  and is on time now, which makes me on time and everybody is smiling.....
B003JR1JV0|3.0|I don't think I ever watched the DVD. The CD is now in my pile to sell. If you like Miley, you'll like this.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Strongly suggest anyone considering watching this movie should save their money.<br />It isn't worth the $4.99 rental fee.<br />Love the music of the Broadway version but some of the actors in this movie version just<br />can't sing *at all*.  It is painful to listen.<br />I was force by Amazon to give it one star but it isn't worth but half a star.
0385504225|5.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's books, and this series with Robert Langdon is just so enjoyable. Loved this book.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I found it a fun puzzle game and on a trip where things were going awry, I gave the game to the kids to play snd they found it fun too.  I like that it makes you think strategy but not too hard.  But now I understand others comment that there should be more boxes.  Still, good fun for all.
1439177783|5.0|Wow. Portia de Rossi's struggles were so heart breaking to read about! I'm so amazed at how strong she was to get through everything and has finally found happiness and acceptance with who she is.
B001EBWING|5.0|Casablanca is a great love and action movie that give an idea about people who escaped from WWII to United States..
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I love Twilight, no matter how horrible it really is. What can I say, it's a guilty pleasure to watch vampires in WA.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  We can't wait for the next two movies in the trilogy.  Reading  the books first makes the movie more enjoyable but<br /> it is mandatory
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|It's Miley Cyrus, so don't be suprised on the quality of acting. And it's Nicholas Sparks, so don't be surprised on how formulaic it is.
B003NRYMZQ|3.0|Much more drama, trying to create storylines.  More Action needed to make this a 4 or 5 star series. To to see Season 2.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I recently read this book in about 1 day over spring break. It was very enjoyable and a very creative concept. If you have enjoyed Mitch Alboms other books, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as well.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Very good. A wonderful tool to use for trying something that has been going on in Europe for years. I have been practicing this since I received the book. I have found that in order for this to continue working in the weight loss arena, one must do exercise regularly and be careful about what you eat between fasts. You can eat anything but, in small amounts and at the right time of day.
1573229725|5.0|This book was so beautifully written! A friend in England recommended this to me, and I'm glad I checked it out.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|These talented guys have been underrated in my opinion over the last decade.. They are a strong group with a strong bond.. Stand up and take notice..this is talent!! Awesome CD
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Okay, I love whales, and I love Greenpeace (a former employee). This story brought tears to my eye, and I just had to buy the movie so that I could watch it over again.
B00821OX98|4.0|Well done, especially the 'war zones'/scenes, recreating those in modern metropolis' are pretty difficult.  Sometimes this can be like a rollercoaster, with it's ups and downs, but the character development, which evolved over the first season did justice to all the actors.  I'm going out on a limb here, but \\"Hey, this is MUCH better than that reality crap TV that Hollywood is churning out these days.  And you NEVER hear the name \\"Kardashian\\" ONCE!
B009LQKHIO|1.0|The blurb and the general idea of the story were what made me start this book.  I'm trying so hard to continue but it's just too stupid (the simplest way to put it) for example, &#34;Matt was like a brother to him, not only his best friend, but like he was a brother&#34;.  There's more where that came from and I've only just begun.  It really irks me that this book has more than two stars especially with all the errors that could have been prevented with simple editing.  I shall give this book a rest and try again tomorrow.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Granted, book one and two are page turners; this book was more subdued but never the less, was a great story in the culmination of the series.  Without given &#34;the gist&#34; of the story, pity President Snow didn't have to partake in an actual Hunger Game?
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Excellent story, action, effects... Just plain fun to watch. I can safely say that there has never been a movie like this.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Definitely a lot of speculation, which is probably required for this topic.  But enjoyable to read and gives a different perspective of how Jesus the man may have fit into the time.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Some of the beloved die hard elements just seemed to be missing. Fighting along side his son just didn't replace saving his family in my twisted little brain. I wanted him to still be in love with his ex-wife. Where was the love story?
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I love this jumperoo , I originally bought it 5 years ago for my fist born.  She loved it so much she would jump till she fell asleep lol.  When my now 6 month old was born i looked around for other jumpers but none really compared to this one.  The price is great, very steady and fun.  My son loves it and Im a happy mommy. Must have.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Five finger death punch keeps improving their albums with each new release. I love the sound of the instruments, especially the drums! Very heavy and powerful! Highly recommended album!!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I love this game. However no multi player for note 2 and very limited tech support. Will rate higher when I can play multi player on my device.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|The shower scene in the original Psycho remains my favorite terrifying movie memory, but the shower scene in Scarface was a pretty close second. Though not typically a movie aficionado, there are a few films that have captured my attention. Scarface is one, which is obviously the reason Damian Stevens's book caught my eye. I've watched and enjoyed both the original movie and the remake, and I believe Al Capone would have approved both. I also believe he would have appreciated the detailed analysis and thoughtful comparison made by Mr. Stevens that brought Scarface to life in both films. The book takes you through the background, as well as the movie, and highlights details that I would never have recognized.  I loved it!
B004GYY714|5.0|It helps me find the right kind of music i want so 5 stars form me  amazing music nice and clear
1475972350|5.0|Capturing my attention from the outset, Time Killer didn't let it go. After a bit of difficulty, Max and Jesse get it together to wisely use their time in tracking a killer that abhors any real or perceived waste of his time.  The well-developed characters pull the reader into their realm to create a story of suspense that will satisfy the most demanding reader. Bravo Mr. Thiede! Bring on the next one.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|A classic. I have seen this movie many times, and I never get tired of watching it. Great ending...true redemption.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits is a superb show. The acting is excellent, the dialogue is witty and fast-paced, and the story lines are interesting. I finished watching the entire season in less than a week, and I just can't get enough. This is a brilliant show, and I hope it will be on the air for many seasons to come.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Never thought I'd find myself reading epic fantasy fiction. I used to wonder what people saw in this stuff, and then we watched the first series and as horrific and gory as it was, I was hooked on the story and on the characters.<br /><br />Character Love/Hate: I am hopelessly mad about Jon Snow, Arya Stark and Tyrion Lannister.... Danny (Daenerys) comes in there too, but not as high as these 3! I could do without Catelyn. I don't mind doing away with the whole House Arryn and of course like everyone else I like to see the rest of Lannister's heads on spikes! But Jon, Arya and Tyrion the Imp are my faves!<br /><br />So yeah, I freaking LOVED this genius piece of fantasy fiction. I am horrified how people can just criticize this pure work of fiction - yes it's complex, yes it takes patience, yes it won't go as expected but very few people in this world can write this level of epic fiction and deliver it so well. I would suggest saying THANK YOU George R R Martin for taking the time to write these novels and for giving us a different world to imagine and escape to - although a highly unstable, unpredictable, cruel and harsh world, but not one entirely without hope.<br /><br />I felt lost in the sea of characters - yes I know, my brain should keep up but I am not one bit ashamed of getting lost, I feel I did quite well actually - and I wish there were more backdrop - I wish I could better understand the motives of some characters but perhaps it's coming.<br /><br />Amazed at how close the TV series is to the book and I can't wait to pick up Book #2, I don't care if he has to take away my favorite characters. I trust Martin to tell me the rest of this saga from his point of view, not mine and not anyone else.
B003MAS9S0|5.0|I was surprised at how good the movie was! I owned every one except this one! Very surprised how well the movie was put together back then.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|...and will see it a few more, I am sure!  If you are a fan of the Tony Stark-isms...this will not disappoint!
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Loved this story. I could not put the book down.  Jack at his best, sorting out the bad guys, in this case the militia who had kidnapped the Presidents Godchild, and him, by mistake
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Only played the demo but man do I wish I could play the game is awesome story line is good detail is on point!
0345803450|2.0|I rarely stop reading something right in the middle, especially a book by McEwan. I kept on expecting more. I read the reviews which confirmed that I wasn't alone and wasn't insane. The older I get, the less time I have to spend on books and people I'm not enjoying. The MC left me flat. I was puzzled by her motivation and I was bored by the political backdrop. Mr McEwan writes well but not well enough to keep me turning the pages. Back to the library.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I am biased.  I love James Bond movies.  All Bonds represent slightly different characters.  Daniel Craig version isa rougher around the edge than others but is a realistic personality.  Action is great and Xavier Bardem is masterful
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is a great time waster! It's a lot of fun and people of all ages will enjoy this game! There are different places you can run too and different minions you can choose from!!!
B000ID37RM|1.0|Before you rent this, check your SDM settings if you are on a school computer. I rented it, have the plug-in, but my school has the Silver Light blocked where I couldn't allow the movie to stream copy-righted material. Thus, I wasted time and money trying to watch it.<br /><br />It's a GREAT movie if you can actually get it to play.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is a good game its fun it makes me want to be a detective it a ver very very fun game
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a great read! I haven't gotten this into a book in a long time. This is definitely a MUST READ!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a very great app and i love it to death yall should make a insta gram app tht actually works how its supposed to and if their is one can someone tell me it thanksss
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I only recently realized I'm a strict empiricist when it has to do with theology and related matters.  Books like this one I rate highly because it is convincing and the source is rated high in my mind. He isn't an Evangelist slamming his palm on a Bible and screaming at the top of his lungs, &#34;Jesus is the answer!&#34;.  I hate that.  I hope anyone who reads this asks themselves questions like &#34;What's this author's motive for writing this book?&#34;.  This book and others like it, in addition to my own experience, has told me there's a Creator that is alive and is attending to what each of us does.  That sounds crazy, and I wouldn't have said such a thing 5 years ago.  Things have changed.  In particular, my narrow mind.  The Maker had to show me, put Its presence right up to my nose.  I was nearly blind to the idea that our Creator was involved in what happens here on Earth; It also cares how we are living.  Like smoking crack.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|In book one and two characters just &#34;happen&#34; to meet in the most improbable situations and places all over Europe.<br />In book one, usage of words today, yesterday and tomorrow, during general description of a situation is gramatically wrong.  As an example, instead of &#34;the day before yesterday&#34;,  &#34;two days before&#34; would be better.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I hope this book makes those Doctors and Scientists who make the decisions on how others teach<br />Younger students and the media that science is wrong and that &#34;God&#34; is real!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|A fresh story line in the Sci-fi genre is always worth a look. Combine that with great effects and excellent acting you have a really enjoyable movie. Whether or not you like Tom Cruise personally is irrelevant; he is a top notch actor who puts effort into his craft and it shows here. A good part of the movie involves Cruise in isolated situations and your interest is held throughout.<br /><br />Just to give you a heads up: pay attention to the dialogue! If you get up to get a snack or go to the bathroom and don't pause the movie you may miss a crucial point and never figure out what's going on. There are subtle hints that things are not what they appear to be but you're not sure until you have the benefit of hindsight.<br /><br />Basically, a fun way to spend a couple of hours and you'll give this movie some thought after its over.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|This is Magic: The Gathering all right. Too bad the free version doesn't have much in the way of options to play. Sealed Deck play is locked. So are other decks. It tells me to pay $10 to buy the full version at what seems like almost every screen. I'm not sure what else I get when I buy the full version... or how to get other cards.  I would rather play Duel of Champions. At least then I know what I'm buying and can play multiplayer without having to put money down. I can choose whether I want to buy cards or not. So, this game is ok. Not great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator daily it helps with calculations dealing with ohms law both ac and dc and its always right there on my kindle fire it's also a good reason to take my fire to work .
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book continues with the stories of the Hunger Games.  It gives the reader a better idea of the people involved and the history of the troubles.  Not quite the ending I was expecting but it kept me interested until the end.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|very good movies and I really liked the movie box, excellent precentacion.<br />I recommend them..................... Now I'll have to buy the two new lacking for the whole collection
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I normally would not give his type of game a good rating, I just don't like games in which you have to purchase (with real currency that is) your way to the next level. However with this game I am sure there are lots of little extras you can purchase but the core game continues with or without buying extra points and it is charming. Who doesn't love those little round yellow guys and therefore it is fun to play as one. It is challenging enough without being prohibitively hard and the graphics are what you would expect from Dreamworks. In short, my opinion is, great game!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Incredible acting and beautiful scenery and sets, The drama and politics of the real life surrounding Henry VII is amazing
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'd already seen the movies before I bought the blu ray set, all are done very well, though I do like the early movies the best, good entertainment, though in my opinion not for children.  Generally I prefer a more positive outlook on life from other planets (seems ridiculous that some people still think we are the only planet that sustains civilizations), but these movies are worthwhile and if you like to jump a bit while watching a movie, you'll enjoy these movies, Weaver turns in a good performance consistently.
B004OR199G|5.0|It is very informative and easy to read and understand. Many great tips that help with a healthier lifestyle. Thanks.
0545586178|5.0|Not only was the book well written but the storyline was compelling. It was a thoughtful book that seem to be very germane to the current state of affairs in the USA.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Oblivion wasn't bad. It had great visuals, solid acting and an OK twist. The narrative had a decent, slightly \\"slower than it should have been\\" pace.<br /><br />The problem however, is that the characters were not fleshed out like they should have.<br /><br />This movie had the potential to be an incredible franchise-starter, but it takes too much screen time trying to develop one character at a slow pace, instead of balancing out the time to develop what could have been an incredible supporting crew.<br /><br />I still wish for a sequel, but it may never be...
B004UID2LC|1.0|U can't look up videos u can only see the most popular or the most resent videos and how it is set up it is bad
0743297334|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS IN GREAT CONDITION AND WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO COMPLETE MY SUMMER READING REQUIREMENTS, AND AT A GREAT PRICE.

0143039431|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS IN GREAT CONDITION AND WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED TO COMPLETE MY SUMMER READING REQUIREMENTS, AND AT A GREAT PRICE.
B001993Y3G|5.0|I love this movie!  No matter what critics say about Kevin Costner not having an accent, he did good with it!  Morgan Freeman as always is an added bonus!
B00BPA2PBG|4.0|Ok im not gonna review the movie. but the quality. The colors are very more vibrant on the 4k. there is still a lot of grain in the movie but you must remember it is a very old movie. wish it had the special features on it. but for the price it is very cheap. I do believe that the 4k is still a few with years away from being perfect. if you don't mind the special features missing on it then I suggest you go with the 4k has the colors to show a better picture. i also think this technology is still five years from being mastered. if you were looking for a great upgrade then this is not the movie for it. if you do not own this movie then this is the version to buy. now Sony could just figure out a way to make their 4k TVs 240 mhz. but like i said. its a nice upgrade, but if you already own the Blu ray I suggest you wait.
1582701709|2.0|Basically a rehash of most other self-help books. No big new ideas. The author is the the main person profiting by the information in the book as she got you to buy it; thereby, making her richer and able to feel much better about her life. Buddah's followers knew this thousands of years ago. The fact that the book was originally priced at $23.95 and I bought an excellent basically new copy for $1.00 is telling.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Great theory development. The way to approach and understand others are explained in a simple and direct way for anybody
B000022TSH|5.0|should of got it in HD its a little too dark and narrow for flat sreen but a great movie.takes you back to the old LA, dont  know if it comes in HD with out blue ray
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Who doesn't like the minions!!! This game is fun, funny, and challenging!  Move over Temple Run, there's a new minion in town!!!
B004LRVFX4|5.0|This film is at the very top of its genre. It manages to do everything all at once, and the young actors are simply stunning. Elias Koteas lends his underused, drastically underused, gravitas to it, and wait, so too does Richard Jenkins, two actors with amazing gravity and integrity, and they are just not used enough or correctly, but here they are, and they are just circling around the young actors, and then we have a perfect little film. Amazing. If you have any love for this genre, you must watch it. The young actress is phenomenonal, but then so too is the young man. I watch it, and one of the things that strikes me is, will I be able to take the introduction of 'Romeo and Juliet' as a metaphor, that seems forced initially. But the director has it figured out. The young man is going to say he hates it, it is stupid.<br />Win. The last two scenes are simply amazing. Watch it.
B00CKYHH6O|5.0|Any TNG fan will be happy to have Season 4 in this new, stunning format! The writing & character development really started clicking in Season 4. Now the visual effects are what makes watching these episodes almots new again.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Politico thriller with outstanding character acting; one of the best of British drama. Highly recommended and you will not be disappointed.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|The enhanced Blue-ray visual effects are AMAZING. The behind the scenes and actor/character interviews are a lot of fun too!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|My Internet doesn't work well with HD, it keeps buffering through out the movie. I would be happy with non HD movies.
B00ATK02WM|5.0|This movie lasts 177 minutes. If you didn't read the novel this is the best movie for you to know the whole story. All the acting are excellent. A lot of the outdoor scenes and real indoor scenes.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Non-stop action, good plot with a twist in the end, Bruce Willis (and his son) get the crap beat out of them, It was Die Hard all the way.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Of all the hundreds of thousand of native people who died in Thailand (and mostly in Indonesia), it is interesting this movie would choose to depict a white family's ordeal.  That said, the story is compelling and very painful to watch.<br />It is unimaginable what everyone had to go through, how emergency services worked (or not) and how quickly everything had to be set up.  The best and worst sides of humanity appear in a crisis.<br />This movie prompted me to research more about tsunamis.  I did not realize they come in a series of waves instead of in one immense wave.  There was no tsunami warning system set up in that area.  They say they now have one and I hope to God it works.<br />The actors, including the children, were all excellent and definitely a loving family who had their courage tested.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I enjoy this series very much. Just enough drama without being ridiculous. Good acting, believable characters.  It makes me want to visit Downton Abbey.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was a nice surprise. Only complaint is that I want more. Great environment and challenging. I look forward to more rooms.
B000J103PC|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />Co-assistant Andrea \\"Andy\\" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) to her fashion magazine boss Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep)  :  \\"I didn't have a choice.\\"<br /><br />Miranda's response: \\"Oh, no, you chose.  You chose to get ahead.  You want this life, these choices are necessary.\\"<br /><br />The above dialogue is found near the end of this engrossing comedy-drama movie based loosely on Lauren Weisberger's novel \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" (2003).  (\\"Prada\\" is an Italian fashion label.)<br /><br />This movie is the story of a young woman (Hathaway) who wants to fit into a fashion organization, does eventually fit in, and then realizes that she is giving up way too much just to keep fitting in.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot to mention that this movie is hilarious.  The story revolves around Miranda's assistants (the other more experienced assistant is played by Emily Blunt) trying to please her.  Andrea gets help fitting in and other advice from the magazine's Art Director, Nigel (Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />Enough has been said about Streep's superb performance.  As the boss, she indeed plays her character as the \\"devil in high heels\\" with perfection.  Both Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci give stand-out performances as well.<br /><br />The background music in this film is fantastic.  Also look for several cameos such as the novel's author, Lauren Weisberger, Heidi Klum, and Ivanka Trump.<br /><br />This movie was filmed both in New York City and Paris.<br /><br />Having this film set in the fashion world, I felt, was the perfect setting in getting this movie's message across.  Fashion obviously concentrates on the outer person but this movie reminds us that there is an inner person.<br /><br />As well, this movie asks the subtle question:<br /><br />\\"What would you give up and do to get ahead?\\"<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the wide screen edition released in 2006) has several fun and interesting extras.  I personally liked the \\"Gag Reel.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a hilarious movie with a subtle message.<br /><br />\\"That's all.\\"<br /><br />(2006;  1 hr, 45 min. excluding end credits;  wide screen;  36 scenes)<br /><br />XXXXXarious movie with a subtle message.<br /><br />\\"That's all.\\"<br /><br />(2006;  1 hr, 45 min. excluding end credits;  wide screen;  36 scenes)<br /><br />XXXXX
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Intriguing story line and typical Jack Reacher wit and intellect and skill ultimately wins out and allows for &#34;Oh Yeah!&#34; at the end.
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|I love this movie.  I finally decided to purchase a copy.  The cover is different than what is pictured, which isn't really a big deal as long as the movie works, but I just wanted to give future buyers a heads up in case that matters to them.  The dvd also has contrasts issues in my dvd player in the bedroom, but not on my laptop or our dvd player in the family room, kind of annoying, but it is not the product's fault.  Would recommend this movie to anyone! Great for a rainy Saturday afternoon.
0143120530|5.0|This book reads like a novel. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. Foer succeeds in making what might be considered by many a boring subject into an exciting adventure through history to the present on mnemonics and the memory palace tecnic amongst many other modern research findings. What is astonishing is that we learn the secrets of memory training as we follow Foer who considers himself &#34;a young reporter with just an average memory&#34; to train his memory to win the memory championship in the USA. As a psychiatrist and psychotherapist I recognized some of his findings but had never put them together for practical daily use. I have started to do this and am already amazed at how I can remember much better.<br />This is a must read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great example of CG with good writing and plot. My son and I watched and he also concurred that it was one of the funniest he has seen.
B00DUL3VFM|4.0|Classic 90's sci-fi movie. Who doesn't love Kurt Russell, Ancient Egypt, and Space aliens! That formula should go into every Hollywood blockbuster!
B005DJREJS|5.0|Loved the way she handled her awkward moments.  Her facial expressions are priceless.<br />I told all my friends to watch it.<br /><br />Good to watch when you're lonely!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This DVD does not work at all. It is broken and horribly scratched. I am very upset, it is one of my favorite movies and I wasted my money. I feel amazon has let me down.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|I admit that I changed my mind on this one based on other reviews. I allso needed space and already had a pdf. So was deleeted.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|From the moment I started reading this book, it was so hard to put away, I cut down on sleeping to a minimum just so I could read a little more, it's captivating. If you're a fantasy fan, you will love it, no doubt.

B0060MYM3S|2.0|Dvd's came on time. But only came in paper sleeves no case or cover. Bought as very good nothing was said about no case or box set missing. No very happy!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This is a good movie if you don't want too much reality. If youre a picky person about that then you wont like this movie . It is just a fun movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|LOVE THE INTERACTIONS OF CHARACTERS AND HOW THIS SHOW IS WRITTEN TO EXPOSE A LITTLE OF EACH AS THE SHOW PROGRESSES
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is nice to be able  to make one set of notes an  have them b  o whatever device I am using.<br />I also like that I can make  up a meeting agenda on the run and print it out for the meeting for those in attendance.
055357342X|4.0|As the 3rd book in the series, A Storm of Swords is very similar to the way the first book (A Game of Thrones) worked in terms of rythm and structure: starts well, then major changing event happens that is, usually, not for the feint of heart, and then moves on to an ending full of cliffhangers that makes you want to read the following books.<br /><br />If you liked A Game of Thrones and could sustain the healthy amount of treason, backstabbing and killing, then this book is probably for you. If you're fed up with George R. R. Martin's twisted mind, then it's probably not.
B00149C8BK|5.0|If you are a fan of Michael Jackson this is a must have for your collection. Every #1 hit that I remember is on this album. Enjoy!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is become so addicting.  Granted, there are some instances where you can tell the writer is just toying with you and keeps dragging things along to add drama, but it is still so well written and very well acted.  Maggie Smith is a hoot and just keeps getting funnier as the seasons go on.  Love it!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This is a fantastic, imaginative, intriguing, and beautiful film!  The 2-Disc Blu-Ray edition is spectacular, both in picture and sound quality.  There are also several great bonus features, including a short documentary featuring the smart and sexy Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Liked the story line & subject. Disliked the &#34; to be continued&#34; idea,but look forward to reading  Hollow City & other books by Riggs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Seriously too much fun with this game. I play it all the time. I have no complaints about this game. I think it's for all ages and recommend it to everyone
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is really fun to play especially with friends or different people. This game is a must have and it's worth 5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Probably one of the worst books I have ever read and I am pretty pissed that I wasted my money (Will Amazon refund me??).  I don't understand why people like this so much. I didn't think I could dislike a character more than Bella from Twilight. She is so immature and self-depreciating, this is supposed to be the hero of the story?  What a waste of time and a giant step backward for women.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is great to book to while you have some down time.  I would it this again and again. Love it.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Well, I feel I should be writing this review with the Super Mario Bros theme song playing in the background.  HEY HOLLYWEIRD, VIDEO GAMES ARE NOT SCARY!!!!!!!  Mama isn't a horror film, it's not a monster movie, it is a PG-13 fairy tale with no atmosphere and a crappy CGI ghost.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I liked this movie very much but it was a little bit slow. Acting excellent.  Some of the accents a little difficult to understand so I also used captions.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not a page turner, but doesn't have to be with all the different stories and people.<br />Unique, worth reading, makes you think
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Fantastic!  I can't wait to read how everything concludes.  Written very well.  On to the third book.  Might even read the whole thing today.
1442365463|1.0|Abridged. Narration was awful. Find another voice and where is the unabridged edition?<br />I would not recommend this version to anyone,
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|I love the game, but at the start the last chapter in the fourth level it exits the game every time. Please fix glitches!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I love this series.  I love that it takes place in a mystical land and yet it could be Camelot. The differences between good and evil seems to be not such a fine line. The character twists come at you loud and fast, just as you think you have it \\"you don't\\" Book 8 has to come out fast please I can't wait to see were we are going next.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I have a lot of series in my possession, but this is by far one of the best. I loved every episode of this season. Especially the damon and elena and damon and alaric scenes. This show will have you on the edge of your seat. It is worth it.
B0002XMKYE|5.0|Patton is one of those classic films that my family and I never gets tired of watching.  I really believe that this is George C. Scott at his best.
B003L77GH4|5.0|In this season I actually liked Elena. She grew a backbone. Even though you might be a Stefan fan, Damon starts to win you over and he did with me. This show will have you on the edge of you seat. It will keep you wondering &#34;What is going to happen next?&#34; Awesome!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Dislike when the program takes over to control the outcome of the game.  Also dislike when too many of the same<br />Denomination is used to control the game
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Classic book that I read long ago.  I highly recommend reading this one over.  Quite a bit I had forgotten.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Like the title says this is an awesome simple calculater app. Real easy to use with a great memory function the remebers all your previous calculations. And looks great too!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I actually had to watch this movie twice to appreciate the whole plot and sub-plots together.  Very authentic sets and costumes.  It's too bad Spielberg fell into the p.c. trap where all the blacks are portrayed as smart, worldly and educated and all the whites [except of course, for Lincoln]as slow, dumb and greedy. In that respect, the movie could have been any pedantic t.v. commercial.
B00DJXSKWU|5.0|Handles great for an RTS on a mobile gaming platform. Controls are good , graphics are nice , gameplay itself is pretty good. Overall for a dollar I'm quite impressed as RTS games on android generally are horrible (interface). Though the game needs more content, it is promising.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. I can pin my interests and quickly find them later. I actually find pinning to be rather addictive. This is an app for anyone. Its easy to use and fun.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had heard about this book awhile ago and decided to save it for a good read while on vacation in Maine.  I couldn't put it down!  When I had to put it down the characters invaded my thoughts until I could go back to reading again.  Very good read and also informational, I learned about a bit of history I had little knowledge about.  Recommended highly.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|, Love it, works for me, will buy again and recomend, to friends and anemies too, why not , I am neutral.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was at the top of my summer reading list because I wanted to read it before the movie and I am glad that I did.  Now that I see the trailers for the movie i can see the differences between the movie in the book (first off enders age) it was a great story from beginning to end and I recommended it to my sister who also loved it.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|, Love it, works for me, will buy again and recomend, to friends and anemies too, why not , I am neutral.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this awesome game!!!!!!!!!!!(x23865357477557368658638)I am addicted to it .temple run related game. I strongly recommend this awesome game to anyone like me .I know I enjoy the game

B009NQZVKG|4.0|Fast and easy read + very entertaining.  Books follow some old, but also introduces new characters.  I also enjoy the accurately historical elements in the book.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|, Love it, works for me, will buy again and recomend, to friends and anemies too, why not , I am neutral.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I would really recommend this app.  It really makes you think on some of the clues.  It would be cool if you could go head to head with someone as an option in this game
B00BHMF578|5.0|, Love it, works for me, will buy again and recomend, to friends and anemies too, why not , I am neutral.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Book 4 in the Game of Thrones series keeps getting better and better, The plot twists and character development and expansion is well done. Well written!
B0049J0DC8|2.0|I avoided this film for nearly 2 decades. The marketing storm that surrounded the original and subsequent releases was a major turnoff for me, but I finally caved.<br /><br />It was pretty much what I expected - a feature length commercial. It was as though Disney/Pixar had literally run out of ideas for a film, but needed to offload some action figures they already had sitting around. Solution? An animated film built around those action figures.<br /><br />The only real surprise came roughly 20 minutes in, when a child strapped a firecracker to one of the sentient toy soldiers, and blew him up. I've got to give it to Pixar for that detail - I didn't ever expect to see a suicide bombing in a children's film. Well done?<br /><br />2 stars, both for the score by Randy Newman.
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS is a incredible series.  I have every season so far.  As good as it is I can't help wondering how it will pan out when they lose Cote de Pablo.  She is one of the main reasons I watch NCIS.
B009G41CG2|5.0|WORKS GREAT LOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! LOVE TO PLAY THIS GAME AND SO DOES MY WIFE VERY ADICTING LOVE IT LOVE IT
B001AQO3QA|4.0|does not look as awesome as star wars on blu ray but still a good movie but still feels old
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We loved this movie and would highly recommend  it.  Action was great...we were sitting on the edge of the sofa as the plane took off.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|After awhile the videos wouldn't even play at all . This app kept shutting down on me . Also there are no porn ads.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A real page turner...excellent fiction but realistic view of actual events in history...good for all audiences..even hogh school classes studying history
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this book really connected to me as in my teenage mindset and it was a clear sealing to another side of life. I thought this book was very good at exposing and connecting to the teenage mind
B0083Z614S|5.0|Creative and well written. Good for someone who is ill or needs some cheering up. Perfect for children of all ages.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love playing this game. Originally first started playing on Facebook. But than found out I could play it on my daughter's Kindle. Now I play twice as much. Check this game out, I challenge you to beat my score!!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|It has been a great movie with a plot that changed every once in a while and throw you off. Beautiful music, CG scenes and effects at their best and the acting is surprisingly good from Mr. Cruise. Mr. Freeman is as always, exceeding his last movie. He is always good and gives credence to the story.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app for weather conditions of my area,and it's fast and easy to use.  Thanks again for this application. Happy fishing for me.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|There was no way I could connect and watch the movie. I'm so sorry that I got into this that I feel cheated. The time I have spent trying to connect I could have purchased the DVD 3 times over.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It's fun and if you enjoy bubble pop games you will certainly enjoy this one and it has a twist
1607885735|5.0|Every time you read a Baldacci book you feel that it is going to have sequels, like King and Maxwell and the Camel Club&#34;. I'm expecting a sequel to this one. Very good thriller and it carries you through without dropping youat all.  Good Book.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|I really love this game. Every thing about it but one thing. The one thing is that there's only 4 characters, I only wish that it unlimited characters that were hurt or in pain. Otherwise a good game.
0062238868|4.0|A powerful and evocative inside story by Chris Kyle that is made all the more poignant by his untimely death. Well worth having in your library.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Very interesting! Teams was a pioneer but also a very different individual. This history make one wonder what he could have accomplished if he were not taken advantage of all of his life.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game it is very cool.the graphics are great.<br />But there adds<br /><br />Lib  love love love love love this free app FREE
B00EEXPDTM|4.0|Excellent drama. Though it's about a tawdry subject, the production isn't tawdry at all. Amanda Seyfried was courageous to take on this role, and pulls it off. She is believable and evokes empathy for Linda Lovelace. All star cast supports. Watch for James Franco as Hugh Hefner, and Sharon Stone as Linda's mother.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This game is a good game but they can make it much better. All they have to do is<br />Make better sound effects and try not to make it sound nasty.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have seen this collection in all it's reincarnations. This is the best so far, and at a reasonable cost!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining also I love the free scratches they have cuz it just makes you want to play more....also it allows u to be able to play even if u don't want to pay for coins because if u don't win the game u just get points to buy virtual stuff not coins to actually play the game which can be a bummer but still fun...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Amazing game.<br />Tons of fun. Great graphics!!<br />Can't stop playing -<br />missions are fun -<br />hard to get / accumulate gems though.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I really loved this movie. The twist they threw in at the last was great.  I really wasn't expecting that.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm hanging on every scene in every episode.  I don't know why I didn't watch this when it was on the first time.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I enjoyed watching Willis and the &#34;Rock&#34; in this movie. Though, I must say, it wasn't as good as it could've been.
B008XG1X18|1.0|won't use it,  I do not understand what it is, and I have no use for it. Thank you for your help anyway. Thank you Linda
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I'm not certain who won, the good guys or the bad.  This was a &#34; pipe dream&#34; story. If read in a sleepy mood you will miss one or more machinations.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|This is an excellent read, looks like Mr. Le Carre is his old self again. Highly recomand this book for your customers.<br />.
B00EAI94AA|5.0|Aside from stunning visuals throughout, this film is fairy tale in the fullest sense of the word--cruel and relentless, but filled with beauty.  With a troika of amazing performances, it's one you shouldn't miss.  I only wish I'd had an opportunity to see it on the big screen.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down read it in 6 hours can't wait to start the 2nd book! Where has this  series been my entire life!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Oblivion begins with a mystery and ends with a bang, but also a satisfying coda. I saw Oblivion in the theater, but did not fully appreciate it until just now at home. The audio has soft parts, with little more than soft wind blowing and bird chirps. In other places, there are combat explosions and gun fire. The multi-track audio includes the default 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio (48 kHz), other languages in lesser, lossy formats, and a music only track in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (96 kHz). The modern classical music track is another form of enjoyment that BD can bring to your A/V experience. I found the music wonderful, but for the dialog and effects, one must listen to the main audio track. In the theater, the audio was very loud, while at home, one may choose a pleasing volume level to hear the quality in both soft and loud passages.<br /><br />The story spins out in bits. The main part starts with the two main characters, a drone repairman [Cruise's character] and his female comm officer. As it progresses, you come to understand the situation and characters more, although there are apparent dream sequences and/or flashbacks that are not explained at first. Near the end, in a flashback/blackbox replay sense, the arc of the historical story becomes clear. I have a sense of Bob Seeger's words in \\"Against the Wind\\", \\"what to leave in, what to leave out\\" about the pacing and content of the film. The extras include several omitted scenes that are interesting for what they additionally disclose about the story, from which one may consider why they were omitted. The director, Pete Hammond, also directed\\" Tron: Legacy\\" and was a producer for \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\", to give some sense of the quality and sensibility of the movie.<br /><br />The superb story starts simply - perhaps even a minimal, mystical sensibility, with the two main characters. Later another female character is discovered, after which the story starts snowballing. To avoid spoilers, I'll add little more. Yet, in how many movies does a quote from ancient Rome, from \\"Lays of Ancient Rome\\" by Lord Macaulay, \\"how can man die better than facing fearful odds,\\" serve both to educate or remind viewers of ancient Rome and advance the story line? This is a smaller story, rather than a grand tale with a cast of thousands. Yet, this is far more than a summer fun, sci-fi shoot-em-up. From the excellent video [note- the palette is somewhat subdued rather than bright Technicolor, to match the story and dystopian, post-war theme], through the fine story and excellent audio, this one is a keeper in my view. Sci-fi is best when it makes one think of possibilities, and this movie has it in spades.
030758836X|2.0|I am sure some people loved this book. It's just not my type. The writing is fine, but the story is not interesting to me. I don't like reading about self destructive, delusional, arrogant, violent, and hateful people. There are enough real people living in co-dependent and destructive relationships, I don't need to read about fictional ones, especially when they are so full of hate, so mean.<br /><br />This is not a commentary on the value of the book itself, just on my tastes in books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never been into this a type of book. I was told by all of my friends to read it so I decided to give it a try. I am sure glad I did! Had a hard time putting it down.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Great cast , loved the actors , was good choice for night at home with a movie. Has a good story line.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome because it is so fun and  you give us so many things like the fluffy unicorn and so many other things
B00005JNS0|5.0|We liked the movie and just needed a copy for our road trip.  I think the kids watched it twice over the course of 3 days of driving.
B000I9X53W|5.0|I love this movie as a matter of fact I gave it to my sister for her birthday. we have seen this movie lots of time and she was trying to buy it will I saw it online at amazon  yeah amazon  I just love amazon
098357670X|5.0|The author gives a lot of useful tips .<br />This is an excellent book for everybody who want to draw caricatures!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wonderful just what I needed. Yay I love this new alarm clock!  I threw my old clock away. I strongly recommend everyone. try it out.
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|Wow! I stumbled onto  \\"Life is Beautiful\\" and it's must have been one of the most beautiful movies I've ever watched. A touching masterpiece, at the very least.<br />You'll probably laugh. And will likely also cry. But for me, it reached deeper than laughter and tear to touch the very core of humanity and love:<br />Being able to say \\"Life is beautiful\\" in any situation is in itself COURAGE. To not only see hope through destitute and cruelty but to put hope in the lives of others is in itself STRENGTH. To laugh in the face of death to protect a loved one is in itself LOVE. Superb acting, great comic reliefs and a stunning storyline brought new light into one of the most tragic chapters of history. This movie has it all. It penetrates one's mind as lightly as humor often comes yet it reaches deeply and lingers. I was left to marvel at the power of love and perseverance,at the strength and courage.<br />See for yourself how touching it can be!
B005NACYQU|5.0|another great neil gaiman book.  Now to go about researching all those gods he mentioned!<br /><br />(and bizarrely, require additional words for my review to count)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having this available for when I travel and don't have access to my Bible to read.  I haven't used the organization of reading it that is available yet but will when I have more time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOME and AWESOME to get because you can build energy and the best house I was going to not buy it
B006S08RLU|5.0|Amelie is one of the best made films I've seen. This is the film that made me fall in love with Audrey Tautou but I'm sure I'm not alone in that regard. The characters in the film are all great and were well cast. The director's style makes it really special. It is simply one of the best films ever made.
0920668372|5.0|I love this story.  I read it to my kids every night when they were little and loved the time shared with them and try and give this as a baby gift whenever possible.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|I had read that this version of Anna Karenina is a loose interpretation and that is true yet it is still a very well made film. I am a fan of films of this time period and of classic books in general. Not to mention I have a huge crush on Keira Knightley) While I do enjoy catching movie mistakes I do not watch films looking for a reason to dislike them. Quite the opposite for me. I want to like every film I see so I'm not too hard to please. I will buy into unbelievable premises to give a movie a chance. But when I watch a film with great writing, great directing, great acting, great cinematography I can recognize it. When you can get lost in another time, another place and get drawn into the lives and emotions of the on screen characters it is a great experience. I feel that when I watch this version of Anna Karenina.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is very consistent and weaves a great web of generations to show the culture clash. way of thinking over the years. The subject is difficult to explain in simple terms because it never will be. His exposure of individual experience over several time lines is a very effective way of getting the reader to better understand. Thank you.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I played this on my phone and was afraid to turn my character around in case the Slender Man was standing there! I let my kids and grand-kids try it and we all did the same nervous laughter waiting for Slender Man to pop up in our faces. Nervous fun but still fun and who doesn't like to get scared once in awhile!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a much-needed guide, easily understood and intuitive.  Read it through once then use it as a quick reference.
B00005JLEU|5.0|How can a &#34;cartoon movie&#34; be one of the best films I've ever seen? Well if I have to put it in works I'd say it is the very haunting atmosphere the writers, director and artists managed to create. I was grown and had kids of my own the first time I saw it. I was alone when I watched it the first time and it scary! It's hard to describe the sort of scary that it is though. Not a Shining or Excorcist type but maybe more like what's around that next corner type. I would say more but if you haven't seen this before you need to watch it. You won't be disappointed. It is seriously one of the top animated films ever made. The other top animated films just happen to be made by the same man for example Howl's Moving Castle.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|this is a fun game with a cool concept but it has problems such as....<br />the continuous spire release does not work properly for fungus. it is supposed to be a way to infect all countries, including ones with closed boarders, but i don't remember it ever infecting any for sure.<br />cost for mutations increase if you buy an unrelated upgrade. such as buying sneezing raises the price of cysts.<br />it is very hard to earn Dna points when you need them most<br />nearly impossible to win fungus because of difficulty in transmission.<br />the same countries fail to get infected time after time. islands/ Greenland worst about this.<br />almost always either cure research too fast or death rate too quick and one of two causes u to loose.<br />please make easier, I like challenges but this is rediculous! especially on fungus which I have yet to beat
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has so many twisted characters and events.  It was a great read because of its raw honesty, witty humor, and grotesque story of a marriage gone wrong in the most normal way.  Like a train wreck that you can't not watch.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I downloaded this and realized that the reading level is too hard for my grandkids.  It also was kind of boring for me when I tried to play it.  I will be deleting it.

B000FC146C|5.0|Remembering my childhood years means reliving The Thorn Birds.  Every time they played it on TV I watched it.  Now, as an adult, I read it.  And I am once again the child enticed by the story.  Thank you, Colleen!
B00E193TM2|5.0|This is my first 5FDP cd and I couldn't be more pleased.  Like the music and beat.  Great metal !
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Great app and I love all but 1feature, the animation. What this app is lacking is a settings menu that enables you to choose the features you want. I'm constantly frustrated because of having to wait for the spinning numbers animation to finish.and when you are near completion of a puzzle they do it with every number you put in, adding almost 2 seconds or more to each entry. There needs to be a way to turn it off!

B001NHNG64|5.0|AS usual Jack Reacher is great.  He gets himself constantly involved in situations and has to find a way out.  I just enjoy his attitude.
1451695195|4.0|Proof of Heaven is a good read about a near death experience (NDE).  I enjoyed it.  It's a fast read.<br /><br />The important aspect of this book is the medical validation of a NDE as a true experience and not some brain-wave hallucination that several skeptics have tried to suggest.<br /><br />Coming from a neurosurgeon, Eben Alexander explains in medical terms how his NDE was not triggered by a brain manufactured event.<br /><br />It is worth reading.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I've owned these for over a year:<br /><br />Sometimes the buttons stop functioning randomly and won't work until a few hours later or the next day.<br /><br />Recently it started disconnecting itself all of the time.<br /><br />When a microwave is on in the house, the sound gets distorted (seriously). Might not be a con, could be out of logitech's control.<br /><br />The software is just really buggy. It doesn't remember my settings half of the time, and then the buttons keep breaking themselves. I'll press \\"pause\\" and it will raise the volume instead.<br /><br />Positives: Sound quality is decent, I prefer stereo mode to the fake surround. Wireless is amazing with good range.

B000003BZ4|5.0|Some music is just good, but if you never get the opportunity to give it a listen or hear it on the radio, you just don't really know.  I'd heard of Gov't Mule ever since they formed and released their first album in '95, but my travels had taken me to some out of the way places so that I no longer got good (AOR) FM radio options like I did in Dallas/Ft. Worth (KZEW & Q102).  So I missed out and for whatever the reason I never searched 'em out...tyme passed and they just slipped into the shadows for me personally.  As I noted in a earlier review, I purchased Gov't Mule's &#34;Holy Haunted House&#34; recently and was impressed enough that I decided to go back and get the first Gov't Mule release.  I was not disappointed.  I was pleasently surprised as the first track was just a vocal rendition with no instrumentation, but plenty of attitude.  It then takes on a slightly early Black Sabbath feel on track two's &#34;Mother Earth&#34;.  Not the vocals, but the heavy guitar sound.  &#34;Rocking Horse&#34; is another heavy guitar and bass attack with plenty of attitude.  &#34;Monkey Hill&#34; is my personal favorite of the twelve tracks on this release.  The sound is just what I like, kind of a dark heavy feel...great guitar playing throughout.  For those who are interested because of their affiliation with The Allman Brothers Band, this ain't your typical Allman Brothers sound.  It is considerably heavier, but very well compossed.  Warren Haynes is really a very good guitarist, but most likely I'm the only one just figuring that out.  I just arrived a little late to the Party!  The rest of the album is very good, I'm just not going to review each song.  Rock On!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game makes you think a bit but I find my self playing it every day must get!<br />Each thing you find leads to another and soon you are on another level! You will be sorry if you don't get this game!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think that this game is a great way to pass the time. It gives anyone the ability to be a hard core off-roader, one that isn't afraid of breaking his neck every now and then a guy comparable to superman. And in the end after you've upgraded to your super diesel you can go to be d with a feeling of accomplishment. And wake up ready to try again for three and a half hours
0743277708|5.0|He tells me it's one of the best books he has ever read.  \\"It just gets better and better. Great dialog and very descriptive\\", according to my reluctant reader!
B001O9CR3O|1.0|It does not work in US Blu-ray DVD players apparently. So, now I am out my money and have a useless DVD on my hands.<br /><br />Learning: try to test as soon as you get something to avoid getting stuck with it after return period is over.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|The &#34;concert&#34; was a handful of songs around 50 minutes. The second disc was barely an hour. Kind of fizzled after such a great first part of the doc from the 1970s. As expected, Joe Walsh stealing the show. Glen Frey coming across as a substantial informal Richard.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This was a difficult book to read, the format different than I expected but, the characters and the story remain with you long after you read it, and the heartbreak for the mother was just emotionally draining.

B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Interesting movie. Different than what I thought it would be, but very informative. I would recommend it, although I think it's the kind of movie you watch once and then never again.

B0069JBKHI|4.0|My sister recently became a mother, and she wanted something to watch her newborn child. Knowing i was the most tech swavy of the family, she consulted me to find somthing hi-tech. Ive been peeping this particular device before she went into labor, primarily for it's unique wifi feature, that allows one to view , talk, and play music to their baby (or caregiver), regardless of where the parent or viewer is. The baby came sooner then expected, so my sister decided to buy it on her own. Here's the things he likes, and dislikes about it:<br /><br />Likes:<br />-The fact that she can see, talk, and play music (and lights) to her child, regardless if she's at work ( School teacher) or at the supermarket over a 3G, 4G, or WIFI connection.<br />- You can connect it to any wireless network, which means when she brings her over to my house, my mother can set the device next to her. Sometimes they have conversations through the damn box!<br />-Multiple users can view the video feed, but only two at a time. Her husband, and my mother can view the child through their iPhones and iPads.<br />-Included battery, which lasts two hours. Micro usb cable included.<br />-Installation is a breeze<br /><br />Dislikes (At the time of the writing)<br />- Well, only two people can view the video feed at once.<br />- The video delay ranges from 5 seconds to 11 seconds, regardless to whichever connection youre on, you could be upstairs in the bedroom in my house uising the fastest affordable  internet (I have a NETGEAR Wireless A/C router i bought in January, on a Comcast/Xfinity 50mbps internet connection)an youll still have a delay. This is bad when you wanna talk to whomever's watching your baby through the  two-way speaker. Frame rate could be better<br />- Taking it out the packaging (you understand me once you open the retail packging) is harder than breaking the included Micro USB cable. that micro USB port it so easy to break. Use a micro USB from a smartphone instead, and plug it into the wall. '<br />- Included battery ONLY lasts two hours.<br />-Instlation is a breeze, ntill you get the app! it gets GLITCHY! but with a bit of paitence, it will be done, and the monitor will work.<br /><br />So if you have MONEY, and you want the BEST possible way to observe your child, sibling, niece, nephew, godchild, foster child, etc. I suggest you invest in this monitor!o the wall.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|Loved all the mixture of characters in this movie. The story was enjoyable and embraced the wonderful<br />culture of India.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|Aside from the asinine complaints about this CD's dramatic departure from Fall Out Boy's older, more pop-punk-centric sound (not that there's anything wrong with disliking the general sound of the CD--that's a matter of personal taste--but many seemed to automatically dislike this CD solely because it wasn't what they were used to), I have heard many negative statements, from critics and fans alike, citing Folie a Deux's \\"overindulgence.\\" I guess I can understand why some would think of it that way--Folie, while still punk rock, is loaded with pieces of several other genres and features strange instruments not usually associated with punk rock. I know that some people just don't enjoy this type of sound, or think that the genres clash too much to be innovative. Again, it's a matter of personal opinion. Personally, however, I loved all the things they managed to pack into this CD--maybe it's just that I'm a sucker for genre mixes, but I thought the band did a great job of integrating such a wide range of instruments and styles into the songs (warbling auto-tuned vocals, a flamenco riff, R&B, violin medley, screamo) and some of the unusual licks in the songs showed that the band members think very far outside the box of any genre. It was, in my opinion, much more unique and creative that what they'd done in their older CDs, although those were good as well.<br /><br /> Secondly, I believe this CD, better than any other, showcased the strength, versatility and range of Patrick Stump's voice. In the band's earliest records he was holding back so much that his voice came out nasal and lacked vibrato. As time progressed, however, he got more confident and that progress was apparent in his increasingly stronger and clearer voice, and I believe this CD was the peak of that mountain. Throughout the album, he hits some very broad low notes as well as some very high ones and can hold long notes with much more ease than on previous records, while throwing in some vocal acrobatics like those on the band's cover of Michael Jackson's \\"Beat It.\\" Many of his various vocal tones can be heard--soulful, snarkily nasal, bluesy and swingy, powerhouse. Above all, you can hear the confidence and passion in his singing better than ever before.<br /><br /> As for the others: Songwriter Pete Wentz outdid himself completely lyric-wise. While he's always had a talent for clever metaphors and plays-on-words, those he dreamed up for this record seemed more mature, though they lacked the bitter, sarcastic and somewhat self-loathing bite that much of the fanbase loved from their early records. The songs are mainly about such subjects as drug abuse, politics, greed, and society's superficiality, with some double-meanings and allusions, such as the song title \\"27\\" which refers to the 27 Club, a name given to the oddly long list of musicians who have died at age 27 of drug overdose. The guitar and drum parts are brilliant throughout the album and are executed wonderfully.<br /><br /> The only complaint I have to offer is a small one: while normally a CD would have about 5 or 10 seconds of silence between tracks, this one leads straight from the last note of one song to the first note of another, with no break at all. I think even small breaks between songs would have improved<br /><br /> Descriptions of tracks:<br /><br />1. \\"Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes.\\" A light, major-key verse with clear, controlled vocals instantly greets the listener, until the track goes into a percussive anthem that pulls the listener right into the groove. A good introduction to the CD.<br />2. \\"I Don't Care.\\" The lead single of Folie, this lively (yet sardonic), saucily sung track mocks the superficiality and emptiness of so many aspects of modern society.<br />3. \\"She's My Winona.\\" There's a lot of debate about the meaning of this song, but either way it is well-written and you won't be able to keep from moving your head to the music.<br />4. \\"America's Suitehearts.\\" A song aboutcelebrities. Patrick's voice is very clear and broad in this one.<br />5. \\"Headfirst Slide Into Cooperstown On a Bad Bet.\\" Easily one of the strangest on the CD--in a good way. Patrick's voice goes amazingly low on this, and the track starts with a funky beat and then alternates between churning guitar medley and slow, almost-a cappella verses. Very strange lyrics though.<br />6. \\"The (Shipped) Gold Standard.\\" Nothing particularly special compared to the others on the album, but still a great song.<br />7. \\"(Coffee's For Closers).\\" Very percussive--you'll find yourself tapping out the drum beats in no time. Closes out with a nice violin medley.<br />8. \\"What a Catch, Donnie.\\" Very different from the others: almost entirely piano, bluesy vocals and smooth, relaxed drum beats. Listen closely toward the end for a sudden vocal medley...<br />9. \\"27.\\" Definitely one of the strongest on the CD, very fun to listen to but meaningful and a bit dark.<br />10. \\"Tiffany Blews.\\" In a word, addicting. Leads in with a funky vocal-noise rhythm and gets progressively more guitar-oriented, until a sudden break for the warbling auto-tuned part sung by Lil' Wayne. (For those who hate his music: So do I. But trust me, it actually does sound good in this song, you'll see.)<br />11. \\"W.A.M.S.\\" Great track with a flamenco riff and an odd bluesy bit at the end that induces an image of an old blues singer smoking on his porch in a ghost town.<br />12. \\"20 Dollar Nose Bleed.\\" Sounds similar to many of the songs made by similar band Panic! At The Disco on their album \\"Pretty. Odd.\\"<br />13. \\"West Coast Smoker.\\" Another lively and snarky track, with a few seconds of screamo tucked in, closes out the album with a bang.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this album to pretty much anyone who likes any form of rock, or likes genre-bending, or who wants to find some unusual and meaningful music.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|This game looks as good as pussy but if it had all the effects I would give it a 10 star rating.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Most of the novel was, as the sell copy paints it, &#34;unputdownable.&#34;  The ending, however, could have been stronger...the final third of the book pretty much tossed around the same idea.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love this book I read it 6 times  Thank you Jeff Kinney  I read your books every night.  Thanks so much for this book.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very enlightening review of historical references and an insight into the life and times of Jesus the man (not the Christ).  The author could have been more organized in his telling and could have expanded the background information in several areas, but I enjoyed the eye-opening history lesson and was inspired to explore in more depth.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|the only thing i can say is it is very addictive, once i started i thought i would watch one  episode at nite before i went to bed that lasted for 4 or 5 nites then i had to finish up season 1 all at one time and watched the first 7 episodes of season 2 all at once on a sunday then finished the last 2 episodes the next day. i loved it so much that when i found out i could not get it on hulu plus or netflix i subscribed to Amazon prime and have watched the ist episode of season 3 cant wait for the rest to come out.

0385366752|2.0|I just finished this book and could not believe how long and drawn out the story was for such a terrible and unsatisfying ending.  It was clever to create a narrative that made the reader question and modify her feelings about the characters.  But at some point the sickness just became unbelievable.  I know it's fiction, but I like believable fiction.<br /><br />That said, the narrators on the audiobook CDs were fantastic.  Julia Whelan and Kirby Heyborne completely nailed the characters and there were many places where subtle shifts in tone and emphasis were done perfectly.  It was a compelling book to listen to and the voice actors made the characters seem real (until the story became, to me, unreal).  While I'm giving the book only 2 stars due to its content, if you like audiobooks this is a very good \\"listen.\\"<br /><br />SPOILER SECTION<br /><br />One thing that really bothered me was that the book did not hold together factually or logically at the end.  The \\"good guys\\" are completely stymied in their search for evidence that will sink Amy, but the evidence is right in front of them.  She says she was attacked by one person, but the evidence she created and planted all points toward Nick.  How does her story hold together when the fingerprints on the weapon are her husband's but it was someone else who supposedly kidnapped her?  What about Nick's fingerprints on the purse?  There are no fingerprints whatsoever from the person who she claims to be her kidnapper.  It seems to me that these inconsistencies would have been  impossible for her to explain.  Also, it isn't credible that the people she met in Arkansas did not recognize her at some point.  They were spending a lot of time together and watching the TV shows in which Amy's photo was featured.  Amy's story wasn't nearly as airtight as the author asks us to believe.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Excellent condition. I truly enjoy this CD. It has what I expected contained.<br />I'll be back to order more product.<br /><br />Thx
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I saw the author interviewed on the Daily Show and got the book right after.  It is well written and has a lot of good info, although most everything is conjecture since most things written about Jesus were well after the fact.  It was good to get a more &#34;historical&#34; take on the life and times of Jesus.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was a bit dubious when I first read the reviews, before actually reading the book itself. When someone tells me 'this story brought tears to my eyes' I was doubtful and even suspicious. I generally don't find books do that for me more than once or twice in a lifetime of reading good books.<br /><br />This one did. More than that. It was a real eye-opener. My generation has always tended to dismiss the entire German Military Machine as thorough-going dyed-in-the-wool Nazis. Or, if they weren't Nazis, they generally cooperated simply for survival or a quiet life. Clearly, I was wrong and clearly, The German Air Force was in direct opposition to the Nazis and did what they could to save Allied Air Crew from falling into the hands of the Gestapo or S.S.<br /><br />And the story itself. How one German pilot, one day, said to himself, 'enough is enough..!' and not only refused to finish off a badly shot-up B.17., but actually escorted the plane over the German Coastal Batteries and out into the Chanel. And amazingly enough, both pilots survived the war and many, many years later, actually met up again (THAT was the part that brought tears to my eyes..!)<br /><br />I can't speak highly enough about this book. Get it and read and you'll understand why.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Very well written.Consise, condensed, logical. It makes sense and I'm usling it as my base training. My strength grows day by day and it gives me a nice feeling. I highly recommend it.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|A very thought provoking book - it's time for science to step up and see things from a different perspective!  When people embrace this, we will be a much healthier and happier society! The book arrived through my kindle, so it was immediate and I love that! I love that I can make a decision to purchase a book and I can receive it at that time
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Just finished Magic Academy 2 and enjoyed it quite a bit.<br />Good story, nice graphics, appropriate non-intrusive music, good variety of player involvement-<br />(ie: puzzles!)<br /><br />Contrary to the lower reviews there were no bugs, no unsolvable puzzles, no unfindable or unplaceable objects, and the spoken dialogue unfolded like an ensemble audiobook with pictures.  If anything, the people who had trouble with this aspect of the game probably had too much coffee that day or expected arcade game puzzle play.  The game was a nice slow \\"read\\" through an illustrated puzzle book that talks.<br /><br />No walk-through needed although I did use the hints quite a few times.  The logic in a lot of the situations was a little sparse at times-  why certain objects had to be put together with other objects wasn't very clear sometimes, but the on-screen \\"sparkles\\" giving unasked for hints, combined with the (somewhat slow timed availability) hint button got me through.  And anyway, expecting logic in a fantasy magical world would be a bit silly.<br /><br />One thing that was unique to the game, at least in my (probably limited) experience was the ability to open doors and cabinets, pull out drawers and push curtains aside to see inside or behind them.  The fact that there was no timer or \\"points\\" system (other than the \\"achievements\\" for finishing parts of the game) was a welcome change.  It made the game a lot more relaxing than trying to beat a timer or play for maximum \\"stars\\" in a level.<br /><br />I played on a standard Kindle Fire with the brightness turned up all the way (making the hidden objects a lot easier to see), and the graphics were sharp and clear.  The only real problem in the gameplay that I had involved dragging small objects around.  Since the objects stick to your fingertip, it's very difficult to see them sometimes.  And when you're trying to match the shape of a vaguely dark object to either the outline in a list or a vague outline somewhere in thescene, it can lead to a bit of frustration.  No problems with \\"collision detection\\" as noted in some of the lower reviews.  Nothing that couldn't be placed in the right spot eventually.  It's just a matter of finding the right spot to drop things into.<br /><br />I can't imagine playing this game on a cell-phone screen, unless maybe you use a jeweler's loupe or big magnifying glass, but that's true of most hidden object games.<br /><br />All in all, fun game, wish there was more of it.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Just finished watching this movie for the first time and felt it was absolutely necessary to comment on it right away.<br />This film is very well done and the storyline is close to home on many levels.<br />Wow!
B00CHILW64|5.0|Although there were many news stories about the tsunami, watching this movie gave me a better understanding of how devastating the tsunami really was. Difficult to watch at times, the ending was truly 'the impossible' ---and inspiring.

B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie and its message. Adults can enjoy as much as kids. here are six more words added.
B00COMLLX2|3.0|It was ok. Either the screen doesn't react fact enough or it freezes on my kindle to make the ticks move on the machine to bounce the balls back into the game. See for your self.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is far better than the sequel, as is often the case.  three more words
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use it mainly to see what is going on in the world before calling it a night. Work makes it difficult to watch the news. I would recommend.
0812992792|2.0|This is a case of too much hype about THE ORPHAN MASTER'S SON, too much exclamation about how great it is, too much insistence that it will be the best book I ever read. I expected too much; therefore, I'm disappointed.<br /><br />The book is about North Korea. The writing is choppy. As a result, I thought throughout that I was missing something as I tried to get a handle on the orphan master's son, Pac Jun Do.<br /><br />I know for sure that Pac Jun Do is a master liar. But I couldn't tell for a long time whether he was a good guy or a bad guy. Now I think that while he was younger and into adulthood he just went with the flow, accepting his lot and behaving as he was expected to. But he gradually came to think differently. Still it's choppy. So I'm not sure.<br /><br />The story gets better when Jun Do is part of a delegation traveling to Texas. But the reason he goes with the North Korean officials is never clearly sated. He doesn't seem sure himself.<br /><br />When he returns to North Korea, he comes home to the hideous. It gets worse. Frankly, it was so awful I could read only so much until I had to put the book down and take a break.<br /><br />In my opinion, someone did some great marketing of this book and put out there some stupendous reader reviews that really sold the book to a lot of readers who believed them. In reality, it's difficult to follow. It is hard to tell if description is imagined or true. The writing is clumsy. First Jun Do is here, then he's there, then you can't tell where the heck he is. Too much is left unsaid, left to the reader's imagination. Yet torture scenes are described in awful detail.<br /><br />I didn't like this book at all. If you still want to read it, borrow it from the library; don't buy it. That way, even though you'll waste time, you at least won't waste money.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|I use it mainly to find out quickly about a subject that would give me a headache if I stopped to think about and remember. It is useful.
B0050VA428|4.0|It was very mysterious, and I definitely could have never guessed what happened at the end! Fun to read! (:
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Does make u think. Not addicting but makes you really think of combinations of words. The only th ok by is it doesn't let you skip. The hints are worth coins.
B005LAIHRC|4.0|Definitely for mature audiences, but I have to hand it to Tom Cruise (I am not a fan), he does a mean Bret MIchaels impression and if that is him signing, well, he rocks it. Weakest link: The two sappy leads. The rest of the cast is spot on...
B008XG1X18|5.0|My gosh this is addicting. So many crafts and ideas. I really enjoy looking thru and using some of the ideas for myself. I definetly recommend this!
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Even though the next in the pre-sequel is about to go on DVD, I hope they are busy making MORE, MORE, MORE!  The casting is unbelievable and this will be watched way more than once or twice.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It has been a long time since a book has been able to surprise me the way this one did. I do not want to say more than that and spoil it for anyone else. The ending was a little anti-climactic. Otherwise it would get five stars.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed this even more than the first one. Wonderful writing. I'm very impressed with the creativity. Couldn't put it down.
B00D56GJCE|5.0|I had heard such good reviews of this show, but thought the whole \\"one girl plays multiple characters\\" thing was really stupid and stayed away from it. I thought it would be a gimmick and silly. How wrong I was. Tatiana Maslany's performance in this show is mind blowing. Each of her characters doesn't just have say a different hair color--they have wholly separate personalities and ways of simply moving. They walk and sit differently. Not once when watching was I pulled out of the story and think that it was ridiculous. Tatiana's acting is simply superb.<br /><br />I thought about several mainstream Hollywood actresses, and wondered if they could even possibly begin to pull Tatiana's characters off--and got nothing. Tatiana isn't just an incredible actress but she has a remarkably physical androgyny that is crucial to her being believable as different people. Not that she isn't pretty--she is, but it's almost like she's a blank slate. Distinctive yet malleable. This show wouldn't have a snowball's chance in Hades of succeeding without her.<br /><br />Moving on from Tatiana though, this show has a really fun plot as well. It's sci-fi in a way that I've never seen been done before. The sci-fi exists simply to move the plot forward. It's the basis of the show, but not really the point of the show. Sure, it's the big mystery--but the drama and meaningful plots all come from the people involved. It's a means to an end, and allows the freedom for this show to cross major boundaries. It's Desperate Housewives meets Bionic Woman while hanging out with Continuum and Lost Girl. It's drama, sci-fi, comedy, a cop show, an action show etc...<br /><br />I also need to mention that the method of filming was quite nice as well. It changes depending on which of the characters is on screen. It's subtle, but there and helps to establish character as well as the mood.<br /><br />Really engaging, really fun. Recommended for any discerning viewers out there who want to watch one of the best shows of 2013. (Heads up to any parents out there though, it does contain graphic violence, nudity/sex scenes, and explicit self-harming so this might not be something for the kids. It really doesn't have a lot of all of that--but know that it's there.)est shows of 2013.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great imagination and attention to detail. Held my interest all the way through. Could picture every scene with the great detail.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|A friend told me about Suits and even though she said it was great I was rather skeptical given her brief description of the show. I have found its a show that's hard to describe but entertaining to watch. I liked the first season better but not by much. I would recommend this show to friends (and strangers apparently).
B0097C8XL0|4.0|my daughter loves the game. however, for me, I tend to get nauseous when trying to play it. she's happy though!
B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this game it is the greatest game I've ever had.i t was one of the first games of mine.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Having 'ate what I killed' (google this altucher quote if you don't know it) for the last 13 years, I fully subscribe to what James covers here. It captures his own evolution to grounding life with gratitude, health, balance, intrinsic over material and forms all into a rallying call for artists and entrepreneurs to awaken from the cubicle.<br /><br />His style is humorous and readable, sometimes laugh-out-loud but more often with an acerbic edge. Sometimes the US-centric themes are a little grating but my quibble (and its not to be taken as a deal-breaker) is that the points are well-made 60% through and yet get we have some fill to wade through in the last part. This is much better than in previous books (and in fact James refers to his editor in the latter sections - fill) but I still felt a few hours of my time were stolen from me. :-)<br /><br />So more a 3 1/2 star from me. A great read for those that haven't taken the step and a good reminder for those on the path.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|love it, I have a tendency to play for a few hours when I play it. In fact, this is what I do while sitting in class for probation.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|VERY elementary reading with a very stupid young female and a demented pervert of a man.  Boring, ugh!  I want to finish it quickly and get on to some good mystery fiction or a good biography.  Tough reading.
B00634GHJA|4.0|Quick and easy even for someone who knows nothing about electronics....only thing is that it transfers so quickly that I don't have a chance to check to see what picture I am transferring as I don't have all my pics titled. Once I click on a picture, it goes on there very fast.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Morgan Freeman is always a draw for me when it comes to movies.  But, I was surprised to enjoy Tom Cruise's performance in Oblivion.  There were no plot holes for me. Would I have questioned my own reality in Jack's place?  Hard to say.  There was a wrongness in the feel about his relationship with Tiva from the beginning, the feeling they somehow did not belong together.<br /><br />The climax pulled everything together.  The writers did a good job of taking you down one path and then questioning preconceptions.  Well done.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Prometheus, that Greek Titan god fabled for bringing mankind fire, for partaking in the creation of mankind.  The title of director Ridley Scott's Alien prequel says a lot doesn't it?  And (good) science fiction has long explored epistemological and moral questions and implications and \\"Prometheus\\" does so (much better in the director's cut than the theatrical version I might add) but...yes, there's a but...<br /><br />But even though the special effects are grand, even though we get some eerie and tense moments (a la \\"Alien\\"), and even though this movie purports an unsettling discovery that will give man epistemological answers at least for the Alien universe, it doesn't quite satisfy in the end.  It leaves you scratching your head and asking \\"what\\" and \\"is that what all of this build up was all about?\\"  The cast of very fine, capable, and attractive actors (among them Noomi Rapace whose character lends the film it's more historically spiritual roots, Charlize Theron whose character is a cypher for all that is vain and surface and material, Idris Elba whose character appears to be set up to display the earthiness of mankind as an agnostic pragmatist, and Michael Fassbender as the robot David--a facsimile of a man who is close to man's own heart in his programming to search for what is godlike) give dedicated performances but the script unfortunately scatters them so they do not gel, at least not at the appropriate times.  It's certainly not their fault.<br /><br />So it was with some disappointment due to so much promise that \\"Prometheus\\" didn't bring us the fire that we were perhaps expecting.  But if we can see it with new eyes, over again, might we see more?<br /><br />3.75 stars.
B00DM0YE9S|4.0|Ed Harris is always good...period, end of sentence. The story line is based on true events and Duchoveny is a convincingly unlikeable character. Surprising end with a twist.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed, I cried, but mostly, I believed these characters.  I love a book that makes me want to meet the characters, that makes me sad they are not real. Like Hazel, I really want to know what happens after the novel ends.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Excellent throughout. No lagging story lines...holds  your attention throughout. One of the best that I've seen in a very long time.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I'm sorry Charlaine Harris, but the final book was disappointing. Well written, of course, as always. I had to finish the series and I had to finish the book but, at the end, I was very unhappy with the result.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|As others have said, not too hard but not too easy either. A good game for waiting in the doctors office or similar situation
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun all day long. great game. I cant stop playing it every day. every day I. want to play it
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|This is classic Vince Gill.  The song choices are great and the vocals are amazing.  Vince shines on this CD!!!  If you love Vince then I'd pick this one up!!!
0316228532|2.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter who loves Harry Potter. She was disappointed with this. I asked why she said this just isn't her genera.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|This is a hard-hitting, well-documented book. Mr. Spencer lays out the unadulterated facts and pulls no punches in doing so. If you want to know the truths about Islam that others are not, for reasons of fear or political correctness (or both), then read this book.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Very nice gameplay a little glitchy I have found but very fun keep up the good work glu mobile Inc.  :)
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Games drop constantly and the UI is unresponsive and often confusing of what it wants you to do. The fact that you essentially need to BUY points to actually play makes it additionally frustrating and a waste of time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was interesting from the beginning. I'm half way through and can't put it down. Won't watch the movie until the end.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Trite but in this case true. Very absorbing story line with a touch of chilly realism.  Take this one on vacation!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not a bad book at all. Very readable and entertaining.<br />Mind you, a bit gory at times for the age group.<br />Has a deeper message conveyed in it, and all in all much better than a lot of the muck that is suggested these days for teenagers.<br />Highly recommended.
B009ZQJ0ME|4.0|The influences of the time period during which this film was released are obvious and interesting.  It's worth a watch if you enjoy 90's action and overt &#34;resist the fascists!!!&#34; style fiction.  Those three exclamation points were necessary.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|There's action, good special effects and a lot of good one liners, but it lacks a real story line like some of the individual movies. Not enough heart to make it worth purchasing. I got it free with Prime so no big deal.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Sigourney Weaver...at  her magnificent best  . Plus  a well written and well directed story line.  film making very near the absolute top.  it would be hard to imagine a better, or stronger storyline.  and absolutely no human could have done a better job in the role.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loveeeed it. Awesome. It was such a cute love story. Definitely recommend it. I so need a man like Connor.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|This movie is a must see even if you don't want to see it the second time. Whitney Houston is at her peak vocally as well as professionally and the songs she performs are off the charts GREAT!!!! The acting is supurb as well...how can you miss with Kevin Costner? Very beleivable story because the acting is believable! I have it in my movie library to show my grandchildren when they can appreciate the significance of the talent this movie protrays.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Brought together all the charm and drama of each of the super heroes while keeping them as individuals with their own quirks.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very active game. No dull moments. My whole family enjoys playing game. As fun as expected. I definitely recommend this game. It will keep you entertained .
B00DW39B2K|5.0|A must see!  It is not this often you get to see a good movie like this!  Worth the price!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I want more songs from her. Great, unique voice that makes me look forward to her next album. Buy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i liked it a lot it was a great game,  I played it all at once and it was really entertaining!
B005KELW26|4.0|Solid neutral purple case which appears to be quality. I do not shop on line and got caught paying more for shipping than I felt was fair.
B005M5PENG|5.0|Having jumped into HI - 5-O in the middle of their second season, we absolutely had to watch all of season 1 - of course.  The characters and actors blend really well together - the team of writers continuously touch on various issues.  Although we now laugh and say - &#34;Hmmm....it doesn't market Hawaii very well - since there's always a murder - kinda like it's a mini-LA!&#34;, lol - but, we know it's entertainment.  The on-location shots of the islands are gorgeous and we all hope one day to visit.  Each episode from day one, has carried into the next episode - and we also like how future episodes use previous story lines and characters - which goes to show how many scenarios are interlinked!  Makes for great writing.  We can't wait for the new season to start!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|This is one of my top ten favorites. I have loved this movie since I first saw it. If  had to pick on of my favorite scenes, it would be in the waiting room to see there case work and the man with the shrunken head and big eyes! I laugh ever time I watch it! This is one of the movies I go to when I'm sad or just need to laugh. Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!
B00C2C637I|2.0|read the whole book......could not get into it.  I don't care for his style of writing.  I'll have to try some of his other novels.
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|Very well done, A great representation if a horror classic. The film was in focus and the sound matched the lips on the screen.
B00005N6KG|2.0|Bought these because I thought they may be a good alternative to ear buds for running, biking, and exercising. The two major flaws are: the over the head design interferes with putting sunglasses on top of your head.  The second flaw is that the design creates wind noise and relatively low speeds on the bike.  Also the price of forty bucks is outrageous.  I think the seller is manipulating the amazon system by selling something that earned high ratings when it was cheap then quadrupling the price.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|All protagonists were great.  Had adventure, mystery, love story, and shoot out.  What more can you want?  Loved it. Acting was fantastic.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great app, always has the precise weather to know what to expect for the week and weekend. The weather alerts are very useful and informative. Will recommend to others. The format is easy to read for those with less than great eye sight. Layout is easy to navigate, again great app.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|So fun officially addicted to This game. The new upgrade for the kindle fire makes it so much easier to navigate.
B00E193TM2|5.0|Didn't like the fact that there is like two of every song but its still great stuff, totally recommend it
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Very good app. Starts off extremely easy and get harder and harder with each level. It's easy to play with a group of friends. Have competitions and see who can beat the game first.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Intelligent and full of suspense, it has a few detours, not always justifiable. One thing is for sure - after completing this novel, you will know everything about Aborigines in Australia and then some... Still, it was absolutely worth the time, as the book is pulling you into the story, providing you that familiar Harry Hole feeling again. Great debut for an iconic series.
B005LLSZNM|4.0|This is one of the best series on television these days. Good acting, plenty of action, or should I say, violence? 4 Stars.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first and I was surprised that it followed the book so closely. The book is better but its refreshing when they don't make major changes with film versions :)
1118488768|5.0|I don't like salesmen. I don't like receiving a pitch. I HATE people who sell me things with buzzwords.<br /><br />A few months ago, I was elected to become my company's social media presence. We're a small business with a really small staff. We don't have the money-power to throw at advertisers and old marketing. So we focus on building relationships. That's what I like about David Meerman Scott. His mindset is the same. I'm only through half of the book, and I already have dozens of notes and ideas to bring to my company.<br /><br />There's a reason why newspapers are dying. This is what works to people who grew up with the internet.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Trust me, this game is amazing. And addicting. My best friend had told me about it, but I had been unable to get the PC version. So guess what? I got this, and its awesome. Currently I'm working on a hidden underground mansion, beneath an ancient temple that I'd built. Seems pretty great, huh? Yup.<br />So why did I give it five stars? Because:<br />The updates are slow. No offense, to anyone, but I would LOVE to have the updates for pocket minecraft in the Amazon appstore way sooner. Really, it'd be nice. (HINT HINT)<br />Anyway, that's my review for this. Now stop reading this, and go get  'em! Er, the app, I mean. =^-^=
B00D611UMM|5.0|When I first heard that Alison Moyet had a new CD out I was curious to know whether she had returned to the sound she had in the 80s. I wan't disappointed. This is a must hear! Simply put, it's beautiful. I strongly recommend it to any who loved 'Alf' or any of her early material.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Kind of odd but managed to keep my 5yr olds attention for the most part an kept you laughing  liked the music an graphics I'll watch anything George Lopez is in
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so insanely addictive and fun that it was almost impossible for me set it down! Even when I was on vacation!!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Seems to work well...of course the weather forecasts were ever accurate it would be great! Works good for radar display.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is like watching history unfold before your eyes - cinematography is just breathtaking - and the jewelry and clothes - WOW!
B00BB8V2V6|4.0|Timothy Hutton, Uma Thurman, Mira Sorvino and a very young Natalie Portman. An enjoyable movie that hints at the old adage, &#34;you can't go home again&#34;.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|A truly great book and like most books, much better than the movie. I highly recommend this book for anyone.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|At the ripe old age of 51, I am a Despicable Me junkie. These movies are both fun and funny, with decent plots, good animation, and very likeable characters. The sequel does, however, have more of an adult theme. Stealing the moon is a concept a six-year-old could understand, but preventing chemical warfare is a bit more of a complex idea. Additionally, there are many references to music and culture from the 60's-80's that would be lost on children, or even teenagers. But, for those of us grandparents who watch with the kids, it was a truly enjoyable experience.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I personally don't really care for the facebook app. The lay out is bad. I hate having to use my finger to look at other posts. It is too easy to \\"like\\" something be accident. If you are scrolling down and you accidentally hit the like button, it will say that you liked that post. I also hate that notifications keep on popping up, it gets annoying.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a show since \\"Breaking Bad\\" and \\"Bates Motel\\". So well written and casted. Can't get enough.
0545586178|4.0|This book is extremely good! If you liked the first book, you have to read this book. It takes place a few months after the hunger games. I will say one thing, it is way more twisted than the first. Just read the book, you will know what I mean. :)
B000GCFG7E|3.0|Not the best not the worst i've read of Reacher. Will continue reading though! Why 5 more words to write!!???
B006LSZECO|5.0|this is a great novel, new and interesting. She uses great analogies.  I am anxious for any new work from Gillian.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Dragonvale keeps deleting my game. It's happened twice. I get like level 23, then it all goes missing making me start all over. Facebook doesn't save it so don't try.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books.  I loved the Kite Runner but I love this one even more.  An amazing story about women in Afghanistan.  It gave me an entirely new perspective and made me realize how incredibly fortunate most of us are.  This book is a must read.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I absolutely love this series!  I totally love this show! Love the characters! Best show I've seen in a long time!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Fun game with still a few glitches. Graphics are beautiful. Easy to play the game without spending a lot of real money.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I read many WWII related books and am selective as to what i choose.<br />You will find this an easy read, well written, and a veryt enjoyable read.  The actual story is amazing in itself, and with such input from the key players it is you fely like yopu were there in many cases.  Once again it is clear hitler had little support amoung many of the actual fighting men. The only sad part is to think most of this generation has passed on and not all had a chance to tell their own stories.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|Who doesn't love Bocelli?!  This DVD is great because you have some insight into his personality while still enjoying the his  magnificent voice.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This is a fun game. Would be funny if the faces had expressions. Lol! Mad if you had a draw four. Or even little sayings you can put in.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Really wonderful device, and the new software interface is very clear and informative. The device itself is tiny, weighs hardly anything at all, and measures the following: steps taken, distance traveled on foot, height climbed on foot, calories burned, and heart rate (by a nifty optical sensor on the rear of the unit). It also tracks sleep, and the sleep display is particularly informative. I wholeheartedly recommend it.<br /><br />Two usage points:<br /><br />1. I keep it in a coin purse in my pocket, so I don't lose it. (I don't have coins in the purse, I think they'd be hard on the screen.) The unit is so light and small, it'd be easy to forget about and put through the laundry, which I don't think it would survive.<br /><br />2. When taking my pulse, I hold the unit between my forefinger on the back and my thumb, lightly, on the front screen. That keeps the unit still relative to my finger for the pulse measurement. If you hold it in one hand, and place the finger on your other hand on the sensor, then you have to sit still and not have shaky hands, or the measurement goes wrong. Holding it with one hand, thumb and forefinger, and keeping that hand relaxed, I can get reliable heart rate measurements even while I am running.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. there are so many games to play in just one app. I love it that it gives you 250,000 points just for rating it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is so much fun. How could anyone not like it:). Sooooooooo funnnnnnnnn<br />So dispicicable awsome. Amazing and contagues get ittt.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Awesome pack to keep the 8 discs very organized. Although the discs are not from a complete set, it has the 8 movies and that's what matters to me.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Incredible read! The story of Steve Jobs is both inspiring and cautionary. His desire and willingness to have his biography presented &#34;warts and all&#34; adds an exclamation point to his impressive legacy.
B009JBZH54|5.0|That's it. Very happy. I waited for the three movies to come out to buy them in one set. Not disappointed.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|As a Baby boomer I'm always looking for simpler apps,this is one of them.<br />I was able to .an  my way around I  in just a short time.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|I got this mount even though I wanted something for a yoke mount, but couldn't find anything so I got the handlebar mount for my Galaxy S4. Works well, but I didn't like the mount on my bar and found a Yoke nut mount I liked better. Nothing wrong with this mount, just not my preference.
B000FBJG04|5.0|None of us show enough respect and gratitude towards the men who defend our country and after reading this book I much more fully realize the toughness of our soldiers. The conditions in which they were forced to live is more than most anyone could survive but couple that with artillery, rifle fire from infantry, snipers, tanks, planes, etc. True soldiers are a different breed altogether and ALL U.S. citizens show honor them or leave for another country if they do not support what they are doing.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Liked it.  Acting was good as was the special effects.  Not a huge fan normally of Tom Cruise, but so far I liked this and Jack Reacher.
B003M6OW4Y|4.0|I was very different and fun to watch,.  Sorry there was not more of them.  But if you like Joss Whedon, you will enjoy this series,.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is life-changing and has healed my food addiction. All if the information is so easy to follow and isn't overwhelming!
034580404X|4.0|Great trilogy!  Easy read.  Lending product to my friends!  Sexy, over the top!  Great condition!  Looking forward to the movie version!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this game is okay. You can get hooked onto this game well at least I did. I think you should get this game if you have a lot of time to waste.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Soothing game to play if monotonous. It will keep your attention for a while but you hit a wall within a two to three days if you aren't willing to pay for the extra storage to meet the absurd five-digit seed and nectar minimums.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Lots of childish humor, but also lots of punchlines thrown in for the adults watching. We catch new things each time we watch it as a family. Also love all the extra features such as mini-movies and seeing the actors and actresses who voiced the characters.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My two year old lives this app, and I like there are no pop ups so she doesn't accidentally buy anything.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|works good helps me sleep, very relaxing with a variety of sounds . I would recommend it to any one that has trouble sleeping.
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|Compared to some previous albums by this artist I was hugely disappointed in this album - especially with the overly lush orchestral accompaniments.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is an awesome book that delves into the genius mind of Tesla. His tenacity and ingenuity are explained and is inspiring.
B0049D1TCM|5.0|Glad I bought this fun cd I recommend it to people who like her radio songs, the rest of the cd is similar to real surprises.
0802473156|4.0|have not gotten thru all of it yet but what we have read is very special and hopefully the rest will be the same
0143036742|3.0|The tone of this tomb changes throughout so as to catch the reader either going from more interested to less interested and vice versa throughout.  There are parts I liked and parts I was positively bored with, and didn't we already read through a part like this already, why are we reading another part just like that other part?  Anyway, at some point it all ends.  And I think I rather liked a few parts of it but could have done without a lot of other parts.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is an outstanding chronology of the evolution of the rock music business and recording techniques from the 60's through the 80's.  Great interviews with the Classic Rock icons.  Highly recommended.
068815333X|5.0|I enjoyed this book (my third Lehane).  My only issue is that I never wanted to put the book down.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is not a typical book for me, but I enjoyed all the Hunger Game books. I have not read other Suzanne Collins books.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|It was a great wrap up to the Indiana Jones series and was happy to see Karen Allen back. Great movie.
0805047905|5.0|This book was recommended by my child's day care. This is a wonderful book and she loves all the colorful drawing in the book. She at least wants me to read this book once a day.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I never thought I'd see Batman like this. And what a surprise ending (no I won't spoil it for everyone who hasn't seen it).
B004V9MU86|5.0|A read that you don't quite expect but a book that you will not be able to put down. You really get into the characters of this book and don't want it to end.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Anything D A is of interest to me. So glad to get the first two episodes, especially the English version. I have been very busy all summer so come fall I shall be watching them. A good refresher course. It will be nice to stop and rewind what I missed the first time. There is always something that slips past while watching!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this is  a great app. fun to play..really makes you think.<br />i would recommend this app. &ccedil;ute and fun to play.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|AWESOME!! What a season! Great show!!!! This is one of the best shows I've watched in a long time. Several stories happening at one time but not too many to keep up with. Love! Love!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautifully written, directed, acted. Sometimes I feel like I'm watching a living painting. Rich characters, complex storylines. Believable acting. I am heartbroken after the finale because of how attached I am to the characters.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is one of Nicholas Sparks better books. Can not wait for the movie to come out. I will go see it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Everything about this show is fantastic . The acting, the writing ,the cast are all wonderful. And I love the humor.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I found the information was no where near what I expected.  It would be nice to have the Candy Crush game for Kindle Fire.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is much more than just another hidden object game. Not too easy for those that play a lot of hidden object games
B004D0YB4Y|3.0|Why can't there be samples for this CD?  I like to hear a bit of each song on a CD before I will buy it. Hey Mr. Charles Bradley... that's why it is so Hard To Make It In America.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|Awesome show. Very entertaining, somewhat accurate legally, and you grow to like the characters very much. Harvey ends up stealing the show
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|I had the feeling it was getting to be ten to Midnight and the author was getting really, really tired of the story, of writing and wanted to turn in the MS and be done with it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A slow-ish start, but when the momentum picked up,I was hooked.  This is the first book in a long time that made me ignore all my other responsibilities so that I could stay with the characters that Hoover knows.  The only negative is that her editor let her down on some simple grammar rules-- that, I found jarring.  A really good read!
1878424319|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone who is interested in the success of their lives.  I have sent copies of this book to my grandchildren and am hoping they take the time to read it.  I will be ordering the Fifth Agreement very soon.  These are books that a person can read over and over and get new benefits each time they read these books.  I recommend this book for everyone but especially young people who are seekers.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It was a good book, I would recommend it.  This book made me realize to be grateful for my family.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Very well done movie about a studio I had always heard about but didn't know the history. The new song collaborations at the end of the movie are great as well.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was completely surprised by this book. I guess I expected it to be a dry documentary but it was more an exposé into the the inner workings of geniuses and the comparisons of great men and women in our history. Speaking of history, I am not just a little upset that I had to be 58 years old before I was taught the history of a man that until I read this book I only barley knew his name. Mr Patrick I enjoyed your writing style and your insight into men like J. P. Morgan and Westinghouse and the moral differences between men like these, who were by all outward appearances very successful  and obviously wealthy, and men like Tesla who will get their rewards that will last forever.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|It's a fun game, but the gene research roulette game that gets access and evolves dinosaurs kills most of the fun.  I will not pay real money any more for in game extras because of that.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|it was a fun fast moving musical movie. I would recommend it to my friends and family to watch anytime
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Versatile and very useful. I have it installed on my tablet, smart phone, work desktop, and home desktop.  The article clipping feature is very useful.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Can't get any better. It's as simple or complex as you make it. UI is great. Portability is great. Use it for to-do lists or class notes. Make separate notebooks or just write notes as you think of them - they'll order themselves by date. There is absolutely nothing I can think of that is wrong with Evernote on any platform.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Kids love using it. Easy to use.  Simple interface, cann't ask for more.  A+<br />A great simple tool to maintain motivated students in class.
B006Z20976|5.0|I had watched the movie several times before I bought the Collector's Edition.  Watching the making of the movie and watching the movie with commentary is GREAT.  These are the best &#34;extras&#34; along with the funny segments.  It gave me such an appreciation for the ministry of the movie, the people behind the scenes, and additional information that enhances the enjoyment of the movie when I watched it again.  It is fun to get to know the people involved with the movie and almost makes a person feel part of it.  The only way to buy this type of movie is with the extras.  They are so fun to watch and worth the purchase price alone.  It is such a joy to watch a clean Christian movie and to be able to laugh at good clean humor too.  The only truly valuable movies for me are those with the message of redemption and hope which this has.
B0033WDCRA|4.0|Some of the music from this stuck with me, over the years, from when it was released. So I recently bought this cd. It seems to have been redone in many ways, from the original release, but I still enjoyed it. The lyrics tell of many stories, you can understand the lyrics, & the lead voice reminds me of Queen to a degree.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I found it to be rather tedious.  It was a very narrow segment of the life of our greatest president.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|very nice packet good details great movies<br />i got it for avery good price theres nothing to complain about love it
B00BR9VW32|5.0|I love Tina Fey! Her book is laugh out loud funny. It's an easy read, great for relaxing. She writes about her childhood and career.
0345444051|5.0|Awesome book if you like sci fi, I will say that when you are done with this book you will keep thinking about it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|it has made my reading experience so much more pleasant and I am sure that I will be doing more reading in the future because of this kindle
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Was having problems with Adobe reader. Ez PDF reader was available worked great right away, problem solved. This is a good ap.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This is the book for you. Phillipa Gregory has done it again. And the new STARZ series is great. I watched the first episode last night and then read this book. I have read all of her books and this one is just as good. Get it.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|How fun!  I actually got this for my 3 small terriers, who don't like deep water, but like to put their legs in and lay down in cool water at the lake, so I thought I'd try it. The slide actually makes a nice back rest, I can sit and read against it.  My good friend's kids (4 and 2) came over today, and were really putting it to the test. Diving, jumping, rolling, and the think held really well. No holes or tears after terrier paws and 2 boys.  Contrary to other reviewers, mine did not arrive with holes or tears in it. Things I love about this product; 1) attaches to your hose to create an adjustable water spray around the periphery. 2) drainage holes for the water, 3) lots of fun little toys and such included.4) really shallow sides, not hard to get into for the little ones (human or canine:).  Things I don't love 1) I have a love/hate relationship with the size....it's REALLY big for an inflatable pool.  Make sure you have a nice big space to devote.  2) Blowing it up could potentially be a chore.  I have a Kirby attachment that blew it up in about a minute, but you really would have to have an electric blower of some sort.  It would take you a year to blow it up by mouth. Plus, between the toys, pool base, slide, slide bottom, railings, there are 11 different areas to blow up.  Overall, this is a really fun, campy product!
B002SJIO5E|2.0|I watched this again recently getting ready to see Elysium.  I still don't get it.  The short film it was based on was very clear in tone and story but this still feels somehow disjointed.  Now it could just have been my expectations when it came out.  I was so excited to see something like it, but it just fell flat.  The VFX are great.  Editing is awesome and Sholto Coupley does a wonder job...just wanted a more direct storyline.
B00BHU261S|3.0|I'm not sure if the fact that I had different expectations going into watching this film whether that unfairly influenced my overall opinion of this film.  I realized this was a story about Hitchcock himself, but I still subconsciously expected more suspense.<br />Anthony Hopkins really was very good, and some of the story of Hitchcock was really interesting.<br /><br />But overall the film progressed rather slowly for me.
B00634GHJA|1.0|Can this be removed from my account, I don't want this I thought I was getting a game wrong app.
B00C7LB20C|4.0|I don't know why the reviews weren't better for Erased.<br /><br />The movie was suspensful.  It was also very intense. I never found myself bored with the story line. The plot developed nicely. If you like a good suspense film that is hard hitting, you'll definitely enjoy Erased.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Getting rid of fear is the biggest part of reading this book for me.  I love his Spiritual out look at life/death.  Wonderful easy to read and made me want to finish after I started.
B00003CWOL|5.0|The satire is funny and entertaining with the star studded cast. Not a movie for people who take things too seriously or kids.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I would have given this game 5 stars but there is so much talking and you have to keep tapping to get the talking to go faster. I enjoy the hidden objects and puzzles but the storyline, well, what can I say? Good freebie but they need to minimize the talking (a lot) before they charge you for it. If I want an audio book I will purchase one.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Easy and user friendly. Nice actions, love the highlights, love the timer. This is a well put together app. Thanks
B00632HWOG|5.0|Kindle email app died. Kept sticking on old emails. Would not download new emails.  Yahoo works great. Smooth and reliable.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|sad this was her last album,but it is awsum,classic janis and nobody does it like her,i highly recommend if you want to hear the most passionate powerfull performer
B00571F26Y|5.0|EVERYONE needs to read this book. I am amazed at how great I feel after eliminating gluten from my diet. It is truly a miracle for me. No more pain &#34;AT ALL&#34;. Headaches, stomach pain, etc. have all disappeared in less than 3 weeks and I lost 5 pounds without even trying. I recently turned 53 years old and had to cancel my celebration plans because I felt so bad. That very night (7-10-13) I gave up gluten and now I feel like I did when I was twenty. I have boundless energy and even my vision is better. I have challenged everyone I know to lose the wheat for 2 weeks and then make your decision. I love, love, love it!<br /><br />Thank you Dr. Davis!!!!!<br />God bless you for sharing this with the world. I am a living testimony to losing the wheat and regaining my health!
1400052181|2.0|I think this book is worth reading especially for persons in the field of cell biology/culture. Unfortunately, early on there is a major error. That is, when Dr. Jones received the tissue report from the initial biopsy, it read, according to the author, \\"carcinoma of the cervix, stage I\\". Staging is a clinical process to determine the extent of the tumor ie confined to the cervix, extending to local tissues, paticularly around the ureters, or with distant metastases ie liver, bone etc. Staging is crucial in determing treatment and the stage, of course, could not be determined by a limited biopsy. Radium treatment of the cervix (which has complications) is inappropriate if there are metastases to the liver or bone. This why Henrietta had all the studies prior to radium therapy. Remember this was long before MRI or recently developed diagnostic procedures so none of the metastases apparent at autopsy were found. She thus had the treatment for local disease. What the report should have stated \\"carcinoma of the cervix grade I\\". Grade is an estimate of the malignancy of the tumor by the number of mitotic figures visible ie growth potential of the tumor.<br /><br />Although I said the book is worth reading this fundamental error in terminology makes one wonder about the depth of the author's knowledge of cervical cancer. I am surprised she has not already been called on the carpet for this mistake.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|You don't have to be an Eagles fan to love this story about  a damaged soul.<br />Bittersweet, sad, funny, and a character who makes you stand up and give him his own Eagles cheer!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Terrific performances, great photography, great music. Perhaps a bit overlong. What can I say - It's the one and only Tarantino!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Not working properly, get stuck and nothing happens when pressing on icons, I prefer to use the web to use this app, very bad, I do not recommend.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Good fun movie, just what I was looking for. Not a paragon of the genre, though. But perfectly enjoyable, I think.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|The great script provided a real inside to reality of the justice system. The lead was complexed yet he delivered awesome<br /><br />Entertaining every minute got action drama and Humor a good mix for inflight travel or not too deep to just have a beer and enjoy. I will watch again
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Jobs is certainly a dichotomy. Inspiring in some ways. Repulsive in others. I wish I could be half as driven as he was.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Amazing game, it's really fun and mind simulating. It covers all the big times in history and has great new features. I would recommend this game for anybody!
B008OM0EDO|2.0|Description of the movie is much better than the real thing  Not much comedy Go mow the yard instead of watching it
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|So much fun! I love this game and its really fun, it makes you set goals and learn to be patient!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoy the technical side of his stories.  He explains things in detail especially about long range shots with sniper weaponry.
0061438294|5.0|I chose to buy this book because it was written by an exFBI agent. I had bought other books on this subject. I enjoyed how Mr. Navarro included examples of how he used body language to profile his prey.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|No doubt on my mind on being the best show on TV and one of the best all of time!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It really GREAT. You might get stuck but you'll pass it worth to download. Promise don't listen to the bad reviews AWESOME XD&copy;!!!!!!!!!! !
B006LSZECO|4.0|Slightly disappointed in this novel which follows a couple's unravelling; neither of the characters is particularly likeable so despite a very clever narrative ruse, at the end I just didn't care what happened to either of them.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me game is a pretty fun game to play if you need to kill some time. Like the diff levels as well
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app. I use it on my kindle and on my phone. It works for me, easy to use. I'm happy. :)
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|gritty realistic police drama like the Wire.Great chance to catch missed episodes.<br />Good to watch Justified co star who plays Boyd Crowder.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|A little slow in places and not a lot of character development, but still interesting sci-fi with a twist near the end.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|The only good thing I have to say about this book is that the actual killer was a surprise - I can usually figure out the whodunnit, but didn't on this one. I almost quit reading early in the book but figured it had to get better. It did not. WAY too much French language that was not \\"translated\\" so that readers could understand. In the space of 3 paragraphs the sister's murder went from being 3 mos to being 6 mos. French currency was completely inconsistent - one minute they're paying in Francs, the next in Euros. There was NO Murder on the Cote d'Azur -they were all in the Atlanta area. For a seemingly smart person, Maggie sure was a love struck ninny as far as Laurent. Knows nothing about him, allows him to move in with her when he shows up out of the clear blue after months of no contact. A proven liar yet she stays with him, and it gets even worse in the intro to the 2nd book, which I will not be reading. (or giving away here in case other readers are interested) I'm sorry I wasted so much time on this one.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|great movie made you feel like the robot was a person. a feel good movie shows how anyone can become a better person,compared to rocky.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Very nice, very easy, very fast, much easier than connecting wires. Glad to have it and pleased that it was available for free.
B00634GHJA|2.0|I cant seem to get it to transfer where I want it to go & then it puts a lot of stuff that I have NO IDEA what it's for..  Going to keep reading about it and try again.. Have not given up, yet!!<br />If I figure it out and it works like I thought it was suppose to - then I'll come back & change my review.. But right now, it's to hard to figure out... Sorry!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I like that I can connect it to facebook, & see that I do have some friends who play it as well. I also like that I get free credits everyday. I just play until my credits run out because it's so much fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun game! ive been playing the game for a few hours! I cant put it down. even my kids love the game too!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Game was fun and challenging at times but sometimes too precise on the click area taking several times to complete. I would recommend the gam
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is freaking awesome!!! I play this almost everyday because of the fact that you can play on multiplayer or create and be creative with your own worlds. This game is awesome and I hope you think it is too!
B008JFUN6E|3.0|Elysium's story may have some considerable issues, but this is basically one of the best looking films made this year, the CGI and special effects are incredibly realistic. Neill Blomkamp is at a completely different technical level than the rest of Hollywood and i hope to see more films like this and District 9 from him in the future. I can't recommend this film enough, if you're a Sci-Fi fan you have got to see this movie.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Not the greatest movie but solid.  I can't complain too much as it did hold my interest pretty well throughout.  But to me it's not a 'see over & over again' type movie.  Once was enough.  Good entertainment for an evening.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Loved the idea of a zombie romance. Highly recommend it. Only gave it four stars because the emotional healing of the zombies is a little unbelievable.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is a well written, fantastic tale.  However, I found parts of it pretty improbable.  Like, how can a young woman with no previous hiking experience, to speak of, find the energy or strength to carry an impossibly heavy backpack (heavier and larger than any man's backpack whom she met on the trail) and walk several hours, even during the beginning of her trek on the PCT?  She mentions not being able to lift the backpack - - the only way was to sit, fit her arms into the straps and secure them, then get on her hands and knees and into a semi-standing position, then walk hunched over for miles.  Come on!  And, not too long into the hike, with open sores all over her feet and toenails blackening and falling off, the result of ill-fitting boots??  Really?  Other than that, it was a very interesting story.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Ordered to late for Christmas arrival but did get it<br />as soon as possible.  Was very nice and we enjoy<br />watching shows whenever we want.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I loved all the twilight sagas.  Characters are well developed.  Thought the movie was going to be really stupid but fell for the<br />story line and you could say I got bitten.  I looked for and watched some on TV, and finally had to rent the last two movies from Amazon.  Heck, I am 66 years old and I got hooked.  The movies were that good.  .
B002ZG980U|4.0|INCEPTION, I think, is a fine film to watch on a rainy day if you are looking for something twisty-complicated that's meant to make you think a bit.<br /><br />I though the acting was solid.  Leonardo perhaps plays it a bit low-key, but the performances of the other characters make for a good complimentary match so that it all works.<br /><br />The special effects were realistic without that corny over-the-top thing that Hollywood typical goes for.<br /><br />The storyline isn't entirely new, but it's woven in a convincing way and you don't need very much suspension of disbelief to be tugged along.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Great performances of a less than awe inspiring plot.  A nice diversion, it's possible to go check on the dryer and not totally lose your place.
B00D2ZF24O|5.0|This is definitely the best Will Smith movie yet! His son, Jaden, also gets a chance in this wonderfully dramatic action adventure fantasy to put his acting skills to the absolute test! Yes, it's not \\"Men In Black\\" or \\"Independence Day\\", but it's still pretty darn good! M. Night really redeemed himself from the badness of \\"The Last Airbender\\" and I hope this movie gains a bigger audience. The critics, in my opinion, have really misjudged and pre-judged this movie due to M. Night's recent work and because they are so used to Will's comedic style. This in my opinion is a very underrated piece of cinema that deserves to be seen and be known about! Highly Recommended! 10/10. Well done Smith and Shymalan, well done!
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|And then I actually tried to turn the plane. holding my kindle straight up, the plane failed to level out. if someone fixed the controls, it would be amazing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|loved.it, very entretaining, with new challenges every day, i personally recomend it, download it and try it for yourself if you don't believe me!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is my favorite app I'll play this for hours. I love how you race, feed, groom, and treat your horse. Also you can clean the field. Also you can clean the barn.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|It got here real quick and I really enjoyed this movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes action.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Spend lots of time here. Great  game! Only thing that would make it better would be to have a coin amount option on the acorn items.
B006C45CFG|4.0|I viewed this film as an individual and as an author of non-revisionist history related to this country's indigenous people. The presentation of two different genres of film taking place during the same century was interesting. It was refreshing to see producers and directors taking the chance of combining those two genres in film version (versus existing graphic art publications). The casting of Adam Beach and Jose Raoul Trujillo in indigenous roles were excellent decisions. I've always held Beach's acting capabilities in high regard; his casting in this film was, in fact, the primary reason I purchased the DVD. I suspect Hollywood will be reluctant to pursue more of these mixed-genres in film simply because of resistance by many earth residents to the fact that life exists concurrently in other  galaxies/spiritual realms and, probably/potentially, at a more advanced stage than our own. The choreography and digital work on this film was excellent. I cannot say the same for the bonus items on the DVD. The blatant lack of inclusion of the two leading actors in &#34;Indian&#34; roles (Beach and Trujillo) in the bonus items (interviews, promotional, etc.) was very disappointing. The actors who were included in the bonus items gave credit and commendations to themselves and other actors portraying whites ... but not to those actors portraying &#34;Indians.&#34;  I've rated this film (NOT the DVD) as &#34;I like it.&#34;  vehoae, author of Conscience: Breaching Social Amnesia.
B0094M2ODQ|4.0|I recommend this to anyone looking for light comedy.  I had seen this before, so it was worth a 2nd time
B001RHOJSE|3.0|Arendt's report on Eichman's trial in Jerusalem is very enlightening and even-handed. Those interested in the psychological makeup of Nazi perpetrators of crimes will see that they were not the average Germans, who in general were well educated, cultured and civilized, quite unlike the members of the Nazi hierarchy. Unfortunately Arendt's writing style is rather poor, which makes for a difficult reading.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Typically, I think Ellen is funny & I enjoy her books and TV show, but for some reason, this book struck me as \\"too wordy\\" -- meaning writing her thoughts directly with all of the twists & turns were kind of a headache. I did enjoy her notes on personal strength to overcome obstacles when she first came out on TV & how she uses meditation.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Fun movie to watch silly yet scary at same time . A good popcorn eating movie! Blood and gore yet hilarious at times!
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I saw this title on a list of books that were going to become movies, so I tried it out.  I really liked it!  I blew through it so fast because I couldn't put it down.  It was beautifully written, made me tear up a couple times!  I'd recommend it for people who want to read the book before they see the movie, and anyone who is a sucker for a little love story
B00A6WSTIW|5.0|Movie quality was excellent. We need more older titles for the Prime members.<br /><br />Sometimes it talked time to load the movie.
B001OKGX92|5.0|First time i watched the movie, plot didnt make too much sense. Have now watched it so many times I could care less about the plot. Love the movie and love San Francisco -lived there for 3 years- and everythin about the scenery!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really good app. Everyone will love this app. It is really fun especially if you like horses.
0812992784|5.0|This is an autobiography of outstanding quality and with great political significance.  If one cares about protecting the right to freedom of expression in this era of globalization, Joseph Anton, Salman Rushdie’s account of how Ayatollah Khomeini’s 1989 death edict affected his life, will prove enlightening.  Those who admire Rushdie’s large fictional output will learn a lot about what shaped his writing and about his character from this beautifully written book. (For myself, I much prefer this autobiography to his fiction.)  There is plenty of fodder for those hungry for gossip and trivia; I had not realized that Rushdie’s strangely drooping eyelids were due to a medical problem – as opposed to an attitude of hauteur or boredom. Fans of Alfred Hitchcock will appreciate a real world drama that echoes Hitchcock’s themes, being about an innocent man whose life is put in danger after he inadvertently gets entangled in a crime/a murky plot orchestrated by strangers.  In retelling his ordeal, Rushdie includes asides referring to Hitchcock’s “The Birds,” where with no warning a quiet beach community is invaded by gulls and crows mysteriously bent on carrying out murderous attacks, and he was as baffled as the inhabitants of Bodega Bay as to how he became a target.  How would a man of letters in Britain writing a novel in English with elements of magical realism and a story line that centers on the stress and confusion of Muslim migrants from the Indian subcontinent trying to find their footing in the culturally alien British Isles anticipate that the theocratic leader of Iran would denounce him as a criminal and call on Muslims everywhere to assassinate him and all those involved in publishing his novel?  In condemning Rushdie for publishing a work of fiction that he had never bothered to read, Khomeini was opportunistically grasping at what seemed to be a chance to polish his credentials as the leader of Islamic revolutionary forces; significantly, henever offered any explanation of exactly what it was in the book that he deemed so transgressive.  As it happened, Iranian-sponsored death squads as well as freelance wannabe assassins dogged Rushdie’s existence for many years, making his life a sheer hell as he was forced to kept moving around, using the name “Joseph Anton” as he sneaked from one hiding place to another.  His nightmarish experience might have originally seemed unique, but there are now strong pressures being exerted at the UN to extend Islamic censorship rules to the West, so Rushdie’s ordeal has broader lessons.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Well written, interesting, introduction to particle physics. Prof Carroll does a great job in writing and in a Great Courses video describing the hunt for the Higgs Boson and Dark Matter.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Not very entertaining. The storyline was boring and the characters were not believable though I have enjoyed the actors in other movies.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I took my wife, and kids to see this at the Imax in 3d, and at my children's request; I agreed.<br />And let me tell you; it was a blast. The 3D right off the bat was amazing, and it worked well with the giant Imax screen.<br />Without giving anything away; the story was good, the special effects was good, the acting was good, and my family really got into it.<br />Don't get involved with those nit picky reviewers. The water is just fine, now jump in.<br />Highly recommended.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Nobody else told me that I could do it on our own and then James came along. Very few write that make instant connect.<br /><br />I want to give this to my daughter who is 17 but book contains some swear words that prevents me from doing that so this book will be in my kindle library for some time before I can share.<br /><br />I too am trying to ideate and do something on my own. This book gives me tools to do it at least to try.<br /><br />Thanks for the wonderful book James.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Loved reading this because it made me so happy.  Tina Fey is hysterical, witty, and real.  I found myself laughing out loud on the train to work.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Another great Kindle App. very useful for on the go reading. I have absolutely no complaints. You will love if.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|One of my favorite all time movies. Have seen it several times and ordered this one for my friends who also have a Border Collie. Anyone with a Border Collie should see this movie.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Client Eastwood is always a hit! If you're a baseball fan or not, you don't want to miss this one.
B006IGZWB2|3.0|The movie is ok but read the book instead. The book is wonderful but the movie leaves too much out and is disjointed as far as following what is going on. It skips over a lot of the true history during the time period and if I hadn't read the book some parts would have even been confusing.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|This was a great movie. I watched it for class and was in aw. I loved the ending, was the best part. Kept me in suspense and will watch again.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie is beyond words to describe.<br />A heart rending and gut wrenching movie based on true facts makes this even more of a humbling experience to see.<br />It makes you realise just so many challenges that people face in such a natural disaster and the bravery and heroism they display through the adversity.<br />It does show some pretty unsavory scenes and can be disturbing but at the same time that really gave the true feeling of what was experienced in that event.<br />Fantastic acting!  I have to say I've not found such a great movie production in quite a while.<br />Needed to watch a bit of humour afterwards as I did feel pretty down afterwards.<br />Totally gives me a lot more appreciation for the simple things in life and family!
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love The Vampire Diaries. It is by far my favorite TV show. I have all 3 seasons and watch them all of the time. The discs were in great condition.
0988178532|5.0|Rate 9.0 / 10.0<br /><br />I have always like thrillers especially sci-fi thrillers. When the author has given me a copy of this book, I grabbed it.<br /><br />Disclaimer : This book was given as a gift and it has NOT influence my review of this book or whatsoever. It is entirely my honest, unbiased opinion.<br /><br />As I flipped through the pages of the book, I noticed the author took great efforts to structure this story. He has developed the characters well especially Nate. The book is written more to reflect the author personal life and to add more mystical and supernatural juice to it that many young adults can relate to. Without giving too much away, this book relates to everybody internal desire craving for power and magic. If you are a fan of Harry Potter's adventures, then this book is something you may want to consider. It is a good thrilling story indeed. I have enjoyed it fully and I hope you will to. Good job and can't wait for the next segment from this author.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love the Harry Potter movies and this was in great condition. I have watched it several times and will watch it several more!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I have an Android and it works fast and better than this. The only problems I've had with the app is that I can view any playlists and it loads slow sometimes. Other than that I would give it a 5.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|The amazing series comes to an end.  The cast all returns in the final season, and you learn the reason they were on the island.  There is plenty of crying in the final episodes, so you may need a tissue.  The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the finale (The End.)  The finale is not what I wanted, and left me upset, but I will go back and revisit the island and maybe skip the finale, and imagine the end I would give the series.
B0073QWCAA|5.0|WOW what a great buy. complete Alien collection that didnt cost me an arm and a leg. it was the perfect Christmas gift to myself.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I enjoy this mystery object game so far. I enjoy all the G5 games. The only disappointment is to advance in the game, you have to purchase either the full game or access to more features.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Although it was great for getting my music, I can only use it in my wife's Tahoe, as the angle of the thing does not fit well in my car.  But I will recommend it as it was easy to install
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Tom Hanks is usually a safe bet. Looking forward to a fantastic sci-fi this weekend. After 30 minutes of Cloud Atlas we are searching the old DVD collection. A total disappointment. Who can find pretentiousness meaning in this dribble? What hell was Tom Hanks thinking? Where & How do I get my money back? Why should I ever read another review again? And most important of all, Sometimes reviews are just complete rubbish.
1451695195|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone doubting the existence of Heaven........It is no coincidence that this afterlife experience happened to a scientist who had never before believed in Heaven.....It is truly rivoting to read the description of his experience and realize that he could not justify such an experience by any scientific explanation........You won't want to put it down!
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|This movie really wanted to be Slingblade meets Cape Fear. Matthew McConaughey was superb. Unfortunately, poor acting by the films young cast, an inconsistent script and lack of character development turned Mud into quicksand.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|you can be sure that the good guy/gal wins with a Follett novel. That being said, this was a fun ride.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved loved love this trilogy!!!! It was . A book I couldn't put down. Or should I say three books......I love rereading these great books
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Well worth the money. Everything you could ever want to know about the Alien saga is here. The movies all look incredible at 1080p. The case design is incredible too.
B00C7L2QCA|4.0|My wife and \\"enjoyed\\" watching the series, which is sometimes quite gruesome, mostly because of the acting, the lighting,and the editing.  The plotting from episode to episode is less consistent and controlled than it could have been (the daughter comes in and out somewhat arbitrarily, as do new murderers), and sometimes a scene from one episode is virtually replayed in a later episode. Some filler shots, like one of Lecter's building, are overused.  But the series has high production values, and Mads makes it worth watching.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Is an ok game - is nice to play but a lot do not know how then get mad when they lose and blame everyone for their ignorance - beware foul mouth players
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This is the fourth Harry Hole novel I have read, and is one of the best. Unlike others, it is set in Australia, not Norway. It contains much more direct action, whereas some of his other novels are more procedural and psychological, although all have some crime-fighting activity. The book explains some of the mystery behind Harry and why he is such a broken character. Jo Nesbo writes effective police mysteries, and this one should be enjoyed by most anyone who is looking for a new mystery.<br /><br />As a mystery lover, I will put in a plug. Although somewhat darker, and even more scary, the British Mo Hayder crafts exceptionally well written mysteries such as &#34;Birdman&#34;. But do not read if you are bothered by truly psychotic criminality. Like Hitchcock, what she leads you to anticipate is much more horrifying than what is revealed, but there are true horrors in &#34;Birdman&#34; and her other books.
B00DCX08MW|2.0|The game is ok and kinda boring there are only 3 planes and it takes forever to get somewhere. All in all its ok.
B000IKQMFO|5.0|It's really a good 'who dun it' movie, along with the side characters. Bill had it comin...I think a 'follow-up movie would be good.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I was honestly not expecting to really enjoy this one, I had read a few reviews which knocked the film. However, if I recall correctly it was mostly because of lack of action... since when does a critic knock a film for &#34;LACK&#34; of action? Anyway, I enjoy the world and plot, as well as the action, in this sci-fi film. If you love sci-fi, classic tropes used very well and some action... as well as Tom Cruise than this is the film for you.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Loved the book and loved the movie. I can't believe this was Grishams first book and that it took so long to take off!
B00DHNJGCU|5.0|Great movie, watching everything unfold was thrilling. The ending gets a little to Hollywood, however, I cannot knock an entire film based on the last five minutes. If you enjoy a good thriller to keep you on the edge of your seat with a bit of action every once in a while, this is the movie for you.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very challenging and you move thru the levels.  Really am enjoying the thought process challenges as I move thru the different years.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|5 stars, always can find a book, mag  or newspapers , I love it I take my tablet or something with my kindle app!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is off the hook and very addictive. I play this game too much. The graphics are great. I just love the minions they are so adorable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its like mixing the Ninja Turtles with Spy Kids with a bit of Morgan Freeman mixed in a bucket of legos.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I recently watch this movie and I have to say it is excellent. I know many people who where worried or pessimistic about a human version of MLP, but the staff at Hasbro Studios did an excellent job staying true to the characters, the feel of the world and the content of the show. It has substance without feeling completely off and the characters are instantly recognizable and behave just as you would expect them to if they were ponies instead of humans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a blast! Great way to pass time. This game is challenging enough to keep my attention without making me bored. Can't wait for new updates!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game!! I've actually lost track of time playing this game. The graphics are great and the characters are so cute. This is one fun game!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|To much medical terminology that can be confusing.  Other than that great read.  I would recommend this book to others.
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|It is a great kids movie. my kids loved the movie and the characters. after the movie was over, they had to play the videogame.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had been dying to read this book forever because I just became a Nerdfighter and I finally got the chance. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE SO READ IT.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|An ordinary business traveller unknowingly sets into motion an end game scenario. The government goes to work dealing with many facets of containment, information and disinformation. This is an action/thriller whose antagonist is a virus...
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|The 3 D Graphics effects are excellent. the story is only so-so but because of the wonderful use of vibrant color I gave it 4 stars. The Wizard of OZ need not be concerned ...this could never replace it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is quite fun and interesting to play. it makes you think and remember items you came across. great app!!
B008TTPQXA|5.0|This book placed many doubts on my mind.  The fact that the phenomenon was experienced by a well recognized neurosurgeon and made him change his views with respect to NDE and afterlife was extremely powerful.  I am religious, but lately I kept asking myself questions and shifted somewhat towards strict scientific explanations.  But this story is really astonishing.  I had, of course, listened to similar stories, but not so profound and real as this one.  Also, it is very well written with extensive detail and explanations and I felt striken by the authors words. A highly recommended read.
B009GEDP26|5.0|There is nothing that I don't like about Castle. It is funny and I love the characters.Very easy to access the videos on Amazon.com
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game and my sister has it on her IPod but she already got the latest update and I am still waiting for it. Other than that it is an amazing game and worth the $7.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Thankfully I didn't pay for this one.  First of all, there are ads.  In order to remove ads, you need to buy, with money, tokens.  Crazy! I can't even start up a game now .  It keeps sending me to the screen to buy tokens.  Removing it after I finish this review!
B00DYOOGYK|1.0|I try to open but it goes back to the home page<br />I hate it it doesn't work wast of
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was an amazing thrill ride of emotions and plot twists. I can't wait to see how it all plays out.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game has a lot of characters, boards,and a lot of missions. Its fun and something you can get addicted to.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Loved this book- mystery after mystery unfold leading you further into the lives of the characters.  Keeps your interest throughout
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Weather forecast for next 10 days, or next few hours. Multiple locations. Easy interface lets you select detail level you want to see.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very entertaining game I must say. I like the variety of games for this app, but I wish they didn't cost so much because it takes a while to be able to unlock most of the games.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|A nice twist on Tetris, this one manages to keep me occupied when I probably should be being productive!  Very addictive.
0071766588|5.0|The book exactly like test. I recommend for every body. Most of tutors teaches from it. I love it ...
B00C1LIYWM|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />As \\"Safe Haven\\" opens, young Erin Tierney (Julianne Hough)  is seen racing hysterically out of her suburban home, either the victim or the perpetrator of some terrible crime. She thereupon flees to a town in North Carolina so bucolic that one half expects the Waltons to come traipsing down the street at any moment bearing freshly-baked blueberry pies. Even though she's colored her hair and changed her name to Katie and is constantly looking over her shoulder for fear of exposure, Erin begins to make friends and establish connections in this idyllic locale - this despite the fact that she's being hunted by a tenacious and determined Boston detective (David Lyons) who refuses to give up the pursuit even when the trail appears to have gone cold.<br /><br />For all its good intentions and lip service to reality, \\"Safe Haven' is never able to shake its dime-novel aura and taint - not a surprise given that it is based on a work by Nicholas Sparks, that modern-day purveyor of romantic triteness best known, to movie audiences at least, for \\"The Notebook.\\" The distraught woman just happens to land in a town that just happens to have a dreamy general store owner (Josh Duhamel) who just happens to be a widower with two young children, one an adorable little girl (and Mimi Kirkland really IS adorable) and the other a son who's having trouble coping with the loss of his mother who just happened to be in the flower of her womanhood when she died. And it all comes to a head in an absurdly melodramatic flourish at a Fourth of July fireworks celebration no less. If my tone sounds a mite cynical, it's probably because there is some real acting talent here and one hates to see it thrown away on such tripe. And it's a particular disappointment given that its director is the talented Lasse Halstrom who`s usually more discriminating in the material he selects.<br /><br />As it is, though, \\"Safe Haven\\" will probably feel right at home someday as a Lifetime Movie of the Week.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote to do little memos that I can read on whatever electronic device I am using...smartphone, Kindle, computer. Great for grocery lists, instructions, measurements for when I am shopping, etc.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Like the large key size and the fact you can turn your device sideways and have all the sine and cosine functions as well but not have them for simple tasks.
B00CATSONE|3.0|I was expecting something more robust in germs of length and research. The author borrows heavily from Malcolm Gladwell and other sources of information that are not listed.
0143121316|3.0|On a foreign reader perspective it is too much focused on Sino American relations although  it is undeniably an authoritative book because it was written by someone who actively participated on the process of diplomatic rapprochement  between China and US. Additionally some passages of the book have too many details that the reader might not be interested.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this was really fun.  A mix between the popular games: temple rum and subway surfer (which are some of my favorite games).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am only sorry we have to wait to January for more.  I can't believe Matthew was killed.  Glad Bates is okay.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cute game that challenges your hand and eye cordination along with a bit of frustration. it is a cool game
B0092S4WLY|4.0|this game is a lot of fun, and it's only downfall is that there are only 9 levels, I do really like the game soI am patiently waiting for more levels
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Absolutely fabulous! I have never had so much excitement, shock, horror and sadness in a book. So far the books have not let me down. Going to start book #4 now.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|This movie is rarely seen on TV.  It is one of a kind and parents should watch this great space adventure with their kids. This one is a keeper.  It brought memories when I took my kids to the theater when they were little. Now, they are 29, 32 and 33.  They still sit and watch it.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Unlike most other games.  Light, easy to learn, different from other games, and different every time you play.  Takes about 45 minutes.  Best with 5 or 6 people.  Easier to play than to explain.  Lots of fun.  Looking forward to adding an expansion or two to my base game.
0780622650|5.0|This movie was excellent for the summer.  It gave my students ideas to create their own space adventure.  They wrote great books.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Riveting.  I can't leave it alone!  On my second trip through the series.  Lots of twists and turns in an excellently written story.  Exquisite cast, scenery, and costumes, Incorporates real life events and social customs of the times into the plot.  A must see from the beginning.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire HD tablet and my phone, (Galaxy Note II) Easy set up with no problems or glitches. Highly recommended.
B002HRTMHQ|3.0|His music is very good.  Motown roots make any music good.  He is very talented but should leave the vocals to someone else or share vocals.
B000VSBX34|5.0|Like everyone else my age, I first saw Help! at the actual movies, not that one could really hear anything of the dialogue with all the screaming in the theatre! It was simply fun to watch the film again, as a sober sided adult. It is fluff, sure, but it brings back so many memories of a (in a lot of ways) gentler time, where it was alright to sing in a movie, and no one agonized over deep themes, and no CGI overwhelmed plot and actors. The Beatles lived again, as they once were, silly, happy, innocent.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Horrible movie that took a long time to go absolutely nowhere. We were very disappointed since it looked so promising with having both Brad Pitt and Sean Penn. Would NOT recommend!
B000059TFO|5.0|Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe are mismatched FBI aqents dealing with the disappearance of three young people (there to register black voters) from a back road in Mississippi in the early 1960s. The film takes an unflinching look at the realities of JIm Crow and the very real dangers of the Civil Rights movement in the US. The film is deeply suspenseful, often enraging, certainly disturbing,  often heartbreaking.The acting is  Academy award level. You won't easily forget this story, especially since it is based on an actual event.
B0000524EM|4.0|First Film with Brandon Lee is awesome, a true classic. The other films are not so good, tried to repeat the formula, but it does not work
1475143389|5.0|First review I've ever written on Amazon.  After following this program more or less for about 6 months I'm seeing the results promised.  When I say more or less i mean that I follow the weightlifting philosophy, work in cardio a couple of times of week, and try to eat well but nothing as disciplined as described in the book.  The heavy weight, low rep weightlifting works for me.  This book is a great value.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|This games is fun. But you are just doing the same things over and over again. You can't unlock new things.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Epic and Amazing. Sheldon Cooper FTW. Great show, always!<br />I've never gone wrong with any episode of this incredible show.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|great value for the money.  Really pleased with the cd.  Was surprised that there was 2 cd's and a dvd.  Great value. Thanks
B009IF8CH6|5.0|With a mixture of its diverse cast of characters and intellectual humor; &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; is my favorite television show. Of course everyone has their favorite characters, mine being Sheldon Cooper, and their favorite episodes / moments, but in all honesty I haven't watched one episode that didn't make me laugh or think or engage my mind in some way. To sum it all up - if you haven't seen this show, in my honest opinion - you're missing out. Thank you Big Bang Theory, for existing and not being a waste of television time.<br /><br />-Michael
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|My kids love this game. They enjoy taking care of the patients and doing the medical things like pulling out the splinters and bandaging the boo boos but as far as an adults point of you it is boring and repetitive as all the patients have the same issues and you must treat them all the same.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Must see people.  The soundtrack of our lives recorded at Sound City.  A piece of history saved for future generations. Thanks Dave G.
030758836X|5.0|I couldn't stop reading Gone Girl, and it caused me to be sleep deprived during a work week because I stayed up to late reading it.<br />It's a compelling mystery that caused me to keep asking my friends--even those who don't share my taste in books--if they'd read it.
B009MO57H6|5.0|It was good I have a the other resident evil films awesome wicked  f a n tas t I c
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was so great to read the whole series. Really felt like I was looking through all there eyes.... .
B008602KQI|5.0|Read all of the books. This movie left out alot from the book but over all very good. Love the first part of the games.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|clumsy, clumsy, clumsy.  more work than it's worth.  save money, buy a book!  Big Fish has really got a lemon as far as I'm concerned.
B0094J3AZA|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who loves dollhouses but wanted one where she could design and redesign the entire house and the rooms. This duplo house lets her build so many different style of houses that she never gets bored with one single style. She also loves to mix the duplo house bricks (lots of pink) with her current duplo Cinderella castle and sleeping beauty sets because the colors work so well together. I know there is an older version of the legoville family house that has orange/yellow walls, but I chose this newer version to go with all the duplo princess sets that we have, and the soft pink is a nice color afterall. Also have to mention that the 3 large base plates, walls with windows, roofs and lots of furniture included in this house set are just what my daughter needed to create her bigger and more elaborate houses/ mansions/ castles. Love this house. Great addition to my little girl's building sets.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I played this game online and loved it, but on my tablet it was only on a trial basis so I was disappointed when I needed to buy it to continue to play. I'll just play online. Thanks
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The magic of Hosseini's writing - it was a pleasure to read.  You wont want to put it down .
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I was gifted this book by a friend and was quite pleased with this book. It was amusing, entertaining, with some romance thrown in the mix. I loved it very much and can't wait to find out more about this author. Well done!
0307352153|5.0|An excellent read for anyone who is interested in learning why we react the way we do to others and to surprise situations. Well documented and written for any intelligence level. Age doesn't matter either.
B008JFUN50|4.0|I just saw this movie August 10th, 2013. It was a really good movie. I found it very unique and moving. You can really see the blend and touch of different culures and the beverly hills. It is a pretty inspirational film and also entertaining. I definitely did not feel like I wasted my money or time.<br /><br />The special effects and definition are top notch as well as the sci-fi setting the film is in. They have kept it very canon to the problems our world may face some day and the technology and science we have created and discovered.
B001XULSG6|4.0|If you liked Star Trek Next Generation then you will love this movie. It combines some of the best elements from the TV series into a fun and action packed movie. In my opinion the best of there post TV movies.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Love being able to watch Star Trek any time I feel in the mood and know it will be great quality
B002BVQU5A|4.0|This is one of Johnny Depp's earlier works but is very good. It is a rather unusual story with some interesting twists and turns. Truly original story line.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Good movie for streaming and background entertainment.  Streaming quality was good, volume was adequate.  Nice to be able to jump to places in the movie as the this was a long one!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you are a regular to watching downton abbey ...then you will know that season 3 is filled with a few surprise and sad moments.  I loved watching it on prime as there were no commercials and I was able to watch an entire season at my leisure.  A ++

0307279189|5.0|This book is written so well that I have re-read it twice in the last 2 months. It is truly a life changing book for a runner, either well established or an aspiring newbie. When I have trouble with motivation in my training, I pick up this book and read some of it to bring my enthusiasm back up! McDougall writes in a very comfortable manner, and does not condescend to the beginner runner, which is fundamentally important!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Great book as usual by Rollins lots of interesting and educational parts as well as mystery and action so liked it
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Crashes constantly, features removed.  I deleted after having to restart my device so many times.  The prior version was great -- bring it back.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun, even as an adult, I enjoy it! a must play. I would totally recommend this game to anyone! :)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follet is one of my favorite writers. His historical novels are fun to read and you get a better sense of the history you learned
B005S9EKCW|2.0|I've never watched the live musical and I've never read the book.<br /><br />I did, however, watch the film in the 90's with Liam Neeson and Geoffrey Rush and I liked it. I particularly loved the story of Jean Val Jean and Javert. Rush was fantastic.<br /><br />I LOVED the King Speech, which Tom Hooper also directed.<br /><br />So given that background, perhaps it can give you some sort of idea where I'm coming from when I say I did not like this movie. I wouldn't say I hated it, but it leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />How so? What it mostly comes down to is the way the plot was executed seemed rather ridiculous. It took, what, 10 seconds for Javert to figure out who Val Jean was? This was some 5 minutes or so after we are even introduced to these characters? Plus there's the fact that Cosette and Marius fall in love after seeing each other for a few minutes, and then we hardly see Cosette after that despite Marius' professed love for her. It all just sort of skipped around, and if I hadn't already seen the Liam Neeson version, I think I would have been thoroughly confused. I thought that version executed almost every single plot device much better than the Hooper version. So, for me, the plot was unenjoyable and just sort of dragged. Ironically, I thought some of the plot should have been elaborated on more (e.g. the points I made earlier), and yet it still clocks in at over 2.5 hours.<br /><br />Plus, the music wasn't terribly likable to me, but that is a far more subjective complaint and probably shouldn't factor into other people's reviews.<br /><br />From my understanding, this is a great movie if you love the musical. For someone like me, it certainly lacks magic.<br /><br />BUT, in it's defense:<br />-the cinematography was gorgeous; I wouldn't expect less from Hooper<br />-I can definitely see why Hathaway was given the Oscar for her performance. The fact that they did the 'I Dream a Dream' song in only one shot was astounding. The emotion was raw, theaesthetics were fantastic, and her voice was great. But it was slightly odd in that she was hardly in the movie at all.<br />-Russell Crowe has gotten a lot of crap for his singing in the movie. Granted: he was not a stellar singer, but he was fine. It was just a bit jarring to hear Jackman's operatic-style voice juxtaposed against Crowe's very plain voice.<br /><br />...and for the record, my fiancee, for whom I purchased this, loved it. So if she ever ends up writing a review on this, expect five stars
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game ever.it is so cool.my family plays it all the time thane for. reading my review
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great!! Can't wait for season 4. I'm so hooked on this series. PBS has done an outstanding job on this.
B00CTMA95S|5.0|Dark energy, quantum mechanics, parallel universes, all tied in to the search for an Ancient Warrior's tomb. It's all there in spades! I finished this book in a couple of days and on a plane. Some great thrills and a real page turner.
B0057F869U|5.0|I got this digitally, so I can't comment on shipping or quality of the product or anything. So I'll just review the movie..... This is now definitely my favorite version of the movie! Michael and Mia give very good performances-it was very well acted, and very well done. Its also nice when you get the rare occasion of seeing Judy dench NOT playing the part of the villain!!! Lol! Its a great rainy day/lazy Sunday movie!!! :-)
1455508977|5.0|It's hard to explain when you are enthralled my such a magnificant story teller.  Nicholar Sparks is certainly a good author of love stories.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|No spoilers. I liked the film. The acting was good, not great or amazing, but good. The plot, while simple, moved well and was cohesive and it never really felt rushed as is often the case in movies today. The action was fun and well done and if you like the old martial arts flicks with all the wild jumping and inhuman super moves, you will really enjoy several parts of this movie. Check your critical eye at the door, be prepared for some fun, and you will enjoy the film. Cheers!
B006964E8S|5.0|a good read - entertains until the last page. Will certainly be reading any follow ups of the John Puller Series.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan has a remarkable and clarifying grasp of the history of the Holy Land and makes the historical context of the New Testament understandable to me for the first time.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is the perfect tycoon game for all ages<br /><br />You can get mythical creatures from any culture<br /><br />BEST GAME EVER :)
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett seems to have departed from his thriller formula, but once I settled into the story,and didnt expect a page turner thriller, the story and the characters came alive....
B005ES1DW2|4.0|they are comfortable, and they fit well.  the price was excellent.  I like the color and feel that they will last me a long time.
B001D07Q9E|1.0|Received DVD in what appeared to be original packaging<br />DVD player would not read disc<br />Tried it on two other players with same result<br />NO response from seller to my request to return for replacement<br />Very disappointed
1781162646|1.0|I could not get into the story and felt it was not well thought out.  I have read all his works but this one was disappointing.
0714843377|5.0|This is light reading book and the information or thought of the author make you think differently how you see your career. I really recommend this book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|this book was an easy read, I thouroughly enjoyed it from cover to cover. I recommend this read to anyone who loves reading.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great to revisit a childhood classic. Only gave 4 stars because some of the special objectives have less than stellar instructions on how to complete them.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|Amazing book. Well written for and easy to understand even when you have not done a lot of science in school.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I downloaded this for my kids, but I have had so much fun growing new plants and attracting new fish. Educational learning about the sea life. Cute graphics with goals of growing the reef. Actually great graphics that look real, like the way the plants sway in the water or the manner the fish swim. Soothing music along with it. Better than an aquarium!
B001152TL6|5.0|A great film noir combined with a study of madness.  Some people complain this movie is confusing; and it is to a degree.  It's a DAVID LYNCH film, for crying out loud! Bill Pullman's understated performance is pitch perfect, and Robert Loggia is also great as Mr. Eddy.  I'll never tailgate again!  Robert Blake deserves kudos for taking the role of the role of the Mystery Man,  who serves (perhaps!) as Fred Madison's conscience, alter ego and partner in murder.<br /><br />I will forgo a plot synopsis other than to say it's about a man who kills, and tries to deny this truth to himself by creating a false reality.  It's not as surreal as other Lynch films, but compared to most filmmakers it's out there.  Highly recommended.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Anyone who is an Austen fan will love her best work. Such an amazing book of love, learning and growing.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|My husband had never seen the movie, so now he loves it, too.  What a treat!  Funny, silly, but not stupid; quite bright, in fact.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Unlike many other Disney princess movies, Tiana teaches you to work hard to achieve your dreams and accomplish anything you want in life. The characters are wonderfully engaging and I found myself deeply immersed in the movie.<br />Such a wonderful family movie that everyone would enjoy, except maybe your husband. (Unless he likes Disney movies)<br />All in all an amazing movie, worth 5 stars in my book
0679720200|5.0|is so thoughtful and so responsive to how I liked the service.<br />As I told the provider, &#34;if there were more people like this in the world, it would be a better place:-)&#34;<br />THANK YOU....
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like this game. It is easy to play when I have time to kill waiting for appointments. Very colorful and User friendly.
B000AARKO4|5.0|It's like peeling an onion .. So many different layers. Great story, great acting, and great truths to take away even today.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|This is a great app. For kids and adults! We all love. The only thing is I rated it 4 stars because on the Kindle fire first addiction it does not repeat you. That's the only thing we are sad about. But it's great for the kids and they will love it!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is cool and all but I have been waiting to play it for 2 hrs cud the app is freaking out this ducks alot
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is a great game it starts starts off easy but they gets harder as it progresses.... good time passer.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Sometimes this book can get confusing but it was good. Very sad but good. And sometimes this can get boring. But I believe the author did a great job in approving his opinion and what he wanted his readers to inform. -(:
0440180295|4.0|Cover art wasn't my favorite, but it's really the content that counts. Easily one of my favorite books of all time.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This if s good app but I'm not right into the socialling sites buy this one is absolutely great. :)
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This app is addictive and the only reason I'm writing this is because i need more coins but otherwise it's a good game to get
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This story kept me up later each night and looking forward to the times I could carve out for reading. They were my own times before going to sleep. An excellent job of keeping the reader's interest through both plot and narrative device.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Very graphic....you don't need an imgination  it's all there in  black & white.<br />Very, very, very hot hot and steamy.....
1617751588|4.0|I love the video cartoons for Simon's Cat drawn by Simon Tofield. Getting Simon's Cat in Kitten Chaos from the library was a no-brainer when I saw it show up at our library. While it's a cute book that I enjoyed, I don't think it works quite as well as the videos.<br /><br />Given that I thought I'd like it a bit more than I did, I tried to figure out what the issue might be. I think it's relatively easy to mentally compare this to Garfield, the other well-known cartoon cat. Since Garfield started as a comic strip, the books retain the feel of the character. Simon's Cat started as a video cartoon, and it seems like some of the humor of the character comes from the movement and action. The drawings are a bit random in places, and it's more difficult to capture the story that is normally communicated in one of the Simon's Cat videos.<br /><br />Even with that assessment, Kitten Chaos is still a fun (and quick) read. If you like the Simon's Cat videos, Kitten Chaos is worth reading.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowed
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|FIVE STARS, ENJOYABLE AND ENTERTAINING,GREAT CAST. I VIEWED THIS MOVIE ON MY KINDLE IT WAS GREAT. JUST ME AND MY MOVIE. DID NOT GET DISTURBED, I WILL DO IT AGAIN.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|First of all I want to explain the five stars; this is not casual entertainment suitable for a pleasant evening with a relaxing movie, it is intense and provocative drama that will shake you until your teeth rattle. It does an outstanding job of providing a surprisingly serious plunge into drama, excitement, and visual beauty that is not easily forgotten.<br /><br />We watched this last night for the first time without having read the book or any reviews so this review is strictly on the movie itself. This is a powerful and effective movie which grabs you by the shoulders and gives you a good long shake. It doesn't let go even after the movie is over as one's mind speculates on the alternative stories and considers which one to be really true.<br /><br />Visually the movie is graphic and powerful and has a variety of strong images mixed with beauty and wonder; if you watch it late at night you may have trouble sleeping. I've found it hard to put the images and thoughts of the movie behind me as scenes from the movie keep returning to my mind.<br /><br />I recommend you approach this movie with caution as it is a force with which to be reckoned and can imbed itself in your memories.
B0063IH60K|4.0|nice solitaire game....just so much that you can do....but can the numbers on the cards be 'enlarged'?  thank you so much.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|A fascinating look at a LA area studio that ended up being the place where a slew of groundbreaking careers were launched over decades.  I thought I would put it on while I was doing other things and ended up riveted to the TV.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|For a free app this was an interesting puzzle game. Good for all ages but younger kids would not enjoy it.
B0014JKJHK|1.0|Not happy at all now I have to take super glue with me everywhere just to keep the soles on and the non skid part is terrible I am slipping everywhere !!!!
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|I've got an older CSS book and I felt like I needed to get a newer, more comprehensive book for my continuing web work. I've used CCS a lot but mostly learned by modifying other CSS files, trial and error, and Google searches. This book does a great job of pulling everything together and putting things in one place for me. I can't compare it to other books but I liked it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A simple app to do a routine job well and fast.  Not spoken complicated gadget that you need a big Inst.  book to use.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved loved this book! Loved Drew and his open honest and<br /> cocky POV! I found myself shaking my head and rolling my eyes but then totally laughing out loud, cheering him on and just plain swooning!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There are few books that I can't stop reading and this is one. I wanted to read it again as soon as I finished. The beginning is strange but once you settle into the writer's style...it's magical.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I bought this b/c in 2008 E350 has the Ipod integration kit and I don't have an Ipod nor do I ever plan to own one. Installation was super simple (less than 10 seconds) and I was listening to my Mp3 player and Pandora within a minute. This is such an awesome product!
B00E8B1358|4.0|I wasn't expecting much since this was 100% my husband's idea to watch, but it ended up being very entertaining! I actually thought it had a great plot and it kept me engaged throughout.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|I like the game but you pretty much are at a loss if you don't go into the hints to see what your assignments are.  If you don't you end up working against yourself.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love the dynamic between the characters and the story lines. A very entertaining show!! Mike Ross needs to get his degree so I can stop worrying about him getting fired
B005Z271Y6|4.0|A unique talent who can sing. No crazy costumes--- exposing various body parts accompanied by bodily gyrations.  Just a great voice singing music from the heart.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This is a particularly clever psychological thriller which completely misleads the reader into believing the main character, Dana is as crazy as she is made out to be!<br />A wonderfully woven web of false information and doubts leads the reader along several paths thinking Dana is delusional as the narrative draws towards an explosive conclusion.<br />Once again though, just as you think you've guessed what is going to happen, more twists and turns are revealed which found me reading faster and faster to discover how this tale was going to finish.<br />The characters are realistic and varied and the detail of the plot is brilliantly conveyed.<br />If you enjoy a thrilling tale, this is the story for you.
0307742997|4.0|'The Snowman' is certainly an enjoyable crime novel.  Our rough-around-the-edges investigator Harry Hole is tasked to find a serious killer whose calling card are snowmen left at the crime scene.  Of course nothing is as it seems, and Harry discovers he is somehow connected to these grisly murders.  The author does a great job in building an elaborate plot complete with realistic characters.  Kudos are also probably in order for the English translator too.  My only complaint with the book is its surprise ending.  It comes off as somewhat forced.<br /><br />Bottom line: considerably better than your average crime mystery.  Recommended.
1452000247|5.0|This book had me gripped from the first page.<br />The writing and story reminded me of a Tolkien/Dahl tale of exquisite fantasy as the reader loses themselves in a magical world of a boy's dreams.<br />My ten year old is totally captivated by the narration too and it has been a topic of conversation round our dining table.<br />The language and description are absorbing and extremely well-crafted.<br />This book is a must-read for adults and children alike - fantastic!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A good additive game, frustrating at times too easy at others<br />I would recommend as for free it's great value for money.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I LOVE. THAT THIS GAME HAS A PLOT, it's not a plain hidden object that's for<br /><br />sure! I told my mother about it and she wanted to check it out, she has never played any games nut now she is hooked!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved this movie.  Saw it in the theater, bought the DVD, downloaded the digital and have watched it many times.  It's the frickin Avengers... but it's made in a time when nerd commander supreme is now recognized as such and allowed to make movies (thanks Joss... we love you).<br /><br />This move has everything... could the Incredible Hulk lift Thor's hammer?  Who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Captain America?<br /><br />Can't wait for the follow-up movies and the sequel.  Iron Man 3 was already another great one with some nice tie-ins and looking forward to S.H.I.E.L.D. this fall.<br /><br />What else can be said?  Never forget the comics but remember that this is the Marvel MOVIE Universe so... anything can happen.<br /><br />WATCH IT.  Twice.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Totally loved all the real life scenarios that come when one is expecting. Movie does a great job putting it on film!
B008OM0EDO|4.0|4 Stars for Making Me Laugh.  Bold... good cast, with fun cameo appearances by other actors and actresses who have above-average senses of humor. There was a bit of a drop in the action and entertainment just-past-halfway-through mark that almost got me lost and moving onto something else; but I stuck with it and enjoyed until the end.<br /><br />I liked the democracy speech. It reminded me of \\"Team America: World Police.\\"
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I liked it all. I especially liked the interaction between different and the Indian boy. I particularly like the British actors.  Judy Dench did a superb job as she always does.  the Indian boy did a great job acting.
B005LAII12|5.0|im a super family guy fan. If you dont like family guy you may not like this movie. Wahlberg is so funny in this move and Kunis just beautiful! Ted is cute too. lol
B0054SMID0|4.0|It didn't look good at first but after seeing that is was free with prime I gave it a try.  It was surprisingly good.  Worth watching not buying
B004J88SGC|5.0|I love Billy Joel. He sings his best hits and give a great performance. If you are a Joel fan this is a must have.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Often overlooked by many sci-fi fans, the SG-1 series was a solid mix of science and mythological folklore. With a great cast and excellent plots, it was a great show that ended long before fans were ready. The second season was the beginning of the series finding its footings in exactly what it wanted to be and how to get there, especially with the addition of new bad guys and new allies. I've enjoyed watching the old episodes again and often long for a new and good sci-fi show rather than the stuff that's out there today.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. its so fun and challenging. its great for all ages. everything is great. and I love all the characters.
B00BSBUZPK|3.0|I am huge Eagles fan and while I will watch anything they release, I was somewhat disappointed in this. Glenn and Don have Basic storys from their youth while other band members have maybe a line or two about their history before joining the band. There are some tidbits that I did not know, especially from Glenn(who else). I enjoyed the clips and behind the scenes that I have never watched before but that is all they were, clips. I was hoping for much more live performances than they gave us, that was my biggest let down.<br />  Glenn is the most vocal and comes off as aggressive, he was clearly very driven but also in a dark way, he has no reserve about replacing band members and I thought he got what he could out of people who had more talent than him and would cut them loose later on. He speaks rudely about Don Felder and calls him Felder and never by his first name, he talks about Don Felder like he has a mouthful of spoiled milk, at least Don Henley gives him the respect by calling him Mr Felder. Glenn attempts to degrade Mr Fedler subtly when he refers to the guitar tracks that Don Felder would bring them to get a song out of, one of which went on to become Hotel California.<br />  There is a lot of coverage of Joe Walsh's drug use, some of which is uncomfortable to watch, and while real, there should have been more about the individual members of the band. I recently saw the band live and Bernie is back in, Randy was supposed to return on a limited basis, and Don Felder was not invited at all, which is very unfair and disappointing to fans like me. There was a lot of shouting Where's Felder at the concert and I hope they can reconcile if this is not their last tour, even Pink Floyd did for one set.<br />  Back on track, I hope this is not the last chapter of The Eagles, this documentary actually leaves more unresolved than it does answer questions. While another album to replace Long Road Out Of Eden is ridiculous, at least a song or two by ALL members wouldbe better fitting.
B000NY12CI|4.0|This biographic story is eye opening and interesting. I was intrigued by her insight and ability to look back and analyze her culture. The only unfortunate result in her rationality is not realizing that she was worshipping a false god. She rejects that god and her religion becoming an atheist but does not learn about the one true God. Unfortunately man's religion can be a major stumbling block to all belief systems.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoy this game with my 3 sons ages 8, 10, and 12. It gets them involved in a different type of game that uses their thinking skills and memory.
B004WDRSO2|5.0|i like the movie blue ray is awesome my son also loves the movie keep onein my minivan for those long roadtrips from home and blue ray for when mom needs peace and quiet
B00CH87HF4|5.0|very fun and not boring. only thing I would improve. is add a auto aim.<br />I like the action and ability to come back and not lose all the gain or cash. being able to upgrade on the fly is good too.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Awesome book could not put it down.  A true American hero. Rip Chris Kyle. 5 stars. People should read this book
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is one of the best comic book movies to date. Well developed characters that you actually like and are vested in. I love the wit and humor that is delivered and typical of Joss Whedon.
B007RAE6TC|5.0|I have watched this film a number of times over the years, and never tire of it. Just to hear Laurence Olivier read the prologue and epilogue is worth the purchase price of the recording, but the entire cast is superb, as is the soundtrack, and as for the script, what can one say? The tragic love story, in Shakespear's gorgeous language, will endure forever, and this movie brings it to vibrant life.
B00340LM8C|4.0|Cary Grant at his handsomest. Grace Kelly, well, she plays herself--classy, saucy and a refined lady. I can see why the Prince wanted her for his bride.Violence is there, but hidden for the most part. Sex is there but entirely hidden--only suggestions of intimacy. As I said, 'classic'.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keep a note pad and pencil handy unless you have an outstand ing memoryl unlike mine....Relaxing and just enough challenge
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good story.  Well written.  Confusing with too many characters.  Wonderful ending to a very sad story.  I would recommend it
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the intriguing storyline...especially the characterization of &#34;death&#34;. The writing, so lyrical and engaging, was a pleasure to read. If I had one negative critique it would be that the narritive ended far to early leaving me hungry for more details. However,  this could have easily been the author's intention. The book is catorigized as juvenile fiction, but at 53 years young, I loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is absolutely amazing!!!!! I love minions! It will cheat at times but its works really good on Kindle Fire too.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love it<br />Very fun and graphics are goog. Would  recommend to Dr I ends and family. Hope everyone enjoys this game
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great TV Series with excellent plots and actors.  Every show you watch makes you want to watch the next one to see what's going to happen next.  Exciting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like that there are so many versions, including amplified. It is complete and I also like that I can access it on my pc and find all my notes, where I left off, my bookmarks. You can click a verse and share on twitter or facebook. I only wish I could download the amp version for times when I don't have a wifi connection.
B004H4XLRE|1.0|We just purchased this toy on Amazon. I am extremely disappointed as is my 3yr old son. The launcher really only works with the plastic car that was included with the launcher. It shows 5 cars and says &#34;Collect them all!&#34;<br /><br />How can they be collected if they cannot be found ANYWHERE to purchase? Do the cars even exist?? If so, where are they?<br /><br />It states the &#34;other vehicles sold separately.&#34; REALLY?? It also states &#34;not for use with some car vehicles.&#34; It should state &#34;Only for use with the ONE car included!&#34;<br /><br />In addition, it states in the description on the website that the die cast 1:55 can be used with the Launcher...while it is true they do fit in the launcher they launch about a foot! Not much of a race! We have tried all different surfaces with no success.<br /><br />Basically we are left with ONE car that actually GOES! That is not what I call a race!! It is what I call &#34;False advertising!&#34;<br /><br />Now I have a 3yr old son that is extremely frustrated and crying because they don't race and it doesn't work!!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|It was easy enough to switch from google reader to feedly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I sometimes have issues with keeping it in the view I prefer. I would like to set it once and be done.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Really great book that is now aligned with many of the works on conflict resolution, mediation and negotiation.  Must have for any library.
B00000JPH4|5.0|This movie was purchased for my daugher years ago but was lost when huricane katrina came to New Orleans. I bought it for my grandchildren to enjoy as much as we did.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I'll admit I got this CD because I loved her voice and Next To Me was a really good and catchy song. Most of the other songs are pretty slow in comparison so it might take some listens to appreciate them for their true value. The lyrics are really nice and there's a lot of strong messages. I think it's totally worth the buy.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Even tho' there is a more complete box set for the Alien franchise, that includes Prometheus, this 2010 version set covers all expectatives for an absolutely classic movie franchise, and for the price that has been offered it's definitely a must have.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Every song has a hook to me. Laura Mvula's voice is new and wonderful. I cannot get it out of my head. Really good. Love the arrangements and production too.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this series, can't wait for books 4&5. The crossfire series is perfect for post fsog cravings, but also has an amazing story and characters which make it stand on its own.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Can't complain about the discs cause there is just nothing wrong with them. I can watch on my PC using PowerDVD and they just work perfectly.
B00571F26Y|5.0|It amazes me that the average 'thinking' person has not given this 'Commercial Genetically Altered Crop' subject a lot of thought.  This book ought to change your mind, and sure to change your lifestyle.  There are other books on this subject, but this is your starter  HEALTH 101.  Even if you buy \\"Organic\\"...think about where the seeds for the crop comes from...heirloom? Altered?  All my friends and family have read this and changed their eating habits.  YOU WILL FEEL SO MUCH BETTER!  AND...maybe if the GIANT CORPORATE GROWERS start feeling it in their pocket books, and we bombard them with complaints they'll 'get the picture'.  Not a chance, but we all can try.  READ THIS BOOK!
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I really enjoyed this film and it picks up at the most important part of Hitchcock's career, the planning and production of Psycho. It is interesting that the story adds in the actual inspiration of Psycho with the true story of Ed Gein. Adding more of Ed into the film gave a symbolic relationship between Hitchcock and his work. At first, Anthony Hopkins felt like an odd choice for the part of Hitchcock but the more I watched it the more natural he appeared. I thought it was interesting when they are unsuccessfully shooting the shower scene and finally a fed up Hitchcock steps in and has flashes of people he really wants to kill. This is as equally violent and horrifying as the actual film they are trying to create. Another scene that I thought was pure genius is the ending. Hitchcock is explaining that he is not done making films and that he is going to search for inspiration for his next project. Just as he is finishing his sentence a crow lands on his shoulder. This draws an immediate connection to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds which is now another very popular film created by him.<br />-William Fehr
B004EPYZUS|4.0|A middle aged Tom Cruise leads his team in a bevy of stunts and trickery to victory in achieving a pleasant evening at the television set (in my case, watching a disc). As usual the challenge is to prevent some Mighty Bad things from happening (or  insuring some mighty good things do happen). Little time is wasted on lengthy explanations or jabber on love or marriage,  right or wrong, or any of that other 'claptrap' that slows down many a picture that would be better off without them. Its go to work and get the job done. Cruise is all that one could ask of him, the supporting cast do quite well with what is left for them to do before, during and after, Tom's achievements. Found  Dubai setting interesting (while hoping these are real background shots) with the directing properly keeping things moving. A  picture to keep on your list for one of the nights when you do not want to face reality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love reading a series.  The ending was not entirely what was expected but enjoyed it just the same.<br />Looking forward more from this author.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The Fast diet or alternate day fasting can truly be a life changer. This book and the preceding BBC show are excellent in showing what's possible and why. My goal is to lose 60 pounds in one year through ADF and then to maintain my weight with two fast days per week. I am currently 18 weeks into the program and nearly half way there. My annual physical is about four weeks away and I anticipate good improvements in all my blood work. Yes, it is a little difficult but knowing that you can eat tomorrow is the key to staying on the diet.
B00932A4XE|1.0|How these actors, who could arguable choose oscar worthy roles every agreed to appear in this monstrosity is a mystery to me. This wouldn't have even been a decent lifetime movie.
B002TXZT7A|5.0|These books will take away your tension and stress while listening with your minds ears to the way conversations go. Fantastic!
B007C7UZIG|4.0|I have steam for my computer and I absolutely love it, the app especially!! You can keep up with friends and look at games and keep your wishlist. The only thing they need is to enable voice chat like they do on computers.
B002TXZRNQ|3.0|About the content of the story - it is such a pity that a person can come so near to the truth but miss it at the end.....eish! Mitch Alborn is a great writer, so I will keep on looking forward to his books.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have borrowed the original version from a close friend many times.  I hadn't seen it in a while so I looked went to Amazon.com and looked up how much.  My friends are around here anymore, but it seemed a little more than I wanted to pay.  Then I noticed there was a &#34;Restored Edition&#34; for about half the price and I could get Amazon Prime shipping as well!  I did a little research to make sure that they didn't do anything different in the movie.  I don't trust some of the movie studios when they &#34;re-release&#34; titles.  I found out this was just that.  When I received it a few days later (I have Prime), I watched it in two sittings as we always did.  We always ended after the scene when Darcy asks if IS this is the only response I should expect? and Lizzy gives him an earful.<br />Great Movie, I really enjoy this version (The BBC) and not the lousy remake one.
B00DURGZHW|3.0|The kids are really the star of this movie. Matthew M. was ok but was more of a talking role. Just okay movie for me.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I bought this app last year. Now amazon says i don't own it and i can no longer download it.  Very disappointed.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love this show......may have to start watching from the beginning again, just in case I missed something! Can't wait for the new season.

B007KZY1YY|4.0|Good story line that keeps you reading easy to pick up from where you left off.<br />Preferred sequel more than 1st book
B005LAIIJY|1.0|DVDs were scratched. Gohastings has no desire to fix the issues so you either live with it or send then back. I was able to fix 2 of the DVDs with a scratch out product but one was so horribly scratched there was no way they sold it honestly especially when the description said it was like new. None of their stuff is like new. Will never buy from this seller again and I suggest you don't either. Thanks for reading my honest review.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|The first few chapters are pretty engaging, but the last section (history of zombie outbreaks) drags on forever and is pretty boring.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game and I always will be loving it!!! You get to take care of dinosaurs and animals to!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love zombie-apocalypse literature and movies and WWZ is so far the best of the genre I've found. I really like how he focuses on the geopolitical moral quandaries rather than just the personal stories (which are there as well). A very fun read.
0307730700|4.0|I read this book to compare it with Unbroken and found that it lacked compelling story-telling because it almost seemed that it was a series of interviews.
B00506NRBS|5.0|While I don't agree with every tip Derek offers, he tells a great story about how CD Baby got started and what he learned from the experience.  You can definitely learn something from him.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Very good movie with a good telling of history in the time frame allotted.  Highly recommend.  Would like to have went a little farther in history at the end but for the story that was being told was still good.
0399159347|4.0|Families can be a source of joy and solace or frustration and despair.  In Liane Moriarty's bittersweet saga, \\"The Husband's Secret,\\" three Australian women face daunting challenges:  Cecelia Fitzgerald, a perfectionist, has an impeccably neat and organized home, runs a lucrative business, volunteers at her daughters' school, and maintains a cheerful and unflappable demeanor.  Tess Curtis owns an advertising agency with her husband, Will, and her cousin, Felicity. Sixty-eight year old Rachel Crowley works as a school secretary and dotes on her two-year-old grandson, Jacob.  She is still grieving over the loss of her daughter, Janie, who was strangled twenty-eight years earlier by an unidentified assailant.<br /><br />By chance, Cecelia learns that her husband, John-Paul, has been keeping a momentous secret from her.  Tess's husband, Will, makes a dramatic announcement that impels her to leave Melbourne and move in with her mother in Sydney. Rachel is distressed when her son and daughter-in-law inform her that they will spend the next two years in New York, where a new job opportunity awaits.  Her grandson, the light of her life, will soon be thousands of miles away. Eventually, Cecelia's, Tess's, and Rachel's stories interconnect in unexpected ways.<br /><br />This is a cautionary tale about the dangers that await long-married couples who have settled into comfortable routines.  We can take nothing for granted, the author implies, and when the worst does happen, only those who are strong, resilient, and forgiving can hope to survive with a measure of equanimity.<br /><br />\\"The Husband's Secret\\" is engrossing, but its impact is weakened by implausible coincidences and excessively melodramatic situations that are incongruously juxtaposed with breezy dialogue.  The complex plot is too hectic, and includes a whodunit, a torrid affair, guilt, betrayal, attempted murder, a tragic accident, and finally, the characters' belated realization that they must accept what they cannot change.  Some readers will be exhausted by all of the misery that Cecelia, Rachel, and to a lesser extent, Tess, must endure, thanks to a combination of human frailty and incredibly bad luck. On the plus side, Moriarty ably demonstrates how families confronted with seemingly insurmountable obstacles can either fall apart or stay together, depending on how they choose to handle adversity.  Ultimately, \\"The Husband's Secret\\" would have been even more powerful had it been less contrived and more subtle in its treatment of domestic angst.annot change.

B003WTE886|5.0|Great music that never disappoints. Taylor Swift is adorable, talented and just has a way of making the world feel good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Pros<br />Very good graphics<br />Tremendous variety of scenes and settings, and more with each update.<br />Lighthearted fun.<br /><br />Cons<br />Can get a bit expensive if you buy extras but they are not required.<br />Swipe controls are a bit imprecise, which can be frustrating.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Great book.  Although supposed to be for a young adult audience, it was well written and I actually felt it should be for a bit of a more mature audience given the subject matter of the book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|All in all this is  Avery fun game the only problem I have is it says I am connected to Facebook but non  of my friends can see my score but thence rocks
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  Not what I would call &#34;typical Stephen King&#34; but definitely his style.  The story makes you think what you would do given the same opportunity but also makes you think of the consequences of your actions.  A MUST READ!!
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Top notch movie the movie keeps you on your toes from the beginning to the end my grandson had never seen this movie so I bought it and he has watched it at least 20 times, super babysitter !!
B0044XUZ9K|4.0|Long John Silver, the pirate. Lots of treasure. Deceit, trickery, indifference, loyalty, betrayal- this has it all! I had never read this as a kid, but of course had heard of the pirates. Once you start reading, it's hard to stop, because something happens on almost every page, and you want to know what it is.<br /> This book can be enjoyed by an adult.  Argh!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Tho  is definitely a good game to keep your mind going! Very addicting. I can't wait till they open more rooms!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is harder than it looks which makes the game challenging. Very addictive and fun. Looooove the Minion Rush app!!!!

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Enjoyed this movie...a must see if you like sushi. Jiro is humble and inspiring. You will learn how much effort and tradition goes into making sushi.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I did enjoy this film.  The action sequences are good and it doesn't take itself too seriously.  My favorite part was the Chuck Norris cameo.  So if you like action and Chuck Norris cameos this movie is a good bet.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Well written and an interesting and provocative concept, but not uplifting in any way. I am not sorry I read this book, but I can't say I enjoyed it either.
B00973902K|5.0|I requested it last year at our Holiday Party and since so many people knew about it we had a lot of folks come out the floor and dance!<br />Great catchy toon

B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Bruce rocks again All of his movies are awesome I sure hope Red 2 is as good too I'm sure it will be
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The plot lines are interesting, but what makes this series stand out are the characters. They are complex and interesting. It's nice to have a cop show where there are no clear &#34;good guys&#34; and &#34;bad guys.&#34; In addition, you get a deep appreciation for life in the streets of LA.<br />I plan to keep watching subsequent season.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this is a great game to play. I love it and my sister loves I like how it only gives you a pic
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game because it is Challenging and fun at the same time. It is not too hard that my kids can play it too.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Yep, its free, no strings attached and yes sir, it does work!  While true it violates you tube policies which, well, lets face it, when used as intended, which is to allow you to watch you tube in areas where internet is too slow or intermittent to stream, really is not a big deal.  Just make sure you scan each download for virus' or malware before opening them and PLEASE respect the content owners rights..  delete after viewing, satisfies my conscience anyway..  Great App! :)

B0064X7FVE|3.0|I love the app but have had the same problem of it draining the battery life out of my kindle,so hopefully that will get resolved. You can still get all the same information that you could on the old version,it just took me some playing around to find out what they moved

B008LV8TSU|3.0|The story was interesting, and I liked the author's sense of humor. Sort of tongue in cheek. It was a little long for the actual story told, and the ending was a little difficult to follow.

0812992784|2.0|Would it be possible to write a boring book about one of the biggest international news stories of all time, the ordered assassination of an author by a country with a huge bounty for anyone who kills him?  It was Valentine's Day 1989 when the dying Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran sentenced Salman Rushdie to die.  His crime? The spurious things he had written about the Muslim religion in his just released book \\"The Satanic Verses.\\"  To answer my initial question:  \\"Yes,\\" and the book is titled \\"Joseph Anton,\\" Rushdie's memoir of the dozen years he lived under the death threat. Joseph Anton was the alias he chose to live under, combining the names of Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov. Ironically, one of the writing decisions he made for this book also leads to a serious grammatical downfall.  Rushdie writes his memoir in the third person, constantly referring to himself as \\"he.\\"  This was a wise choice, because if he kept saying \\"I,\\" he would come off as the height of pomposity, which I believe he truly must be.  Problem is, in the book he never calls himself by his real name. Therefore, very often throughout the pages of this very long book, I had to pause to figure who he is talking about.  In writing, a pronoun is supposed to refer to the previous noun.  For example:  \\"Bill, George, and Dick went to the fair.  He ate a lot of candy.\\"  In that example, \\"He\\" is supposed to refer to \\"Dick.\\"  Constantly, Rushdie refers to others by name and then drops in his \\"he\\" and the reader has to use logic to figure out whom \\"he\\" means. Sometimes, it is impossible to determine definitely, especially when talking about \\"he\\" and his son Zafar. Further, Rushdie is a name-dropper like shedding dogs drop hair.  Seems like dozens of names per page.  People he meets, people he knows.  He names everybody who attended his wedding.  He even names people so that he can name the famous people they are related to.  It's endless and confusing when he mentions a person again in the book, expecting the reader to remember whom he is talking about.  There are a few nuggets of enjoyment in this book, but short and far between.  His observation that if the Internet had been booming when the death threat was announced, his life would have been in greater danger.  He goes into detail about a number of books by other authors, which led me to create a list of \\"books to read,\\" including Bill Clinton's favorite book, \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\\" and \\"Crash\\" by J.G. Ballard.  However, I don't think I'll read another book by Rushdie.  Yet, his description of the aftermath of 9/11 is one of the best I have ever read.  Bottom line, if you feel you must read this book, I'd wait until the Readers Digest Condensed Version comes out.reader to remember whom he is talking about.

B0060CV31C|5.0|A timeless classic!! A movie great for the whole family all the way to the 2 year old in the house. I highly recommend this movie!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of my favorite games and it installed and plays great.  I can play this anytime. Sure do enjoy it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the third book, Mockingjay! I thought Suzanne Collins did a great job explaining the characters feelings, and describing many parts in the story. This book has a twist to it that makes the excitement accumulate. It is something different from the other books in the series. You should definitely try it.
161655164X|5.0|if you are on the fence about getting this and are a &#34;the last of us&#34; fan then it is 100% worth the money to get it. beautiful art to a beautiful amazing game.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|If u lik 1 Direction &/or u can spell 'okay', u definitely might enjoy the movie about kan fooers that git lost in da forrest of gump.  It was my 12 yo who said it best, &#34;Thanks, Dad!  It was okay!&#34;
B000W7JWUA|5.0|this is a fun game to play a small game with two friends or with the family. awesome dynamics and just an easy set up.
B006O6F932|5.0|If you are familiar with monster high, you know that their attention to detail is delightful. There are even skull-shaped locks for the lockers!  We've had this for a few weeks and I keep finding new things.  One of my favorites is the fact that the dolls fit through the doors and the furniture is proportionate to their size, which is unusual.  The toy folds for easy storage, not that we will be storing it any time soon.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the bleachers broke the second we assembled them, and some of the furniture is not very sturdy.  But my 7 year old would not let me give it 4 stars; she would give it 10 if possible.  She saved her money to purchase it, and she is thrilled with it.

B001XUH69Y|5.0|I was certainly impressed by the clarity and sharpness of the streamed version of this classic film.  The film of course is considered almost perfect, and I wouldn't presume to sit in judgment of it.  But, it does have significant age, and in the past when I've seen it, it always seemed to have small picture or sound defects that detracted from the experience.  This stream from Amazon to our smart TV was beautiful.  The sound was vibrant and the picture crystal clear.  I was really &#34;Wowed&#34; by it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game was very entertaining and had some hard challenges. I would recommend it to anyone who likes hidden object games.
B009WUBERW|2.0|Terrible story line and really poor acting, even though there wasn't much to work with.  I don't know why I gave it 2 stars; I didn't hate it, just disliked it.  I agree with the title of the film, nut I'd shorten it to Expendable....
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Rose makes the difference.  The original companion was also named Rose but in Galyfrian. Doctor 9 is great as well, very alien as well as human.  This season has lots of connective tissue to the old Doctor Who series and the two new Doctors to come.  It also has one of the best stories of all of Doctor Who. &#34;The Empty Child&#34; is the first of a two-part story, which concludes with &#34;The Doctor Dances&#34;  these two episode form one of the best of the Doctor Who stories over the past 50 years.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game like temple run but I enjoy it more because it is easy and it changes places often. This game is fun and a little tricky. But one I let a litter boy play this game and he got me a cool boar.<br /><br />I love this game.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I teach audio courses at a community college and this little recorder is the best for the price.  You have not just two built-in microphones, but also they have a changeable range of the width of the stereo image!  So, if you are trying to capture say, a band on stage at a nightclub, you can put the mics at a 90-degree position which picks up a less wide range of sound. (Who wants to hear the fan hooting and hollering next to you, right?) Or, if you're out in nature and you want to pick up a much wider ranges of the breeze blowing, the birds tweeting, and the bees buzzing, then you can switch them to 120-degree stereo width which picks up a much wider range of sound!  Not only that, but you can add two external microphones to get 4-tracks of recording at once or just add the two external mics and skip the built-in mics.  Even better, if you're a budding songwriter, you can record one track at a time to make a 4-track recording!  The sound quality is EXCELLENT and the machine is well-made and durable!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|An unnamed well developed main character narrates his life shaping childhood memories.  Economy force reduced living conditions on his small family.  A live-in sitter is hired for him and his sister.  Only he feels trapped and aware as the new sitter Ursula becomes their sinister adversary, causing bondage unknown to their parents.  Situations become unbearable for him and he stumbles upon his new friend Lettie.  \\"Children as I have said, use back ways and hidden paths while adults take roads and official paths.\\"  Suspense builds at each new turn of events.  Common spells are replaced with recipes sometimes, his friend Lettie explains.  Ursula begged Lettie to send her back while not looking even faintly human.  Turning on Lettie and the main character Ursula becomes evil in her deadly attack, using ancient deceptions.  Lettie and the main character confront Ursula.  This descriptive fable plays out courageous times in the lives of two determined children and their resourcefulness.  Many demonic gripping dangers could win in this thrilling children's story.

0920668372|5.0|This was all of my children's favorite book. They still cite the poem at ages 22 and 21 and I am sure my 16 and 6 year old will as well. I absolutely love this book and suggest it for all parents and children.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  It is not only appropriate for middle school students, but adults as well.  It is a book about kindness and how to live your life.  I love the whole concept of precepts!
B0020PJJHS|4.0|Not his best but it still a great Bond flick to watch, Pierce gets into the Bond role better in the next two movies he did.

B003DES8I6|3.0|While Boondock Saints is one of my favorite movies, this sequel leaves a lot to be desired.  I found this to be a bit more slapsticky  than the first.  So, I was a bit disappointed by the loss of the original tone.  However, it's still a decent movie and if you have seen the first you owe it to yourself to catch this one just to see the story through.
B00CFOI2QS|4.0|If you enjoy the classic Hammer horror films, Horror of Dracula is the jewel in the crown. This set includes both DVDs and Blu ray. There are also extensive features and interviews. The LionsGate 2012 blu ray includes two restored versions, one from 2007 and a second from 2012 that includes some missing footage found in Japan. This really is an intense effort to make this film appear the best it will ever be in a home environment. By today's blood and gore standards, this 1959 film is rather mild, but Christopher Lee's Dracula portrayal is indelible. Now, if this film interests you, don't just run out and purchase it. This set is a Region B (European) Blu ray. It will not work in a North American (Region A) player. You need to have either a Region B player handy or a multi-region player. If you can handle this, it is well worth adding to your film collection!
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Started reading this because i finished game of thrones. saw some comments about it being hard to read, didn't think it was too bad but i can see what they mean by that. wordy at times, but not so much it slows down reading. character development was easier to follow then in GoT, because not everyone is related. it is very war themed, but individual plot lines keep you entertained. i definitely plan to continue the series, but gave it a 4 star rating because it doesn't have me as enthralled as GoT, and the plot can jump around in times you expect it to continue. with all that said, still a great read. get read for magic :)
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|used it while walking on training mill and watch or use my tab. with the original you cant charge it or plug it on the wall while on the training mill
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it, the app is fun and challenging at the same time. This is my favorite escape game so far. I can't wait for more rooms to come out! Thanks for a great app :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyable game. can't wait for more levels. At first i wanted to delete the game as the instructions seemed a bit vague however i persevered and it payed off big time.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|There are few words to describe the sheer genius of Chimamanda Adichie. A friend of mine who read the book after my recommendation said, &#34;she is on a whole other level of writing.&#34; I think that may be the best way to put it. I think she, and this book are simply astounding.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|this app is the next step in technology AMAZING perfect for school!!! Love this app is defiantly worth more than free!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Nice App Its very useful for me when I wake up in the mornings for school. You should download it if you have trouble getting up in the mornings.

B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent series...comparable with the Walking Dead. Would highly recommend this series and look forward to more of these. Season 2 is next.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|Adichie's book is a searing novel of the human condition... The lives we hold so dear and how fragile they are. Our ability to live and love against a backdrop of great pain and suffering. Through characters who capture your attention and a factual context that is more shocking because it is true, Adichie tells the story of the Biafran-Nigerian war. This is a book you must read.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the film. the 3D effects were fantastic & made you really watch the film. I thought the screen play was very good as well as well as the acting. It was a very good prequel to the Wizard of Oz.
0451205766|5.0|great read after seeing movie numerous times. my husband is a big fan of the book and movie. interesting to see how book compares to movie.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I give a lot of series good ratings because they have 15 minutes to intrigue me or I don't watch anymore!  This one had me going from the first few minutes and now I'm hooked!  I rarely get sick, but when I do, I find a good series and enjoy it while getting better.  Now that I'm better I have to find time to watch this!  Can't wait to watch all the season...

1451626096|4.0|I found this book awesome -- easily one of Philippa Gregory's best. Although I still haven't read two books in this series (I am definitely going to re-read this once I get to those), I thought this novel did a fine job of tying up many of the loose ends that exist in the series in exciting, dramatic ways.<br /><br />Reading this book was a fascinating, fun experience. If you like Philippa Gregory and any of the novels in The Cousins' War series, this is a must read.<br /><br />As usual, Gregory's new book was a pageturner -- I was hooked for two days straight.<br /><br />FYI, I was lucky enough to win my copy through the Goodreads first reads program.
B002KKCWP4|3.0|Got this sandal in black with yellow trim as a gift. I have been using it all summer. I like that the sandal has a good fit and is mostly comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I have 2 dislikes - the sandal strap material seems to attract dust because of which the color soon appears charcoal grey instead of black, giving the impression of being worn out and dirty. Secondly, the sandal design has straps overlapping in the velcro area on the top and back of the foot, which are a bit uncomfortable. Everytime I wear the sandal I have to insert my finger between the strap and foot in both spots to straighten the overlapping straps - more annoying than discomforting.
B000683VI4|5.0|Yes its a chick flick, but the best one!! Have trouble remembering movie titles I've seen but not this one!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think this is a really cool game it's just that it is in a dumb version you can't eat
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Surprised my daughter!  She collected the whole series!  Even adults would enjoy this one. Very talented people in this series.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Why would I want to take a picture of myself??? I wanted to be able to capture pictures of family, events or video without it pointing at me.  I couldn't figure out how to even TAKE a picture much less capture an image of my  dog sitting on the floor in front of me. What's with that? Am I just that  stupid??
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This equal, just like its predecessor was riveting and fully immerse. I found it difficult to put down at times. I started reading this series expecting a typical shallow sex/romance. I was surprised to be pulled into the thoughts, lives and emotions of these amazing people. I immediately purchased each successive book for my kindle app upon completing the one I was on. I would happily recommend this series for anyone enjoying immersion into the lives of such intelligent complex people.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Too hard to 'get out of' the app.  It  is okay6 other wise. It was neat that I found an item on the first try.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|Highly recommend. Some sad and dark parts but great meaning to the story. Loved the storyline and portrayal of long loved childhood characters!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Just a nice way to be able to listen to one of my favorite artists while I am on the go.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|This is a movie that you will want to watch more than one time, just because there are so many interesting twists to the plot that you might miss in the first viewing. Bradley Cooper is outstanding in this movie. A very intense drama that will entertain you again and again.
B001XUPGLY|5.0|After Khan....this is my favorite of the Star Trek series.  I love San Francisco and it is fun to watch the interactions.
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek succinctly shares his true business success experience and the reasons for it. The book is an easy, quick read which will prove invaluable to anyone considering his or her future. Walk with Derek. Let him tell you what worked for him. Consider your own decision. And, then, make it. You will think back to Derek's truths often as you pursue your own success.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|After getting Prometheus, the standard definition set just couldn't cut it anymore.  Does not look dated on blu-ray, and 3D conversion on the tv makes it look even better.  The packaging itself is awesome as well.  Getting this on special for $19 was quite the bargain!
B00499QUK2|5.0|For Sherlock Holmes fans, the updating is cleverly done, the acting is good and the production is nicely carried off.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I admit that 2009's \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" started out pretty shaky with the cartoony action sequence after the opening credits (Stryker's force raiding a facility in Nigeria), but the film found its footing and kicked total axx. I like it for the most basic reason people like movies: The story and its characters pulled me in and kept my attention; I was entertained, pure and simple. How so?<br /><br />For one thing, the movie effectively accomplished precisely what it set out to do - unveil Wolverine's origin. It shows Logan's early family, however brief; it establishes his relationship with his brother, Victor; it shows his participation in all the American wars since the Civil War in an excellent opening credits sequence; it establishes his relationship with Stryker and the US government; it shows his inner conflict between universal morality and being an animalistic killing machine; it establishes his capacity for true love and heroism (Kayla and the old couple, as well as going back to save the mutants at the end); it shows how his bones became reinforced with adamantium; it effectively shows how he lost his memory; and why he's known as Logan/Wolverine.<br /><br />This isn't some mindless action/CGI flick with little dramatic valleys or depth, as some have criticized. As just noted, the film starts out with a dramatic sequence from Logan's youth and proceeds with the dramatic montage of various wars during the opening credits. This effectively sets the tone that \\"Wolverine\\" is a serious superhero film, like the three X-Men films before it. From there we get touching moments with Kayla, both early in the story and later; as well as dramatic lulls with Victor, Stryker, the old couple, the black guy in New Orleans (I forget his name), Gambit, Cyclops and Professor X.<br /><br />As far as depth goes, we get Wolvie's intense struggle between flesh and spirit, which we can all relate to one way or another - will he selfishly and greedily use his powers to be a moral-less killing machine at Stryker's beck & call or will he use his powers for the good of humanity? Will he take the high pay from the government or will he be content making $18,500 as a lumberjack? We also get his discovery of love with a moving relationship with Kayla, his later struggle with betrayal, and then understanding and forgiveness for Kayla's plight (her concern for her sister). Not to mention a certain character's powerful admission of genuine love at the end. Furthermore we get Victor's headfirst plunge into lawlessness with zero respect for life other than his own but then - surprisingly - evidence that he still possesses a sense of loyalty to his blood kin. This shows that even one of the main villains isn't one-dimensional. In addition, near the end we see Cyclops as a boy trusting the still small voice he hears somewhere within, which leads to salvation and Xavier, an obvious type of the Holy Spirit or what have you.<br /><br />One aspect I really liked was the build-up of mystery regarding Stryker's \\"island\\" lab for mutant experimentation. When Wolvie & Gambit fly over it and it's location is finally revealed it's a thrilling revelation. From there the final act just builds to an explosive climax with the creative destruction of something, the deliverance of the mutants and the revelation of how Logan completely lost his memory.<br /><br />As far as all the criticism about Wolvie's claws, particularly in the bathroom scene, so they look a little cartoony, so what? They're obviously a reflection of the comic medium of which the film is adopting.<br /><br />Let me end by addressing some other common criticisms:<br /><br />The helicopter explosion: This was thrown-in for the explosion and simply to show Wolvie's ultra-coolness. Logan would have no concern about the explosion due to his mutant healing factor; after over 150 years - so many wars and so many mortal wounds - such an experience was now mundane.<br /><br />The dialogue in the non-action scenes: I thought a lot of this dialogue was witty and busted out laughing 7-10 times during the film. As far as the verbiage being weak, it's a Wolverine flick where most of the characters are warriors or kids, not James Fenimore Cooper.<br /><br />Kayla's moon parable: This was worth it just for the hilarious \\"Koo-koo-ka-choo\\" line and I found it a very creative touch. Not only does the legend link to Logan & Kayla's relationship, including Logan accusing her of being the \\"trickster\\" later in the film, it provides Logan his namesake, Wolverine! In short, it wasn't some worthless tale thrown in just to show Kayla was Native American.<br /><br />Criticisms about Deadpool: The movie is showing Deadpool's FIRST appearance only; after all, it's \\"X-Men ORIGINS.\\" As far as his twirling head and the laser eyes destroying the tower - how awesome and creative! Film is a visual medium and they knocked it out of the park with this one. As for Deadpool being silenced, stick around for the post-credits scene.<br /><br />The bullet to the brain: This was the perfect way to explain Logan's complete memory loss. Think about it: Being shot in the brain is the closest to death Logan would ever come, but his healing factor kicked in and renewed the damaged brain tissue. His restored brain would be as good as new, but with Logan's memory wiped clean.<br /><br />The inclusion of mutant kids as hostages supposedly just for the fun of putting names there: The movie's called \\"Wolverine\\" so it focuses mainly on him, but it's also called \\"X-Men Origins\\" and so naturally details the very beginning of the X-men. I enjoyed seeing Cyclops as a kid in the film, but I'm glad they didn't take the focus off Wolvie by getting bogged down with Cyclops' story or anyone else's.<br /><br />GRADE A-n scenes: I thought a lot of this dialogue was witty and busted out laughing 7-10 times during the film. As far as the verbiage being weak, it's a Wolverine flick where most of the characters are warriors or kids, not James Fenimore Cooper.<br /><br />Kayla's moon parable: This was worth it just for the hilarious \\"Koo-koo-ka-choo\\" line and I found it a very creative touch.

B001XUH69Y|5.0|A movie that I've seen many times, with great actors, and one that I never get tired of watching again.
0345529057|5.0|After hearing people talk about the Game of Thrones TV show I finally decided to rent the first season and give it a try (I don't have HBO).  I enjoyed the first season so much I watched it all in like 2-3 days, despite working and having a toddler.  When I mentioned to friends how much I enjoyed it - everyone said I should read the books.  Absolutely most addicting thing I have ever read.  I read all 5 books in about 2 months.. again.. despite working, toddler, and other daily demands.. I found every chance I could to read them.  I'd give more than 5 stars if I could.  His writing is amazing, the plot, the twists, the way things connect back, the character development... I can't wait for the 6th book (Winds of Winter) to come out!  I'm hooked!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Interesting but to vague on each person.  Could have been more exciting and less bouncing around.  Not my favorite at all.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent book for everyone who wants to learn and understand the times of turmoil and calamity which accompanied the formative years of Christianity and the life of Jesus of Nazareth. One may dispute the author's conclusions but the scholarly value of the book is impossible to deny.
B007EE5820|5.0|Really enjoyed reading about such an inspirational and positive person.  I was a fan to start with, but had no idea of the depth of Arnie's character. Very human.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I like a good thriller but there was too much credibility stretched in this latest installment. Nazi's on an island in Brazil? Really? Bullets all over the place and magically he never gets touched despite marksmen shooting?
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|So I finally got around to watching this movie just last night. I had many friends say it was a really cute movie. Now I know for some (including myself) kind of become hesitant on certain Disney movies in today's day and age. I must say though, the direction they went with this movie was quite excellent. I absolutely LOVED all of the video game arcade characters/references, the music, the story of Ralph,and the references to computer programming. Definitely not the movie I would have grown up with as a kid but still enjoyed it! It's hard not to love this movie.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Really well written.  Entertaining yet informative.  Fascinating insights.  Required reading for every American.  I will have all of my kids read this book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved this game!!! It really kept YOU thinking but, the feeling of achievement to get to the next level was fun!!!I would also like to find more gAmes like this one!
147674355X|5.0|If there's one thing I learned growing up, it's to always listen to my mother. And when my mother tells me to read a book (she recommended) when I have the time, she actually means \\"you better read this book before I disown you\\". You think I'm kidding? I'm not. So obviously me being the obedient child I am, I read Hopeless as soon as my mom told me to. Add the fact that I absolutely love Colleen Hoover, it didn't take that much convincing for me to read Hopeless. When I say that I love Colleen Hoover, I literally mean, I love her. If she wasn't already married to Tina Reber, I'd totally tweet her everyday until she gave into my creepiness.<br /><br />Hopeless exceeded my expectations and more. The story, the characters, everything latched onto my heart until all I became was a hopeless little mess. I laughed guffawed, I cried bawled and I felt experienced with the characters. While I was in Colleen Hoover's world, I was no longer Louisse, stalker and blogger extraordinaire, I became Sky, a home-schooled, technologically disabled teen girl. (I , unfortunately, didn't actually get to hook up Holder along the way, that was all in my head. Lucky Sky.) To say that this book was intense would be the biggest understatement of the year. I honestly didn't even see half the book coming, I felt like The Hulk threw a fourteen-wheeler truck at my head when the story started unraveling. If someone were to ever receive an award for the best/most plot twists in a book, it would have to be Colleen Hoover. You won't see anything coming.<br /><br />Sky is definitely one of the best heroines I have ever read about. She's not your typical witty/snarky prtoag, Sky's is the type of girl who's mastered the art of deadpan. Being inside her mind was both fun and really painful. Sky is such an expressive person... on the inside. On the outside, she seems really closed off and pretty suspicious, most likely because she was raised by only her mom, Karen and no one else. She's been cooped up inher home for the last few years (and yes, she's home-schooled.) Sky is the perfect example of a teenager in the twenty-first century who can live without technology. I repeat, without technology. Nada. Non. El zip-o. I'm sure that you're all pretty suspicious yourselves as to what goes on at the Davis household but I assure you, nothing nefarious. I think that the only time I actually saw Sky get flustered was when she met Holder. You could just tell that a little something-something was going on between them but as I have said, Sky is the type of person who's always calm and collected. She's not the kind of girl who inwardly flails over a guy because of his extreme hotness, which is a relief. There's a consistency to Sky's personality that is really good and the way Colleen Hoover fleshes her out, she really does turn into a real human. A person that you can relate to and appreciate (and squee over Holder with.) Sky definitely has a lot of comical moments, moments where you will find yourself laughing out loud, like, legit LOL-ing. As the book goes on though, you'll definitely see different sides of Sky (no, she does not have a multiple personality disorder.) It was hard seeing such a strong person so vulnerable and I actually felt my chest ache for her. The way Colleen Hoover creates characters that you'll invest yourself in really amazes me. I got attached to every single one of the people in this book, and Sky isn't the only one who fell in love with Holder...<br /><br />I'm the type of reader who falls in love with practically every fictional guy I read about but with Holder, I didn't just fall for him, I think I imprinted on him too. *cue Twilight music* But joking aside, Holder has to be one of the most complex male characters I have ever read about. He is so invested in Sky's life that you can actually see that he'd literally do anything for her. Most people judge Holder because of his past misbehaviors but I feel like people misunderstood him. He's been through so much, he's lost important people in his life and he just needed an outlet for all that anger. My heart broke for him reading about all the things he went through, all the pain and anguish he felt. You can clearly see that Sky was the only shooting star in his everlasting night, that she was his salvation. Holder treasured Sky and treated her with outmost care, but not too much to be doting. I love their chemistry together, they went so smoothly together that you can see how much they truly belong together. Sky and Holder's moments together never failed to warm my heart.<br /><br />As I'm typing this, I'm actually recollecting everything that happened in Hopeless and there are literally tears in my eyes right now. Hopeless is easily the best standalone novel I have read (and is currently my favorite of Colleen Hoover's books. I'm still waiting for Losing Hope though.) I can still remember all those intense emotions I felt reading Hopeless, I felt hopeless myself while reading the latter parts of the book. I felt helpless and quite honestly, useless. I wanted so badly to be able to help Sky in her ordeal but I just knew that I couldn't. All I could do was read on and see what would happen next. I worried and worried but I knew that everything would be okay as long as Holder and Sky were together. I don't think Sky would've been able to to make it through without Holder to hold her hand throughout the whole thing, he was her rock and guide. Her very own guardian angel.<br /><br />The scenes between Sky and Holder are absolutely the sweetest things you'll ever read. They are not only swoon-worthy but will also leave you hot and bothered. They're innocent and yet there's an underlying tension as well. Especially the Firsts! Someone fetch me a glass of cold water please! *swoons* So intense. *dreamy sigh*<br /><br />I think that Sky had a lot of angels surrounding her though. Her mom, Karen, for one. Her best friend, Six and her Mormon friend, Breckin, too. They were all there for her even though they weren't completely in the know, they grounded her and they were her comfort. They were her \\"normal\\" when everything was in complete chaos. And some of them also had the answers she was looking for.<br /><br />I am so completely amazed as to how Colleen Hoover wrote Hopeless. Even the smallest of details were carefully thought out and perfectly executed, you never would've seen it coming. I'm not sure if you've watched Book of Eli (starring Denzel Washington) but if you have, do you remember that moment when you found out in the end that he was actually blind, and you kept trying to remember his tells from the very beginning of the movie? It was exactly like this. As things will start to unravel in this book, you'll keep wondering how you missed those little details. You will be left speechless once you find out all these hidden facts. You'll realize how everything little thing is actually connected and when you find them, you'll wonder how you didn't see it. Colleen Hoover, you are a genius.<br /><br />Hopeless was, in my opinion, Colleen Hoover's best book so far. I am so relieved that my mom is a complete Colleen Hoover addict that she bought Hopeless as soon as it was published in the Kindle store. There are moments where you will find yourself laughing and enjoying the book and then suddenly have 360-turn and find yourself crying your eyes out. Hopeless is what other books what to be but probably won't ever become, it's dynamic and powerful. It will rock you to your very core and then some. And the way it ended? It was perfect for me. I cried at the ending, btw. Like, literally at the very last page. I was both relieved and saddened with how it all went down, but I was completely satisfied. I cannot recommend Hopeless to people enough. This book will change you as much as it changed Sky's life. I lived this book and I will live it for many years to come.<br /><br />Rating: 6/5<br /><br />Official post: [...]rs.blogspot.com/2013/05/review-hopeless-by-colleen-hoover.html

B001TK80C0|1.0|I have now purchased two of these, and returned both, with prompt refunds by Amazon----both will not play, and it is not the VCR/DVD player......what's up with that??  Is all the stock bad?????
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This novel is a love story but also has a mystery to be solved. I was so intrigued by the title and love to read about the Irish. When I  read how orphaned children were treated until just a few years ago shocked me and made me very unhappy. I had no idea. I really liked the characters and how people are so resilient. I hope to read more from author, Christina McKenna. She is a great memoirist. I was happy that the two main characters, Jamie and Lydia, found their ancestor y. It was a really good novel.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|His discussion of the historical milieu was well written and did provide an appropriate foundation for an inductive interpretation of the historical Jesus.  He will be criticized for demythologizing Jesus but on close examination this is really not going to be the case for those truly believe in his deification.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Another rip off of candy crush. In a desperate attempt to get my daughters Kindle Fire (birthday present) to play her favorite game, I downloaded this P.O.S.
B003E74B24|5.0|There are things love--and things to frown at--in Chef Ramsay. Importantly, all of it makes an appearance in this autobiography, just as it does on nearly every TV broadcast Ramsay does. I often wonder how much of a celebrity personality is deliberate and affected. Ramsay is so consistent, however, that I really think he is this passionate (and nuts). The guy has no brake pedal. I can hear the words tumbling in rapid, disjoint heaps onto the page, just as they do on the screen.<br /><br />Brilliant read. It's everything an autobiography should be. Here's hoping for another installment down the road!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|A good substitute for the candy crush game.  My daughter actually plays this game. Six more words are required to submit.
B009C7JS14|5.0|I love this app! it is so handy on my kindle I can just pull it down from the home screen and it will tell me what temperature it is!!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This product is O.K.  but you need to make sure you enter your child's age because the game needs to be adjusted for age. Even after setting it, my daughter needed to &#34;bug&#34; me several times to keep playing.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|The move and novel are quite different, but the movie is still worth seeing. Would read the book first, though.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I don't usually choose books about Would War 2. I'm glad I chose this one. This book was well written, it gives a brief description of what Germany was like during that time. I'm also not one to get choked up over what was written but, the ending actually had me fighting back tears. Fantastic!!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Reese Witherspoon is a consistent actress; always lets us know she's an actress acting rather than a believable character.  I am hard pressed to see what the casting directors see.  She brings this movie down.  McConaughey worked hard as did the villians but everything seems so contrived and awkward.  I knocked a star off for sound and editing.  The lads gave a good performance but the regional drawl of these characters, while necessary, require the sound engineers to do a better job ensuring the audience can hear and understand the dialogue.  Several good lines are turned into mush by poor sound engineering and that's too bad.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I have been a long time Star Trek fan, and this is the first time I have purchased a set for the original series.  It was well worth it!  I won't go into too much detail, but I have a few things to point out.<br /><br />First, there are basically a few options - you can watch the original version in either original mono or updated stereo sound.  Or you can watch a newer rendered version with improved backgrounds and animations (due to computer CG overlay).  Also with either original or stereo sound.<br /><br />For the naysayers, the new computer rendering was based on original models and drawings for the show.  The team responsible for the newer renderings were original Star Trek designers who have worked on nearly every Star Trek show (you always notice Micheal Okuda at the credits?  Yeah, his team).  So you don't have Paramount sourcing some odd company for the CG rendering, instead you have a 40+ veteran of the series working on it.<br /><br />My one complaint is that you cannot bookmark your spot and change from the old to new rendering on the fly.  Instead you have to start the episode over again and forward to the part.  I actually recommend watching the entire series in the original style then watching it through with the new renderings.  That way you can see both versions.<br /><br />It's an amazing series, arguably as good as the later Star Trek series, although Picard was my favorite captain!  It's worth the price for any fan of the series.  If you have the series on DVD already, it might be worth checking this out for the interesting little finishing touches put on with the new CG rendering and updating.  I feel it's what they would have done if they had the technology or the budget.  Since all the updates are based on the original set design and artwork, it is at least sticking to the original concept.  Not like the Star Wars re-makes.<br /><br />Recommended!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|D. D-Lewis is simply one of the finest actors on earth.  His powerful yet delicate portrayal of a legend we have never heard nor seen before makes Abe Lincoln even larger, more powerful, more human and real.  Washington D.C. in 1865 is brought to us in firelight, sunlight, and darkness.  The technical staff did an outstanding job in all respects.  Thank goodness there is no aroma delivery system available to movies.  Spielberg is masterful here; in his directing and his ability to attract top talent and funding to make a powerful masterpiece.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|And the Mountains Echoed is a touching story of the injustices of war torn Afghanistan.  In the end it was the connection of  family  and all the people involved with putting it together.  Great read.

B00DURILJ2|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd and finally I got to watch it. I am from Arkansas and I was very happy with this movie. Loved the actors and thought the story line was very intriguing, it kept me wanting to see more. I was disappointed with the little kids cussing though. I guess the director thought this was necessary due to the boys upbringing or the lack there of. So if you are planning on watching this with small kids you might want to take that, and the sexual discussions that take place within this movie, into consideration. Otherwise, I absolutely loved this movie! I would watch it again and most definitely think it was worth the rental price, and I will be suggesting it to family and friends. Yes it does seem slow in parts but the story line most definitely carries this movie!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is such an amazing book I love it! I think it's really sweet that Jack will and summer were so nice to auggie! I would defiantly recommend this book to someone in need of a good read!!! Thanks to the authority for writing such a great book.

B00D6SBOWG|4.0|4 stars and could have been 5 except that the resolution on my machine does not allow the page to set up right. great graphics and enough intrest to keep it interesting. worth buying the full version as it unlockes a lot more content but is still a good free game.<br />My brother put me onto this game from his i pad and it works well on this . one of the better card/solitare games out there.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book that took me through a roller coaster of emotions. As I laughed, teared up and held my breathe through the events of Belle and Lavinia, I felt connected to both of them in different ways for very different reasons.  This was an excellent read.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Not in Japan Blu-ray set of Animatrix entered.<br />Model with bulky, cumbersome Collector's box is not needed.<br />I purchased a place in that.<br />Package brochure is in English, but the contents will be displayed automatically Japanese.<br />You have not written anywhere, but contains both Japanese subtitles and audio.<br />It is easy to clean up is a simple package, and I like it on your own preference.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I have played pinball for a long time. And this one is great for the beginner to the expert. It will keep you involved for a long time.
0307887448|4.0|This is a book I shared with both of my 20+ year old sons. Very enjoyable-- both for the game nostalgia and the writing.
B009NY43NY|3.0|A disappointing end to a series that started off as a &#34;can't put it down&#34; experience. The antagonists were random and not well developed, the storylines for characters throughout the series were too neatly packaged up, and Sookie's final fate was lame based on everything from the previous books in the series. Sad to see the series end this way...let's hope the True Blood  writers keep their writing more compelling.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|My grandson added this app. for me. I like reading my FB but it is hard to navigate for me. Keep going back to home then going back to FB it is back and forth.
B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard returned in 1987 4 years after their smash hit Pyromainia but by this point it was a different Def Leppard. It was the late '80s when glam/hair metal was at it's height of popularity and while many bands have become dated and their music doesn't hold up well or it was just a mistake in their career, Def Leppard did it right which worked and Hysteria was just as successful as their previous Pyromainia. We could hear the band heading towards a more melodic direction by Pyromainia but Hysteria goes even further towards pop-metal and introducing glam into the band's sound. Hysteria is equally good as Pyromainia but in a different way. It doesn't have the same raw edge which we heard on High N' Dry or parts of Pyromainia and it isn't quite as heavy but it was a good change in direction. Hysteria is melodic, refined and polished as well as it's production that gives it a very smooth flow throughout the album. Hysteria is probably the most accessible Def Leppard record as well which is a good introduction to the band which marks their height of popularity. It featured 7 hit singles as well Women, Rocket, Animal, Love Bites, Pour Some Sugar On me, Armageddon It and it's title track Hysteria which are classics that make the album worth it alone. As for my favorite track would have to be a tie between Excitable and Hysteria.<br />Hysteria, along with Pyromainia has Def Leppard in their finest hour or finest hours which we rarely see in bands. Hysteria is late '80s glam at it's finest and masterpiece of the genre as well for Def Leppard or just an essential part of classic rock in general.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Really like this weather app. I can add areas that I will be coming into and it helps me to understand the area for driving.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|The acting was terrible and so was the story.It was a waist of money.This was one of the worst movies ever
B009C7JS14|4.0|Well I goofed. I put the message with weather on Bingo. Maybe someone can straighten it out. Show I am getting ole.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow...I couldn't put these books down....read all three of them in five days....captured my full attention until the very end!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the book.  Did not want to put it down.  I would definitely recommend this book. I was so glad that my friend told me about it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|THIS APP IS SO AWESOME I SOMETIMES FORGET MY MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION TABLE AND SINCE I GOT THIS APP IT REALLY HELPED ME A LOT. SO I RECOMMEND THIS APP TO EVERYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD CALCULATOR.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Oblivion suffers from a recycled Hollywood plot and poor characterization (I never really cared about any of them), but it looks great and the acting is good enough to not detract from the view.
B0055EDCGU|5.0|I want y'all to know the condition of this album was amazing. No scratches at all and it played perfectly. I loved there songs on this album. It reminded me a lot of their Ascendency album. Gotta love Trivium!
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I am sorry the series ended....enjoyed all six seasons.  Could there be a Gossip Girl 2 coming with different characters but yet having some of the original cast members too.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Beautiful photography. Bad dialogue, slow plot, no story. We were very disappointed. Had really hoped for an enjoyable OZ story!
B000W046XK|5.0|There is no one better than Stacey Kent when it comes to mellow jazz. Wish she would tour US market much more.
B0081BU42O|5.0|So. We meet the Gzilt, a militarized, hierarchical, and deeply religious far-flung intergalactic humanoid civilization that decided not to join the Culture at its founding. The Gzilt are  as old and just about as advanced, technically, as the Culture and has throughout its history maintained a distant, but mutually tolerant, relationship with it. The Gzilt have disturbing values, but, as a whole society, are in any event soon to Sublime, departing the Real forever. At least it will if nothing disturbs a key underlying societal assumption. What involves the Culture in all this? Its relationship with the remnants of another predecessor civilization, now Sublimed, that tries to get a message through to responsible authority in the Gzilt bearing importantly on that key societal assumption. That effort comes to a bad, if comically presented, brutal end with far-reaching consequences. One is to crack the unity of those at the top of Gzilt society who learn of the message, some bent upon suppressing it by any and all means and others, persuaded by it, determined to reveal it. These events attract the attention of certain Culture ship Minds, who set about trying to get to the bottom of what has happened and why. The interactions, differing personalities, and variable values and interests of the ship Minds as they undertake this task, without any clear view of what they might do with the results of their search, if anything, tell us more than we could have guessed about their natures and their own society.<br /><br />The Hydrogen Sonata itself? Another amazing Banks concept: music created by an ancient, Beethovenesque composer for an unusual instrument (one not yet in existence when composed) and considered all but impossible, technically, to play. That work has been studied life-long by a delightfully conceived Gzilt female (a called-up reservist officer of lower rank in the Gzilt military) who has physically altered herself to enable her to perform it. For reasons reachingback to her days as an exchange student with the Culture, she becomes enmeshed in and a key part of the Minds' efforts to unravel the Gzilt mystery.<br /><br />The tale, mimicking the  music of Hydrogen Sonata as it is described, might be said to present intercultural drama as a composition.<br /><br />If you like the Culture series, I need not tell you to read this. But I'd make it the last one after the others.<br /><br />It is a great shame that this is in fact the end of the Culture novels. I wish someone would pick up the themes of this series and carry them forward for years to come. It is too much, though, to ask some new author to do this -- to attempt to replicate the imaginative and narrative skills, the insights into behavior and societies, and all the rest offered to us by the now departed Iain Banks. Too bad he was not backed-up.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|My friends and many others are of two minds on this, the fourth volume of GRRM's epic series. Some say skip it, it only tells the tales of some of the less interesting characters, while others say it's fantastic ... I'm pleased to say I'm of the latter opinion. When I first  started the series, I wished for more plot and less depth, but now I'm savoring just how rich this world is.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|After reading many of the Reacher novels<br />I couldn't imagine how Tom Cruise, a whopping 5' 7&#34;, could portray Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Bottom line, Tom Cruise is a great actor. he created a absolutely believable Jack Reacher.<br />Frankly the movie will never make any top ten lists, but I enjoyed it immensely and<br />this was simply Tom Cruise.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|In my opinion this is one of Mr. King's masterpieces.  As a child I used to fear the toilet, thinking something was going to come up through the pipes and grab my behind while I was sitting there.  Now I know I was right!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A very well-written mystery.  Good characters, good plot development, great suspense.  Clues are perfectly placed, and the storyline is cohesive and well-crafted.  Great summer read.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
B006LXQID8|5.0|Though this is in French - it is captioned in English. Very easy to follow and quite humorous. But this is really for women. My wife had a hoot watching it and would say give it 5 stars - Believe me, if she did not think it was worth it she would say so.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|It's OK but nothing special.  You can get more and better information on other sites.  Just takes up another app space.
B0036EH3U2|2.0|I know I am going to offend many people.  So I hate to do this.  But I just can't help it.<br /><br />I don't deny there were novel and, maybe, some original, ideas in the writing.  That's why I give it at least more than 1 star.  But the entire screenwriting is so sloppy, so lame, so simplistic, so superficial, so unconvincing in development, so naive, so unbelievably dumb that I can hardly comprehend why so many people love it in craze.  Perhaps this is a reflection that we just don't see extraordinary talents often.<br /><br />As one example, the (future) intelligence depicted in the series is just lame and dumb.  The plot and story development is non-existing.  It is complete lack of imagination to write fighter dogfights at an age of space jumping in wormholes.  We understand our intelligence grows exponentially.  We know where we are now.  Perhaps it simply points out that when the series was made some 10 years ago, we were exponentially dumber (not stupid though).<br /><br />If you strip off the facade of a spaceship setting, which is the least futuristic, you can enjoy the soap drama in boring modern day American life.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are simply amazing in this... they poignantly tell many important emotional truths. Watch the entire &#34;Before&#34; trilogy -- Richard Linklater is a genius.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Excellent book with nice character development.  Read it straight through and will look at buying the next in the series.
0812982622|3.0|Although the writing was outstanding, the use of three narrators in the second part was not an easy read.  I wasn't always sure who I was reading about.  Although the picture of North Korea was devastating, none of the characters had an impact on me. I found the book less than anticipated possibly because of the Pulitzer an the blurbs on the cover and in the book itself.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|this is the first app i have ever paid for. it is intriguing and relaxing. i recommend this app to anyone looking for something different to try
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is the ABSOLUTE BEST show on Network TV!  When I found out about it, I had three seasons to watch to catch up...which I did over one weekend.  Watch this show.  Start with Season 1.  You will love it.  I promise!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|It is not &#34;controversial&#34;, but it is informative and thought provoking. It is not questioning or confirming a risen Christ.  It is about a man and his times.
0525952926|3.0|I love Ken Follett.  I have read everything he has written.  But I have to agree with the other Follett fans that this second book of the trilogy does not measure up to the first.  Perhaps because I read them together it was more noticeable.  But the character development and sequencing of Fall of Giants was far superior to Winter of the World.  Most notably for me, the last third of Winter got ... sloppy.  The writing did not seems as precise, the details were far fewer and it became nothing but a running transition to whatever the third book would be.  There was an abbreviated runup to the Berlin airlift and then \\"it continued for a year.\\" Next.  Characters who were on the front lines of WWII or captured showed up at the end with pretty much the same perspective and character they had always had, except the descriptions of physical breakdown. Every Russian soldier was there to rape several women when Germany fell.  Major historical events -- the kind you wait for in a time sequenced book -- get referred to offhand well after the event. (It happened in Giants too, when the tsar was shot). It was all very \\"let's hurry and scoop together the raggedy ends of the 45 characters in this book because I am tired of this period of history and the contract for the next book is ticking.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps what triggered this reaction the strongest for was a particular howling error.  Follett went a long way toward explaining how he interwove real characters with fictional ones, researched speeches and locations etc. etc.  He also mentioned two people who corrected his descriptions of life in Germany.  How then, did he come up to a reference to the Washington Nationals baseball team?  It was odd enough that a character was wondering what Jacky Jakes, a black actress turned waitress, did in her spare time in the 1940s. It was odd to me that he thought maybe she followed the two main Washington sports teams, enough to mention them by name, the Redskins and the \\"Nats.\\" What? TheDC baseball team from the 1890s until 1971 was the Senators.  Then DC was without a baseball team until the Nationals in (wait for it) 2005!  So no matter how solidly he did research, this kind of thing comes across as a major disappointment and leaves a huge question about the accuracy of the rest.  No, I don't read works of fiction and expect them to be historically accurate.  But please, if you are going to crow on about the effort to be accurate, don't overlook that you needed someone in the US to read the manuscript for gross inaccuracy as well as the other countries involved.<br /><br />I hope more care goes into the third book, especially if it is set in a time that a lot of us living still remember.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Up to about the 20% complete point I really didn't know if I was going to finish or not but it turned around and I can honestly say it's one of the best books I've read in a very long time! I didn't see the ending coming at all [I hate when I can], it really is an outstanding book, I'm just sorry I'm finished!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|There is something so satisfying about MC's writing. This book didn't disappoint. As usual, I can't wait to read the next!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does what it says on the tin, couldn't be happier. It has a full breakdown of the time remaining for each of your apps.
B0037OOU8O|1.0|Any serious reviewer can tell how good a movie is after ten minutes. I didn't like the first thirty, but I would have watched the rest IF Amazon hadn't deleted the file while I was watching it. I know they have this 24 hour rule, but come on, give me a break. I had started to watch the movie at 6:30 pm and it truly put me to sleep. I go back to watch the rest at about the same time the next day and IT'S GONE! Kind of a weird movie; not worth seeing again. Hey Amazon, you guys are real stinkers.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Poor white girl winds up in the slammer, finds it unpleasant. The end.<br />Save yourself the money and the time.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|this was sweet,sad,funny but so so honest.  great movie.  the men are hot but real.  would watch again and absolutely recommend it.
159463176X|5.0|If only I had the eloquence of Khaled Hosseini, I could do this book justice with my review. Loved it!
B00C7JGDBW|3.0|I had heard a lot of great things about this movie before watching it. And maybe that was the problem. I went into the movie with preconceived notions of how great it would be, but after watching it, I honestly didn't know how to feel about it. It wasn't that I hated the movie, but I also wasn't ecstatic over it.<br /><br />\\"Oz The Great and Powerful\\" provides a great backstory to the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" movie. Most of the acting was superb! Rachel Weisz, Mila Kunis, and Michelle Williams all did wonderful jobs portraying the good and wicked witches. James Franco - who I normally find to be a fine actor - only did an okay job in his role as Oscar Diggs/Wizard of Oz; for a good chunk of the movie, he seemed to be phoning in his performance. Visually, the movie was absolutely beautiful. And the connections to the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" added a nice touch to the movie (for example, \\"Oz The Great and Powerful\\" starts out in black and white and transitions into color when Oscar Diggs arrives in Oz, much like how the original was in black and white and Dorothy landed in Oz).<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth watching at least once!
B009GX69RK|5.0|This is just a great show 5 characters that have great chemistry. You leave smiling and laughing. Can't be better than that right????
B006S01GH2|5.0|I really enjoyed this film - even though I am not familiar with French language or customs. This was an entertaining and lovely film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its an awesome game and it makes u us your head to get outta the room and you have everything u needing every room u just gotta put it together like a puzzle and I love puzzles so I really really love this game and hope the coming soon rooms will come fast cause I wanna keep playen
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I play this one so often and love the different levels. Having a blast with it all the time now!
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book, it was a little quirky and almost inspiring.  I think it would be a great book for book club chats would recommend it to other readers.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great story with a surprise ending. Kept me excited and interested throughout. Glad to see a Vietnam Vet made to look good. Wonder how many other Clydes there are out there homeless
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played this game twice now and it never fails to disappoint. Gorgeous graphics and a cool storyline make this a winner in my book. More like this, please!
B007DIQC90|5.0|My daughter heard &#34;King and Lionheart&#34; on the radio on each day, and made it her mission to find her own copy. As she's 7, I got caught up in the chase, and we listen to this together. I'm very fond of this band now, and my daughter is expanding her musical repertoire. Thank gods it was never Barney!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Definitive look at society present and possible future.  What is humanity when ALL the rules are changed. Interesting look at war in a variety of cultures. Zombies, unchecked virus, war, survival - heartbreaking.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I use this to track my medical and tax info. I use ti for recipes, for iteneraries and for shopping lists! This is so versitile!
B00AUA67GQ|2.0|I guess I expected different results Not really sure how this app would be useful. If the app does not do more, may as well have a sig. app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play it when I watch TV during commercials or waiting in a doctors office.<br />Its hard to stop and I find myself having to play just one more game.
B002NNA9N0|4.0|As a career sales person, I can relate to part of this movie. The Alec  Baldwin few minutes is gripping.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I have downloaded this app three times and can not get it to open.  After it starts connecting it boots me out. Any suggestions?
B0063IH60K|5.0|when you are sitting and waiting it is a good diversion. I spend hours in doctor 's offices playing solitaire.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Don't understand why some people want every movie they watch to be grand literature or Oscar winning performances.  Red, and it's sequel, are just fun entertainment . . . easy light comedy and a little action thrown in for good measure.  O.K. a lot of action.  Enjoy.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've never read a book about IT that so clearly expressed how bad life in a bad shop can be. The first part of the book was full of totally relatable characters, agendas and situations. No one who has ever been through a cutover from Hell could fail to relate to the Phoenix go-live or the poor decision making that forced it. But this isn't a complaint or an appeal for someone to come up with a better way. The authors share concrete ideas about making things better, ideas that actually sound workable if the organization is in sufficient pain to make a change.  A wonderful book for any IT manager or architect. I downloaded it yesterday and already recommended it to around ten other people.
B005OH0OU0|5.0|One of my fav albums...I have it on LP. It puts me in a trance. I saw him at the JAZZ FEST in San Antonio TX (my town) and was thrilled. He is the master of the guitar, as well as a masterful singer and song writer.
B00B8BR1YS|5.0|Just as good the second time!  So many great lines if you are a Shakespeare buff!  Hope you enjoy it.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Love Opera--it responds as well as other browsers and has good features with it.  don't hesitate to use this app.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Easy read! James shows the way to get out of your rut...and GOD has he been in ruts before! Read this book and be inspired to pull yourself up by your bootstraps(or shoelaces) and get your ass in gear!
B00271HTLI|5.0|From beginning to end this is the best movie in the series.  Clever plot well executed.  Too bad this director did not do the rest of the movies....
0375869026|5.0|Enough said! And I never write reviews.  Amazon requires you to write at least 20 words for the review but they actually aren't necessary in the case of this book.  It is all of the things you'd like a middle school book to be for a parent as well as for a middle school child.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This will always be a favorite classic!  Who hasn't thought about the road not taken, or the one that got away!  What a fun story, and how bold to keep coming back together each year, luck them!
055357342X|5.0|A Storm of Swords is probably the best book in the series. The story is rich but what really drives you to turn the next page are the phenomenally written characters. You are so invested in the characters that you cheer for their successes and weep or get angry for their defeats. This book is full of exciting plot twists, major events, excruciating pain, and unexpected payoffs. The downside of the book is that it is quite long, descriptive, and can irritate those with a short attention span or lack of patience. If you have the time and patience to read this wonderful tome and the stomach to accept the fact that this series is not a fairy tail (good guys don't always win and neither do villains) then this book is for you!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Evanescence is the best!  I love this CD/DVD.  I exercise to it!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|Downloaded it for my granddaughter.  She loves playing games on the Kindle.  Funny how kids can figure things out faster than us older folks!!!!
B003C1QIO6|4.0|I had never Heard Jack Johnson until I discovered him on Amazon.  His voice is great,<br />the vibe is soft but with a pleasant rock beat.  Just a pleasant laid back vibe.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|When an update comes out, I have to play it untill I get all the starts and levels to their max without using any of the extra power items.  Eats up a lot of time but is fun.
1426308469|5.0|Our daughter who is really into dinosaurs, enjoyed reading this with me.  Each page had interesting facts and described unique features of each dinosaur.  Many photos also placed an average sized man next to the dinosaur so she could see how big each creature was compared to people.
B009CRJLHU|4.0|You can find my full review on fifty5centsbookblog dot wordpress dot com<br /><br />I recommend this book. It is a great college/New Adult book and Travis Maddox is a staple in today's leading fictional men.
B000687M48|5.0|I love this CD and the DVD.  I love to listen to this.  DVD is a great bonus.  Buy it!
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|One expects a movie like this (MMA star's entrance into film) to be thin, limp, and under-produced. I was pleasantly surprised to find it a taut, well made thriller. The action scenes were the spice, but the dish was satisfying on its own. I especially liked the editing, which wasn't MTV style cuts every 2.4 seconds. The long, drawn out pacing of scenes makes the occasional frenetic action more exciting. No one doubted Ms. Carano could handle the physical side, but she didn't let us down on the acting either. No cringe-worthy one liners or usual action star nonsense. I enjoyed watching this movie, and reccomend it as a thriller as well as a fight flick.
B000GY729M|4.0|This album has great vocals from Brandon Flowers, interesting words, and great rhythm.<br />Not a big rock fan, but I love Flowers voice, and the songs have great intensity.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I don't read as often as I would like but this book kept me engaged. I definitely recommend this book.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|slow at beginning and uses real time. get this only for people who have patience. make food, meet friends, chat, and more!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love this show. It's so well-done with plot twists and turns as well as believable, likable characters. We are looking forward to Season 4!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I play this on a Kindle Fire HD. I would have rated this a 5 except for the fact that I had to do a factory reset and lost all of my progress and friends. I have no idea what to do to get it all back. I'm using the same name.<br /><br />I like this game a lot. I've enjoyed the quests. I haven't had to spend any money. I just log out for a bit and let it build.<br /><br />It's a great game, I'm just very disappointed that I've lost all my progress and friends.
1607053888|4.0|This was a well-written book with lots of attractive bag designs. All of the bags are very easy to sew.  All-in-all this is a great book!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I'm still stuck on one level, but so far it's really fun. It's a great app! And plus, it's free!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Read this when you need a life distraction or a change from what you  typically read. It was my first time reading books like this but on the beach during the summer it was perfect and it's a good plane read.
B0096HFD8W|3.0|I'm not really a big sequel lover but this movie stuck to the original to the point it was predictable
B00957T6X6|5.0|Couldn't put it down for a moment. Can't wait for the next volumes in the series. I would highly recommend reading it
B002ZBZNPO|5.0|I love this album. This is where Amy Lee grew as artist. Everyone thought Ben Moody was Evanscence but he left group and this 1 showed Amy raw talent the best
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|4 stars only bc like most games, it entices you to spend extra $$ to complete some quests or keep up with feeding and harvesting... otherwise it's fun and easy, with patience  you could wait it out for free or skip some quests.
B0045INOCO|5.0|The first 15 minutes and the last hour are some of the fiest moments in film history.. The middle, while important and still good, does not live up to the standards set by the other scenes (unless you count the French Plantation Scenes in &#34;Redux&#34;).
B00846REIS|4.0|Total beach read super great for summer and to lighten things up after reading something deep. I've got a few others reading it now also.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This is by far the sexiest comedy ever written. It's not a romance novel because most of those leave you frustrated waiting for the good sex scenes. This book makes you wait but the laughs are so good that you don't care. The sex scenes are hot too.
B009NX88JU|5.0|hi - I especially loved the frances mcdormand character, even though it was a small part. Fun and good hearted and nostalgic!
0307950654|3.0|I love reading both PD James and Jane Austen.  This novel contains elements of both, but does not convey the brilliance of either author.  No one delivers Jane Austen except Jane Austen.  I have not read other books that try to mimic Austen, so I can't compare this effort.  But PD James made this appealing enough that I did read the entire book.<br /><br />Partial spoiler about the plot: If Lydia was in the coach she had to hear the shouted argument.  The cause of the argument is central to the mystery. But (unless I missed something) no one seems to bother to ask Lydia what she heard.  Any explanations or thoughts from others?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a great game I was a bit skeptical that it. that it was going be like temple run and subway surfer but is amazing I love it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderful writing, thought-provoking concepts, unique perspective. I loved the characters, the dialogue, the philosophical discussion within the book`s content. I finished this book in under 36 hours, the fastest I have read a book in quite a while.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I'm hooked. It is very twisty and I love shows like that. Patty Hewes is a very interesting character. Love it.
B0055OMBIU|4.0|However, I did not know what to expect, there are layers to the puzzle.  The first is tons of very small jigsaw pieces, almost too challenging for me and my children to tackle.  Overall, it is a fun family type project.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I really enjoyed this book as it tied in many of the characters in previous books. A little sad to see some go, a little happy to see some reunited but above all another history lesson and interesting facts neglected by academia.
8866135909|3.0|would have rather had a slimmer book and not so much junk info....additional info was cumbersome and space consuming. WORD.
B003K16P3M|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me after she finished it, pretty excited. So, taking her lead, I read it. And by read it, I mean I spent two days oblivious to the world outside of my book and only stopping to do my homework and eat. It was that good.<br /><br />The \\"graces\\" in the book are an idea that I have not seen before. Sure, I have read books where people have special powers, but this concept with the different colored eyes and the fear towards people with the gift of a grace is a refreshing treat. In most of the books, not all, the people with special abilities are rewarded and surrounded with luxury. In the books where they are shunned, they are able to hide their ability and conceal themselves. Not in Graceling, however. Their eyes give them away and they are used for the crown of their kingdom.<br /><br />Now onto the writing. I usually prefer books with a first person style of writing, but for Graceling, it doesn't matter. The story is told in a beautiful, descriptive way through the use of third person and is not hindered by the use of a ton of flowery metaphors and stuff. While some people may argue with me, I believe Ms. Cashore did a great job.<br /><br />I love Katsa! She is wicked awesome and is an amazing fighter. She has the grace of killing (or does she?) and she uses it to assist her evil uncle. Even though she does, she regrets every finger she breaks, especially the ones she believes did what was morally right. This proves, though she is a born killer and can physically kick the butt of anyone in her way, she is human. She has a conscience, and that is why I like her so much. She is strong and unbeatable, but she doesn't like hurting those who don't deserve it. She is relatable that way.<br /><br />Po and Bitturblue were very personable characters and I could easily be friends with them if they were real. I especially love that the third book of the trilogy is about Bitterblue and her future.<br /><br />An extra note: This is an empoweringbook, especially for a young woman. Katsa is inspiring to anyone and promotes woman's rights throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Overall, Graceling is an inspiring novel for anyone looking for an amazing heroine and an action-packed adventure.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Great detail, interesting and scary characters yet I did not like the end. Guess I am just a romantic and the surprise near the end almost ruined the book...almost.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed a USB-cable for the Kindle Fire, unfortunately my son left it our original cable at our Hotel by Lego World. It's his Kindle Fire, so urgency was important! I browsed the Internet, purchased, and it arrived ahead of schedule, wrapped looking brand new (I bought it used paid less). I have an i-phone, so I used the adapter piece and everything has been working fine. I would order from them again!
1575666286|5.0|Very interesting.  I am doing the green drink and have seen Improvement already. I think he was a big help to the health of us all.
B0063FGG22|4.0|For an older movie, it was still well done and kept you wondering what was going to happen to Cary Grant next.
B00821OX98|5.0|My family enjoys science fiction movies.  Falling Skies is exciting and has u biting your nails.  If u  enjoy being fascinated by someone's imagination and creativity. FALLING Skies is the show for you!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Just difficult enough to be challenging. Makes you think on some of them the longer you play. Great way to spend time while you wait in line, at an appt, or just to have fun.
1932907009|5.0|I  Got the product right away.  my son loves it. he is reading it now. Cant wait to finish it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Woven together like scraps of cloth, the story of Pari and Abdullah unfolds into something much larger and much more complex. So intricately woven, the story was at times confusing. The sections of separate lives, places, and times felt mixed up, like a bundle of sticks dropped on the ground and gathered out of order. Some characters didn't seem to matter on the journey towards the end, but I loved the story and the author's style all the same. Recommended for lovers of &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game brought back so many childhood memories for me. I'm so glad that this game is an app. I wished that you could be able to chat with your fellow opponents while playing the game to make it even more interesting. Lol  I think that would be so cool. Two thumbs up!!
B003QS9WIE|4.0|I thought the story line was excellent, and very well acted. I didn't rate this 5 stars as I found it a little hard to follow in places, due to the flashback scenes. In my opinion it's a pretty good movie, and will watch this one again.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I enjoyed the movie it was entertaining. There is a story line to it as sometimes evil may get ahead, but there are good guys that are watching out for such events.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you liked 50 Shades this is the series for you.  The first book is a little slow but by the end you will not want to set it down.
B001UEBHYS|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time. The plot line is compelling and it is beautifully constructed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun<br />you get 3 different maps to run in and lots oof minions you can choose from<br />this game is super fun and addicting :)
B004JK61K0|5.0|okay after a few MONTHS of trying to get email to send from my Kindle, I gave it to may granddaughter to &#34;fix&#34; for me.  She put K-9 on for me and it works very well.  Yeah!  I could read email before but couldn't send any.  Problem is solved!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After falling in love with the show I was expecting great things from season 2 and I was not disappointed. If you liked season 1 then season 2 will have you hooked!
0767817478|5.0|Remember the guy in the rubber suit smashing the toy buildings with his tail? Those shows were just for laughs. This Godzilla is way better, better acting, the use of computer enhancement was able to make a giant lizard real. And even though it is an older movie I bought this because my original movie was on VHS and who still have their vhs players. So I bought this on dvd so I could watch without commericals and the movie being chopped up due to time.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I love trilogys.  Except for when the third one ends...ha-ha!.  I just love to read and these historical novels are great.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This CD may not be for purist, but it is a marvelous mix of House and old Funk/Rock (think Earth, Wind and Fire).  I highly recommend it.  The songs are clean and tight.  The beat in infectious. Buy it and listen from start to finish.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|Great book. Would be a great book for teen girls to read. Very lovely and well written. Nice story, love Pollyanna
B004J4WLB4|5.0|But do you know what they mean?  Very good book, our book club picked it and we all liked it.  Strikes close to home as we have a Foster daughter that &#34;aged&#34; out of the system and almost 50 years later, we are still &#34;family&#34;.
B00DBSZ6ZC|4.0|Let your imagination take you to a far off place, other than --- say 1800's on our world. It's a fun film. Lots of gore and violence. Everything you want for an entertaining evening with nothing else to do. You have to let any logic go so you can get past the medieval machine guns.
B004LPLU4K|4.0|Great camera work, acting and story. Watched with our kids, they loved it. No bombs, no guns, no car chase, just good quality work.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I have the Blu-Ray,and now the CD.  I am going to load this is my iPod for listening at any time.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Good, but not great. It is worth reading if you like Neil Gaiman, as I do. Fast read and interesting characters.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I first read Dune in the 70s.  I enjoyed it then and much more now.  The ecology theme is so relevant.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Other than being bad at the game (which is a personal problem) I have no complaints. Fun and terribly addictive.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The quality of drama continues in both creative writing and portrayal of the saga surrounding the manor house at Downton Abbey. This series has become the benchmark for period portrayals of the very difficult survival and often tragic demise of landed gentry of Great Britain.  The third season of Downton Abbey did not fail to entertain, allure, and leave me hungry for the next episode. The plot continues to weave a tale worth waiting for as I look forward to season four.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Cool app, it's really easy to use. I can't say it's complicated at all. I like the video features too.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have read all the books and watched all the movies. I have been looking for a inexpensive Harry Potter DVD set. This DVD set fit the bill and did not break the bank. The DVD set was delivered in  timely manner and packaged so it would not be damaged. I have watched all the movies ran with no issues. I would recommend this DVD set to revisit Harry Potter and his adventures.<br /><br />PCEddie<br />[...]
B009XIXVU6|3.0|While, overall, I enjoyed this book, I found the story line somewhat fractured by the manner in which it was written.  It was a good book, just one that challenged the reader to keep the story line to the forefront.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Maybe the best movie of the year. Great story,  great music and great special effects.  I think it is Tom Cruise's best movie.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book has great and detailed information told in such a fun way. This book has 9 experiments about how you can create your reality. Each experiment has a clever name. For example: \\"The Alby Einstein Principle\\".<br />For me, the fun way it was written along with the titles of the principles helped me to relax and have fun. I think that is why it worked with me. The principles that worked the best for me were \\"The Dude Abides Principle\\" and \\"The Dear Abbey Principle\\".<br />I plan to use this book and it's principles over and over. I have recommended this to family and friends. Can't wait to hear about their results. A wonderful book!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It's great to play with family&amp; friends. Great for falling back and relaxing,....Warning...it's addictive,.. but bunches of fun, and it passes time. It is a great game to fall back on when there's nothing else holding your attention. I would recommend it to everyone!
B0010Z32OA|5.0|This is one of those movies which you will watch repeatedly not only because of the charmingly trip the story, but because of the interesting and complex performances from the actors.<br /><br />Initially this is a book and adapted for film, not by the author. Nonetheless, it has a lot of the same charm as the book most major plot points are Followed.  Moreover, changes between the book and movie helped the movie's pace and still maintain the integrity of the initial work.<br /><br />Finally, the casting choices were brilliant!
B00COHAUD4|1.0|They took my money and it never would load.  Kept saying try again later!  Kept trying and it would never load then it timed out.  very frustrating.
1439130833|4.0|It's wonderful! I read it everyday ..keeps me positive ..a must read for everyone ..gonna get other books too. Everyone should have it
0449808696|5.0|Great body of work.  It starts a little slow, but when Moss takes the reader inside the research processes used by the companies to shove taste and calories down our gullible gullets, things get very interesting and stay that way to the end.  What these white coats are doing to the nutrition-starved youth in the US should make every responsible parent stand up and take notice.  Heart disease & obesity begins in grade school unless kids are redirected to healthier lifestyles by their parents and others.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|the first to tracks litteraly gave me goose bumps when I played them.the rest of the cd is no acception.queensryche is back in full force!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well, you know minecraft for the pc? Well now you can play on the go!!!  It literally blew my mind when I saw this game! A game where you can create stuff in survival, or build in creative! When I found this I quickly asked for it, and got it!! I was really excited to finally play minecraft on my Kindle Fire HD! I would really recommend this game to anyone who likes to build.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you have GOT to try this game. you can play in el machos lair and fight evil minions or even el macho him self.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|My 10 year old daughter and I are addicted to this game. I installed it on both my tablet and the phone, and my daughter and I play it side by side to see who can complete the levels faster.<br /><br />Love the cute characters and difficulty levels. This game keeps my daughter busy while we travel, and it entertains me while I commute to and from work by train. Definitely would recommend this clean fun game to parents and kids alike.<br /><br />Plays well on my Galaxy s3 phone, and Samsung tablet.<br /><br />Love getting apps from Amazon appstore - free and paid apps I get from the Amazon appstore, I can download on any devices registered with my Amazone account!
144476490X|5.0|Great book great story. James and Bob story is very interesting and very in detail. Thanks for wonderful story and I would suggest this book to anyone who needs encouragement.
1451695195|5.0|It was inspiring and most believable, coming from one who is in a position to fully understand the workings of our brain. I recommend it to all my friends and family.
B00AB0AXU6|5.0|Loved this movie. Love this series. Excellent and entertaining. I have watched all series and would recommend. Great effects too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is what we have been waiting for! We cut the cable on Time Warner a few years ago, bought a roku, and never looked back. I have a few network shows I have been watching on my computer from time to time that were not available on the Roku. This changes everything! I can now stream anything on the internet directly to my HD tv! I'm completely in love!<br /><br />It works best with the youtube & netflix apps on my iphone as the shows streaming from the chrome browser on my computer tend to be a little less high quality (movies4k, ABC, CBS, USA Network, etc) but I am sure this will improve over time, and in the mean time, it's definitely tolerable.
B009A882D0|3.0|2 of the 3 cds are good , but the 3rd is recordings of live performances of truly inferior recording quality.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Wow.  What a movie.  Denzel went out of character to another level.  This movie really showed what happens in real life.  Outstanding movie.
1444777556|5.0|Great Book very interesting story. Love the story line, more info on street life is needed, Love Bob he is awesome.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to turn the pages to see what comes next.  I must admit it's my guilty pleasure!  Love it.
B004LPLU4K|4.0|This film is the preferred version for your kids and grandkids.  The BBC version is a poor second best. This very Victorian tale is a classic the whole family can enjoy.  Maggie Smith is a scene stealer as the nasty housekeeper!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not Harry Potter that's for sure...just seemed like a lot of messed up people and lousy situations.  Not what I expected.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. The actors are great, the characters are interesting, and I really liked the plot.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This movie is action packed.  Every segment of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  Denzel performed great as usual.
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|I could't enjoy this game. I really hate it and it did not bring any new idea.<br />I uninstalled it and I don't recommend anyone to download it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The dvd came promptly and we all enjoyed watching it. Waiting anxiously for future sequels to be available for viewing.
B004NELBPC|5.0|If you like news right on this is for you. Format is easy, pictures are clear and information is concise yet informative.AND it is free!!!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book! It's a little more twisted than most books involving a little teen romance. Very good read! I now have the next four books!
B0047Y17P2|4.0|I like the Lincoln Lawyer series.  I hope he writes more so I can continue to follow this character in the future.
B004I4M0A2|5.0|I needed an easy way to collect a wish list for insurance claim purposes,  without all the sign up and impending junk mail options,  and this did the trick!<br />I wish the main IKEA website link for Android was an option, but OK as it turned out!<br />I recommend this App!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|hours worth of fun and the kiddo likes to see the minions and laughs at the bananas everywhere. very interesting concept and helps with reflexes and hand eye coordination.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|My opinion is to put more time than 15 stinking minutes on this game. Candy Rufus games should put like 30 minutes. I always get mauled by a bull or something like that. I can't even build a house on cruel mode. Put more time on here who's with me out there.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's a lot of fun and you don't have to be smarter than a 5th grader to play it. In fact some of the clues are very easy.
B008Q08008|5.0|An incredible and moving account of what Wladyslaw Szpilman and the Jewish people had to endure with the horrific attrocities of the nazis, while at the same time the movie shows that not all Germans believed in Hitlers evil ways.  Adrian Brody did a remarkable job portraying Szpilman, and was well deserving of the Oscar award.  This movie is well worth purchasing.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I have seen this movie twice now. I loved it even more the second time. I can't wait to watch it again. It is so full of emotion, of kindness, of the best sort of love.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I have watched Die Hard 1-4 minimum of 5 times each.  I will not be watching this one a second time.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Die Hard Movies when the characters were what drove the movies.  While \\"Live Free and Die Hard\\", relied heavily upon their special effects it was the characters, both the ones I rooted for and the ones I hated that kept me interested.<br /><br />In this, the latest of the series, I was beginning to wish everyone would just die and get it over with.  It felt like a series of action sequences that were stapled together with a quip.<br /><br />I could list each of my issues out, scene by scene, but they would go on and on.<br /><br />I would have thought that my dislike would come from Bruce Willis' age, that is not an issue.  The issue is the character interactions, whomever wrote the script was paid too much for too little substance.<br /><br />Personally, if you haven't seen this one, don't bother, you aren't missing anything except a lot of explosions.  But then if you like explosions this has some very good ones.  Unrealistic, but then this is Die Hard.
086571701X|5.0|a must read for every gardener and every self-supporting DIY'er out there.  This gives you a really good base of knowledge to work from on your own project in aquaponic gardening.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the game but the version 0.7.1 sucks. I can't even get multiplayer. Can't wait till the next update comes out
