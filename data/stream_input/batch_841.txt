0545128285|2.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard does not live up expectations at all. There aren't many \\"tales\\" at all, and they are all 1) short, 2) trite, and 3) boring. The faux \\"notes\\" from Hogwarts characters are trite and silly. Even die-hard Potter fans should pass this book up. Not worth the money at all. (Takes about 30 minutes for an adult reader to finish the entire book, by the way.)
B000069KE0|5.0|I remember this being a strongly anticipated release when it came out on LP.  I also remember the disappointment at the quality of the audio on side 2 (the \\"Ballet\\").  When I picked up the CD release in the 80s, sadly the quality had not been improved in the transfer.  Of course, I had to give the 2002 remaster a try, in the hope that someone had taken the time to do a proper transfer from the original multitracks.    It's not bad; in fact, I do believe it's an improvement over the 80s release.  But the \\"Ballet\\" still sounds as though it was taken from a copy of a copy of the original tape.  The rest of the album sounds just fine; in fact, it looks like the mastering team took plenty of care with the tapes and backed off the aggressive noise reduction used in the 80s.  I wish it sounded as good as the first album, but if you listen to the music you won't be disappointed with what this group created!    Incidentally, I've heard some fulsome praise for the DTS (DVD-Audio) release of this album.  Don't be deceived; while the DVDA is a bit cleaner than the CD, someone got the bright idea to compress the living heck out of the dynamic range, resulting in another victim of the \\"loudness war\\".  The remastered CD at least has more dynamics and (again, except for the \\"Ballet\\" which benefits from any increase in clarity) is probably your best choice.

0198326769|2.0|When buying this book I didn't know it wasn't written for adults. The style was clearly aimed at children and made the book less enjoyable for me (for as far as a book on this subject can be enjoyable).     Because the story is so unrealistic (I don't think children in Auschwitz were able to sit by a fence every afternoon, Shmuell could have just walked out of the camp) I didn't get taken away by the story as much I would have liked to.     The end sentence was also to obvious.     I think the book would have been better if it had been written from an all knowing perspective.
0061537934|5.0|Who knew a dog could write so well?  I really enjoyed the view of life from a dog's vantage point.  This book has a little bit for everyone.  For dog lovers, the dog's eye view.  For guys who enjoy racing, some intersting ties of a life philoshphy to the physics and mental aspects of auto racing, and for the lady's a story about life and a custody battle. I hope Enzo writes another book soon.

B000N6TX1I|2.0|The movie tries to be Very Relevant And Topical by littering the scenery with terrorists and mistreated immigrants. The director obviously took a how-to-film-a-bleak-dystopia course at a community college, so the mise-en-scene is properly gray and gritty. But the movie is enough of a hack job, the premise dull and the characters hollow, that my internal alarm \\"this movie is never going to get anywhere\\" started ringing really loud after ten minutes. When that happens I give it ten more minutes to show some promise. It didn't. *click*
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I read a quote on \\"In Rainbows\\" that stated Radiohead had finally met expectations by reaching them. I can certainly echo this statement, and perhaps even stake the claim that this may well be Radiohead's best album. Certainly a huge claim, but \\"In Rainbows\\" is a wondrous album.<br /><br />I will keep things short as many reviewers have picked apart and detailed individual songs and themes. So, most importantly for me, \\"In Rainbows\\" treads that impossibly difficult line of being mostly accessible yet surprisingly lasting. It simply does not tire. Months and months of sporadic listens and I still become totally involved and immersed, a feat that separates truly great albums from good ones. The overall sound of the album perfectly blends the sombre electronic tones of \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" with the guitar-driven rock of \\"Ok Computer\\" and \\"The Bends\\". It's satisfyingly experimental when need be, yet equally sparse and simplistic. It's cold and desolate at times, warm and genial at others. It is everything I can want from a Radiohead album. Beautiful, consistent, cutting-edge music.
B001DHXT20|4.0|My son loved this movie. For adults it is also fun to watch. It is not as great as some of Edward Norton's movies but still is entertaining. I found it to be better than Iron Man. The action is great. My boys beg to watch it again and again and I actually don't mind. I did not give it 5 stars because it can be slow moving at times and I felt like it could have been a bit better, I always expect a lot from Norton though. For kids though it is 5 stars all the way.
B000W4KT64|2.0|Maybe a movie can be comedy, ironic satire, and musical all at once, but it's a tough balancing act to pull off.<br />For example, the opening song \\"Baltimore\\" should be hilarious - - the whole idea of singing in delight of a famously dull city - - but instead drags on too long and can't quite decide whether to be serious about itself. In fact, all the songs last too long. I suppose that speaks to the quality of the song writing (\\"is the damn thing over yet?\\").<br />Or consider the domestic scenes, exaggerated proletarian misery in wildly perky pastels. Is it supposed to be misery? Or Disney Channel comedy? or a mockery of misery? In the end it looks like they wanted to make fun of miserable conditions, while still being nice to them, but also not being too scary for the kids in the audience or offending the sponsors (god forbid the movie should have the ferocity of, ahem, a John Waters film).<br /><br />Can't review the entire movie because I walked out after about 20 minutes of this idiocy.

1559409002|5.0|I very much enjoy this classic low budget horror movie. Its a great creepy ghost story which to me inspired Night of the Living Dead. It is full of atmosphere,and just genuinely creepy. A woman (Candace Hilligos) gets into an auto accident and sees ghost(or are they). Some of the 'ghosts' faces are really creepy to look at.  Yes it is a bit dated in some aspects, but it still can shock/spook people who haven't seen it before. And there is a twist ending which makes the movie stand out above others like this. I wont spoil it. Cold,rainy days make me want to watch this. This is a great example of what a low budget but a great flair for understanding what makes horror work. Great movie ! The DVD to get - Criterion has a blockbuster release with 2 versions and bonus features. If you do want the DVD for it , Criterion is the way to go.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Everything these reviews are saying about this show is true. It is different from anything else on TV. My father told me about it (he dosen't even watch much television of any sort). It didn't sound like something I would be interested in but I gave it a shot. I was glad I did. Me and my girlfriend watched episode after episode and we were shocked at how it \\"pulled us in\\". We couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next! One thing that everyone else fails to mention in these reviews is the brilliant camera work. It adds something to an already great story. Just pay attention to some of the camera shots in this show. This show is absolutely levels above the other stuff that everyone else is hooked on. Kudos to AMC!
B001LXIDVS|5.0|This is 3rd and finale in the series with Michael J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd in the old west - the year 1885. So, this time its an action adventure in the old west with trains,horses,romance and that Western atmosphere. Fox as Marty McFly has to save Blacksmith Brown from being killed by Beauford Tanner (Thomas J. Wilson). Dr. Brown(Lloyd) falls in love this time with Mary Steenburgen which is something Marty McFly brought to the West with him - Dr Browns future and demise. Because Dr. Brown is in love it affects the return to his time since he doesnt want to leave her behind. A tough choice for him. There were some great high points in this,just like the others. It has the same formula/chemistry as the first 2. I loved the ending where the train has to push the Time Machine car to 88mph to go back from 1885 to 1985. I think it has the charm,fun and energy of the first 2. Some say it was flatter,while others love it. I thoroughly enjoyed the series, the chemistry of the acting with Lloyd & Fox is there,despite a slightly weaker story compared to the first 2. How often are sequels better than the first films ? Not too often but some are just as good, and the whole Back to the Future Trilogy is just fantastic fun and entertaining. Part 3 is a satisfying conclusion to the series.
031606792X|5.0|This reveiw contains no spoilers.    I read many of the reviews for this book before I read it.  So I was very uncertain about it.  The reviews seemed so mixed, people either hated it or loved it.  But I took the chance and I really liked it.    Many of the negative reviews said that there was too much of a fairy tale ending, but I didn't find that to be true.  The story had several twists that were unexpected but the author did a good job with foreshadowing the turns.  So I didn't feel like they came out of the blue.  Personally I like the fact that most of the characters end with a positive outcome.  But the book was far from happy throughout.  I would have been very upset if any of the characters I loved were killed.    Another common complaint was that the sex scenes were skimped on.  We adults who read the book must remember that the books are listed for the middle school set, so I appreciate that the love scenes were not more explicit.  I am actually a middle school teacher and every other girl in my school carries around one of the four books and our school library has a waiting list to check them out.  So I think the sex scenes and sexual inuendo were appropriate for the age range.  I highly recommend the book.  I think it wraps the series up very nicely.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|I liked it. I know it wasnt a masterpiece of film, but for an action all out superhero movie, this delivered. This was a great film for what it was meant to do and that is a roller coaster ride. Edward Norton was a great Banner and the Hulk looked better here. The Abomination was a cool Hulk villain. This had all sorts of inside jokes with references to Marvel,Lou Ferrigno,the late Bill Bixby. I found this better than IronMan,and on par with Indiana Jones & Hellboy 2. This is also better than the first Hulk movie. This is a sequel to a certain degree. As a fan of superhero movies, & a Hulk comic fan, I thoroughly enjoyed it

B001AR0D4A|3.0|Easy for movies of this nature to go over the top with special effects, The Mist is mostly successful here. Not a cerebral film, but has an existential turn in that the horror is as much inside as outside. Your call on which creatures are scarier.<br /><br />An easy resolution is not offered, and there is a chillingly realistic portrayal of the evangelical mindset. The story stays focused; good acting and production values are sustained.<br /><br />This film appears part of a new suspense genre, centered on eco-dysfunction. The Happening and Last Winter appear from a similar fabric.

B0006399FS|4.0|How to follow an album like ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND with its multiple radio hits and critical acclaim? U2, the long standing kings of alternative rock and my generation's Rolling Stones, don't know how to make a bad album. However in the hierarchy of greatest U2 albums, HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB would not make most people's top 5. However, it does make mine. Here is why.<br /><br />While ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND is a fine album, there were a few things about it that bothered me. One was its preachyness. I actually agree with the at times blatantly Christian message of songs like \\"When I look at the World\\" and \\"Grace,\\" but I don't consider either song to be of U2s normal quality. They seem more like soapboxes for Bono to pontificate from. I appreciate the man's faith, and I appreciate his willingness to pen songs like those two, but for my money, I prefer songs with a harder edge (rock) and a message delivered with more subtlety. Another thing I disliked was the overall effect of the album. An 'album' has got to be more than the sum of its parts to be great; I felt that ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND was a loose collection of radio hits, songs written to deliver a message, and a few rabbit trails followed (like New York, my favorite track). It was not a complete album in the way JOSHUA TREE or THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE are.<br /><br />HOW TO DISMANTLE AN ATOMIC BOMB is an album that expected to be even more preachy than ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND, based on the title. I was thinking something like \\"Seriously Bono, Aids in Africa, Christianity and grace, and now the juggernaut of cold war arms races? Is there anything you DON'T feel qualified to comment on?\\" Thankfully, the title has nothing to do with the music. Also, I was happy to realize that ATOMIC just 'feels' like a complete, united effort. A more conservative album in some ways, this is a collection of songs that have a distinctive, highly polished production value (Steve Lillywhite's influence no doubt) that I enjoy quite a bit. Filled with pop anthems, classic rock beats, and remarkable lyrics, I think this ATOMIC is a better album overall.<br /><br />Say what you want about this album, the fact that there is a high level of disagreement on whether it is excellent or sub-par illustrates that U2 is still a band capable of making provocative music. Love them for being willing to change things up, or hate them for taking a new path, but they are and will be, the greatest band of my generation.bt) that I enjoy quite a bit.

B001KVZ6BG|3.0|For something that was meant to be a fable, Danny Boyle's \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" takes itself far too seriously. It's a story of both the Rags to Riches and Love Conquers All persuasions, about an eighteen-year-old Indian boy who becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" All throughout, his draws on life experience to select the answers. And what a life he has led; he came from nothing, a penniless orphan from the streets of Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), and he grew up surrounded by poverty, violence, and abuse at the hand of unscrupulous people. I find it odd that Boyle, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, and author Vikas Swarup (who wrote \\"Q and A,\\" the book on which this movie is based) were able to evoke so much hope, especially since it's unlikely the main characters would have survived past the age of ten.    As I watched this movie, I made mental comparisons to last year's brilliant \\"August Rush,\\" which is thematically similar. The thing is, \\"August Rush\\" had the good sense to be totally unrealistic, which in turn allowed me to engage the story at a more emotional level. If the intention was for \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" to be a heightened version of reality, then it didn't go far enough. When it comes to fairy tales, modern-day or otherwise, you either go all the way over the top, or you stay grounded--finding a gray area doesn't really get the job done.    \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" tells the extraordinary story of Jamal Malik, who was born in the slums and raised with very little to his name. His life was anything but boring: when he was just a young boy (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar), he managed to get an autograph from Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan; he witnessed the death of his mother, who was brutally beaten to death during an anti-Muslim raid; he and his brother Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) befriended an impoverished, parentless girl named Latika (Rubiana Ali). All three are taken in by the villainous Maman (Ankur Vikal),a gangster who forces destitute orphans to beg for money by singing. Some of his children are blinded so as to make them seem even more pathetic. Jamal and Salim are able to escape, but poor Latika is left behind, forcing her into a life of prostitution.    The story flashes forward some years, at which point Jamal (Tanay Hemant Chheda) and Salim (Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala) are teenagers barely getting by as souvenir sellers, pickpockets, and phony tour guides at the Taj Mahal. Jamal insists that they return to Mumbai to find Latika (Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar). At this point, we see just how different Jamal and Salim are: the former is hopeful and patient while the latter is hotheaded and easily impressionable. Upon returning to Mumbai, he seeks out a rival crime lord named Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar) and vies to be a part of his gang. This coupled with the discovery of Latika forces a divide between the two brothers.    And this brings me to the present day, where Jamal (Dev Patel) works as a tea-fetching assistant at an Indian call center. In attempting to get back in touch with Latika (Freida Pinto), he tries out for \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" which is so popular that he knows she will be watching. A physical reunion won't be so easy; Latika is kept in line by Salim (Madhur Mittal), who Javed has since promoted. If Jamal wins the game show, he just might be able to take Latika away from Mumbai and live happily ever after.    Interwoven throughout the entire film are police interrogation scenes involving Jamal and a sergeant named Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla). I won't go into great detail here, but I will say that it directly relates to \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\" I'll also say that each of their scenes kick starts another flashback sequence that explains how Jamal answered specific questions on the show.    It's an intriguing concept, and I'll admit that some of \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is satisfying. But a lot more of it is disappointing. Partly, it has to do with Jamal's sense of optimism, which seems a little overplayed given his terrible circumstances. I never really believed that someone so downtrodden could have so much to live for. A very negative thing to say, I know, but I really do feel that way. And while I get that this movie is supposed to be a fable, I still feel that too much of it is rooted in harsh reality. It certainly doesn't fit with the end credit sequence, which features a completely ill fitting Bollywood-style musical number. \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a decent effort, but it doesn't quite measure up as far as escapist fantasies are concerned.
0385340990|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and finished it in record time -- much sooner than I wanted this lovely book to end.  The war story of the natives on the Isle of Guernsey is little known and a glimpse at a piece of history that is often passed over for the more common stories of London bombings.  While those on Guernsey endured terrible hardship they also forged deep and caring relationships with each other and with some of their occupying enemies.  The reader quickly comes to love the characters and all that happens in their lives through their letters.  I highly recommend this book but be warned it will be over before you want it to be.

Good acting, characters that are full bodied and make sense, good visual effects and edge-of-your-seat action.  What's my reservation about the flick?  It feels like an incomplete film.  It seems like it's mostly exposition.  By the time the flick really heats up it's over.  It's like the makers of the \\"Iron Man\\" were so confident in it's success that they're setting you up for the sequel which, now with the film's success, is inevitable.  I might elevate this film to five stars if the sequel's any good.
1594201927|2.0|Ferguson comes up again as an unabashed defender of empire(s), especially those espousing financial capitalism as modus operandi. So much so that he touches revisionist overtones at times.<br /><br />Had this been just a history book, however partial, Ascent of Money would have been only half bad. However, Ferguson's ideological positions only add insult to the periodic injury produced by financial capitalism.<br /><br />Staying with history for a while, the book makes for a quick traversal of modern financial instruments and some of the supporting institutions and ideologies. Assuming the role of historian of finance, Ferguson doesn't seem to worry about proving anything; a narrative from the perspective of the victors, in (t)his case, the Anglo-Saxon financial elites, might do just as well. One comes away with the idea that financial capitalism is better, necessary, and almost always self-sufficient. Moreover, the welfare state should be viewed not only as a half-baked idea of capitalists, but also past its due date by now.<br /><br />Here are few examples of missing pieces from Ferguson's take one the rise of financial capitalism: Nowhere is the goal of financial capitalism explicitly stated. I would posit that financial markets are supposed to help/guide us to do the best resource allocation (read, optimal) with the idea of maximizing social welfare. The \\"us\\" above is the state and voting citizenry, and not the financial elites alone. Without any compass at work, it's easy for the author to ignore the societal costs of financial capitalism--in the UK/US case, the disappearance of production followed by de-professionalization, and misallocation of resources during, and in the aftermath of, bubbles. In other words, if we look only at what financial capitalism creates, in isolation from other countries or its own side effects, Ferguson's book is right on the money. Otherwise, the market as compass is just as accurate as communism.<br /><br />Ferguson doesn't seem to make much of his own statistics on how much more we spend on, let's say, healthcare and education for much lower returns. In fact, Schumpeter himself, one of the apostles of capitalism, once said that one of our problems in the US was the professional quality, or lack thereof, of our government employees. Hmm, could this have anything to do with how financial capitalism allocates human resources and/or how a society worships the high priests of finance?<br /><br />In any case, fear not the current crisis, for Ferguson has embarked into the next expedition of financial capitalism as charted by the Harvard behavioral finance-, and MIT's Andrew Lo's financial evolutionist/adaptive markets-hypotheses. He does so by means of the last chapter in the book, a veritable illustration of plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose. In plain English, it's just the tools and possibly the actors that needed change, provided that the masters, ideology and the fools remain the same.<br /><br />Rating this book is not easy. It should take 4 stars for the historic part, 2 stars for ideology, and 0 stars for partiality. All in all, for a 2-star book the interested reader may do better to borrow. And, yes, it reads fast and there is plenty of detail surrounded by historical context that make Ascent of Money a decent read.<br /><br />Nota Bene:  Why is it that, in this book, Niall Ferguson writes so dismissively about George Soros' ideas on financial markets reflexivity?  Soros has built his fortune also by leveraging the reflexivity he recommends be tamed by adequate understanding and regulation of the financial markets.  Unfortunately, Ascent of Money contributes only partially to that understating, and reads little about financial markets regulation.s on how much more we spend on, let's say, healthcare and education for much lower returns.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I love the direction that the brothers Nolan have taken the Batman series.  Emphasizing character and story over visuals and pyrotechnics they have made works for the ages.  For starters they have fleshed out the characters introduced in \\"Batman Begins\\" as well as introducing new ones.  Judging from the volume of reviews I'm sure that more than a few focused on Heath Ledger's interpretation of the Joker which is understandable.  I'll weigh in by saying inspired and leave it at that.  What puzzles me is that in all the hype for the film little is mentioned of Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of Harvey Dent.  Discretion dictates that I not give too much away, not that there's many out there that haven't seen \\"The Dark Knight\\", but Eckhart's work here is of great complexity and in my mind equals if not surpasses Ledger's.  I'm reminded of \\"Batman Returns\\" where the ostensible heavy was Scarecrow but the more interesting character was the mentor character played by Liam Neeson(sorry, I forgot the character's name).  Regardless, I didn't see \\"The Dark Knight\\" at the movies and now having waited with baited breath I wasn't disappointed.

What misguided youthful fantasies about wading through rice paddies taking on Charlie and ingesting napalm in the morning.  Director-writer-star Ben Stiller obviously did too because he's gotten all the detail of these film's down pat.  Nothing to get the juices flowing then a little Creedence on the soundtrack.  To boot they've also made a terrific parody of the film-making process.  Justice will not be served if Robert Downey's method actor character doesn't score an Oscar nom.  Tom Cruise is a hoot as the tough-as-nails producer.  Lastly, is Nick Nolte's war \\"hero\\", Four Leaf Tayback, a homage to the late lamented actor Vic Tayback?

0142412147|4.0|Because this book was a compilation of three stories, it's a little difficult to rate.  Story #1 gets 5 Stars.  This was a laugh out loud story for me.  I loved it.  It's worth it to buy the book just to read the first story by Maureen Johnson.  Story #2 gets 4 Stars.  It was pretty good, but it only got a smile on some parts.  Story #3 bored me.  Didn't really like the character Addie and I would give it about 2.5 or 3 stars.  So overall I rated the whole book a 5, weighted heavily by #1.  It's a fun little compilation.  Light, entertaining reading.  I did like the way all the characters from all three stories interacted at the end.  If you're looking for fun, light, Christmas cheer, this is a good choice.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Like most people, i first saw this while waiting anxiously for each part to be released on the website, and at no time did it disappoint.     It seems like Joss definitely has the golden touch when it comes to these things. I don't think it would have been anywhere near as good, had someone else had done the show, and definitely not as popular.    I am glad they have got this on DVD now. The sheer wealth on features on the DVD makes it worth paying almost any (reasonable) price. As well as, the fact the DVD is REGION 0 (pay attention studios and networks!!!)    I would recommend this to anyone that like a good laugh and a bit of enjoyment, and I already have been trying to promote the DVD to everyone i know.    The \\"musical commentry\\" track alone is worth the price!
0743454537|1.0|I enjoyed nearly the entire book. Until I got to the end. (This next part contains spoilers..) Okay, this was where she lost me. It turns out the lawyer has epilepsy and has a seizure in the courtroom. Then, he drives Anna home and they get in a car accident because he gets hit by a drunk driver and she gets killed. All right, that would never happen. Why? BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR AN EPILEPTIC TO DRIVE AFTER HE HAD A SEIZURE!!!!Anna's father was the Fire Chief. He would certainly have known that. The lawyer would have known that-a seizure equals an automatic revoking of your driver's license. The judge would have known that-and anyway, even if that wasn't the case (which it is) whose parents are stupid enough to let them get in the car with an epileptic who just seized driving? Sorry, but Picoult and her editor dropped the ball on this one. A little more research, please.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am a die hard Jane Eyre fan and have collected many versions of the tale as it has adapted to the screen.  Of all the versions I have viewed, Masterpiece Theatre's by far takes the cake.  After renting it I just had to own it, and from now on this will be the version I watch.  Toby Stephens is handsome, but somewhat rugged at the same time.  And Ruth Wilson's Jane is by far the best--she shows an incredible array of emotions, and you truly get the same feeling you did when reading the books of the love she holds for Mr. Rochester.  This version far exceeds the 1980s rendition from the BBC with Timothy Dalton.  If you love the book and want to see your favorite love story adapted perfectly to the screen, this is your best choice.
0743496736|1.0|I found this book intensely, compulsively readable, couldn't put it down, then found myself feeling cheated once we got to the end and the Picoult twist was revealed. (*SPOILERS*) I have to say, by the end of the novel, I could not stand the character of Josie, and the fact that she for some inexplicable reason shot her boyfriend makes her completely despicable. I'm starting to wonder if Piccoult has a problem with teenage girls-I do note that her interviews state she is the mother of SONS-because she tends to paint all her adolescent female characters as completely unstable, irrational, and manipulative. I've read many of her novels and see this as a trend with her-from THE TENTH CIRCLE to SALEM FALLS to PLAIN TRUTH to THE PACT. Her female characters are so interchangeable they could all be the same person, too, in every book. What is with her demonization of girls? Did some evil girl accuse one of her sons of rape or something? You have to wonder, and I find it interesting that she's categorized as chick lit, her writing is the antithesis of feminist.
B00008BRB5|4.0|A fitting culmination for one of pop-rocks biggest triple threats, Syonchronicity seldom suffers from filler and portrays the group at their diverse and sophisticated best. Few groups would track such a brief and glaringly successful discography while ending on this dignified note (despite what was probably going on behind the scenes of course).
0307276902|1.0|I've never been an alcoholic or a drug addict, so perhaps I don't have the background to really understand this book, but I found it to be boring, horribly written (the nonstop repetition was ridiculous-we get it, you're a criminal) and downright irresponsible. Its one saving grace was that it was a \\"brutally honest memoir\\" but hmmm...turns out he lied about, basically...everything, folks! And yes, it matters. When he writes a memoir of being in rehab where he gives counselors constant attitude, breaks rules, and does whatever he wants and then presents himself as clean and successful...and it turns out none of this actually happened-yeah, I think that's irresponsible. There are addicts and alcoholics everywhere who NEED the structure of rehab, and when he presents himself erroneously as having gotten clean without following their rules, which is not true...yes, that's a problem. I found the character of Lily whiny and annoying, kind of relieves me that no such irritating human being ever existed, because that's one of the many things Frey made up. Can't really say anything good about this piece of garbage masquerading as literature. I hear he wrote a novel that was critically acclaimed...too bad, that man will never be getting another dime from me. He should switch to a pseudonym, his work has no credibility.

B001GKJ2FC|2.0|It almost seemed like this movie tried to do what Fight Club and The Matrix did, all at the same time.  But, it failed.  The story is almost good, but it seemed that the people behind this film wanted to focus more on ridiculous special effects and stunts.  I had only slight attachment to any of the characters and didn't care for the special effects (too over the top).  The most redeeming quality of this movie was the Nine Inch Nails tracks...
B0015XHP4K|5.0|I was born in 1984 so these movies were a few years before my time. But with the low cost of this blu-ray set I decided why not? What an amazing series this is. The action, sound effects, well beyond their time. The storyline is nothing mind-bending, just a guy that single-handedly defeats thousands of enemies with a single magazine. But sometimes you just want to kick back and enjoy simple movies like these.
1582701709|2.0|I am a big advocate for an abundance mentality, and keeping a positive attitude. But the author takes it too literally, insisting that with the right attitude we will never become sick, or can throw away our glasses, or can eat whatever we want and stay thin. Not in my lifetime! Anyway, I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because I think it can serve to inspire people, and was written in an engaging style.

0312360266|5.0|Marked is one of the most compelling vampire books I've ever read. I fell in love with this book with the very first sentence. It has an authentic teenage voice that makes it feel like you're listening to a long-time friend, even if it is set in a world where vampyres exist openly alongside us. Zoey is a very likable, relatable character with a humorous voice that does not detract from the darker edges of the book. While the pop-culture references could eventually make this book dated over the years, it fits in with the tone of the book. The vampyre mythology is unique, fresh, and completely convincing; I especially love how it ties in to the Greek goddess Nyx. (Yes, I'm a sucker for Greek mythology. Moving on...) Overall, it is a clever book with lovable and love-to-hate characters, an addicting plotline, and just the right amount of twists to make you eagerly gulp down the pages. There are also a few loose-ends that will gnaw on your curiosity long after the book is finished. Luckily, this is only the first in a series, so there is more to look forward to.
031606792X|3.0|I am neither happy nor sad about Breaking Dawn. All I can remember is that after they got married and went on the honeymoon, I looked at the rest of the book and wondered what could possibly be in the last 500+ pages. And then the story shot off like being on a roller coaster. Some of the other reviews hint at her not writing the last book. I think they are on to something. I think she stopped writing at this point. The romance was lost. This was now a book about survival. It was over the top. I kept putting the book down in confusion and disgust, especially when Jacob imprinted on her baby; utterly disgusting but eventually useful. Then I would pick it back up and continue reading because I hoped that this story would venture back into its normal writing style of the other three books.<br /><br />I was impressed that Bella wasn't as whiney as she had previously been, that she'd matured, but I was disgusted at how insignificant and plain Edward had become after she was transformed into a super vampire. If it hadn't been for her increased senses with sexual pleasure, it seemed she wouldn't have really liked him anymore, and we had to use our own imagination to fill in those blanks. All of the other characters like  Charlie, Carlisle, and Esme, became props and were boring. I also had no interest in keeping up with \\"all\\" the extra characters added in the book in such a short period of time.  But, I am glad Bella got her happy ending. This book was all about her. She finally developed into her full potential, or well on her way.  That is a good thing.<br /><br />People who read the first three books may have issues with the forth. People who only read the forth and thought it was great would probably have issues with the first three. Bottom line, I was intrigued by this series for the romance, not the action. I kind of understand why the movie Twilight had such a cold approach and left out a lot of romance. If this series of books survive Hollywood through all four books, the producers would have to build a climax to the action and suspense in this book. I thought it did a horrible job at capturing emotions. Now I get it! I am glad I read the whole series.ers would have to build a climax to the action and suspense in this book.

0060557818|4.0|This book didn't really grab me at first, but the more I read it, the more I became wrapped up in this unique, dark, imaginative world. Richard Mayhew was just a normal man leading a normal life until he stops to help a bleeding girl in the streets -- an act that truly lives up to \\"no good deed goes unpunished.\\" Soon he discovers that his identity has been erased, left off no better than any meandering homeless person. His life turns even more chaotic when he embarks to London Below, a gritty and surreal reality existing beneath London, and helps Door, the girl he previously rescued, to discover who killed her family and why. The plot becomes more intricate and engrossing, filled with a cast of characters you never quite entirely know you can trust, and the villians are genuinely menacing. The twists were also ingenious and well-planted, making it even harder to not finish this book. While the ending was overall satisfying, there were still a couple of loose threads that make me hope that there will one day be a sequel, but it is not entirely necessary. If you love dark fantasy and are tired of reading about the usual concepts, then Neverwhere is a worthy read.
1439102813|5.0|The cover blurb for \\"Still Alice\\" claims that one critic, upon reading it, \\"...wanted to stand up and tell a train full of strangers, 'You have to get this book.'\\"  I don't know about that, but I can say I've recommended it to just about everyone who's asked what I'm reading lately.    Alice Howland is a respected Harvard professor, wife of a research scientist, and mother to three children when her growing concern about some vague memory and health issues sends her to her doctor's office, suspecting the onset of menopause.  Instead, incredibly, she receives a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease at the age of 50.   Thus begins her strange journey of watching herself fade away.  She may find herself teaching one of the classes that, for years, have made her one of the most popular professors on campus - or she may find herself sitting with the students in the auditorium wondering why the instructor hasn't arrived.  She's enraged when she can't locate her box of tea because her husband has rearranged the kitchen cupboards - Does he still not understand how important order and predictability are to her now? - then realizes her walk home has led her into her neighbor's kitchen, instead of her own.  She's delighted to meet the wife of a colleague at a party for the first time, and delighted to meet her again for the first time every time she sees her.    Even as she struggles to cope with what's happening, she also struggles to convince her husband that it's happening at all, that it isn't just willfulness or lack of focus, and that it isn't going to stop or get better.  Where she once had all the time in the world to resolve her tangled relationships with her grown children, especially the rebel who chose California over college, she now wonders how long she will even recognize them, and how she will tell them she may have given them the gene that causes early-onset Alzheimer's.  She begins to work on a methodical suicide plan, with a daily memory quiz and pop-up notes in her PDA to remind her to put it into action at the appropriate time.    Still Alice is one of those books that manages to be both heartbreaking and encouraging, somehow both hopeless and hopeful, beautiful but bleak.  I was surprised to learn that it is Lisa Genova's first novel, and I look forward to more from her.
1592332803|3.0|I love to bake and, being married to a bread-loving vegetarian, find myself looking for new recipes often. A friend bought me this book for Christmas and I immediately went right out for ingredients and started up the oven.    The good: Wow! What a plethora of information about cooking alternatives! Colleen really goes out of her way to thoroughly explain why different ingredients are used in baking, what they do in terms of the baking process, and how to get in there and make your own informed choices about substituting ingredients. I'm not sure why people in other reviews are complaining that the author uses white granulated sugar in her recipes; sure she does - and then she includes an entire 2-page explanation on different sugar substitutes, how and when to use them, how they're made, and how to choose the right one for your recipe.     I was completely fascinated by the number of simple, informative facts that apply not only to vegan baking, but baking in general, that other baking books don't bother to tell you. For example, did you know that you can make your own non-dairy buttermilk in one easy step? Or that you can actually *make* powdered sugar in a blender?! Cool!    In addition to all the classics, there are a boatload of delicious-looking, unique recipes I'm aching to try, including pine nut aniseed cookies, lemon cheesecake, bread pudding, and Japanese melonpan.    The not-so-good: The first recipe I tried from the book, Mediterranean Olive Bread, turned out rather bland. There's nowhere NEAR enough salt or olives in the recipe, so while the bread turns out a beautiful consistency, it tasted pretty flat.    However, the listed cook time was absolutely perfect, the bread really looked marvelous, and all I'll have to do to make this extraordinary is add a bit of salt and some more olives next time.     The ugly: What I really didn't appreciate were the snooty, multi-page inserts about the benefits of veganism, some of which even go so far as to explain the 'appropriate' language to use when referring to faux-meat, egg replacers, etc. (She lauds herself for not using the term 'milk substitute' because, and I quote, \\"Nondairy milks aren't substitutes for cow's milk - they're simply beverages made out of plant foods\\".) Come ON. I'm totally in her ideological camp, and even I start groaning reading through her wordy asides.     These diatribes are the kind of thing that speak deeply to those already involved in the vegan movement, but simply annoy everyone else. Baking is a joyous event in my kitchen, and whatever my personal choices are, I don't want a cookbook author preaching at me while I'm trying to make dinner - even if I agree with her completely.    Contrasted with the wonderful, upbeat live-and-let-live attitude in the \\"Vegan With A Vengence\\" cookbook, Colleen's little tidbits of couldn't-help-herself superiority get a big thumbs-down.
1582701709|3.0|The 'secret' that this book is about is the Law of Attraction (LOA) and, if you know nothing about the LOA, then this book is a good starting point.  It explains what the LOA is (you get what you focus on) and then goes on to illustrate how you can apply this 'secret' to achieve what you truly want with regard to money, relationships, your health and the world.  The LOA is based on the energy vibrations we are emitting (and these are determined by the types of thoughts we have). Gratitude is a powerful process for shifting our energy onto higher planes and bringing more of what we want into our lives and when we feel love, we are emitting the highest vibration of all. What I liked about the book are the summaries at the end of each chapter and the stories that are told to illustrate the points that are being made. One of the most astounding is the story about Morris Goodman, 'The Miracle Man'.  He was completely paralyzed after he crashed his aeroplane and could only blink his eyes. The doctors said he would remain like that for the rest of his life, but nine months later he walked out of the hospital on his own two feet. These are inspiring stories, but there is more to the LOA than is covered in this book. However, it is a good introduction to the whole topic and, if you have an open mind, it will most definitely broaden your horizons about what is possible and achievable in life.
B00005JNS0|3.0|An arrogant young race car (Owen Wilson) has his eyes opened to what really matters in life when he finds himself stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten little town on Route 66 where folks still care about each other.    There is a lot to enjoy in this movie.  The animation is spectacular, the voice talent is top-notch, and it presents good lessons about respect for the simple, enduring pleasures of life and the false allure of fame.  Despite these strengths and some good laughs, I didn't connect with this film on an emotional level.  I think I just wasn't captivated by the concept of characters developed from cars, but my two-year-old son certainly was, and his opinion probably counts more than mine.

0061339202|5.0|Flow are those inexplicable moments of indescribable happiness that we experience at rare intervals, when we are \\"surprised by joy.\\" These precious moments seem to be gifts, almost accidental peak experiences in which life seems rich with meaning, joy and wonder. When and why do these magic episodes intrude upon our humdrum existences?  Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's answer may surprise you: \\"Contrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments of our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times ... The best moments of our lives usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to the limits in a voluntary moment to achieve something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something we make happen ... For each person there are thousands of opportunities, challenges to expand ourselves.\\"<br /><br />Csikszentmihalyi's theme is happiness. This philosopher-psychologist points out the Aristotelian concept that all other things we seek, riches, fame, power, etc. are valued only because we believe they will make us happy. Based upon decades of research on the mystery of happiness,  Csikszentmihalyi defines it as moments of self-forgetfulness when we are totally absorbed in the process of life ... intervals of peak creativity and self-expression. He expands upon the research of Abraham Maslow and agrees that peak experiences are within the reach of us all. The theme of this book is the introduction of techniques to make this glad to be alive feeling occur more often. It may be stated that this book is no self-help step-by-step program, nor could it be. Each of us is plowing new snow, creating a path that no one else has traveled. The guidelines and the principles are here, but the journey into the sublime uncertainty of our destiny is individual and precious. Flow is one of several extraordinary contributions by this great mind.
B000I2JDEY|3.0|The Bottom Line:    The acting is inspired and the dialogue acerbic, but the film suffers after its amazing first act and at times the pace crawls; WAoVW is worth a look for people interested in film (it was groundbreaking in its time) but is not recommended to people in search of an enjoyable evening.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|If it's possible to fall in love with someone only by listening to their voice, then Sarah McLachlan must have legions of lovesick admirers all around the world (I count myself among them).  You know how it makes you feel when a woman has exquisitely, impossibly soft, feminine skin?  Sarah McLachlan's voice does that to you.  As it pulls you closer, you sense the peril of falling in and not coming back, but you're also not sure you want the power to resist.    For me, what makes Sarah stand out from just about any other recording artist is that I love virtually every song on every one of her albums.  I first encountered her in Afterglow, and it was a musical epiphany.  Here, I thought, is a woman who knows the reality of love -- its heat and its ecstasy and its capacity to redeem, yes, but also its disappointments and conflicts, and especially the ache of yearning.  And she not only knows these things in her heart; they've become part of the fabric of her voice, too.    So now about Wintersong.  Every artist who records a \\"Christmas\\" or \\"Winter\\" or \\"Holiday\\" album tries to create a fresh approach to the all-too-familiar repertoire of the season.  I thought Kim Carnes did it beautifully with \\"What Child is This\\" and \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\".  But Wintersong was a revelation beyond all others.  Sarah's almost startling versions of the same two songs simply blew me away.  And when I got to \\"The First Noel/Mary Mary\\", I was transported -- I'd never encountered a Christmas song like it.  Sarah took risks here, and the payoff is huge.  The drums in the middle of the song are indescribable; you have to hear them for yourself.  And Sarah's voice is more than equal to the challenge, effortlessly creating varied rhythms and moods that drive the song's many changes.  Wintersong is now my favorite Christmas album -- and it's all by one magical artist.  (My eleven-year-old daughter, hearing Sarah for the first time, said, \\"Daddy, if you ever meet her, tell her I absolutely love her voice.\\")    If you yearn to \\"go somewhere else\\" musically during the holidays, this is the album for you.

0307455874|5.0|I picked this book up in a local store, just before Christmas. I wanted to get a feel for the person the U.S. had just elected as president and how he might be expected to cope with the burdens of current times. The book is well-written and a pleasure to read. The main themes running through the content give me hope for the world.    The problems have grown so large, complex and immediate that only a sober discussion of facts and an earnest search for solutions can give direction on how to solve them. But even then, it remains for proposals to be put into action - something only the largest governments can ensure.    Barack Obama's stated belief that politics needs to base on sober discussion of facts and compromise, rather than ideology and unilateral action, would be a sound foundation for getting a handle on the global problems challenging the world. I hope many people all over the world pick up this book, read it, and realize the importance of sober, factual analysis and discussion. We, the people, need to get involved, in whatever manner the system we live in allows. We need to show the politicians and the media that we need and appreciate that kind of coverage, rather than one-sided emphasis of negatives.    I live in Switzerland, a comparatively tiny country, but one steeped in an older and more direct democracy (possible due to the small size), comprising four offical languages and multiple cultures. At the very core of Swiss government and politics are empathy for other views and working out viable compromises. But recently, there has been a tendency towards right-left polarization and a simplification of discussion that has been very disturbing.    So the analyses in this book about the evolution of how politics and campaigning function in the modern world has been enlightening and has brought into better focus what's going on in Switzerland. It has shown me the importance of working to nip this in the bud, before our politics, as well, devolve into a circus.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie! I am 15 and still like it. I was babysitting at Halloween and let the kids watch it, and the little 7 year old loved it so much that she made her dad go out and buy it for her THAT NIGHT! It's perfect for kids! As for those bad reviews, forget them. No, this is not Pet Sematary (no I am not illiterate, King spells it that way on purpose, because it is spelled wrong when they first see the sign in the book), and it will not scare you, it's an old movie with goofy one liners and silly acting. But kids will totally enjoy it, especially if they like the Nightmare Before Christmas. And, as for teenage girls, it helps that the teenage guy is kind of hot.
B000002OX5|2.0|I cannot overstate enough what a landmark album this is. Townshend and The Who entered their own with The Who Sell Out. Brash, loud, exciting, intelligent, crazy, profound, imaginative and fun. The Who new how to have fun and be funny while everyone was going to San Francisco.  From the ground breaking Pop Art cover to the last refrains of \\"Track Records....Track Records...\\", this album is a tour de force.  My only gripe is the remastering. What was John Astley thinking? It sounds totally flat and sterile. No justice has been served to the way it originally sounded. The mix is all over the place. \\"I Can't Reach You\\", has the vocals and tambourine in one channel, while all the instrumentation is in the other. It sounds thin and hollow.  My advice is to find a copy on vinyl and experience the original spread of the mix.
B001CZVVVY|1.0|What a missed opportunity!  Great performers, great orchestra, in a perverse, misguided direction!  An extra character has been introduced who goes around grimacing, juggling, tossing oranges and apples around the set during the action, or caressing or making teasing actions at the characters distracting from the action.  And talk about sparse; Susanna sings her opening aria about her hat without wearing or holding one!  Most of action takes place on a bare set with no furniture.  This is a travesty and a disappointment.  I was so hoping for a new production with wide screen, superb sound and top performers but this is not it.

045122499X|5.0|I only decided to read this novel (And Pillars of the Earth) because of their positive reviews. I have never had any interest in reading books set in bloody middle-ages England. Well, Follett's books are so engrossing that I actually gave up some of my regular television watching just to find out what was going to happen next to these richly defined characters. I think I read \\"Pillars\\" in only 4 days. \\"World without End\\" has about ten main characters; and Follett makes it very easy to keep up with them and gives hints about what happened to them earlier. It also became easier in this book for me to accept the gory episodes that occasionally cropped up - in fact I actually enjoyed them.<br />I guess that proves to me that sometimes I should listen to the vast majority; and hope that Follett churns out another one.
0061150142|4.0|This book is one of Picoults best. The descriptions of the moments that caused Emily and Chris to fall in love are riveting and beautiful. The events to describe their childhood paints a picture of the trial Chris is faced with. This book will remain one of my favorites.
006085880X|4.0|This book made me look twice at my daughter and really start to pay more attention to the little things instead of just seeing her as a \\"good kid.  A must read for all Moms...Wonderful backdrop and riveting storyline.
B00005K3NY|4.0|Canadian filmmaker, David Cronenberg, films are generally quite entertaining. As in most of Cronenberg's films, his distinctive \\"Body Horror\\" style, will cause you to wince numerous times throughout the flick. Michael Ironside steals the show. This method actor is terrifying on screen, even in his very last scene at the end of the film.    If I could say something that may annoy many of you out there, the film does not carry over so well to today, given the dated musical score and the seemingly over used concept of \\"telekinesis\\" and the not-so-scary premise. However, put yourself in 1981 and this film was at the forefront of the Sci-Fi genre. A clear example of this is when Stephen Lack (who plays Cameron in the film), uses a pay-phone to \\"go online\\" by tapping into the line telekinetically. This scene obviously preceding The Matrix by almost twenty years. There are many a scenes like this.       Back to the music, Howard Shore's (who has since done the Lord of the Rings trilogy) score is fantastic and classic 1980's techno horror, but along with Bowie's album \\"Low\\" with Brian Eno (amongst a few other films and albums), this score basically set the stage for the wave of electronica music from the late-80's to today.    All in all, this film will be loved by those seeking a nostalgic feel for the 80's techno/Sci-Fi/horror feel in the light of Blade Runner.
B00006GA4C|5.0|This ranks right up there with the likes of Beatles - Abbey Road, Pink Floyd - Dark Side of the Moon, Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin II, Black Sabbath - Paranoid,  Deep Purple - Machine Head, Alice Cooper - Love it to Death, and other late 60s early 70s great albums when Rock music was at it's absolute finest. In high school, nearly 40 years ago I was in a band that covered this album and loved it. Grand Funk was also an awesome stage show - check out \\"Inside Looking Out\\" live on YouTube.  This music is great listening and much fun to perform as well.  Mel Schacher's driving bass, Mark Farner's overdriven lead and awesome vocals were part of the forefront of the beginning of hard driving rock that began at the end of the 1960s. In my opinion, this is by far the very best album ever by Grand Funk Railroad.  If you like hard rock and you don't have this - buy it!
1878424505|2.0|Sometimes the most obvious answers are overlooked, which is why I enjoyed the inside flap of this book.    I could have done without the rest of it, however.    I completely agree with another reviewer that the author's writing style is way too repetitive.  I guess that's to be expected when you're faced with the task of turning four sentences into a full-blown book.    As you can imagine, really painful to read through.    It kind of reminded me of when I was in elementary school and I had to write three full paragraphs about why orange was my favorite color.    The most important parts of the book are already revealed in the description Amazon has provided, so I suggest you save yourself the money as you already know what's going on.    I am returning the book the same day I bought and read it.
1401309666|5.0|I'll be honest. When I bought this book I thought \\"Come on! Is there really enough content to write 250 pages about the fact that it's now easier to buy hard-to-find stuff on the Internet?\\" In fact, I was fascinated at the many insight Chris Anderson was able to generate about this interesting pheonomenon.    The fact that 20% of Amazon's sales are from books that sell less than 10 copies each, and are so niche they are nearly impossible to find in bookstores, is merely interesting - deserving, perhaps, a 4-page article in Wired Magazine. But Chris Anderson goes on to explore this phenomenon from many angles, discussing the economics for local booksellers and music stores, sub-segmenting the various long tails that make up the entire long tail, exploring the cultural implications when diverse personalities can find items better suited to their tastes than available in the mainstream, and other interesting twists.    Anderson has an objective and thorough approach. In one chapter, he explores the Paradox of Choice, an insight which says that the more choices available, the harder it is for people to choose, which contradicts the book's claim that the explosion of choice is good. Anderson presents a fair argument for both sides, then reveals that he contacted the authors of the original study for their interpretation. Such self-critical writing is a breath of fresh air.    This was a thoroughly enjoyable book written with flair and intelligence about an issue that is both timely and timeless.
0307237702|4.0|Though billed as a radical liberal by his opponents during the campaign, this book should have made it clear long before the campaign that this was very far from the truth.  Actually there is very little here with which one can take issue, much less offense, no matter how far you are from the left-end of the political spectrum.  One may think that Obama is being calculating, trying to be all things to all people, and yes, there might be something of that here.  The timing of this book's publishing in 2006, just before the presidential race began in full gear, makes one wonder how much of the real Obama we are getting here, but two things that are clear from reading this book are (1), the man can think through complex issues, not just dogmatically take positions, and (2) he is not afraid to listen and even consider viewpoints very different from his own.  Considering the paralyzing polarization that has gripped American political life in the past years, one can only be thankful that this clear headed author has been elected President, and, for the good of the country and the world as a whole, wish him well.
1400064287|4.0|This is a terrific book on how to turn your drab message into something that will stick, turn viral, generate enthusiastic support and generally turn into action. The six tenets - simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional and storytelling - are straightforward and easy to implement right away.     There are practical insights a-plenty in this book. I like the advice to not spend too much time trying to tell your story with statistics, but to focus on the implications of the statistics rather than the actual numbers. I also like the advice about adding details to stories, even irrelevant details, because it has a subtle impact on helping people visualize your story and retain it.    My main quibble with this book is its tone. It's often written in rushed voices, like a fast-talking auctioneer trying to sell you something without allowing careful inspection of the merchandise. In this regard, it feel a little like a pop psychology book, and it borrows heavily from its own lessons, telling stories and using emotional language to make its point. However, the brothers Heath have compiled a mountain of research, anecdotes and examples that lend credibility to their framework.    In the end the book is successful in communicating its points persuasively. Any communications profesional should make sure there's a space on their shelf for Made to Stick.
B000UFAURI|5.0|Bought this about a year ago when I first heard \\"The Pretender\\" on the radio.  The CD was the best one I bought all year and I still play it often.  Every track is awesome and there is a lot of depth and variety.  There is nothing weak here.  It was the first Foo Fighters CD I bought (I know, where have I been?).  I knew some of their songs, of course, but never liked any enough to buy the albums until \\"The Pretender.\\"  Since then, I've bought \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" and \\"One By One.\\"  Both are great especially with the extra tracks (I'm a Gary Numan and Psychedelic Furs fan, so I was pleased to see them do covers by those artists), but \\"Echoes...\\" is still my favorite (the CD title reminds me of the Husker Du song \\"Charity, Chastity, Prudence, and Hope\\").  If you haven't bought this yet, what are you waiting for, extra tracks?  This one is too good to wait.    \\"The Pretender\\"--The song that turned me into a Foo Fighters fan!  Rocks and has a unique sound.  The lyrics always makes me think of that Sesame Street tune \\"One of these things is not like the other...\\"  I'm just cooky that way.  \\"Let It Die\\"--OK this is getting A LOT of play on the radio.  Usually I get sick of songs that get so much play, but this one is so amazing I don't mind hearing it two or three times a day on the rock station.  I really like the delicate guitar at the beginning, especially during the repeating \\"Why'd you have to go and let it die.\\"  Then, of course, it explodes!  Vocals are excellent, too.  \\"Erase/Replace\\"--I like the whiny guitar opening and the high octane riff.  Almost punk until it gets to the slower chorus.    \\"Long Road To Ruin\\"--Sounds a little more pop and mainstream.  I thought it makes a good candidate for a single (which are not always the best songs on the albums, of course), and doing some research, discovered it was the second single.  I haven't heard it on the radio which is a good thing because I could see myself getting sick of this one.  Good song but probably my least favorite on the CD (besides the instrumental) because it lacks the edge of the other tracks.  \\"Come Alive\\"--Nice, relaxing, laid-back track that builds up tempo and explodes at the end.  I really like this one.  \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\"--Slow, acoustic number about loneliness.    \\"Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)\\"--Drums kick on this one. The beginning sounds like the song is about to explode but it settles down and turns into a very accessible track along the lines of \\"Long Road To Ruin\\" but with an edge.  \\"Summer's Edge\\"--This one has kind of a country rock sound: \\"Sweet Virginia countryside, I will meet you there, bloody lips and cherry wine, moonshine in your hair.\\"  \\"Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners\\"--Very impressive guitar work on this instrumental.  \\"Statues\\"--Great track!  I like the laid-back feel with the piano and the drums that beef up the sound as well as the lyrics: \\"We're just ordinary people you and me, time will turn us into statues eventually.\\"  \\"But, Honestly\\"--Mostly just vocals and strumming guitar until the other instruments kick in to the repeating \\"Give it to you.\\"  I like the scale guitar solo.  This one is not as memorable as the others, probably because it is near the end.  \\"Home\\"--Quiet, slow song with soft vocals and piano built up with drum and orchestra.  Pleasant way to end an excellent album.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I had purchased this set originally when it came out and had a little difficulty with one of the discs so I had planned to replace the set at some point. The series itself is the quintessential story of a company of men going from basic training to combat during World War II. The best as far as I'm concerned. When my wife and I recently bought a Blu-ray theater system I decided I might start replacing a few discs but assumed they would probably be just Sci-Fi. I was glad I happen to spot this series while looking through the Blu-ray section. I couldn't beleive how reasonably priced this set was on Amazon. I immediately ordered it and the quality is astounding. You won't believe how real the picture and sound are even though they were remarkable with the original set. It truly looks like there is depth to the picture and if you have surround speakers it will blow you away. Superb quality DVDs with many extras including interviews and commentary by members of Easy Company. Don't miss out on this set if you enjoy dramas and if you have a friend or family member that enjoys war movies, I strongly urge you to get it for them. If you enjoy this be sure to catch \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
032147404X|5.0|Yes, he thinks he's a lot funnier than he is... but this book is full of great info for beginning digital photographers. I especially like the perspective that he offers on accessory equipment. He explains where the additional equipment will help so that you can prioritize your purchases.    And, note that this book is really set up for dSLR owners. Point and shoot camera users could benefit from the advice on composition, lighting, etc., but he quickly progresses to talk about add-on lenses, flashes, etc. That really will only serve to taunt point and shoot owners.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|I really like this CD more than I thought I would. All the songs are very good and there are 15 at that.  I especially like War Machine, Stormy May Day, and the heavily radio-played Rock N' Roll Train.

Author Greg Kinney does a great job of capturing the quirky perspective of a middle schooler.    The main character, Greg, is likable, the illustrations fit the story perfectly, and the book takes unpredictable turns that will make you laugh out loud.    Good for ages 7 and up.

The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is well done for this edition of \\"The Rolling Stones USA Collection Series.\\" Although the Stones recorded these hits quite a few years ago they still sound great today.<br /><br />The album begins with the politically incorrect but awesome (anyway), \\"Brown Sugar.\\" \\"Brown Sugar\\" features the band at their best; Mick Jagger sings this with passion and they make you want to jump up and dance to this practically wherever you are! The guitar work is strong and those drums are just right. Overall the arrangement for \\"Brown Sugar\\" is superb--and flawless. Great! After \\"Brown Sugar\\" comes \\"Sway;\\" this is not as hard rockin' as \\"Brown Sugar\\" but the slightly country (yes, country) flavor to the ballad enhances it a great deal. \\"Sway\\" features The Rolling Stones doing an excellent job on a slower paced number; and they never hit a superfluous note.<br /><br />\\"Wild Horses\\" is a stunning ballad that always moves me with its beauty; the raw emotion they deal with in this tune really hits home. \\"Wild Horses\\" is a number that any Stones fan is going to love and it showcases just how good they could be when performing a tender love song. However, \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" reverts back to a more rockin' tune and it fits in very well in this song set.<br /><br />\\"B**ch\\" rocks hard and I love every minute of it! The Rolling Stones rock and add just a very, very slight touch of country in the melody to spice things up. I think you'll like \\"B**ch\\" is you haven't heard it before.<br /><br />\\"Sister Morphine\\" is a memorable number with that The Rolling Stones deliver with loads of style and their timing on \\"Sister Morphine\\" couldn't be better. Awesome! Listen also for \\"Dead Flowers;\\" this rocks with a distinct country flavor that works very well for this tune. The album ends strong with The Rolling Stones performing \\"Moonlight Mile.\\" \\"Moonlight Mile\\" is a passionate ballad that leaves you wanting more--and more is what you're going to get if you get some other fine CDs by this timeless band.<br /><br />Overall, Sticky Fingers is probably one of the strongest albums ever put out by The Rolling Stones. Of course, Rolling Stones newcomers will want this for their collections; the more serious fan will already have this album.

B0014DBZT2|5.0|Most Nick Cave albums have a few great tunes and a lot of not so great stuff on them. He is getting better with age it seems. I think this album is solid all the way thru. The lyrics are as metaphysically astounding as always. A theme runs smoothly from sart to finish. Yes, we're dealing with matters such as death, god, redemption etc. This is not for bubblegum pop conformity cowards. This is where rock should be, on the edge. Nick lures you in with seductive poetic lyrics of taboo expressions and a driving rock beat behind him forcing you to confront new perceptual vantage points in your mind field perspectives. This is a solid product for Nick Cave, I'm really enjoying it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas.He loves it. The cheapest price that I have found.
B0018RBN8C|4.0|Like many people I was attracted to this album after hearing \\"Mercy\\". I listened to a few other tracks and hated them. I bought \\"Mercy\\" as a download and went on my way.    Then I heard \\"Stepping Stone\\" and gave the full album another try. I don't know what changed, but this time around I fell in love. I ended up downloading an additional 7 of the 10 songs on the album. Once on my Sansa (not an Ipod fan. Maybe once there's built in FM....), I played them non stop for at least a month. After a break, they still sound great as they did the first time.     \\"Rockferry\\" and \\"Syrup & Honey\\" still don't do much for me. In a few weeks, I might give them another shot. Maybe for them, the third time will be the charm.    Granted, overall, Amy Winehouse is probably more talented, but with her implosion, Duffy is a worthy replacement. I look forward to hearing more from her. (BTW, when I first heard the songs on Amy Winehouse's album, I hated them too.)
0394800184|5.0|This is a children's book and it is absolutely the sweetest book I've ever read.  It is about a baby bird hatching and then finding its mother in this big world.  The mother feeds the baby (brings it a worm).<br /><br />When I read this book to my children, we compare the bird to them (the child) and compare the worm to the mother's milk.  When our children are first born, they immediately find their mother and immediately get fed.<br /><br />I just cannot sing enough praise for this book.  I like giving this book as a gift at baby showers.  If you have a small child, I would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />Awesome!
B00138F27E|5.0|Ain't No Tellin' became Make me a Pallet on the Floor, my all-time favorite MJH song (which I know best from the 2-record live Vanguard album that I bought second-hand in the 70s). After getting to know him from his recordings in the 1960s, it is wonderful to hear the young MJH.  The voice is more clear than the guitar on these, but the pickin style comes through well enough.  This is a very misogynistic version of Nobody's Business.
015206396X|5.0|I had gotten this book on Chrismas day, I started reading on the way to our ski vacation and once the lifts close not much is happening I had decided to start it and it wasn't very interesting until the 3rd or 4th chapters but once it too off and almost never slowed down.  The characters seemed realistic, during Po and Katsa's training sessions it actually feels like they are telling you the story themselves. A couple of bits of romance keep it realistic between higher aged teens rather than little kids on an adventure it had added some reality to the whole thing.  once I got started it was hard to put down, I had stayed up late into the night reading and got up early which I payed for the next day (a fair sacrafice)  A must-read I'll definately will recommend to my friends and is currently my favorite book. :D
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|If you are not related to somebody in this movie and don't feel compelled to see every single Batman movie, I do not know why you would subject yourself to this.  The Joker is memorable, but I don't want this in my memory.  The only actors who I could understand were the Joker (who has about an hour of vamping over the course of the movie.  Creepy, yes, but way too much.), the district attorney, Rachel, Batman's valet and tech guy. Other protagonists -- like Batman -- I could not understand what they were saying most of the time.  So the dark movie did not make much sense.  Dunno or care if it was how the actors spoke or how they were miked or mixed.  Maybe if I could understand them I would have cared more.  But I doubt it.  Seemed like no plot, just \\"this happened, then this happened, then this happened...\\" for over two hours.  I was very glad when it was over.  I would never, ever sit through a minute of it again.
0962477060|5.0|...basically this is a workbook for the \\"CAGED\\" system -- a method used to help relate scales to chord patterns...you memorize five different hand shapes corresponding to the C,A,G,E, and D chords...these shapes can be moved up and down the neck to play other chords...session guitarists, in particular, like it because it facilitates modulation from one key to another...jazz guitarists -- Joe Pass was a notable exponent -- like it since it also makes it easier to rapidly find a scale postion while improvising...not a beginner's method but once someone has acquired a solid foundation in harmony, the system does function to provide a deeper understanding of the unique quality and function each note and chord has in relationship to the key center...beginners should start with Mel Bay or Hal Leonard and move on to Bill Leavitt...start working with the CAGED system anytime after getting a good grasp of chord progressions.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|I'm not so sure I'd rate it the best film of 2008, but \\"Man on Wire\\" is an exceptionally well-made documentary about the achievement of a high-wire artist, who dreams of crossing the Twin Towers on a wire even before \\"they're there\\" (ironically, because of dreamers not totally unlike the film's protagonist they're again \\"not there\\").  Despite his last name, the Frenchman, Phillippe Petit, thinks \\"big\\" and is not afraid to risk it all (though spectators suffering from acrophobia may occasionally wish not to risk viewing the screen).  And in the end, we see him not only as an accomplished daredevil but a genuine artist, someone impossible not to admire and be drawn to.<br /><br />The film is tight and laconic, avoiding excessive dialog and exposition in favor of making the spectator a participant in trying to figure out what drives someone like Petit.<br /><br />But the film also, upon reflection, allows us to speculate seriously about the role of the friends and associates without whom the grandiose projects of a Phillippe Petit would literally never get off the ground. The early, non-reconstructed  documentary footage is highly professional, obviously filmed by someone who has been directed with great care by the subject being filmed.  (Clearly, this man had a sense of theater long before his greatest role.)  During the recent footage reconstructing the 1974 episode, the handheld camera is quite animated whenever it's trained on Petit, as if to suggest that he alone is alive, heroic, colorful.  By contrast, the camera is rock steady when focusing on the assistants who made possible Petit's publicized feat, making them more wooden and less human.  In the \\"Special Features,\\" we witness a very articulate and \\"theatrical\\" Petit talking about his achievement, confirming suspicions some viewers may have picked up while puzzling out his character in the film.<br /><br />The most telling shot in the entire film is that of an accomplice who, while attempting to describe his feelings after the stunt's success, erupts into tears.  A charitable interpretation is that he was so moved to be part of this earth-shaking drama that words fail him.  But close attention to the scene brings out the tension underlying the film's story: the heroic, romantic, individualistic artist vs. the collective, the social, the very real audience and supporters without whom his mission would be meaningless and even impossible.<br /><br />Petit, besides being an artist, is also a supreme \\"con artist,\\" possessing such compelling \\"rhetoric of character\\" in the service of his idealistic dreams that he proves difficult to resist.  But once the daring, complex, challenging adventure has been pulled off, who gets all of the credit?  In fact, he might be seen to \\"take\\" it quite eagerly--and, through a cleverly-filmed slapstick sex scene, narcissistically.<br /><br />And what if Petit had failed?  Who then, even if only by association and implication, is left to live with the blame of an unnecessary death?  Those emotions ultimately prove more powerful than the surge of admiration for the accomplishment of yet another hero-artist, be he Evel Knieval, Phillippe Petit, or a rock star living on the edge.  We were attracted to him in part by the element of danger, but did we fully understand the other half of it?<br /><br />Even as we question the ability of a Manson, Koresh, or Jim Jones to influence and control minds, some of us may have questioned our own susceptibility to the undeniable if not irresistible charm of megalomaniacal personalities who seem all too capable of making instant \\"yes men\\" of us at any moment.  It is these viewers for whom this film is likely to connect in more  ways than one, providing a fascinating documentary of a heroic romantic figure while affording a penetrating glimpse of the \\"ordinary\\" but devoted onlookers whose own sacrifices make possible and may even exceed the hero's.'s success, erupts into tears.  A charitable interpretation is that he was so moved to be part of this earth-shaking drama that words fail him.

Those emotions ultimately prove more powerful than the surge of admiration for the accomplishment of yet another hero-artist, be he Evel Knieval, Phillippe Petit, or a rock star living on the edge.  We were attracted to him in part by the element of danger, but did we fully understand the other half of it?    Even as we question the ability of a Manson, Koresh, or Jim Jones to influence and control minds, some of us may have questioned our own susceptibility to the undeniable if not irresistible charm of megalomaniacal personalities who seem all too capable of making instant \\"yes men\\" of us at any moment.  It is these viewers for whom this film is likely to connect in more  ways than one, providing a fascinating documentary of a heroic romantic figure while affording a penetrating glimpse of the \\"ordinary\\" but devoted onlookers whose own sacrifices make possible and may even exceed the hero's.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I first watched this miniseries on HBO when I was in the 7th Grade.  10 years later, I am still amazed by watching the exploits of our first astronauts.  Tom Hanks was a perfect narrator/producer of this show.  I give it 2+ thumbs up.

B00004YKUY|5.0|As a long time fan of Journey, it is difficult to consider any releases from Journey which does not include Steve Perry.  However, after having an open mind and listening to \\"Arrival\\", I consider it not Journey's best, but certainly a very good, well-written and well-produced CD.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|This is my favorite CD from rihanna! I listened to it and really couldn't stop! Its better then good girl gone bad! Music of the sun is a 5 star CD but this one is beyond 5 its more like a 10 star CD! i was very impressed! You have to have this if you are a fan of rihanna! i mean it! Its worth what ever you pay, really!
B001OCEJGE|3.0|This is more than a sample, yet less than the full book which isn't available on Kindle. This \\"selection\\" says it iss 98 pages which doesn't mean much on a Kindle. It has a maximum location of 2476 compare with 143 in the sample of the selection. That said, if you like reading Nigella, this is a nice sampler with a few recipes for the Holidays. The table of contents is skimpy on the link, but its easy to search for anything on the Kindle (though I wish you could do it for only the current book) and you can add your own notes and bookmarks to mark specific recipes. A recipe list with links would be nice. But, for a cookbook, often it is key to see a picture of the finished result (in color is best) so you know what you are shooting for and that is lacking as you'd expect on the Kindle. For somethings, the grainy black and white images would do (like in the newspapers) or black line drawings (like comics) but for food you want color. Some day we may get that on a next gen Kindle. For now, this is an intriguing idea...was worth the low price.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|I would like to first admit that I am a fan of this artist, but for those that are not fans; this would be an excellent collection to any Blu-ray set. It sort of angers me this is only available through certain retailers because this is truly a treasure. I have quite a few Blu-ray concerts, and this is probably in the top 3. The video production is wonderful - very crisp and colorful on screen. The audio is top notch as well, and it's great to see a live performance throughout the concert. This is an artist that truly describes the word. She captivates the audience (and the viewer if I may say so) to sing along with and dance with her every move. Some of my favorite performances are: Suga Mama, Naughty Girl and Suga Mama. I know a lot of fans of Jay-Z and Destiny's Child will also be excited since all three \\"extras\\" make an appearance on the disc.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|This unexpected CD is a wonderful surprise since Enya's releases have been 5 years apart from 1995 on.<br /><br />Beautiful pictures in booklet, excellent sound. 'Silent Night' choral version is far better than her solo version in 'The Celts' (1992 CD single).<br /><br />Wonder why she didn't give her personal touch to more traditional Christmas stuff like others have done. Some of the tracks, such as 'One Toy Soldier' (splendid one by the way), I don't precisely understand as carols. Not that it matters because her singing is as good as ever.
1844137872|5.0|This is a book full of real art for every man to enjoy, not a few canvases purchased by the rich who decided it was art because it matched their couch.  This is art that expresses real everyday emotions and beliefs.  I hadn't heard of Banksy before buying this for myself for Christmas, no I'm a forever fan.
B001G9LVGG|4.0|According to the seal on the outside, this is Loreena's first whole length Christmas Season recording. It is not: 'To Drive the Cold Winter Away' (1987), is.<br /><br />Beautiful cover. As usual with her, excellent recording and sound. The Arabian atmosphere which has become McKennitt's trademark seems slightly out of place. Instrumental tracks could use vocals. Some of the songs may be considered 'flat' compared with other of her albums and to other musician's versions.<br /><br />Interesting and nice to have.
B00003CXB4|5.0|this has to be the best movie ever. Iwatched this movie over the last 30 days about 15 times with my 4 year old grand daughter, son, daughter,inlaw, wife, etc, and never once did anyone leave until the movie was over. Buy it you wont regret it.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I just finished reading this book and found it to be the most enjoyable I have encountered in a long time.  The epistolary style is original and very effective.  The authors have mastered the daunting task of combining humor, pathos and grim historic detail into fast moving plot and sharply defined character development. Full of surprises, this book is a treasure.
B00005BHOG|4.0|My son loves to play with this toy, however it is VERY LOUD.  I had to put it away when my daughter was tiny because it would wake her up.  That is the only downfall of the toy.  Use your judgement in your purchase.
B001GZ6QEC|1.0|With all the hype around this movie, someone needs to point out the crime of mixing 2.4:1 and 1.78:1 as the movie transitions from scene to scene.  I spent a lot of time and effort putting together a theater at home that can handle 2.4:1 (Widescreen) movies.  With the \\"IMAX\\" scenes what you get is good old 16x9 HDTV.  I can't set the lens to widescreen mode on this movie or I'll crop the top and bottom off all the 1.78:1 scenes.  I have the wonderfull experience of having bars on the sides for 1/2 the movie and bars on the top and bottom for the other half.  I will try to return the movie.
B000002J2D|5.0|I've read through all of the other reviews of this album and have to add one more opinion.  Genesis has been compared to other prog rock groups like King Crimson, Yes, ELP, etc.  Although they're all fine musicians, the reason that they formed the band was as an outlet for their songwriting.  All four of the original members (Anthony Phillips, Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford) were driven songwriters. They never bothered learning cover material - -  their focus was entirely on writing.  The genius of Genesis has always been in the crafting of their songs, and TTWT has perhaps some of the most accomplished songwriting of any Genesis album.      If you're new to Genesis, these songs probably won't grab you on the first time through (except for the one hit, of course).If you continue to play the album, the hooks begin to emerge and continue to hold up to repeated listening over many years.  Up until this point, Genesis had never fallen into the trap of selling out their songwriting integrity - - through the 70s they had no interest in writing formula pop hits.      Genesis songwriting continued to evolve through the 70s.  I consider  1976-78 to be the peak of the Genesis songwriting phase.  Listen to \\"Burning Rope\\" or \\"Undertow\\" very carefully.  Better yet, if you play piano or guitar, go ahead and try to play along.  Not exactly John Cougar, is it?  Good luck figuring out the chord progressions. Certainly, some of the songs aren't up to that level, perhaps foreshadowing the songwriting collapse that was coming.      For whatever reason, most of the great songwriters tend to  have a peak creative period that might last a few years.  When it goes, it's pretty much gone.  That was Genesis. After TTWT album, Phil's pop sensibilities began to take over.  After the mega-hit \\"Face Value\\", it was inevitable.  There were still enough flashes of their songwriting genius on their albums to keep it somewhat interesting, but mostly it faded away as they \\"simplified\\" their songs to play to the masses.  I was hopeful that \\"Calling All Stations\\" might be a return to their emphasis on the songs, but they were clearly were past their peak.      It's obvious that the material from their 70s songwriting era holds up much better than their poppy material.  If you see their \\"When in Rome\\" reunion concert, observe the contrast between the \\"In the Cage\\" medley  and \\"Invisible Touch\\".  It's like comparing Mozart to Clay Aiken.      I see TTWT in bargain bins from time to time, and it always bothers me.  However, there's some consolation to know that I find 20 Phil Collins albums for every 70s Genesis album.
0060005696|4.0|Summary:    While having some freedom of choice is important to our well-being, having hundreds of options to choose from in every aspect of our lives, as we do in the modern world, is bad for us.  With too many choices, we feel become anxious about finding the very best one, are burdened with a greater sense of responsibility for the consequences, spend large amounts of time and effort on making decisions, and regret lost opportunities after making our choice.  In addition, we experience accommodation that means things we thought would make us much happier really don't, in the long run, as we get used to a new standard of expectations.  Striving to make the best decision every time in the face of an onslaught of more options than we can effectively evaluate encourages learned helplessness and depression.    The author recommends making some rules of thumb to limit the effort you put into decisionmaking, such as cutting most decisions down to two options, and considering most decisions nonreversible.  He also recommends resolving to find an option that meets your standard of acceptability and then stop, rather than spending large quantities of time and energy ferreting out the absolute best option (which, given the enormous range of possibilities for most choices in the modern world, isn't even possible much of the time).    Quotes lots of studies, including a fair amount from Martin Seligman's work on learned helplessness.  If you've read Seligman and other writers on the psychology of happiness, you may find much of this book repetitive, but there should still be some gems you haven't seen before.
B0017ANAZO|1.0|Q: What happens when you take a classic film full of razor-sharp wit, humor, and melodrama and remake it it with none of those ingredients and a group of actresses so bad that your dvd player smells? A: this remake of the Women.<br /><br />Half of them have so little screen time (I'm talking about you Jada and Eva)that they will live this stinker down better than others.  It's primarily the Meg and Annette show.<br /><br />Poor Meg seems to have done a bunch of really bizarre surgical things to her face and it is really distracting. She looks like Sally left Harry to go to a Halloween party. Annette, for some really bizarre reason that defies logic, seems to be channeling Kim Cattral throughout!  That's like watching Sarah Bernhard pretend to be Karen Valentine!<br /><br />Anyway, other the the title, a couple of stolen lines and character names, purists can rest easy.  These two movies have so little in common it's amazing.  This is more like The Powderpuff Girls save the world.  YUCK!
B0009X766Y|5.0|REVIEW: This sparkling comedy/crime caper not only cemented George Roy Hill's reputation as a first-class director: but also proved to be THE perfect showcase for the acting team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. \\"THE STING\\" is a classic re-creation of the Depression-era 30's complete with mobsters, grifters, cops, feds, and small-time confidence men. Newman and Redford play two such con-men looking to outsmart a big-headed crime boss/banker named Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw) who is responsible for killing a mutual friend of theirs. Along with a bevy of co-conspiritors (including Ray Walston, Eileen Brennan, and Harold Gould): they cook up a scheme to divest the mob of half-a-million dollars, and to hoodwink a crooked cop (played with gusto by Charles Durning) who is hot on their trail. This is a grand entertainment: everything about the film looks as sharp as a pair of spit-shined, patent-leather shoes. And even though it's all breezy, good-natured fun: it does have its fair share of serious moments, and a finale that is truly a bravura of filmaking genius. It's easy to understand (considering the technical quality of the production, the superb acting, and the glorious screenplay by David S. Ward) why it earned seven ACADEMY AWARDS.    ACADEMY AWARDS: Best Picture, Best Director (George Roy Hill), Best Original Screenplay (David S. Ward), Best Music Adaptation (Marvin Hamlisch), Best Film Editing (William Reynolds), Best Costume Design (Edith Head), Best Art Direction/Set Decoration (Henry Bumstead and James W. Payne)    ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS: Best Actor (Robert Redford), Best Cinematogrphy (Robert Surtees), Best Sound (Ronald Pierce and Robert R. Bertrand)    GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS: Best Screenplay (David S. Ward)ause he (along with Redford's character) inadvertently conned one of Lonnegan's stooges out of thousands of dollars. Of course the \\"code\\" (if you can call it that) of the grifter is to take money from the \\"mark\\" (without the use of force or bloodshed) by playing upon that person's own weaknesses and greed. And even though such \\"bandit\\" behavior may not be the most moral of examples to follow: the audience will certainly cheer the comraderie (and die-hard friendship) that these guys have for each other in fleecing the selfish, crooked, and morally bankrupt suckers who (pretty much) get what they deserve. It is also necessary to keep in mind that the film is set in the Depression-era of 1936 Illinois where jobs were scarce, people were out on the street, and the mob was in full swing. But as far as the content is concerned: there is a decent amount of mild profanity (although God/Jesus' name is taken in vain about five or six times); a few scenes of brief violence; one risque scene at a burlesque show; and several instances of smoking, drinking, and drunkenness. It would probably have gotten a PG-13 rating if released nowadays, and thus should earn a CAUTIONARY rating for the reasons noted above.

But Mariam had hardly noticed, hardly cared. She had passed these years in a distant corner of her mind. A dry, barren field, out beyond wish and lament, beyond dream and disillusionment. There, the future did not matter. And the past held only this wisdom: that love was a damaging mistake, and its accomplice, hope, a treacherous illusion. And whenever those twin poisonous flowers began to sprout in the parched land of that field, Mariam uprooted them. She uprooted them and ditched them before they took hold.\\"<br /><br />I don't want to be presumptuous. I don't want project my own ignorance on whomever stumbles upon this post. So, I will only say that, as a well-read, well-informed citizen, I thought I knew, if not all the details, at least the gist of the situation in Afghanistan. I watch Anderson Cooper. I saw Charlie Wilson's War. But this book offers a timely perspective on a war that had been going on long before we got involved, a war many Americans don't realize we are still fighting.<br /><br />Set primarily in Kabul, A Thousand Splendid Suns spans 30 years of Afghan history, following the unlikely friendship between two very different women, Mariam and Laila, brought together by mutual fear, grief and pure necessity.<br /><br />What I found most striking about this book was the lack of sanctuary. Mariam and Laila live in an Islamic world, but even surrounded by prayer and mosques, they have no peace and no rest. Not only do they live in a war-torn country, where at any moment a bomb could fall on their home or a sniper could use them as target practice, the women are married to an abusive husband who takes out his anger, frustration, even bordem on his wives.<br /><br />The story is at once foreign and familiar, as it explores not only how much one person can endure, but also the meaning of home when your country has been destroyed by decades of war.by decades of war.
B000002AEN|5.0|If you've never heard Mississippi John Hurt and have any interest in what's generally called \\"country blues\\", please buy this record. If you've listened to Robert Johnson, Son House, Skip James, or any of the other \\"delta\\" stylists and not cared for the style, try John Hurt. His style is actually about as different from theirs as night and day. Whereas the typical delta style involves somewhat idiosyncratic guitar accompaniment with intense (and sometimes difficult to decipher) lyrics, John Hurt's style features a fairly light vocal treatment paired with an absolutely masterful alternating bass guitar accompaniment (later taken mainstream by white guitarists like Merle Travis and Chet Atkins). Hurt's tunes have a \\"pop\\" quality to them that is generally not found in the music of his peers making them much more accessable for the new blues listener. If you are interested in learning \\"fingerstyle\\" guitar, this CD should definitely be among your first stops. It's all Hurt and only Hurt with no overdubs or trickery. The guy was one amazing talent. If you end up liking John Hurt, try Blind Boy Fuller as well. Much more racy lyrics with the latter, but great guitar playing with a similar technique.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I didn't know what to make of it at first - Video blog musical? But loving Firefly/Serenity (Joss Whedon and Nathan Fillion) made buying this a no-brainer. Just watched it for the 3rd time. Brilliant, hilarious. And I think the Singing Commentary is maybe even better than the main show? And by the way, my 13 year old son loves it as well.     Cast is excellent. Never realized how talented Neil Patrick Harris is (long way from Doogie Howser).    Going to buy several copies to give to friends.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|What is it that makes a movie great? Do we judge by how much our eyes can be entertained or how much our brain can think? Should a movie be scaled on how much blood, boobs and Ka-Booms can fit in 100 min, or how much we can think, ponder, or symbolism. If you weigh your opinion based on the first choice, LiT is about the farthest you can get from entertainment, if you happen to favor the latter, then LiT isen't gold, it's darn-near movie platinum. But if you appreciate both, like me, and want a healthy balance of both, LiT is like a fat-girl with a beautiful personality. If it was in a prettier, flashier body, it'd be your number one pick.     Symbolism, especially in movies, is a double-edged sword, and when it comes to it, most people have a destinct mark of love or hate. LiT is considered a modern masterpeice when it comes to allegories, it has deep themes concerning alienination, culture shock and finding yourself, and all are vibrant throughout. The movie fills it's reel by showing a more serious Bill Murray and the ever so talented Scarlett Johansson exploring these themes so beautifully, meekly and passionatly that it does make you wonder how this could get any better... or if it can put you to sleep faster than NyQuil can. If you think of figurative language less as an art and more as BS, then you would see LiT as two average, boring people living their average boring lives, and we get to see them live it for 100 min. If symbolism isen't your cup of tea, steer far away from what is potentialy a snore-fest.     When it comes to me and my tastes, I need a little of both sides. I can't be fully satisfied with disecting what seems to be an average person's life looking for what the deeper meaning of it all is, but I can't take a straight shoot 'em up movie with a cast full of Jesse Ventura's.
0385340567|1.0|My father-in-law and I bonded years ago when he introduced me to the genre of action thrillers.  It began when he loaned me a box full of the first 60 or so Remo Williams novels.  I still remember that chapter two of each book began with \\"His name was Remo and . . .\\"<br /><br />Our latest action hero has been Jack Reacher, the creation of British television writer Lee Child.  Reacher (always Reacher in the series, never Jack) is an imaginative hero.  He spent the first thirty-five years or so of his life on military bases.  First, as a child of a soldier and then as a top military policeman.  The hook is that Reacher, as a military policeman, is something like a super-cop.  His targets were trained men, often devious, tough fighters without a moral code.<br /><br />As he aged, he tired of his regimented life, quit the army, and became a wanderer.  Reacher doesn't even have a suitcase.  He wears a set of clothes until it wears out, buys good quality English walking shoes, and carries an ATM card and a folding toothbrush.  He is something of a cross between Dr. Richard Kimble (The Fugitive) and The Incredible Hulk.  Big, tough, strong, and very street smart.  He moves from place to place and gets involved in situations usually requiring his violent intervention.<br /><br />All in all, it has been a highly enjoyable series.  The kind of candy I yearned for while working on my dissertation.  Upon finishing, I gorged on the likes of Reacher.<br /><br />The latest, Nothing to Lose, lost me as a customer.  Lee Child, the author, seems to have REALLY enjoyed the recent works of village atheists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.  He seems to have enjoyed them so much that he had to come up with a highly improbable plot just to demonstrate how stupid he thinks Christians are.  Oh, and along the way he manages to claim that nothing the American military has done since 1945 has been worth the price of men's lives.<br /><br />But Child's little crusade against conservative protestants and American military efforts of the past sixty years wouldn't have been enough to send me packing if the book weren't so bad.  The villain catches Reacher multiple times and somewhat inexplicably lets him go.  The bad guy has a compound.  Reacher spends the entire novel working his way in and out of the compound as he goes between two towns, Hope and Despair.  On the one hand, the villain has put together an incredibly devious and ingenious plan to help bring about the apocalypse.  On the other, Child (through Reacher) assures us that the villain is a weak-minded man who is accustomed to believing things that comfort him.  It is profoundly boring, which is something I have never been remotely close to saying about any of the other books.  It was literally an act of will for me to continue reading Nothing to Lose.  I was determined to finish because I knew it would likely be the last run for Reacher and me.<br /><br />Now, having finished, I'm sure of it.

0316017922|5.0|If you like to read to broaden your horizons, to challenge your way of thinking, to stimulate new ideas, and if you do not like overly pretentious, academic books that are bogged down in techno-speak and footnotes, then you will love this book.  No, the writer is not presenting original research but Malcolm Gladwell is a genious at taking the research of others and putting it together in new ways that are thought provoking and mind-changing.  I read this book very quickly but the ideas presented here about success and how it is attained will stay with me for a long time.  It has changed how I look at myself and others.  It is a wonderful book for discussion and could not be more timely as a we start a new administration committed to change.     For too long, Americans have been divided into the \\"Personal Responsibility vs. Societal Responsibility\\" camps. We have become a divided nation that has been at loggerheads and has accomplished little. Our position in the world has deteriorated as a result. This book offers a \\"via media\\".  There may be other solutions but it is a wonderful start to a community conversation that needs desperately to take place.      Whether you ultimately agree or disagree with Mr. Gladwell's conclusions, you need to read this book!

B000EOTAM6|4.0|I would rate the movie as about a 3.5 and the extras as a 4.5 giving a solid 4 for the disk.  This is a solid science fiction movie and Charlize Theron is the most believable female action heroine in the movies.  The plot is not all that novel or exceptional, although it is solid and not merely an excuse for the action.  The firearms work is done in a much more believable fashion than normal although the firearm capabilities are pretty much today's weapons.     The extras are an exceptional view into the training and development of the skills of the stars who did almost all their own stunts.

031606792X|3.0|3  a). My favorite chapter was chapter 20 New. I think I was a great chapter because of the ever expecting and finally here turning of Bella swan into a vampire and we got to see everything through her eyes oh and the baby.  b). I think the age group appropriate is teenagers to young adult.   c). The foreshadowing how Alice can tell the future.   d). Compared to the other three books I didn't really like it but I did it was a little confusing with the 3 books  and the fight that never happened but besides that it was an excellent book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The now-unemployed executives at Fox canceled this series after tinkering with content, casting, sequence of shows and time slot. The same folks who canceled Dark Angel pulled the plug on Firefly. The cast Christmas party became a final wrap party. However, the creator, writers and 9-member ensemble cast all went on the remarkable later success.<br /><br />The Firefly DVD, peppered with \\"Copyright: FOX TV\\" captions (as if Fox did anything but thwart and hinder the production), has sold >600,000 copies. Its eleven episodes are a must-see for any drama, action, adventure, sci-fi or space fantasy fan. With strong and compelling stories from the Mutant Enemy (Buffy; Angel; Serenity...) stable of writers, my household remains amazed that that the network wonderkids didn't grasp the point or potential of this excellent work.<br /><br />Compounding their error, they axed Firefly without allowing for a complete season. Adding to its foolishness to incompetency, Fox didn't even air two of the episodes it paid for, making this DVD the only way to see the incohate 11-episode work (the sets, cast and creator going on to make a smash motion picture from the left overs).  Sheeeesh!<br /><br />There is no one under the age of 100 who won't enjoy the creative writing, emmy-nominated acting, cinamatography and \\"wow\\" special effects offered here by Joss Whedon and friends.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I have read the whole series of books and couldn't wait til the marathon of the whole first season on HBO this week. After watching the first 3 shows, I wish I had never taped it to watch in the first place. When I saw it was directed by Alan Ball I knew there would be sex in every scene (he directed most of the Six Feet Under episodes, so I expected it). I saw more sex in the first 3 episodes of this show than I remember reading about in the whole 8 books I read! To me the show is nothing like the books and even though the show isn't bad, the books are much better. I don't think I will watch the rest of the episodes because if I do I will never be able to read the books again. The books are much more humorous than the show, cleaner and not sleazy like the show. I couldn't wait for the next book of the series to come out because there was a lot of suspense, but the show...well, I just know it will be more weird sex scenes and not much suspense. I think you will either like the books or the show but not both.
B001J53X9U|5.0|In this latest installment of the Batman series, The Dark Knight delivers a great movie that can be watched over and over again. The picture and audio quality are all perfected in this release. To add on to this tremendous BD, it also comes with a limited edition bat-pod display case. The extras aren't perfect, as a feature on the transformation of the joker would be nice, it still delivers. Everyone who wants to watch a soon to be comic book classic should own this movie.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|Once again Fall Out Boy has managed to produce my favourite album of the year. I bought Folie a Deux the day it was released and haven't stopped listening to it yet. There's not a song on this album that I don't like and I have yet to find only one absolute favourite.    Fall Out Boy have done some truly interesting things with their sound this go around. They've really come together as a band on Folie a Deux and instead of just one truly great part there are four. Of the 14 songs on this album (13 songs and a hidden track) there's a few songs that I'm drawn to, that I listen to over and over again.    It's so hard to narrow down though there's so many awesome things about all of the songs. I can't help listening to 'She's My Winona' and 'West Coast Smoker' (oh hell yes!) but '(Coffee's for Closers)' and '20 Dollar Nose Bleed' make me happy in my soul. and and and... I could go on. In my mind there is nothing on Folie a Deux that is not to love.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Once again, Disney delivers a great famil film that even a 15 year old would love. Although this movie doesnt have any talking in the first half, it still has funny moments. The picture and audio are both phenomenol in this release. A definite buy!!

0446581348|2.0|I've never liked Bobbi Brown but I wanted this book so badly when it first came out. After reading through it at the local bookstore, I decided not to bother wasting the money on it. I'm a makeup artist, and even though i'm fairly new to the field, I already knew everything that was in it. The only thing that was of interest to me was the list of agencies in the back of the book.    I would have given this one star, but I can see how it would be of great help to women who are clueless when it comes to makeup. It's decent as an introductory, but if you know about brushes, foundation, and basic application, don't waste the money.
B00008WT5E|4.0|AC/DC had one more stop before they exited for [[ASIN:B00008BXJG Highway to Hell]]. It was on \\"Powerage\\" that they continued spiralling upwards, tightening the twin guitar attack, picking up new bassist Cliff Williams and having Bon Scott perfect his infernal yalp. Once again, the songs were amped up sagas of bad love, wicked women and hard living, and this time the band dropped a pair of classics in \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Riff Raff.\\"<br /><br />Had the band not come up with a masterpiece on the next try, \\"Powerage\\" might not be such an overlooked record in the AC/DC canon. \\"Rock and Roll Damnation\\" is as good a three chord concert blaster as the band's ever come up with, and \\"Down Payment Blues\\" is the kind of funny/scary only Bon Scott could deliver. (\\"Can't even feed my cat on Social Security\\" being my favorite.) When the album closes with the loud and angry \\"Kicked In The Teeth,\\" you're once again shown that AC/DC were stampeding towards the top of the arena rock heap. \\"Powerage\\" is a really good album that arrived just before a great one, but it's still worth a spot in your collection.
B00006DEF9|5.0|We first watched this movie as a family about 5 years ago, and Donald O'Connor cracked my son up while Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds entranced my daughter. Now, 5 years later, we purchased the movie for the holidays, and everyone loved it just as much again. We had to repeat \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" a couple of times, and the music and dancing dazzled everyone throughout. The story is fun, too. A classic movie with a vibrancy and joy that transmits cleanly through time to all ages. What great fun!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is, hands-down, one of the best war stories ever made. I've been waiting a long time for this to come to Blu-Ray, and it was worth the wait. With the right TV, the right sound system, mild hearing loss and several irritated neighbors later, you can emerge from some of the scenes shaking and twitchy, as if you'd witnessed it first hand.    I can't express enough how much you walk away from this series respecting these men, what they did, and the entire generation and armed forces. \\"Wow\\" is about the best way to put it.    If you have a Blu-Ray player and enjoy military movies, this is the series you're going to be pulling from when you want to leave your friends in awe.    Note to all you guys out there - my wife enjoyed watching this series, and her best friend enjoys watching it with her fiancee. This isn't just a shoot 'em up. There's a lot of drama in here, and some fantastic character build-up. This may be your best shot to get your significant other to watch a war movie with you, and what better one to watch that a series which masterfully articulates the bravery, suffering, sense of duty, and just \\"doing what needed to be done\\" of this time period.
0765317389|5.0|A while ago, there was an interesting conversation among the people I follow on Twitter. They were discussing books, and several people commented that one of the best books they had read was Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card. A book in the science fiction genre, that had quite a following, I found. I put it on my list of books to find at the library. About a month went by, as I had other books that needed to be read and reviewed. But with a holiday season coming up, I thought that it would be nice to have some \\"recreational reading.\\" I checked out Ender's Game from the library on December 30 and finished it on January 1. I would have finished it earlier, but I needed to sleep and attend work, family, and New Year's Eve activities.<br /><br />Somewhere in the future, children are bred to defend Earth against a hostile alien's next attack. By law, families can have only two children. The parents give up rights to the children for a while, as they are tested for their fitness to defend Earth. Part of the testing is to discover if a particular child can lead armies and have the fortitude to make hard decisions concerning the future of the human race. However, if the government decides that the parents have a good genetic base, they may authorize a third child, as the first two show excellent results, but not quite \\"perfect.\\" The problem with this is that the family must absorb burdens placed on it by society. And the child is referred to as \\"Third,\\" a term of derogation, noncompliance. The Wiggin family has a Third, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, who is six when the story begins. Ender, the government hopes, will strike a balance between his older brother, Peter, who is dangerous, given to fits of anger and destruction, and his sister, Valentine, who is empathetic. All three, however, are extremely smart. It is with Ender that the government pins their hopes of victory over the aliens.<br /><br />The copy of Ender's Game that I borrowed from the library is a part of the \\"Gift Edition,\\" which includes a new introduction by Orson Scott Card. While I usually enjoy these new introductions, Card, I felt, explained too much about Ender, his writing style, and how this book has affected the readers. I think that his publisher should have included Card's thoughts, but as an Afterword. It would have had more impact. Now that I have that out of the way, I need to tell you that this is, simply, one of the best books I have ever read. The hero is gifted, but alone. His intelligence makes him an outcast at school. Because of this, he doesn't really relate to any of the children in his class. The government builds on his isolation, so that he can make hard decisions with little thought to the feelings of others or to change his thinking due to friendships. But there is a humanity to Ender that endears him to the reader. The adults in the novel may think that they have control over him, but they are allowed to believe that, if it serves Ender's goals or objectives. I used to read a lot of science fiction, but have moved to other genres; this book has restored my interest. While Ender is six, Card never patronizes the reader or his characters. Ender is a well crafted character; intelligent, warm, and, when the situation warrants, tough. Your preconceived notions of children, and gifted children, will be tested. But the payoff is that you may realize that you have read one of the best science fiction books. Not only is worth your time, it is a book to share with your children.includes a new introduction by Orson Scott Card.

B000002G7E|5.0|1967.    A year that changed the musical landscape. The emergence of psychedelia affected nearly every major recording artist performing at the time; even the macho swaggering Rolling Stones were not immune to this new scene. Much of the music steeped in pyschedlia and produced that year resulted in soulless records, bland and boring.    Fortunately, one band would release an album full of life; one that challenged the musical landscape.    The Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat    Upon the formation of the Velvet Underground, the subject matter of sex and drugs was nothing new in rock and roll. It was how the subject matter was addressed that made the Velvet Underground, their debut album in particular, different. More importantly, though, their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico hinted at the shearing sheets of noise that would mark the follow-up album    White Light/White Heat introduced an element of music seldom used in 1967: sheets of noise. Abrasive while retaining their pop sensibilities, the Velvet Underground blazed forward with an urgency. Each instrument created its own sharp, churning sound. The title track introduced these elements to the listener; every subsequent track upped the ante.    But the Velvet Underground relied on much more than noise, although that was the unifying element of the album. Listen to John Cale's spoken word piece on \\"The Gift.\\" And typical of the Velvet Underground, their love of bubblegum pop is present in \\"Here She Comes Now\\" and the scorching \\"I Heard Her Call My Name,\\" with its feedback and noisy wallop throughout. This is the Velvet Underground challenging traditional music conventions and the musical landscape at large.    The album closes with the mammoth \\"Sister Ray,\\" a dangerous eighteen minute exercise in the melding and destruction of a simple riff. The track's influence is easily recognizable in many of today's noise rock artists. And, while it may have been record over forty years ago, the track is still every bit as abrasive, dangerous, and antagonizing as it was in 1967.    Don't believe it? Play \\"Sister Ray,\\" or any cut off this album, on the local jukebox and revel in the patrons' reactions.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift has a voice one can listen to over and over (and I have).  Outstanding Album! She started out as a Really Great Singer with a silky, smooth voice who can turn gutsy on a single note; her music and lyrics (credits to her co-writers, too) have matured in a very short time. It's refreshing to hear an album with no \\"in-your-face\\" (blatanly offensive words, or explicit obscene connotations) junk thrown in just for fun or in the name of \\"creative license.\\" Taylor Swift takes simple life situations and makes something more lifelike out of them, as her songs range from Country to Pop Country to Balad.  Kudos to surrounding herself with very talented musicians who blend well and complement her stage presence. She also shows you do not have to be on American Idol to be an American Idol. And did I mention the voice?  Give her \\"a listen.\\"
B001DHXT20|4.0|Bravo and good show to Liv Tyler.  Her performance as Betty Ross is her best acting to date.  She almost steals the show from everyone else involved on the screen.  She works extremely well with Edward Norton, who also makes an excellent Bruce Banner.  The struggle of fighting against the government's plan to use genetic manipulation as a war weapon always makes for a good action flick, and The Hulk does not drop the ball on that history.<br /><br />The storyline keeps moving along, and the rich landscape scenes make this movie play out like an artistic wonderland filled with covert operations and outright war in the streets.  The CGI was able to make The Hulk come off the pages of the comic books and appear on screen.  That said, I still had a problem with the cartoon-look at different times in the movie.  I also found it a little strange that in the final fight scene of the movie there just happened to be a giant chain to for The Hulk and Abomination to choke each other with.  I mean what are the odds that such a huge chain would just fall into the battle in the middle of the city.<br /><br />I do believe Sam Elliot would have been a better choice than William Hurt in the role as General Ross.  I like William Hurt, but in this role, he just seemed a little too stiff.  Elliot would have provided that \\"is that dude crazy\\" element.<br /><br />Christina Cabot is always a pleasure to see on any movie screen.  This woman's career has just begun!  Look for her to have way bigger roles in the near future.<br /><br />So, to finish off this review:  If you liked The Incredible Hulk comic books, then you will like the CGI work in this film.  If you have to have perfect CGI in order to get through a script on film, well The Hulk is not the movie for you.<br /><br />See ya next review!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|The Final Fantasy VII story line has been fleshed out so  much since its original release that it seems new all over again with each release.  Advent Children is the jumping point from which all the new Final Fantasy VII titles seem to have been launched, even those that are meant to be prequels.  Cloud wears his new look well, as does Tifa, although I do miss the original costumes.  Aerith is so beautiful in this movie, she's always really inspired me.  I like that so many of the original characters reappeared here and that the mythology of the game remains essentially the same as it had been.  If you've played Final Fantasy VII and you haven't seen this yet, by all means, pick it up.

B000065U1N|3.0|For years, I've been encouraged to watch the movie \\"Black Hawk Down\\", because of my interest in Machiavellian \\"realpolitics.\\"  Essentially, the debacle of the mission was highlighted as representative of failed communications. It was seen as one more example of Washington getting it all wrong in military logistics. But, the overriding mesage is that the mission is covert and Washington isn't supposed to know about it. If the President or leading congressmen were questioned, they would naturally deny, deny, deny...    One naturally sides with the courage and bravery of the soldiers who fight for a higher calling. But, based on the reality of the world, today's enemies are tomorrow's friends.  This isn't suggested in the movie, but it isn't far fetched in our analysis. Yes, the movie essentially portrays what is supposed to be a historical fact, but two  weeks after viewing, you are left to ask, \\"Now, why were we trying to kill this guy in Somalia\\"?  You scratch your head in wonder, but remember the intense emotions of the firefights.    \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a movie you only watch once. Not for its greatness, but to say you saw it.

B0018CWEYY|4.0|The show is great as usual, and this season has some mind-blowing twists and turns, but there are only 14 episodes... :(    I didn't watch the show on TV, as I like to watch it all at once when it comes on DVDs, so I didn't realize there would be so few episodes... compared to the 23 episodes from season three this is a bit \\"light\\".    I really feel cheated because the recommended retail price is the same than for season three.  In my humble opinion the price should have been dropped to reflect the content of this Boxset...too bad, so sad...there was the writers' strike...well it's no reason to cheat people out of their hard earned money by filling 2 discs with extras, and spreading thin the episodes on the 4 remaining discs.    So I vote \\"Yeah!\\" for the show, but \\"Nay!\\" for the price.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie was fantastic. But you don't need to read yet another review to know that. So I'm not going to review the movie, I'm going to review the special features dvd.     The special features dvd is quite boring. I was hoping for more of the special effects to be paid attention to, the scenery to be talked about (I live in Chicago and my boyfriend works in the loop, where a lot of the movie takes place). I was hoping at least for a small special tribute to Heath Ledger, but absolutely nothing other than the mention at the end of the movie. There's \\"Gotham Uncovered: the creation of a scene\\" which was mildly interesting, but nothing news worthy. Imax sequences, where they just show different scenes shot in Imax film; \\"Gotham Tonight\\" which is just Anthony Michael Hall playing a news reporter who does different segments in the film. The galleries are nothing special either, just the posters everyone saw for the movie and some stills. Then of course the trailers are there too. There's really no reason to spend the extra $ on the two disc edition. It really wasn't worth it. To be frank, the special features sucked. The only reason I would suggest buying this one as opposed to the single disc version that's cheaper is the digital copy. If you really want to have it on your computer so that you don't have to lug the dvd around if you have a laptop like me, this is the version you want. Though why amazon offers the movie as a download for free if you buy it as well as you get it on the dvd itself is beyond me. I now have two copies.     To sum up my review: Unless you really want a digital copy, don't bother with this edition. Special effects dvd is pointless.
1400082773|4.0|A very candid and revealing look at the background and genesis of our new president. The pain (and painful honesty) of Barack Obama's life growing up in Indonesia and Hawaii are offset by his personal and astute observations of the racial terrain in America. As someone in both black and white worlds, he has a rare viewpoint of the ways of these two conflicting cultures.<br /><br />This is an engaging memoir of confronting the past in the process of self-discovery, of growing up \\"fatherless\\" in a single parent world. Obama's struggle and coming to terms with his absent father and his candor of this as he travels to Kenya to find answers - this has been written up in compelling and eloquent language. Although this book was penned 14 years ago, it remains indispensable for the fundamental understanding of this man who is to now to lead this country.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewer from Ankeny, Iowa about how the reader needs to be listening to the core messages in this text, regardless of political orientation. This is about a man who has overcome much in his pursuit of an absent father and the quest to reconcile with that absence. As such, it is about a courageous journey of self-discovery, one that inspires and encourages.<br /><br />This text is Barack Obama defining himself in his earlier years; for his years in the political arena, THE AUDACITY OF HOPE is an engaging read that picks up the thread of his fascinating life. There are excerpts from this book at the end of the 2004 revised edition of DREAMS FROM MY FATHER. Highly recommended.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1934289884 Parataxis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1595941967 The Cloud Reckoner]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1425751881 Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts]]
1400034205|5.0|This one does not pander to any low common denominator.  Makes you think as you read; not as stuffy as I originally feared and expected.  Good fiction!
0385340990|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely and I will be giving it to people I love.  It is a history of the German occupation of one of the Channel Islands during World War II (Guernsey) and how the people survived without much food and with horrible things happening.  And yet how they were able to make it through and maintain their sense of humor, deepen their relationships with others, and sometimes, the best of them, lost their lives.  It is the story of heroic people who care more about others than themselves. It is the story of how literature and good books can make all of the difference in someone's life, and it is a refreshing story of a young and great female author and how she finds her life in a place she least expects.  The life she finds is amazingly heartfelt and palpable.<br /><br />There are many hilarious moments, tear inducing moments, insights into many different types of personalities, as well as great love and compassion that good people show to others.  Each of the primary characters are different and well described to the point where I loved them and sometimes held my breath for them.<br /><br />There are several heartbreaking sub stories about children being separated from parents, and parents dying in the war or dying young and leaving little orphans behind.  And yet the stories aren't lugubrious, they are positive and good people step in to fill in for the lost parents.<br /><br />This is one of the most positive and uplifting books I have ever read.  I loved it.
B000096I9G|4.0|It's not very usual having the chance to watch contemporary bands performing live their whole album recordings, perhaps because they haven't managed to arrange the songs properly when it comes to play them on stage, perhaps because it's not easy to bring them live without the appropriate instrumentation and mixing consoles originally used in the studio, or just because only the most relevant singles are brought onto the live experience, simply skipping the remaining cuts...<br /><br />Whatever it is that makes today's bands not to play their whole albums integrity, it's a relief to see how The Cure performs and record live their 'black albums' in a whole, beautifully shot along with a cristal clear sound.<br /><br />Only shame / remark [for which I'm not giving the whole 5 stars] would be the poor and cheap packaging production for such a great material, and the fact that some of the guitars and drums don't sound as if they were played by the original Cure's lineup, but that's the deal folks: it's not the original Cure's lineup, so some slight differences with the original albums may be expected.<br /><br />Everything else is simply perfect.<br /><br />Contents: 5 stars.<br /><br />Packaging: 2 stars.<br /><br />So this is it: the whole enchilada plus some valuable extra features and some hidden easter eggs... as:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />1) Once in the \\"Disintegration Set\\" menu, highlight \\"Plainsong\\" and move the cursor to the left.

The music is good and the vocals are great. My personal favorite is The Time of my Life and Declaration. However, I think all the songs are just plain old good. I haven't bought any cd's or downloaded any music for a very long time because I haven't really connected with any music or artist like I have with David Cook. I'm expecting a whole range of music from him in the future. I think he has a great deal of talent and it will be a fun thing to watch it develop. Thanks David Cook for some good tunes.

B001DHXT20|4.0|Kudos to Marvel and their continuing movie franchise. The 2008 movie blows away the 2005 movie in every regard - acting, plot, believable unbelievable action etc. Norton is a great choice to pick up baton from Bixby. I enjoyed the cameo apperance of Lou Ferrigno. The filming of the scenes in South America was great. Now, if I could make a request, I'd love to see The Mighty Thor properly done. Hopefully it's on the creative board somewhere already.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I have to say, I watched this series in the summer when it came out and i was hooked on it. I was so impressed with it, just the way it was filmed made it feel real. Another great series by HBO.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Seeing this on the heels of watching the new James Bond Quantum of Solace and the re-make of the Day The Earth Stood Still (two huge disappointments) Iron Man was a very pleasant surprise. The film had plot, acting, dialogue, direction, special effects, humor - what a concept, maybe this type of film making could catch on in Hollywood. What do you think? I'm already anxious for the sequel. Weak spots - not too many, perhaps Jeff Bridges characters motivation. But that's nit picking.
B001FEA9QU|2.0|It could have been worse . . .<br />The original Metallica energy was fresh. Now it's microwaved. Somewhere after the Black Album, a switch went off, and all that was great about Metallica fled into the darkness.<br />Maybe the band should take a few years off and hunt for that greatness. I know, that would cost them millions of corporate dollars, but at least they could regain their musical integrity.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|Wow. I recently picked this up and I must have seen a hundred times. It never gets old. Harrison Ford is outstanding. I think this was his best movie. As to the picture quality it is lacking somewhat, but I kind of like the grainy look it had. They don't make em' like this anymore. What is trully awesome about this movie is the way all the action scenes were shot. All of them out in the Chicago cold, both actors doing their own stunts, real locations, and in some cases real cops (Chicago Police-two detectives), All the movies I have seen in the last five years just lack what this film had.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|I usually stay away from hyperboles. But, the Mist may be the Hamlet of monsters movies. It succeeds on two levels. It is first and foremost a monster movie that is truly horrific. Darabont's realistic direction fleshed out King's story and characters, and made the Lovercraftian horrors much more tangible and immediate. Secondly, the movie is a careful study of the psychology of fear, or how fear operates in group dynamics. It shows that fear makes people do what they otherwise would not, and makes them believe in things that they otherwise would not.    There is much controversy surrounding the ending. It works fine for me both dramatically and emotionally. I would also like to point out that King clearly alluded to it in his novella:    \\"I checked the gun and then put it into the glove compartment. Ollie had reloaded it after the expedition to the drugstore. The rest of the shells had disappeared with him, but that was all right. He had fired at Mrs. Carmody, he had fired once at the clawed thing, and the gun had discharged once when it hit the ground. There were four of us in the Scout, but if push came right down to shove, I'd find some other way out for myself.\\"    The allusion renders the movie ending much legitimacy. An enthusiastic reader can even speculate that such an ending may be what King himself would have wanted it on a deep subconscious level. We would probably never know for sure. What we do have is this wonderful piece of movie making!
1401300529|5.0|This was the first book solely dedicated to the Korean War that I had read. Reading it was a powerful experience in many ways, especially when reading of the battles and the struggle for survival as experienced by the men in combat. Halberstam is good in following ordinary soldiers and officers in their respective units and how they dealt with critical situations. The leaders from all sides get a good analysis too. Gen. MacArthur doesn't come off looking good, and for good reasons. While his bold plan at Inchon succeeded, his desire to keep pushing  north despite the dangers of Chinese intervention and Washington's desire to keep this to a limited war would lead to near catastrophe.    This book is heavy on key battles, military strategy, and the politics of the war from both sides. Some of the history behind the fall of China to the Communists led by Mao Zedong, and the politics of this development back in the United States are detailed as well. Halberstam does tend to jump around from chapter to chapter in order to try and bring the bigger picture to light. I think he does this fairly successfully, though I felt the military stalemate the war brought was dealt with in a fairly perfunctory manner.     Without doubt, the ordeal of the American soldier is lucidly told. One can almost sense the frigid cold ,the confusion of battle and the struggle for survival as the author describes it. Halberstam doesn't hold back from criticizing generals and other people (on both sides) who acted or made unwise decisions. The failure of MacArthur and others in accepting good intelligence information was a critical blunder. MacArthur's contempt or underestimation (maybe I'm being too kind) of his Chinese adversaries and for his own superiors in Washington were other areas where MacArthur and others deserved criticism. Unfortunately, those in Washington who could have been more forceful with MacArthur often let him have his way or were just down right timid to confront him. President Truman would eventually fire his general gone rogue.    The North Korean leader and the Chinese leader also get examined for their roles and where they made mistakes. The differences on military strategy between Mao Zedong and Peng Dehuai (his top general) gets some mention as well.    Halberstam's skills as a writer certainly shine through in this book. One can also feel a passion behind his writing. A truly remarkable book that gave me a greater appreciation for the men who fought in Korea and for understanding the politics of the war.
031606792X|4.0|I unashamedly loved this book, and what's not to like? Love, marriage, sex (hehe) birth, death, rebirth, then a nice battle for supremacy. This book was like a \\"sweeps\\" episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br /><br />I enjoyed everything about this book. It starts off with the wedding followed by the honeymoon. Edward's plan to wear Bella out so she would be too tired to be horny was a hoot! Poor Edward, though he does manage to slip a few past the goalie. *wink wink* (How it's physiologically possible is a question I would dearly love to have answered.) But regardless, the results were mindboggling. Bella's pregnancy and subsequent birth have officially put me off from ever wanting to give birth. *shudders*<br /><br />Emmett really stepped up in this book as one of my new favorite characters. He absolutely charmed me in this book and I loved him, though why he puts up with Rosalie is beyond me.<br /><br />There are a lot of wonderful day to day descriptive passages as Bella gets used to her new life, plus everyone else settling into a mutually satisfactory routine. I love this new dynamic of Edward, Bella, Jacob and Renesme. Then there is the buildup of the Volturi coming to Forks to end the Cullens and anyone else who might be a challenge to their rule.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in the end. What was built up as this epic battle ended up being diffused by alot of endless talking and negotiating. While it's heartwarming to imagine a bunch of people working out their differences by talking it out rather than hacking each other to pieces, it doesn't make for very exciting action.<br /><br />Oh, well. It leaves a possible opening for any future Twilight books and I would love to read more in this fun series. Ha! Me and thirty million other screaming fans. C'mon Stephenie! Write more!
0618526412|4.0|The story and the characters are so quirky, I found it very difficult to get really interested----picking it up and putting it down numerous times, until I made it about half-way through. At that point, I sailed through it.     This will never be a favorite, but it's well worth the read, based on characterization alone. What a talented writer MacCuller's was at such a young age.
0385340990|1.0|Bibliophiles and anglophiles will enjoy this book for its embracement of a literary society, references to classic British authors' lives and its epistolary style.  Its description of life in the Channel Island of Guernsey during and soon after World War II will raise readers' interest.<br /><br />However, some of the characters seem to be caricatures: few people in Britain have names like \\"Darsey\\" except in Bronte-sister books.<br /><br />More research would have made this book more believable and interesting.  For example,  No-one in 1946 would have taken a sudden trip to Australia and the mail boat to the island took six hours and would not have been an evening sail.  The Channel Islands' inhabitants have many traditions that are distinct from those in Britain: many inhabitants have French surnames.  A farmer there was unlikely to own one cow. These characteristics did not come out in the book.<br /><br />The facts about wartime life in the island are though, based on true historical events.  Although many seem to be included in the book in a very disjointed manner and with not-so-believable effect.<br /><br />Being as I seem to be in the minority in not recommending this book, if after reading this book your interest in wartime life in the Channel Islands is sufficiently raised, may I suggest the true story \\"Prison without Bars\\" by Frank Keiller.

0007170874|5.0|My university suggested to all students that they read this book.  I agree very much with their focus on why students should learn how to manage and lead.  IBM was once a has been corporation in the early 1990s until Lou Gerstner showed them how to be nimble and respond to customer needs.  IBM lost its focus because it did not focus its energies on exploiting the innovations of its labs.  They were losing money faster than at anytime in the past.  Only Gerstner showed how they could focus their energies on creating value in the marketplace.  Gerstner's sage advice and guidance helped IBM survive this struggle to become profitable again.  IBM is such a huge technological company that one wonders how Gerstner turned around this company. His leadership saved IBM. One wonders if he could save a company like GM or Chrysler now.<br /><br />This is a great book to read on leadership and common sense.  You don't have to be a genius to be a leader.  What you need is the ability to focus on your organization's strengths and weaknesses.  Improve your weaknesses and exploit your strengths.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|I tried. I tried, i tried oh, how I tried to like this album. I own all of Coldplay's albums and was extremely excited when I first heard about this release. I listened to it maybe about 50 times from beginning to end, but it just fell flat for me. I don't get it. It seems as though Coldplay was lazy with this album. The songs are predictable and formulaic. This is an extremely poor exhibit of their talent. Better luck next time, Coldplay.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|The series starts out nicely but quickly turns bland, mostly due to dreadful choices in scripting.  The director covers major events in history in banal conversations between characters, instead of actual film scenes.   For example, the major battles of the war are glossed over, and the famous Boston tea party is covered in a five minute discussion between John Adams and his brother Sam Adams.  This is the major flaw with this series.  The most profound example is how the film handled the American victory in the War of Independence: at the very climax of the war, when America wins its independence, all we see is John Adams in his sick bed, receiving news of the event.  How pathetic.  You'd think they could be a little more creative than that.  I mean, if JFK had a cold during the first moon landing, do you think his film biography would show him sick in bed reading the news, or would it still show the Apollo moon landing?     Paul Giamatti plays a wonderful John Adams.  He is very convincing.  And the early scenes between him and his wife, portrayed by Laura Linney, are quite touching.  Their early years together are fascinating.  But as the time passes, I found myself less and less interested in John Adams and more interested in the surrounding events which were not portrayed.  I found myself wondering what was the point?     The series has some wonderful sets, like the recreation of Boston harbor filled with British warships, and the royal court in France.  Some of the scenes of John Adams in France are startling, especially the royal dinner party.  All the french are terrible snobs and yet they look completely ridiculous in their wigs and heavy, heavy make-up (the men were the worst).       Unfortunately, it is all wasted.  The movie has many opportunities to excel, but falls far short. The best example perhaps is Adams' vice-presidency.  The film briefly talks about a conspiracy to keep him from becoming president, and offers some vague hints about collusion between Washington and Hamilton to control the government.  Yet this shocking revelation is glossed over in favor of other scenes where Adams is simply treated by his fellows with a lack of respect.  An entire episode should have been spent just on this early political intrigue.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This album (if you are new to Radiohead's style at least) is an acquired taste. But when you do learn to like it, it's breathtaking.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I'm neither an expert in movies or classical music, so you may not want to waste time with this review. There are many others who offer expert comment.  All I can do is tell you what I like about this DVD.    My wife left me with a normally vicious cat.  You've heard Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast.  My wild cat only accepts one kind of music and one composer--Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  I jumped at the thought of getting this movie.  Here was something I could watch in comfort without worrying about the irritable feline critic.  That is worth two stars.    I began the afternoon in a terrible mood.  Watching this show brought me peace and comfort.  I enjoyed the story and the music.  Two more stars earned.    It is a long movie which made me feel I was getting something for the high price.  When you are used to paying 11.95 for an eleven page pamnphlet this feeling of getting a product at a good price is worth a star.    Will you give it five stars?  Who knows?  More to the point who cares?  I can't tell you what you will like.  If I could, Amazon would hire me right away as director of propaganda and pay me enough to buy all the items I want. This is a good buy!
B00004XONN|5.0|Keep an open mind when you buy this. I did and I promise, my brains didn't fall out! I love this album, it's a breathtaking experience listening to it. buy it.
B001GJOL22|3.0|Big Rush fan, first Blu-ray DVD, very disappointed!  The video is great as is the audio, but many songs ( especially Neil's drum solo and Working them Angels) the video does not line up with the audio.  Being a musician myself, it drives me crazy knowing this.  Even if you are NOT a musician, you can see and hear that the two do not line up.  Anyone else notice this same issue? It's not my player or system, because when I watch the Atlanta Bootlegs bonus material, it lines up just fine.  At times if you watch the video screen behind the band it lines up perfectly, but if you watch the band the sound is about a 1/2 second BEHIND the video.      Great DVD to have if you can get over the out of sync issue.
B000XUOIQ4|3.0|Why do some rich, childless women leave their entire fortunes to pets--cats, in particular?  The question can addle one's mind, even driving some to kidnapping and attempted murder.  It completely freaked out Edgar, the much maligned butler in \\"The Aristocats,\\" Disney's tribute not to cats, or the upper class--but to the jazz age.     Edgar learns of his status in his boss's will by listening to a conversation through--what else?--a drain pipe in his tiny quarters.  So that night he drugs the woman's four cats (Eva Gabor, really, and three illegitimate kittens) and drops them off in the country.  There's no way they can find their way back, unless they meet Ballou the Bear or some other Phil Harris-esque figure--which, fortunately, they do.  Harris is just as cool and charming as ever as the free-spirited Thomas O'Malley Cat.  But instead of entering with the more charming, \\"Well it's a doobity doo, it's a doobity doo, I mean a dooby dooby dooby dooby doobity do,\\" Ballou--I mean, O'Malley--sings a long, tiresome tribute to his lack of responsibility.      To his credit, he almost immediately feels responsible for the stranded cat family in spite of their apparent lack of shortcomings, hijacking a milk truck headed for Paris and the aristocratic mansion where the woman is by now completely losing it.  (Perhaps she should have made more effort to bond with humans, rather than pets.  I'm not saying she deserved this, but people do set themselves up for tragedy, and then act completely shocked when the inevitable happens.)  Later, they meet up with two spinster geese and their alcoholic uncle.  Edgar, meanwhile, tries to retrieve his hat from two American Civil War throwback dogs that have somehow ended up in the French countryside.    It's all just a prelude to the rocking finale, set in a flophouse full of O'Malley's neér-do-well friends, who live for jazz and just hanging out, Daddio.  They're so laid back, so tolerant of different lifestyles--or so one might think,until the puzzling refrain of their catchy song: \\"A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born every time he plays/With a square in the act, you can send music back to the caveman days.\\" They go on to decree that only a select few--hepcats, specifically--should be allowed to play music at all.  As if to hammer home the point, the \\"cats\\" launch into an inspired, raucous rocking jazz tirade that threatens to literally bring down the flophouse.      It's the defining scene of the movie, really the only one worth waiting for, and it comes to a screeching halt when an emaciated, buck toothed, Asian-looking \\"cat\\" plays a piano solo with chopsticks and blurts:  \\"Shanghai Hong Kong egg foo yung/Fortune cookie always wrong.\\"  What?  Should we let our kids watch this movie?  Well, it's hard to refuse them when you see them dancing through the house, singing, \\"Everybody/everybody/everybody wants to be a cat.\\"  Unfortunately, this movie is likely to make a parent identify more with the butler than with the hepcats.
031606792X|1.0|I'm just going to come out and say it - this entire series pretty much sucked.    I read these books because a friend of mine recommended them to me.  After I read Twilight, I continued on with the series, kind of hoping they got better as they went.     In Twilight, I was intrigued while Bella tried to figure out the strange boy who couldn't decide if he wanted to snarl at her or smile at her.  Once the mystery was gone, so was my interest.  She dives right in to being an annoyingly obsessed teenager who can't string two coherent thoughts together.  The biggest joke in the book is her snapping at Jessica, who at least can admit that Edward's looks are what snared her.  No, Bella has to insist there's more behind the face.  Remarkable, since the book takes place in her head, and yet we still see no evidence that she's noticed what's behind his face, either.    Yet there was a love story, a couple of cute lines, and a few redeeming scenes, so I didn't trash the book to anyone who asked about it.  I continued on with the series, skipping pages that got too grotesquely corny for me and pretending Jacob didn't exist.  Then, I read Breaking Dawn.    Can we say fanfic gone horribly awry?    I don't want to go into too many spoilers, but where the hell did this crap come from, and why didn't the editor stop it at the door?  The only parts I found tolerable (note I said tolerable, not GOOD) were Jacob's chapters, and that's only because it gave me a chance to step out of Bella's obsessive compulsive antisocial suicidal head for a bit and breathe.      I was sick of Bella before this book.  I was sick of the way that she's constantly regarded as selfless, when her whining, complaining and tantrums about gifts and attention constantly point to someone who is so self centered she doesn't care who she makes unhappy as long as she feels comfortable.  I was sick of the way she's so indefinably stupid that she always thinks she has to be the sacrifice, she has to be the one to step up and save everyone - her supernaturally strong, intelligent friends couldn't possible fix it like SHE could.  I felt that she didn't so much want to protect her loved ones as much as she insisted on courting her own demise.     Then, with this book, her selfishness and shallowness all pay off and she gets her fairy tale ending, complete with tiny princess for the fangless daddy to dote on and pet pooch to guard their pretty cottage.      All stories need to include some struggle, some hard decision for the heroine to sort through.  I have to admit that Meyer's at least delivered this much in her other three books.  This one provides a lot of hints for a struggle - Bella changing, Charlie's reaction, the bad guys swooping down on them in the end - but none of it produces ANYTHING.  Everything just kind of works itself out while the characters obsess about other things that may go wrong, and then those things inevitably work themselves out, too.  This is essentially a really long book where nothing happens, but a lot of stuff might.    After being disappointed that I didn't take to the series, my friend shoved a copy of the not-yet-finished Midnight Sun at me and told me to try that instead.  I did, hesitantly, and found myself sucked in.  The story was so much more genuine from Edward's point of view (not being in Bella's head had a lot to do with that).  He shows an honest struggle and a desire to know the girl before declaring love.  But now Meyer's won't finish that book.  Her stance that she won't write because it was leaked on the internet is essentially watching her take her toys and stomp home because the game wasn't going the way she wanted.    I'm officially done with this series and this egotistical writer.  I want those hours of my life back, please.
0743298039|5.0|This book is the real deal.  A wonderful story, masterfully told; a book that will be as good in 30 years as it is today; a piece of literature that will stand the test of time.  Much has been written about the plot in other reviews so I won't repeat that, but this is a book for all readers who love books and appreciate a complex story, elegantly told.  Much like a fine bottle of wine, it is to be savored.
B0015XHQTE|1.0|I looked into this DVD set and I discovered that there is no subtitle and no closed captions in all Dirty Harry DVD collection.  We are extremely upset with these great shows without any subtitle/closed captions.  Clint Eastwood must be a bigotry man against non-English people and hearing impaired people who need to read what their says. FIX THESE DVDS TO ADD SUBTITLE OR GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DAY!!!
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I've read, listened and snickered at all the reasons for not liking the movie. The weak voices of some of the actors attached, the nonsensical plot, etcetera, but at the end of the day, I simply couldn't. Intellectual snobbery aside, all of the cast were having such a bloody good time on screen that all the arguments were laid to rest.  In an age where good comedies get no awards, where musicals are picked apart and lambasted for not 'making sense' (as if any instance of people singing and dancing spontaneously would EVER make logical sense) and only the bleakest of the bleak movies/performances get accolades and award recognition, how can it be wrong to just want to smile, shake your head and enjoy this movie, regardless of the many reasons to not do so?<br /><br />We all know the major players, but I think Amanda Seyfried (who has also been an standout on television in \\"Veronica Mars\\" and \\"Big House\\") should be commended for her acting AND singing ability.  Her sweet rendition of \\"I Have a Dream\\" was spectacular and her many other interpretations throughout this movie more than made up for any other musical shortcomings.
0887307280|5.0|I found this book to be a great read. Having been involved in starting a business and many of the heart aches that have come along, this book address many issues that everyone is likely to come across in most business.    For everyone that believes that it is important to keep a personal educational library, this is one of books that has the potential to create a Paradigm Shift in the way to conduct things within your business. Such things include: overall organization, policy, strategy, automation, people management, and more.     This book may not give you the full detail of what you may require in your business or endeavor, but will set the foundation of how to structure things optimally.    After having read E-myth revisited, I see more people daily in need of this valuable information. If you are serious about your business, how it operates, how much free time your have; This one is well worth your time.
B000J0NIIW|4.0|It's very useful for quick spills. But don't let the battery charging for longer than needed it will damage the battery. I haven't been able to use for this reason in quite a while. I hope to be able to use with the suggestions from other reviewers.
1591396190|5.0|This is one of those books that makes you sit back and say Wow every few pages. I have been involved in a business for a number of years and was in search of a book that might help us accelerate our growth.    Blue Ocean strategy is one the best books I have read in my educational library for some time. It talks about how to take what you got (your business/organization) and re-invent it into something that is even better, making your company stronger within and giving the market place something that is unique, with potential for strong growth. A strong emphasis is on taking a hard look at what you have and know for certain what the market demands or goals to be attained, then using the tools in this book to get there.    Folks that might review this book in a bad light are those that lack creativity or are unwilling to do the work required for the tools in Blue Ocean Strategy (BOS) to be useful. Every organization that is in need of help is deferent. This book has a great foundation to work from to make the changes needed.    BOS is a book of tools and strategies that can be used by any business to re-organize or re-invent and set a new course for growth. I would recommend this book to anyone that wishes to re-invent a company or is considering making a new company that will likely break away from the competitors. An excellent read!
B001JE25ZE|5.0|I am Legend is a compelling, suspenseful story that draws the reader into the nightmarish world of Robert Neville, the last man on earth, as he battles vampires and struggles to understand the cause of the vampire epidemic through research and experimentation. The unpredictable ending provides a shocking twist. Screenwriter and novelist Richard Matheson reinvented the vampire story in I am Legend, but his apocalyptic vision of legions of the undead also inspired dozens (if not hundreds) of zombie novels, comics, and movies (including three based on the novel itself).<br /><br />This particular edition includes a bonus: ten short stories.
159562015X|2.0|Light reading, possible to finish in one stretched sitting. It does not offer any surprizes, or anything knew. It is more of a summary of strengths list, may be a good way to find out if any of yours made the list. If you can -> borrow a friend's or library copy.     I found the classification interesting. In \\"Working with Others who have \\"NameofStrength\\" sections, depending on the strength type - the author addressed his comments as \\"she or he\\" not both. Here are some examples: Achiever was mentioned as \\"he\\", activator was mentioned as \\"she\\", Adaptibility was \\"he\\", Analytical was \\"she\\", Arranger was \\"he\\", Belief was \\"her\\", Command was \\"he\\", Focus was \\"he\\", and so on..

B00003CXWV|5.0|\\"Blow\\" is basically a glorification of the drug trade. Principles are shown in a glamorous light throughout most of the movie. They get all the girls and are awash in money. Even after they are arrested and confined to prison their only real crime portrayed is the loss of family life and strained relations with parents. In prison George Jung is portrayed as a counter culture icon, a wronged, flawed hero. The negative effects of the drugs upon the society as a whole are never broached. The killings, the crime, the destroyed lives, the waste are not examined. It is truly a movie about our times. A valuable movie to watch to see what has happened to our moral compass. It is another Hollywood view of the state of the union.
B001ILHY2C|3.0|The movie is certainly entertaining but it doesn't have the political overtones of the original
0061205699|5.0|To KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was one of my favorite books to teach when I taught high school English.  Its strong characters, gripping dialogue, and powerful messages mesmerize its readers. I used to think it was a book that every student should be required to read before he or she graduates from high school. I have since changed my thinking; instead, I now strongly feel that every human being needs to read it before he or she dies. Read this book; better yet, read it with someone and talk about it as you immerse yourself deeper and deeper.  When you finish, you will be a stronger person and the lessons you learn will benefit you and those around you. Trust me, put this on your \\"Must Read Before I Die\\" list.
1563894696|2.0|\\"The Long Halloween\\" is way too long and marred by a detective plot, that just doesn't add up in the end. On the positive side it has great, moody art-work and some very decent character descriptions of central figures in the Batman-cast, however it is not a satisfying read.     Jeph Loeb is obviosly in love with his idea of a killer using the holidays to mark his murders, but he hasn't got the ideas to keep the plot fresh for long. Therefore he turns to throwing the classic super-villains from Arkham at Batman. This only provides utterly unnecessary action-scenes and distracts from the main plot o hunting down the holiday killer and Harvey Dent's attempt to convict \\"The Roman\\". If Jeph Loeb had written a stunningly surprise finale to the very thin plot he might have pulled of a decent comic, but instead we are left with a showdown in an office (how epic is that...) between Batman, Catwoman and super-villains galore. And... tadaaaa... three different characters claiming to be the holiday killer. It doesn't add up. And what's with the appearences of Catwoman. A mystery throughout the book and a mystery at the end. Very sloppy script. Avoid this one unless artwork is all you care about. The art is great.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|Seven Lives Many Faces by Enigma is an excellent CD/album.  I have been a long time fan of Enigma even with all of the surrounding controversies, I still very much listen to their music. Seven Lives is one of Cretu's best since Enigma 2. The music is sophisticated, unique, sometimes a floaty escape. I did not care very much of Cretu's last work as it was too disco. With Seven Lives he goes back to his roots of creating subtle textured music with a beat.  I didn't see anything that was extremely controversial or dark with this CD although the six pointed star on the cover may spur something but as far as the music is concerned it was done masterfully.    The tunes that I really like was Touchiness an enticing sexy song, The Same Parents a moralizing melody, Fata Morgana an excellent instrumental, and Hells Heaven also.  Nice work Cretu and the Enigma crew.
0312944098|5.0|This was an exceptionally well-written book that I could not put down.  Archer weaves a wonderfully intellectually stimulating read.  This book ranks with First Among Equals and A Matter of Honor.  This was an outstanding book.  Outstanding.  I have already pre-ordered his next book due in March.
0312427999|1.0|Like Malcolm Gladwell, Naomi Klein is expert in taking well-established, complex ideas and reducing and re-packaging them as if they were her own. Brilliant marketing, but not deep thinking. Still, a decent introduction to the concept, but if you want to know more, just google \\"creative destruction\\" or look up Friedrich Nietzsche, Mikhail Bakunin, or Joseph Schumpeter. Also Werner Sombart's War and Capitalism: \\"again out of destruction a new spirit of creativity arises\\".
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I've watched Dr. Horrible on line, Hulu, bought it from iTunes and watched it more times that I can count. I watched my DVD for the first time yesterday, and it was as magical as it was back in July when it premiered. Hell I watched the entire DVD and extras twice yesterday. Commentary the Musical if it's possible is even funnier than Dr. Horrible. There need to be more adventures Joss.... Don't let us down.
B001IZZEEI|5.0|Though I asked for this version of the movie (I waited to buy it because I thought there might be another version out), I hadn't expected anyone to buy it for me.<br /><br />But my SO came through!<br /><br />It's fabulous because of the packaging, the design elements, and extras. The CD of \\"Songs of Romance\\" is a better grouping of music than the CDs you can purchase separately, IMO. Every song has me moving and playing back my favorite parts of the movie in my head.<br /><br />With all of the special features, there's plenty of entertainment to bring new meaning to parts of the movie. Depth.<br /><br />I like having the portability of movies on my laptop and that's another great extra. There's a coupon you can redeem a free digital copy from iTunes. Sweet.<br /><br />The \\"Ever Thine Ever Mine Ever Ours\\" photo album is a fabulous edition to this version. It is as if it is your copy of the couple's wedding album.<br /><br />The \\"program\\" for the packaging is just like a program you might have received at Carrie and Big's extreme version of their wedding.<br /><br />If you have this edition, I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. If you don't have it, order it before they are all gone!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Hey, I liked it. I can say all the negative stuff but it was good to see the man in the hat back up on the big screen again. I've watched this movie 3-5 five times since i got the dvd and i thoroughly enjoy it. It's got aspects of all the movies wrapped up in one. Heck, it even mentions an event from the Young Indiana Jone's TV show. It also brings more depth into the character of Indiana Jones and the whole meaning of his life.   I can say, though, that he only uses his whip three times (twice is in the very beginning, and once at the end to toss to mac)which is the least he ever used it in any of the other ones. Some more whip swinging and snapping and booby traps would have added more to the feature. But I still enjoyed it nonetheless.
031606792X|1.0|I am one of those people that really enjoyed the first three books. Although Twilight is the best, the other two were entertaining.  This book is a DISASTER on all levels!!!  These characters are completely unrecognizable!    What a horrible, horrible ending to good story.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|We need more movies like this!  My husband and I took my younger cousins to see this movie, because we just couldn't pass up sharing the wonderful story and the many lessons that came with it.  It seems everything made for kids today is centered around brainwashing them to consume more, to encourage them to throw away anything that is out of date or no longer \\"in\\", and does nothing to encourage them to pursue helping their fellow man.  This movie addressed so many problems today from our cradle to grave economy, the fact that we WILL live in the trash and filth we create, and \\"things\\" don't create happiness or make you feel alive.  Wall-E made my heart melt.  I am thankful to the people who created this amazing movie, and stood up to the BNL's of today by making such a strong & deliberate statement with Wall-E.  Keep up the great work!
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a man who has groomed his role as the neighbourhood curmudgeon into fine art. He is still sort of fighting the Korean War; he dislikes and distrusts anybody whose ethnicity is not red-blooded White American; and he isn't afraid to air out his opinions. He isn't fond of his relatives, either; his kids want to put him in a  retirement community, his granddaughter wants his stuff, and nobody wants to leave him alone, including the babyfaced young priest of the church his wife belonged to, and who she recruited to look after Walt after she passed away.<br /><br />Walt wants to be allowed to live quietly with his old Lab, sitting on the porch and enjoying breakfasts of jerky and beer. His composure, such as it is, is disturbed by the arrival next door of new tenants - an Asian family with two teenagers, one of whom is a boy with no direction and an older teen daughter who makes it her life's goal to civilize Walt. Her efforts are stymied by one of her relatives, a gang member intent on bringing her brother into the gang and who won't take no for an answer. During one of his attempts to cow the brother, Thao (Bee Vang),he butts heads with Walt, who takes exception to anybody having loud altercations on his lawn, and who brings his rifle with him to get rid of them. The gang member cousin's way of getting back at Walt is to make Thao's initiation into the gang the theft of Walt's most prized possession - his 70s-era Gran Torino.<br /><br />Things go a trifle wrong, and Thao escapes from Walt's middle-of-the-night pursuit after bungling the theft. The movie intensifies from this point; the girl, Sue (Ahney Her), decides that what Thao needs is a dose of Walt, teaching him to be a man. There are continuing confrontations with the bad elements of the neighbourhood - as in many old settled communities, as the older people die or leave, ethnic groups have come in, and they don't always get along - and Walt, feeling a bit embattled, rules over his home as though it were a fortress, keeping an eye on everybody. He grudgingly comes to terms with his new Asian neighbours, who have elevated him to protector for fearlessly standing up to the bad guys, and just as grudgingly takes Thao under his wing when the boy's family makes him go to work for Walt to pay off his debt for trying to take the car.<br /><br />If you are sensitive to racial slurs, don't bother with this movie; I heard more derogatory ethnic terms in 2 hours than I think I have ever heard before. Walt is not shy to call people what he thinks to their faces; the Italian barber he has gone to for years is used to it, and gives back as good as he gets, but the polite Asian family next door doesn't know what to make of their crude neighbour; the young priest takes the crusty old badger in stride, and never lets up on trying to bring him into his confidence. I was mildly disturbed by Walt's continuous verbal racial slurs, but I grew up with guys like him, so I tried to see beyond them and view them in the context of the story. What I got from it was all the older components of the movie - Walt, his old dog, the old grandmother next door, the Gran Torino - all survivors of a simpler age, old warhorses learning how to coexist with a new world.<br /><br />And hey, it's Clint Eastwood. How can it be bad? The movie was directed by him - and while a few of the conversations seemed a bit of a stretch, the acting was great, and Mr Eastwood is always worth watching.h it were a fortress, keeping an eye on everybody.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|What I particularly like about this show is how Walt's applied knowledge of chemistry gives him the upper hand in several confrontations, and how he is also able to teach his former student the real ramifcations of all the chemistry curriculum he never bothered to learn in Walt's class.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|If there was ever a movie that could singlehandedly demonstrate the incredible qualities of Blu-ray technology it is The Dark Knight. Played on my [[ASIN:B000WEI0S8 V VIZIO GV42LF - 42\\" Gallevia LCD TV - widescreen - 1080p (FullHD) - HDTV]] a rather standard 1080p HD LCD, the display is terrific. However played on a 120Hz set like my [[ASIN:B0018C7FSO Mitsubishi LT-46149 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Integrated Sound Projector]] and there is none of the \\"flicker\\" associated with film. It is like you are standing directly behind the cameraman on every shot.    This is an eerie sensation in a film noir-ish fantasy like The Dark Night because it is grounded in a gritty reality while at the same time exploits state of the art special effects. The viewer becomes part of these worlds in a manner that even a first run theatre viewing cannot deliver.    As to the film itself, it goes without saying that it is the best of the superhero genre flicks. Much has been made about Heath Ledger, and much should be made. There is a tendency to lionize dead actors in their postmortem releases, but Ledger's twisted humanity is a real tour de' force. christian Bale and Aaron Eckhart are quite good, but it is Ledger who steals the show, while looking like a cross between Beetle Juice and Bozo the Clown. Now that is hard to do.    Buy it; buy it in Blu-ray; and get a 120Hz set to see it like a camera operator.
B001D08SK0|3.0|Kind Of Blue is musically timeless. The concept of this package is terrific. Adding the studio outtakes was a nice touch. This record has been re-issued more times than one can imagine, so adding those extra tracks was long overdue. But the real reason for my comments is the disappointing quality of the vinyl LP. I just wish Sony/CBS had some quality control in terms of the blue vinyl LP. My first copy had bubbles which created bad pops and surface noise. I just received my replacement copy today and it is worse. More bubbles, pops and this one is warped. I hope can get another copy as easily. Maybe the third time it will be better.     A note on the packing job by Amazon...the first one came well padded in the oversize box but the second one had no padding at all, just shrink-wrapped on a bigger piece of cardboard. An invitation to a problem.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|I got a bad vibe reading all these reviews about defective discs, but took my chances as we were eager to get this movie as a Xmas present for our son. mistake! the movie skips and pixelates on our main DVD player. we got a replacement from Amazon, and again it skipped and pixelated on the *same scenes*, so it is obviously a production flaw. it did play well on a brand new Mac laptop, which I guess has a more fault-tolerant DVD reader than our TV player.    I'm in the process of returning the replacement, and then buying the single-disc version. if that is defective too, a refund it is, and no wall-E for us :(
B00011F5DK|5.0|What an incredibly fun and entertaining game for the whole family! We originally purchased this game a couple of weeks ago to use as a \\"trailer game\\" to take with us on the road while we were out camping. Well, since opening up the box, we've spent at least 1-2 hours a day playing it. Now,our 6 year old and 9 year old kids keep begging us not to take it out to the trailer's cupboards, and leave it at home for us to play as a family instead! Needless to say, the game has been a big hit! In addition, for all of you educators out there in Amazon-land, I would highly recommend Blockus for use in a classroom or in a homeschool setting to teach logic, critical thinking, spatial relations, geometric sense skills, etc. Buy the game and have some fun!

B001NY42KQ|5.0|Well all I can say is.. if you loved the 1st 2, this was a Incredible finish to the original wildcats. I have heard the OST over 50 times, I seen this on the big screen 4 times. I would have more but my car broke down. Whether I am watching it or listening to it I get emotional because I feel like I can be a wildcat. This is a way HS should be. I wish it was for when I was in HS. lol. This is the type of film all should see and love it. Wheither it's for a certain Wildcat, The musical numbers, or whatever, it's a must!
B0019FOC5E|2.0|Forgetting the fact that the CD is missing Chiquitita and I Do I Do I Do,  the takes of several songs on the CD are NOT the same used in the movie clearly the take of the song Mamma Mia sung by Meryl Streep is not the same one used in the movie, as well as Does Your Mother Know.  the song Mamma Mia almost sounds as if it were recorded live during the filming in the movie.  This is not that big of a deal, but in \\"Take a Chance on Me\\"  you can barely hear Julie Waters on the CD, in the movie she sings the song while standing on the table (she starts a capella, clearly recorded just while filming, this obviously wouldnt have been on the cd), but on the cd the background singers are singing the ENTIRE song with her, loudly, you ca only hear her if you're REALLY trying to, which is unfortunate because she sounded great at the song.      The sme thing goes for Dancing Queen, this song is sand early in the movie by Christine Baranski and Julie Waters, it is then sang again during the credits by these two, Meryl Streep and many background vocals.  ONLY the take with background vocals is on the CD, and it is still in the spot as if it were in the movie.  This is an overall disappointment to me, I think they wanted all the songs to sound more like the original abba recordings.. but that defeats the purpose of the movie soundtrack in my opinion.  You'd be better off ripping the audio off the DVD in my opinion, because this is basically an Album recorded by the cast, but is by no means a Film Soundtrack.

B000NA28I4|1.0|First and foremost, I need to mention that I've never read the book, although I hear it was much better than the movie.<br /><br />I don't know who wrote the script, but I've seen better writing in bad fanfiction pieces.  The writing is uninspiring, and at times it's downright cheesy (are we together... as one.../ into the sky, to win or die).  Some of the lines were supposed to be inspiring but they usually just made me laugh.  It's a shame, too, because I see it as a story with great potential.  From what I've heard about the book, I doubt Chris Paolini intended for it to be watered down into an 80-minute extravaganza of what might could be called special effects.<br /><br />Eragon himself seems to be just a spoiled teenager who never uses his head.  I think the actor who played him could have done a good job if he had more to work with.<br /><br />I saw two somewhat redeeming points to the movie: Saphira the dragon was very good.  And Brom, played by Jeremy Irons, added a refreshing bit of good acting to this movie.<br /><br />I think if Eragon had relied more on good writing and acting and less on special effects and gimmicks, it could have been an excellent movie, but as it is, the movie might even be worse than Dragonheart.  I need to read the books now and hope that they're better than the movie.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I'm a big WW2 fan, but you do not be another one to consider this DVD's as great.<br /><br />PROS: To write all the pros this series has i think you won't finish reading. So, i'll try to set what i consider the mainly. (1) This series shows an objective angle of WW2 (including the German, British, Russian, Japanese and US). (2) It has a balance between interviews and not interviews scenes. (3) Gives importance to the most relevance matters that days. (4) The coverage is amazing. (5) It keeps far away a Hollywood's movie making.<br /><br />CONS: The World at War would be perfect if it had subtitles. &iquest;why it does not? I wonder the same.
B000W74EQC|5.0|I have to admit that years ago, when the Harry Potter series was first getting its start, I was hesitant as a Christian to get into something that focused so much on witchcraft and wizardry.  In the years following, I have learned to be more openminded about such things.  Last month, I finally decided to watch the Harry Potter movies.<br /><br />I was immediately captivated by the movie, and its subsequent sequels.  In the month that I have owned the first five movies, I have already watched them all three times.<br /><br />Yes, the focus of the story is on Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  I caution Christian audiences not to immediately dismiss this movie just because of that.  Some of you may remember the old Disney movie, \\"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\\".  This series is no more harmful than that.<br /><br />The entire movie has a wonderful sense of whimsy to it, created by such things as chocolate frogs, banks run by goblins, candles floating near the ceiling, and the great broomstick-based soccer/polo-like sport known as Quidditch.<br /><br />The cinematography was beautiful.  The Hogwarts sequences had such a warm, colorful, enchanting feel to them.  It made me want to enroll at Hogwarts.<br /><br />The cast of characters is perfect, including such well-known stars as Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, and John Cleese.  And the acting by everyone was absolutely superb.<br /><br />The musical score by John Williams is very different from the composer's normal sound, but is still a masterful score.<br /><br />I say again - watch this movie with an open mind, and you will be amazed and spellbound by this great landmark in fantasy.

0553284347|5.0|Sometimes the better part of the cure is diagnosis:  there is a lot of healing in finding out the simple truth that it wasn't your fault--that they--whoever they may be--were truly dysfunctional and abusive.  How do you find that out when the abusive dysfunctionality is all you've ever known?<br /><br />That's where I found this book helpful.  It helped me clarify the patterns of behavior in my own family and gave me cause to re-evaluate my relationship with them, and how I viewed my own childhood.<br /><br />I would recommend reading this book in conjunction with live therapy though, since a book can not gauge where you are with your family.  It can, however, give you courage to tackle the process of healing and allow you to evaluate where you are at in your recovery from abuse.<br /><br />Although I underlined about half the passages in this book, I did disagree with the author on one point, though... forgiveness is essential to moving on.  I believe this topic was best covered in Jerry Sittser's A Grace Disguised, about how he had to forgive the drunk driver who killed his wife, mother and four year old daughter and how he continues to have to forgive and goes on to clarify the damaging effects of an unforgiving heart.<br /><br />I do sympathize with those reviewers who used this book and believe it did harm to their psyche.  But in my own experience (and I had a doozy of a childhood, trust you me) I do not believe that Dr. Forward's book is harmful in any way if used as a tool of recovery and not the source of recovery itself.  Remember, a book can't see you cry during a particular part of retelling your story, but a therapist can.  Remember that their ability to gauge your reactions is invaluable part of the process when it comes to addressing painful issues in your past.<br /><br />So get this book for validation, not as a substitute for guidance.  It won't be the cure, but in its clarification of painful parenting practices, it's certainly a wonderful salve.
B000002U82|5.0|Such an amazing record, outstanding, terrific, the nearest to the total perfection!!! This record is undoubtedly a master piece.<br />And i'm not taking about the classic master pieces we can find in music, such as: \\"yoshimi battles the pink robots\\" or \\"ok computer\\". The Dark Side of the Moon reaches a higher level. A level i do not think any other rock band has ever reach or even will.<br />If you haven`t listened yet i strongly recommend to do it.<br />The Dark Side of the Moon is an immortal record.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" was a breath of fresh air into the rather beleagured Batman Series with some dissappointing versions since the first one with Michael Keaton. In \\"Begins\\" the series was effectively reset bringing new life and depth to the character and the series and the \\"Dark Knight\\" surpasses them all.    There is so much to the movie that it would be difficult to discuss it all - but overall it is extremely well written, directed and filmed.  For example, many of the comic movies (or action movies for that mmatter) have a tedency to draw out the action scenes or CGIs just a bit too much.  In this movie each of these scenes were timed just right so that they were part of the movie without being overblown.  Without giving away any of the plot, suffice it to say that the sequence involving a bank towards the beginning of the movie was perfect.  From the shot, from behind, of someone standing in the street to the point where the word \\"bus\\" is mentioned.  Perfect.  I went back and watched this a few times.      The cast is solid, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are such great actors in their own right and they are able to bring so much  depth and emotion to \\"comic book\\" charactors (which of course is a fnction of also having a good script.)  Watch some of the scenes - Caine with a note in his care, Freeman, including a scene I will not mention due to possible spolier or any time Oldman performed.    Christian Bale does a good job and is not as bad as some people want to make him out (though sometimes the Batman voice is just a bit much), but he was more ancillary (to some degree) as those around him and ultimately the movie spotlight really is Heath Ledger.  When he passed away the buzz was that he was unreal in this movie and that he probably would get an Academy Award nod for the performance.  The buzz was an understatement.  His performance was understated and over the top at the same time.  Each body movement, facial twitch and movement, breath through the teeth was amazing.  After the first two times he appeared it almost became a situation where I just wanted to see him back on the screen and ignore the rest.  He was simply that good.    There are a couple of nitpicks,  Maggie Gyllenhal and the character she potrayed, was okay, but for some reason those scenes did not quite measure up to the rest.  And there was one other scene that did not work for me as well as the others.  Both of these nitpicks are very minor and due in part to the fact that so much of the movie was done on such a high level that the bar was raised so high  - so that one or two scenes that ultimately do not detract from the movie as a whole is not a problem.

B00004WG2F|4.0|`Legends of the Fall' is an easy movie to love.  It stars one of the most charming men working in film today.  It also stars a man regarded as one of the greatest actors of his generation.  It is beautifully shot and very well acted; filled to the brim with sentiment and grace and an ending so emotionally gut-wrenching you'll be unable to hold back the tears.<br /><br />It's not perfect, but it's still very, very good.<br /><br />The story tells of three brothers, Tristan, Alfred and Samuel as they grow up in the wilderness with their father during the 1900's.  Their lives are affected by war, love and tradition and as the film progresses we see them build and the tear down relationships with others and with each other.  Tristan is the wild one, the one most influenced by the ways of the Native American, especially One Stab, the faithful friend of the family.  Alfred is the more mature brother, at least from a societal standpoint.  He is heavily affected by his father's love and adoration of Tristan over all else, especially since he feels as though he has earned the spot of favorite.  Samuel is the youngest and greenest of the three.  The film takes little time to really get to know him since the focal point of the film is Tristan.<br /><br />The film starts very strong, developing a nicely crafted character study of this family and the interwoven layers that make up their lives.  The first half of the film will just suck you right in.  The second half falters a bit as it ditches the depth it originally instituted and comes off more like a soap opera, with brothers bickering uselessly over the love of a woman.  This was a disappointment for me because I expected something a little more poignant, especially when considering the films beautiful start.  It's not a fault that will deter you though; my wife still loves this movie, and I still like it very much.<br /><br />The films biggest selling point is the acting, which is for the most part perfect.  Aidan Quinn is stellar as the jilted Alfred, wearing his frustrations on his sleeve without overwhelming us with clich&eacute;d emotions.  Julia Ormond is divine as Susannah, the woman who tears the family apart.  Her controlled and meaningful delivery makes her characters arc all the more devastating.  Anthony Hopkins is also fantastic here and the boy's father William.  He is one of those actors who cannot do everything, but what he can do he does flawlessly.  This is a flawless performance (and that whole `I am happy' scene just gets me every time).  Henry Thomas is a bit boring, but the film is not very interested with him.<br /><br />Brad Pitt gives what may be his finest performance to date here, seriously.  He totally gets Tristan and delivers a solid portrayal of a man's honest emotions; guilt, pain, love, remorse, betrayal, anger, responsibility.  I was blown away with each passing frame as he built more and more on the man he initially created.  It's such a tremendous performance; truly Oscar Worthy.<br /><br />So, in the end I highly recommend this film.  I give it a solid B, and I'd throw nominations the way of Pitt and Hopkins and maybe even Ormond and Zwick.  There is a lot to love here, and the end result is nothing short of memorable and entertaining.  It loosens the reigns towards the end, but it's a small grievance when you consider all that there is to enjoy.wearing his frustrations on his sleeve without overwhelming us with clichéd emotions.

1594201927|1.0|There are many, many excellent books addressing the current economic crisis, the utter failure of deregulation, the outrageous excesses, looting and crimes of Wall Street, the destruction of the middle class, the horrid debt burden left for our children, the fantastic increase in disparity between the haves and have-nots--in short, the destruction of the American way of life as we have known it.    Don't get your history and analysis from a right-wing apologist for Wall Street and the ultra-wealthy, who likes to blame the poor and middle class victims for the horrid, downhill course of the last 30 years.    Save your money and shop around--there are much, much better analyses than this revisionist history and propaganda piece.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|The controversy sparked by my recent raving of a certain Batman movie has caused me to dig up this atrocity and give it another watch.  I had to borrow it from my Spider-Man obsessed brother-in-law for I do not own this movie (nor will I ever).  I think it's important, before I get into discussing why I loathe this movie as I do, to set you up with my feelings going in, so you won't label this a review by a disgruntled Spider-Man hater who expected to rip it apart walking in.  I am not `Team Batman' or something like that; for it is not that simple.  I am simple `Team Good Movie' and this just doesn't fall into that bracket for me.<br /><br />Oh, and MKIA, this is all for you ;-)<br /><br />So, to set things straight; and am a total Spider-Man fan.  Growing up he was my favorite superhero ever and I collected the comics and had all the trading cards and played with the action figures and so when the original `Spider-Man' movie was released I went insane with excitement.  While I felt it was a bit long in areas I totally loved the movie and saw it three times in the theater.  When `Spider-Man 2' was released I bought my tickets almost a week in advance and showed up at the theater an hour early and was blown away by how amazing the movie was.  It was smart and intense and brilliantly directed and acted.  It was the perfect superhero movie, and I still consider it one of the best superhero movies of all time; maybe even the best.  Last year there were a slew of trilogies ending, all of which I was excited over.  `Pirates of the Caribbean' was ending and `Shrek the Third' was being released and of course there was `Spider-Man 3' and of the three this was the one I was most excited over.<br /><br />It was going to be amazing.<br /><br />Since seeing this film I have come to affectionately refer to it as `Spider-Mess 3'.  Okay, so maybe not so affectionately, but whatever.  I will state this before getting into the film also.  I understand that Spider-Man is not a dark character, so don't for one second even begin to conclude that I don't `understand' this hero; I know him very well.  I also know that Venom is one of the darkest characters in the Marvel universe and that the whole symbiote storyline was Spider-Man's darkest hour.  Just know that I know that and you should too before watching this film.<br /><br />My main issue with `Spider-Mess 3' is that it is, well, messy.  There is so much going on that Sam Raimi fails to get a firm grasp on what he is trying to portray.  There are a slew of villains who all have their own agendas but their agendas are all thrown into one pot to stew; and on top of that you have Peter Parker's personal life, which is in shambles, and his relationships with not only Mary Jane and newcomer Gwen Stacy but also his best friend who now wants to kill him because he knows that he is Spider-Man and blames him for his fathers death.  The movie is barely over two-hours which seems like a lot of time, but it isn't if you want to do this story any real justice.  Instead, the film seems rather rushed and thrown together, especially in the ridiculous ending which made me so aggravated I wanted to get up and leave the movie altogether.<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, Spider-Man is not a dark character and that is what made the first two movies so delightfully entertaining.  Raimi understood how to take the stylized world of Spider-Man and make it deep and meaningful without making it dark and brooding.  I know that this is not Batman, who has always been a darker character (unless you include the mockeries that have been made of him in the past; i.e. `BAM' and `POW' and Joel Schumacher).  The problem is that Raimi, in this installment, made a mockery of `Spider-Man', ridiculously overplaying the `fun' aspect of the film and sacrificing the intelligence.  There is no balance here.  Stripping the character of all dignity he made the evil of the symbiote play more like a arrogant frat-boy than anything else,making it a joke.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I read this book on my Kindle (Merry Christmas to me) and I absolutely loved it.  The format of the letters was much better than just a book of fiction would have been.  The characters were reality driven, you can just imagine any of them in real life.  I loved the historical aspects to the story as well and the ties to WWII, all of the details in this book I had no idea about.  Just a wonderful, easy read.

B001D94L1Q|4.0|On the face of it, this massive boxed set containing Olivier Messiaen's entire oeuvre (including some works which were never published) might appear to be pretty much the definitive edition. Many of the artists featured were closely associated with the composer in one way or another at some time during their careers.  No-one, of course, was more closely associated with him than Yvonne Loriod and it is good to see that she features in many of these recordings, and especially welcome to see included here the two-piano version of \\"Visions de l'Amen\\" played by Loriod and the composer himself, recorded in June 1962. It is a pity, though, that so little of the music for solo piano is not represented here by Loriod's recordings, but is mostly supplied by Roger Muraro, whose playing, whilst competent, never really feels to engage with the true essence of the material. His rendition of \\"Catalogue d'Oiseaux\\", for example, is not a patch on Peter Hill's exquisite (but hard to find) [[ASIN:B000EPWIIS edition]].<br /><br />The organ music suffers a similar lack-lustre treatment at the hands of Olivier Latry, although the fault here seems to be more the standard of the recording than of the performance, despite being recorded at Notre-Dame de Paris. Not that his playing is bad by any means, but both [[ASIN:B0000V86LE Jennifer Bate]] and [[ASIN:B000003W1F Gillian Weir]] manage to pack far more feeling into their performances (and are generally better recorded).<br /><br />Fortunately all of the works more than make up for any short-comings in the solo piano and organ pieces, however, with vibrant and powerful performances aplenty. The orchestral and concertante works are big, bright and beefy, just as they should be; the chamber and vocal works are impassioned and vibrant also, for all that some of the recordings are quite old (although anyone who dislikes their chamber ensembles close-miked might prefer to back the volume off a little in some places.)  Jeanne Loriod's rendition of \\"Fête des belles eaux (Celebration of the Beautiful Waters)\\" for ondes martenot sextet is a particular delight.<br /><br />The vocal works are all well performed also, with the real jewel in the crown, of course, being the complete performance of the huge opera 4-hour \\"Saint François d'Assise\\", played by the Hall&eacute; Orchestra, conducted by Kent Nagano and featuring Dawn Upshaw, Jos&eacute; van Dam and Jeanne Loriod, recorded live at Salzburg, August 1998.<br /><br />DG/Decca have done a nice job with the packaging, with each CD in a simple paper slip-sleeve, all housed in a single box, so that the whole 32-CD set takes up less than 3 inches of shelf space, including the comprehensive 378 page booklet of programme notes, photographs, and essays detailing Messiaen's musical output.<br /><br />In addition to the caveat regarding the quality of the solo piano and organ works, the only other warning I'd give the prospective purchaser of this set is to point out that despite several works being specially recorded for this edition, a small number of works are represented by recordings made in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These do have noticeable tape hiss, although not to any distracting degree and the performances are such that it is easily ignored.<br /><br />All in all, a very good release which should probably be classed as an essential purchase for anyone seriously interested in the music of Olivier Messiaen. It's a limited edition, so grab one while you can.les eaux (Celebration of the Beautiful Waters)\\" for ondes martenot sextet is a particular delight.

031606792X|2.0|The first three books of this saga have led us to believe that the love between Bella and Edward is eternal, unbreakable and fulfilling.  Well, I suppose my imagination made some enhancements in place of what should have been the writer's imagination.  Nonetheless, this was a love story or rather THE love story of a 'perfect' man (a debatable topic, but not quite appropriate here) and his so less perfect object of affection.  The saga was evolved around the sacrifice and perseverance of a true love.     So, what the hell happened to that?  All of a sudden, Bella decides to sacrifice everything, including her true love, her family (both the old and newly acquired), the other man that loved her and everything in between for a pregnancy in which she never even expressed any sort of interest before?  What happened to eternal love she pledged to Edward?  Does she no longer care that he's suicidal without her existence?  What was the point of the whole saga then?  Wouldn't she be just as happy married to Mike or Eric with a whole bunch of kids?       In other words, would there be anything, anything at all, ever, that would make Juliet give up her Romeo?  I'm sure that the author of that love story left no doubt in your mind on how to answer this question.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|This has to be one of the most unusual films ever made. From Penthouse magazine's Bob Guccione  and Director Tinto Brass, \\"Caligula\\" is basically a high production porn film... with lasvish sets and costumes, this film is somewhat shocking and even a little disturbing. With nearly two and a half hours of male and female nudity, and serveral hardcore sex scenes thrown in, this is a somewhat creepy film. This is not a bad films, it just is not a great films. \\"Caligula\\" is the kind of movie you need see at least once...<br /><br />It is kind of hard for me to understand how such great actors such as, Peter O'Toole, Sir John Gielgud and the ever so sexy and desirable Helen Mirren, along with Malcolm McDowell ever said yes to being in this film. They do however give good performances...<br /><br />A couple lessons of history: 1. Tiberius (Peter O'Toole) \\"fishes\\" were in reality little boys he called \\"his minnows\\", not the men and women in the swim scene.<br /><br />2. Caligula committed incest with three of his sisters, not just Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy).<br /><br />But, hey... it's only a movie right?
0375703764|5.0|Trust me on this when I say \\"buy it in as close to bad condition as possible.\\"  You immediately get a better feel of how the story should be read.  That should give you a warning about what to expect.    The format is daunting (the style to which Danielewski subscribes is ergodic literature) and Danielewski for the most part keeps to making your attempts to just READ the novel close to impossible.  At numerous times, the author will make the reader circle back (or move forward) any number of pages - and this is just the tip of the iceberg concerning what Danielewski does in House of Leaves.    With two stories going on at once (one on a documentary on said House of Leaves, the other covering the life of a man who decided to edit a massive manuscript based around this documentary), one can describe this novel as a reader's going through two mazes simultaneously.    However, once you (the reader) find your own Ariadne's thread for navigating this story, you will not be disappointed and may even enjoy the ride.  A love story as told by Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Sterling, Brad Anderson, David Cronenberg and Satoshi Kon to Stephen King and transcribed by Daedelus.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Update (1/11/09):  MAD MEN just won the Golden Globe for the second straight year for Best Drama.  Well deserved.<br /><br />Frankly, I'm pretty despondent about the future of quality TV on the major four networks.  The recent cancellation by ABC of the breathtakingly brilliant PUSHING DAISIES was the first major blow.  When a show this great can get cancelled for weak (not genuinely bad, merely weak) ratings, you feel that something has gone wrong with commercial television.  For one thing, TV history is resplendent with shows that started off weakly and then succeeded a couple of years into their run.  THE X-FILES, SEINFELD, THE OFFICE, and 30 ROCK all started off with weak ratings, only to build an audience later.  The second horrific piece of news undermining my confidence in commercial TV was NBC's announcement that starting next year Jay Leno will get FIVE HOURS (!) of prime time for a more politically oriented version of his talk show.  First, why would we want Leno when we already have Stewart and Colbert? Second, this means losing FIVE HOURS (!!!!) of scripted programming on NBC each week.  This is a recipe for disaster.  And an act of despair.  NBC clearly doesn't think it can produce 15 hours of quality TV a week, so it is trying to produce only 10 and then take the super cheap option with Leno.  NBC, I have news for you:  you get what you pay for.<br /><br />MAD MEN could well be the model for successful quality TV shows in the future.  Although it gets very low ratings, on AMC it is safe from cancellation because of its widespread critical acclaim.  More and more, niche cable networks seem to be the place where quality TV series manage to thrive and avoid the constant threat of cancellation.  AMC in fact has two superb series, MAD MEN and the very promising BREAKING BAD (which was seriously truncated by the writers' strike last year) and they've announced a new Sci-fi series based upon Kim Stanley Robinson's acclaimed Mars trilogy, about the settling of colonies on Mars.  The series is taking its title from the first of Robinson's novels, RED MARS.<br /><br />So, while I'm on the verge of giving up on ABC, NBC, and FOX (though under new head of programming Kevin Reilly its shows have become more interesting and he has so far resisted to kill shows prematurely as his predecessors did).  CBS I gave up on years ago, since the network seems content to churn out an endless number of bland police procedurals.  AMC, F/X, Showtime, HBO, ABC Family, the Sci Fi Channel, and similar networks may be where we all go in the future for the best shows.<br /><br />MAD MEN became the first show not on one of the big four networks or HBO to win the Emmy for Best Drama this past summer.  It will almost certainly win again this coming summer, since Season Two was even better than Season One.  Moreover, during Season Two the show started building a buzz, culminating with a great appearance by Jon Hamm on SNL, including a skit with some of his MAD MEN guest stars.  The show became part of our cultural sensibility, inspiring magazine photo spreads.  I still think the show is one that people tend to know about rather than know.  Thankfully people who do not have access to AMC can catch up on DVD (I watch it as it comes out, but my cable company shows AMC in low-def rather than high-def, so much of the show's physical beauty can only be recaptured on DVD or Blu-ray).<br /><br />As good as the show was in Season Two, the sophomore season was even more brilliant.  In my review of Season One, I mentioned that Jon Hamm's character Don Draper exemplifies Thoreau's statement that most people live \\"lives of quiet desperation.\\"  In Season Two, Hamm and his carefully constructed existence gradually begins coming apart at the seams.  His Stepford Wife Betty begins to come apart at more than the seams.  I really enjoyed January Jones in Season One, but primarily she was a beautiful manikin.  In Season Two the human being inside is psychically rebelling against the roles she is being forced to play and the result is someone who is on the verge of collapse.  One scene in particular was compelling.  As she prepares for a dinner party she notices that one of the dining room chairs is wobbly.  Moving the chair back and forth gives way to anger, as she displaces the stress of her life onto the chair and she begins to destroy and obliterate it.  Indeed, the many moments where Betty loses control are among the season's finest.<br /><br />January Jones's amazing performance as Betty gets a bit less acclaim than she deserves in part because of Elizabeth Moss's job as Peggy Olson.  I think many people watching MAD MEN began in Season Two to realize that Peggy, as much as Don Draper, was central to the meaning of the show.  I have very little evidence for this, but I believe that the show will end with Peggy Olson heading Sterling Cooper.  The show started with her first day as an employee of the company, working as Don Draper's secretary.  We've seen her become a successful copywriter for the company and at the end of Season Two even has the office next to Don's.  I believe that a logical ending of the series, mapping al the changes that took place in national sensibilities in the sixties, would be for Peggy to become head of the company that at the start of the year was so completely male dominated.  This does not mean, however, that Peggy's personal life has kept pace with her professional life.  In fact, Peggy remains a bit of a mess.  The season did end, however, with perhaps the best scene in the entire run of the show so far.  Peter tells Peggy that he hates his marriage and that he loves her.  Shockingly, Peggy tells him that she had had his baby and given it away.  My feeling was that in telling Peter she was not trying to be cruel so much as she was trying to definitively close the door on one part of her life and open another.  Peggy is one of the most wonderfully complex characters on TV.  While Don Draper has artfully created a public self, Peggy has not.  She has primarily resisted the roles that people have tried to provide for her.  She has not yet become her own person, but you feel that she might.  I also find her and Don Draper's relationship to be delightful.  They are not close friends or perhaps not even friends.  But a flashback in which Don visits her in the hospital when she is suffering from post-partum depression (intensified by the fact that she didn't even know she was pregnant) and essentially orders her to get her act together and get out of the hospital.  Don is not always presented as a good person, but he has his moments, and the tough love he gives Peggy at the moment helps her turn her life around.<br /><br />I mention Don, Betty, and Peggy, but one of the delights of MAD MEN is the very deep cast of characters.  Joan Holloway (played by the beautiful Christina Hendricks) has a new fianc&eacute;, but it doesn't appear to be the healthiest of relationships (one of the most shocking moments in Season Two occurs when he rapes her in Sterling Cooper offices).  The deeply closeted Salvatore starts gradually to confront his own sexuality and his attraction to men, including a coworker, while his \\"beard\\" marriage struggles.  Roger Sterling struggles to overcome health problems in order to marry a much, much younger woman.<br /><br />But at the heart of the show Don Draper remains the dominant character.  Jon Hamm's performance as Don has been brilliant from the very beginning.  On \\"Fresh Air with Terry Gross\\" series creator Matthew Weiner explained that Hamm instantly stood out in auditions, but the network wanted an established actor in the role.  They were adamant that they did not want an unknown actor in the show's central role.  Weiner finally issued an ultimatum, that without Jon Hamm as Don Draper, he was unwilling to proceed with the series.  Weiner's wisdom in casting Hamm has been proven many times over.  It is almost impossible to imagine thisshow without him.  Don is one of the most artificial and complex characters in the history of TV.  Just as he creates ad campaigns, so he has created the persona Don Draper.  Season Two shows Draper having serious doubts about whether he wants to persist in playing the character he has created for himself.<br /><br />I read a bit over a year ago that the plan for the show was to move a couple of years into the future with each ensuing season.  If so, Season Three should pick up sometime past the Kennedy assassination, perhaps with the early part of the Vietnam War.  Clearly the show intends to reflect the enormous social upheaval that took place in the decade.  It also represents many of the now almost comic aspects of the pre-sixties world.  For instance, in one scene Don, Betty, and their kids are enjoying a picnic on a blanket in a lovely country locale.  As they finish, Don stands up and shakes all of their trash off the blanket and onto the ground.  This was very definitely before Lady Bird Johnson's attempt to beautify America by picking up trash.  I'm sure that Season Three will show many new changes.<br /><br />This is easily one of the 3 or 4 best shows on TV.  I put it up there with my own favorites PUSHING DAISIES, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and LOST.  Notice that of those shows PUSHING DAISIES was on ABC and has been cancelled, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS was on DirecTV in the fall and will be on NBC in the winter and spring, and LOST begins its penultimate season on ABC.  I think in the future fewer and fewer of my favorite shows will be originating on the big four.

B001ILHY1I|3.0|What is modern filmmakers' penchant for bleached-out sepia-tinted color that looks like moldy black and white?  It does not seduce me.  To be frank, it looks just plain ugly.  I suppose, in the case of this movie, it signifies the ugliness of the future that awaits us.<br /><br />Despite its ugly-duckling appearance, \\"Death Race\\" is a serviceable action flick starring the charismatic and appealingly imperturbable Jason Statham (of \\"The Bank Job\\" fame).  Short on plot, \\"Death Race\\" is long on action, the explosive action of racing between souped-up, armor-plated, rocket-mounted, grotesque-looking vehicles.  Statham's killing machine is an unrecognizable modified V-8 Mustang GT.<br /><br />There's one catch to these races:  they're not about winning, they're about killing the other competitors.  The more racers that are killed, the higher the ratings of the televised matches.  It's an interesting theme, but it seems to lack the necessary acerbic wit to pull it off to complete satisfaction.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Fete of Death\\"
0684865130|5.0|MASH is definetly the one word to describe this book. I can't imagine that the sitcom, MASH, wasn't inspired by this book. You can even pick out certain characters although they are sometimes blended together or split apart. Although, MASH would have been limited to Cinemax if it was an accurate copy. There are a lot of sex scenes in the book.    I don't think I have ever read any book that made me laugh out loud more than this book. Some of the humor was very silly (like MASH), but I couldn't help laughing.     Catch-22 is about pilots in war and there are some war related scenes that are gruesome, but not too often.
0132350882|3.0|Good set of rules for keeping your code up to high standards. But to be honest, most of the rules are common sense and not likely to surprise anyone who cares enough about his code to bother reading this book. Even so, the author's arguments are often not so convincing (i.e. based on anecdotal evidence and personal opinion). This is fine with rules with which you happen to agree, but don't expect this book to change your opinion in the few cases where you don't agree. Then there is also the issue that most bad code isn't bad because the programmers didn't know the proper rules, but because following the rules can be difficult. Most examples in the book are a bit simplistic, but in the second-to-last chapter the author walks us through a complete refactoring where he applies his rules to real code. This is a great idea, though the chapter ends up being a bit tedious. The last chapter contains a concise set of rules -- read this if all you have is five minutes.
B000004747|4.0|First of all, let me say that this is one of the most impressive feats of jazz music composing and performing I have ever heard. I was told by many sources that Rahsaan Roland Kirk was some kind of genius whose music simply could not be ignored. This CD, which combines two albums' worth of songs, promised to be a good introduction to Kirk and his music. I was not disappointed. Kirk's musicianship is unsurpassed. His experiments with electronic effects and unorthodox recording methods, like the screaming and white noise used in the title track, actually sound like they belong and there is no resistance to their effect. In fact, it makes the music vaguely more satisfying. Very few people have succeeded in mixing such effects into jazz so that it improves the music, though many have tried and failed. Kirk's ability to play several instruments, occasionally at the same time, also gives him a leg up on the competition. Just the same, when Kirk feels like playing straight up jazz, he does it with the best. His versions of Black Diamond and Alfie are just sensational. I tried to envision the music the way Kirk did, but I couldn't get my head around his ideas. I mean, when does the sound of a glass breaking fit into a musical piece? Kirk knows, the listener doesn't, and when the listener hears it, he or she will know it sounded good but won't be able to understand why. When I started to think about it, that's when I felt my head was going to pop, so I just sat back and listened. My fear that this recording was going to drive me back down into the hell of avant-garde, free jazz crap, did not come to pass. This is highly listenable, highly enjoyable, and a constant source of surprise and amazement. I'm looking forward to adding more of Kirk's works to my music collection soon.

The DVDs simply slide into the cardboard slots and they are not secure, so they slide around enough that they get a little scratched in shipping. The thickness of the DVDs warps the shape of the cardboard case because the case was not made big enough for them. I'd expect this kind of packaging for a free AOL disk, not three DVDs.  One of the copies was missing the code insert for the digital copy.    None of them worked correctly in any of my DVD players, my family's DVD players, or my PS2.  They all skipped at the same spots.  I'm sure this is a copy protection \\"feature\\" meant to make it difficult to copy.  The problem here being that I bought three copies, so I'm not a pirate.  Why do I have to be subjected to this punishment?      So I tried the DRM-encrusted digital copy.  Playing the digital copy requires you to register it online.  I tried the two codes that came with the three copies and for both, iTunes said that the code was invalid.      Do not buy this disk set unless you plan on buying a new DVD player along with it.  Do not buy this version if you plan on using the digital copy in iTunes.  Do not buy this.  Thanks for ruining my Christmas gifts Pixar/Disney!
B001H5X7I4|4.0|I went and saw this one night with my mother (who's in her 60's).  All I knew of the movie came from commercials on TV.  When we purchased the tickets for it the woman behind the counter gave us a funny look, then told us that if we don't like it we can come back up and get our money back within 10 minutes after it started.  That seemed a very odd thing to say.  I sure had never heard anyone say something like that before, and wondered what she knew that we did't.  Me and my mom exchanged a look and as we entered I asked, \\"What the heck have we got ourselves into here?\\".    The very first scene of the movie starts up and it was very raunchy to say the least.  We again exchanged an uncomfortable glace.  Then, we proceded to laugh so hard our stomachs hurt.  It was raw, it was foul, and it was funny as hell.  Although I admit I could have done with a few less \\"F\\" bombs, it was still a great movie.    I can kind of understand the ticket girls statement.  I'm sure she thought going to see such a movie with one's mother would be ackward. But, she doesn't know my mother, the woman who after watching Jackass was still laughing more than an hour later.    I don't have much to say about the movie itself, just thought it was an amusing story.  Although it does get a bit slow in the middle and I really could have done without that kid.  He seems a bit out of place.  You'd have to see the movie for yourself to understand.
B001GJOL22|5.0|Finally Blu-Ray. As stated here several times, this is the best RUSH show ever recorded on DVD. Now lets wait and see if Dream Theater follows and releases a Blu-Ray concert with anchored cameras that move smooth across the stage so we won't get dizzy while watching. RUSH have been setting the production trends when it comes to this genre of music so I can't wait to see Dream Theater learning something here. I could live without the fast zoom-in and zoom-outs though. It's borderline amateur.
0756404746|1.0|I read the reviews, saw that a debut fantasy novel had broken into the mass-market paperback bestseller list, and, obviously, I bought the book.    I nearly finished it.    John D. MacDonald, in his introduction to Stephen King's \\"Night Shift\\", speaks about author intrusion. He defines it like this: \\"Author intrusion is a phrase so inept the reader suddenly realizes he is reading, and he backs out of the story. He is shocked back out of the story.\\"    I've seen many forms of author intrusion over the years, when good writing goes bad. Never have I been so shocked out of a book by an actual bit of the story as I was with \\"The Name of the Wind\\".    SPOILERS AHEAD!                    Before I begin, I should point out that the \\"dragons\\" in this particular tale are herbivores. Initially, I gave a bit of credit to the author for at least flouting that particular fantasy convention when he'd failed to defeat so many others. How he used it is another matter entirely and what prompted me to stop reading. Now that I've got that out of the way, our herbivore dragon eats trees that are used to make a euphoria inducing drug. To put it another way, if the sap from maple trees, instead of being boiled down into syrup and candy could instead be boiled down to make cocaine or some other heavyweight drug, this would be what the dragon ate. Then, seeing the dragon stoned out of his mind, our hero decides to feed the dragon enough of the boiled down substance (as he found a sack of it) to cause the dragon a lethal overdose. It doesn't work, at least not immediately, and the dragon begins swaying toward a small town.    That's when I quit reading.    If you, Mr. Rothfuss, want to take this seriously, we can do business.    I need a hero who's human. Not in a literal sense, you can use aliens, but someone who doesn't have a talent in every area. The scholar/musician/magician/swordsman you've created here just doesn't jive.    I don't care about how poor our hero is in terms of actual numbers. Knowing that someone is poor and may not be able to afford what he desperately wants is enough. Pages and pages of poor defenseless trees are wasted over telling us, exactly, how poor Kvothe is at any given time. I'm not his accountant or a tax collector and therefore this information is wasted on me.    Despite my disdain for certain aspects of this book, I must acknowledge that the author does show some promise. Don't buy this book, and you should therefore probably avoid the rest of the trilogy (if only to avoid feeling the need to read this particular book to see where it all started) but, I think, we should keep an eye out for whatever is done after this trilogy.

0307455874|5.0|In light of all of the terrible things that have happened over the past   eight years under the Bush Administration, it is about time that positive change come to fruition finally in this country.  The Audacity of Hope is well-written, with a wry sense of humor  despite the obstacles imposed early on his life as a child of a single mother. I used to be a Republican many years ago and I can tell you  that politically this is the type of book that inspires a generation or two or three of voters and sways the Right to find common ground with the Left (or I should say those that are slightly left of Center).  Barack Obama is a wonderful politician though I don't want to call him a politician as he is far more of a statesman and a social reform advocate.  I suppose that I cannot find the right words to tell you how great this book really is.  You must experience it for yourself and share it with your friends.  Reading this book will make you especially proud of your country knowing that our democracy finally rang true this election and that the majority of the American electorate is somehow bound by a shared sense of Hope. Remember Hope and positive Change in our legislation are the only ways we will truly prosper as Americans and as members of the global community in the upcoming years.  The Audacity of Hope is a great book covering Barack Obama's political ideology, philosophy, plans for this country and its communties.  If you do choose to read this incredible book,  you will have a greater sense of the man who rose so quickly into power. As a Democrat and an ex-Republican, I realize that there are so many Republicans still churning questions about Obama.  If you find yourself in this position, then I will tell you that this is the book for you to add to your reading list.  I felt especially patriotic after reading this book,   knowing that there is a politician out there who is genuinely speaking out on the behalf of so many Americans and citizens of the world.

0385340567|2.0|Many here are knocking this book for Reacher's political views. Regardless of your politics, the book still does not measure up to previous work in the series. If you take out the political discussions, it is a weak story, with cardboard characters and improbable plot twists. Reacher seems to spend half of the book driving around aimlessly and cluelessly. Say what you want about previous books in the series, they were never boring. This one is boring. It reads like Child had to deliver a new book by a certain date, so he sat down and cranked out a couple hundred pages without much thought or care about the content. Or the reader.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|What many considered \\"the artistic crime of the century,\\" French high-wire walker Philippe Petit did what today would be impossible (because they don't exist and because of security) by performing a tightrope walk between New York City's World Trade Center twin towers ...in 1974.<br /><br />The feat itself isn't as interesting as the preparation and the history behind Philippe's successful walk. Having scaled between the arches at Notre Dame and the Harbor Bridge pillars in Sydney, Australia, Philippe's goal from early on was to walk on a wire much, much higher. At just over 1,350 above street level, the twin towers were his goal.<br /><br />Friends and even workers within New York's buildings aided Philippe in surprising ways. Many backed out when they realized how close he was to actually doing it, worried that if he fell to his death they would be partially responsible.<br /><br />But nothing was going to hold Philippe back. Security guards, wind, fog and fearful friends all plagued his attempt ...to no avail.<br /><br />As stated earlier, the preparation was fascinating, showing the documentary watcher the tensile strength needed to span the buildings, the bypassing of security guards, and the near failure of the entire episode because of a severe sagging of the wire during its initial deployment. The tense nature of how the story unfolded was pretty phenomenal. Looking up from the ground at Philippe as he walked the wire was simply awe-inspiring; he looked like a speck against the higher clouds.<br /><br />Arrested after his successful walk, the words \\"Man on wire\\" appeared on the violation written up  by the New York P.D., which is where the film gained its title. But the film is much more than a simple man doing a tightrope walk. It's a historical recounting of one man's goal to achieve what seemed unachievable.<br /><br />It is strange to see a man doing something artistically dangerous -- and illegal -- on things that no longer exists. Perhaps that added to my enjoyment of the documentary. After watching the horribleness of 9/11 time and time again, it was unique and refreshing to see something being done to the towers of a quaint and beautiful nature. Something that many Americans probably have trouble attributing to the twin towers now. Which is why you should watch this.<br /><br />Thank you, Philippe.hing the horribleness of 9/11 time and time again, it was unique and refreshing to see something being done to the towers of a quaint and beautiful nature.

B001C46P2A|5.0|This film is long, slightly too long maybe, but the intention is clear : to give the feeling of time an Aborigine may have since he is in direct connection with the cosmos. And the whole film is about that cosmic call. You have to let yourself be led into that contemplative story telling in these slower moments. But the film is a lot more interesting on several other issues that concern the West directly. First our world wars and their absurdity, in fact the absurdity of all wars. The beginning of the second world war in Australia is shown as having no reason, no motivation, no sense of organization or humanity. Even in the evacuation of Darwin the Aborigines are not taken into account. They do not exist in a way, and what's more the mixed blood, particularly the young mixed blood who are taken away from the world into some kind of Christian mission to be assimilated, though that is impossible in a segregative system, are literally locked up on an island on the direct way of the Japanese, abandoned in the hand of God that can do little in front of Japanese bombers. It is obvious that this is a reflection of the wars we are waging and wasting and losing in the world, waging for sure, wasting because there are more economical ways to reach some political objectives than a war, losing because a war is always lost by those who start them, in the short run or in the long run. I have even the tendency to believe that winning a war is a defeat in a way because it glues to your skin that you are what you are only because you used violence to achieve it. Today the use of violence is becoming if it has not yet become, an unacceptable course of action. Bush did not understand that. We can see today where we are. And we have to get out of these quagmires, Afghanistan being the second. Then maybe we will be able to run after Osama Ben Laden who is not an Iraqi, not an Afghani, nor anything really, except somewhere a Saudi, and finitely a criminal terrorist. That film could not be more powerful on this subject. The second subject is of course the racism of the Australian policy concerning the Aborigines and the mixed blood. It shows how this segregation, this racism, this assimilation policy, and all that goes along with this official policy that considered some human beings as inferior to the whites, is absurd because it takes a white to assassinate the other white who is on his way to stealing what is not his, and it takes an Aborigine to be the screen that will save twenty or twenty-five children. The point is this film shows both the absurdity of the Australian policy and the potential of these Aborigines and mixed blood when they were given free rein on their courage and initiative. At the same time it shows how even white people can change. This leads to another question n that is fundamental: who or what makes history? There is no answer here except that history is made in a way or another and there seems to be the belief that with some time distance history is getting better all the time, even if at times it goes back slightly due to the vanity of those who believe they can make history, like here the Japanese, the monopolistic capitalists, and a few others. One thing is sure in this film though: God does not make history. It takes three men and a boat to save the children who were in the hand of God and could have been killed by the Japanese. There is maybe one more thing behind this film: the world will not change if we do not integrate in our thinking the equal existence of those who are different from us, no matter how little or how much. And there the final scene is essential: accept that child to be what he is called to be, an Aborigine, because his initiation trip to the country of his ancestors is going to give him the identity he needs just to be one human person.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinese more powerful on this subject.

6303234844|5.0|I wasn't even a fan of PG's work before seeing this concert video. After seeing it, I think Gabriel is the finest artist still breathing and performing. The duet with Paula Cole on \\"Don't Give Up\\" is the most incredible, excellent live concert footage I've ever seen. \\"Solisbury Hill\\" is the most joyful 5 minutes ever captured by audio visual technology. The musicianship is exceptional. The sets and onstage performances transcendent. The audio recording quality is superb; way above average. In sum, a powerful, beautiful, work of art.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|This movie was one of the best yet. And I have seen a hell of a lot of movies. A couple horror cliches are present but are done so in a way that's not over-the-top (like its American counterpart of the same name) and are very subtle. In short, this was the scariest movie I've seen in my life so far. It's just something about Asian horror movies that make me laugh at the movies they keep churning out here in the states. This movie is awesome and I highly recommend it.
B000001FOL|1.0|Sigh. When will they Britney Spears wannabes stop? We have Patti Smith, PJ Harvey and now Nico. Dumb posers! Nico has such a generic voice and this album is completely overproduced.

B00006JKOL|5.0|When Jethro Tull won Best Heavy Metal band about 20 years ago, many people freaked out.  While I can understand their outrage, it's not so farfetched as many believe.  It's just that Jethro Tull is/was one of the most complex, intricate, eclectic bands EVER.  They could weave a musical tapestry of hard rock, metal, folk, prog rock, and jazz all into one, and do it seamlessly.  This album is a great example of their genius.<br /><br />For those who want a testament to Tull's heaviness should just listen to the first song.  After a charming 2 minute introduction, Martin Barre's guitar takes over and it makes your ears bleed.  Barre is one of rock's most underrated guitarists ever, and his playing is as awesome as many of his contemporaries.  Barrimore Barlow's drumming on the title track is also incredible.  The next song, Cold Wind to Valhalla, isn't as heavy as the title track, but it's still damn good.  Requiem and One White Duck are lovely songs (especially Requiem), with wonderful orchestration.  The epic, four part song Baker St. Muse is as good as any Tull epic.  The guitar playing is awesome, and the band delivers on one of their more complex songs.  The album closes on a lovely note with Grace.  This is one of Tull's least heard yet most essential albums.  It's another great example of a band named after the inventor of the seed drill.

B0017ZB8M6|2.0|The world of pop music is fickle and many musicians/artists who are invited into it every day are ruefully spat out in a year's time, music's future one-hit wonders.  Some pop songs can really speak to people on a grand scale while others are facetious and empty, a short and satisfying burst of aural energy to an ear that's hungry for an infectious beat.  The same can be said for singer Katy Perry's debut album \\"One Of The Boys\\", an LP chock-full of short, catchy compositions devoid of sentiment.  With a somewhat limited vocal range and a plethora of songs that practically blend into one another, Perry is easy to peg, therefore easy to forget.<br /><br />The title track has Perry singing about shedding her tomboy ways, desperate to get the attention of a guy that sees her as \\"just one of the boys\\" (i wanna be a flower, not a dirty ring/i wanna smell like roses, not a baseball team/and i swear one day you're gonna wanna make out with me), followed by \\"I Kissed A Girl\\", by and far the album's best track musically and lyrically.  \\"Waking Up In Vegas\\" is just plain boring, another upbeat track on an album full of rousing songs containing humdrum guitar work and Perry's facetious trilling.<br /><br />\\"Thinking Of You\\", one of the album's three total ballads, is a lament of a lover she never should've given up, dwelling on him even as she embarks on a new love affair.  \\"Mannequin\\" decries an emotionally numb man and \\"Ur So Gay\\" is an insult to the ears (not to mention offensive to homosexuals for the misuse of  the word \\"gay\\" - there are now commercials that denounce people as rude and stupid for using the word \\"gay\\" to describe something).<br /><br />\\"Hot N' Cold\\" speeds things back up and brings some value back to the proceedings with its admirable production and toe-tapping beat, its accompaniment reminscent of The Killer's heavily-synthesized rock.  \\"If You Can Afford Me\\" disgusts nearly as much as \\"Ur So Gay\\", the first-person perspective of the song revealing a woman who thinks much too highly of herself.  \\"Lost\\" is a cringe-worthy ballad made for its teen audience by bemoaning the sacrifice of the self for popularity.  \\"Self-Inflicted\\" makes no point, nor does it make sense lyrically.  \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" foretells the death of a relationship and \\"Fingerprints\\" is Perry's rebel yell, a last hurrah on the album about leaving your mark on the world.<br /><br />Perry's first album brings with it a slew of songwriters and producers, giving \\"One Of The Boys\\" the misfortune of being overproduced.  As a result, the album fails to make a grand impression on a more discerning listener and is primarily aimed at teenaged consumers, a demographic whose musical tastes are inconstant and often lesser-minded.  The few songs here that show promise are the playful, erotic kitsch of \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" as well as \\"Hot N' Cold\\", both of them written and produced by the same people.<br /><br />Though Perry's schtick seems to be \\"sexy and salacious\\", her music can come off downright obnoxious and uninspired.  This \\"pretty punk\\" routine has been done to death with artists like Pink, Avril Lavigne and Ashlee Simpson, so what Perry and her unusually large amount of collaborators give us on this 12-track disc is nothing new, nor is it notable.  In fact, the aforementioned singers have far more introspective and/or clever ouevres than Perry does, and that is largely due to a wise choice of songwriters and producers.  This is one of many of the album's faults, along with repetitive instrumentation and Perry's ball-busting vocals.  This consistent wailing of hers can grate the nerves, as can the stale instrumentation in each track (with the exception of \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" and \\"Hot n' Cold\\").  Even the CD's booklet features Perry (an attractive, well-endowed woman) leisuring in form-fitting ensembles, her broad-billed hat, fire engine-red lips and perfectly coiffed tresses resembling a 1960's pin-up.  Perhaps her production team thinks she can sell her image to sell the music, but this is lost on people like me.  If you can't sing and you don't have something important to say, than I ain't buying it - LITERALLY.<br /><br />It's clear Perry needs some serious help with songwriting when she's coming up with embarrassingly awful lyrics like this:<br /><br />\\"You're so sad maybe you should by a happy meal/You're so skinny you should really Super Size the deal\\" (Ur So Gay)<br /><br />Bottom line: If Perry wants to be more than just a flash in the pan, she'd better write some more self-exploratory songs as well as find a better team of producers who can vary her sound a bit and expand her musical style.  Older pop music fans, pass on this one - you'll be wasting hard-earned money on an album that with either be traded in or accrue a thick layer of dust in your music collection.lost on people like me.

B000784WMW|4.0|It's a wonder how any young girl, unloved and mistreated as a child and cast out into a brutal institution, could develop into such an intelligent, honest and loving person. Such is the life of Jane Eyre-an uncommon girl who's quick wit and sharp tongue have shielded her from abuse by her extended family, her school instructors and her time as governess at Thornfield estate. Directed by Julian Amyes, this eleven-part series moves deftly through the life of Jane but remains faithful to Bronte's story. It is an older production and the camera work is a bit weak, but most of the cast is brilliant, including Sian Pattenden, who plays young Jane. The lead actors, Dalton and Clarke, give strong performances but lack some of the important character traits of Rochester and Eyre. Zelah Clarke plays 19yr old Jane, but Clarke was almost thirty at the time of this production. The age difference gives her more experience and confidence than Jane should have with Rochester. It's more interesting to watch a character struggle against intimidation and when confronted by an imposing man such as Rochester, Clarke was much too composed. However, not all of the fault is Clarke's. Amyes' has a habit of filming scenes from an unnatural distance that results in a loss of intimacy. Film actors shouldn't have to work so hard to be expressive. Their slightest look should speak volumes, but as I've seen from Amyes' other productions like Great Expectations and The Old Curiosity Shop, sometimes he films like we're watching the scenes from a theater which is an unfortunate disservice to his cast.                    I agree with many reviewers that Dalton was dashing and exuberant but I think his Rochester was bit more likable than he should have been-considering the life-draining secret hanging over his head. Dalton understood Rochester's manic exterior, but not the overwhelming oppression that must certainly loom over him. However, these points are minor considering the obvious effort made forthis over five hour production. The script carried each episode well and at no time did it become tedious. There are many versions of Jane Eyre and I think viewers will find this the one the most fulfilling.
031606792X|1.0|How could you, Stephanie?  How could you?  I will not accept, nor can I abide this abomination of a book, otherwise known as, Breaking Dawn.    Its one thing to betray your own fans with this contrived garbage, but the bigger crime is that you betrayed your own characters.      I know others have quoted this before, but I am going to say it again.  In the words of the legendary Joss Whedon, Buffy creator and master of everything that you are not and never will be, \\" Give the fans what they need, not what you think they want.\\"  I would argue that to an even greater extent you owe this to your characters.    Let's forget for a minute, how many fans of this series have been heartbroken by the failings of this book, you can't please everybody, right?  But how could do that to your own characters, to the world you yourself, created?    With breaking Dawn, your beloved characters,  the ones t hat fueled the whole story up until now, became stand-ins for your plot devices, so you could exercise your own bizarre plot agenda.    I have even resorted to scouring fan fiction sites in an attempt to replace this story with a better one. And I think I found one too, titled, Sacrifices on [...]   It ripped my heart out over and over and I loved every painful minute of it.    Newsflash, Stephenie, first love, life, blood, is precious because its finite.  Take away the element of loss and you lose the meaning.     I feel like bonking SM on the head with my copy of Tuck Everlasting,  once for borrowing heavily from the theme and twice for missing the point entirely.      What fans were looking for with a series finale was an end to this story.  Not the start of a new one.    I will still cherish Twilight like a dirty little secret, but you, Mrs. Meyer, are dead to me.
B000P0J09C|5.0|This is a true masterpiece, a work of art, and the best war movie I have ever seen. It's not a \\"Hollywood\\" war film with a happy ending. It actually shows the reality of war, and more importantly, conveys the message that war is hell. Not to say that there aren't some good combat scenes, because there were. But the point of the movie was to show the true impact of war. And they did that so well, in part of the excellent acting by Vincent D'Onofrio, and in part of the script in general. Almost anyone who can handle the very emotional, disturbing content of this movie should definitely watch this.

The actors are of fresh and new talent and sang live througout most of the movie. The storyline was made to go along with the songs and was very familiar. The colors are absolutely astounding in blu-ray.  There are a lot of special, but weird and vivid, effects which seem to take you on psychedelic journeys. I feel these may have been a bit overdone. The extra features include a lot of material and are very interesting. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, especially the music.  Great soundtrack.

In the case of this film, the real true story is the music itself. The songs are vintage Chess Records editions. The story around them, very loosely based on the true story.     One truth you cannot deny though. Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Howling Wolf, Miss Etta James and others were the progenitors of rock and roll as we know it today.  These people made the music that influenced the major R&R artists who changed the world. (And they've got the law suits to prove it)      Go see the film for an interesting story and glorious music.  Get the history elsewhere.     Rebecca Kyle, January 2009

1400049628|4.0|With the increase in human population and an increasingly ignorant populace, scientists have estimated a 6o% potential of a class 4 outbreak in the next fifty years.  I was once a skeptic, figuring these the tales of wild conspiracy theorists.  It wasn't until one of my friends went through his story of horror. In a class 3 outbreak in southern California he was forced to kill his own zombie parents.  He never woke up without screaming for three months.  I became a believer.      Neer mind the movies, following those leads is sure to get you killed.  The handbook shows the ins and outs of every weapon, terrain, and bodily protection.  You'll learn why the machete is so powerful, and scoped rifles are so essential to protection from zombies.  Until there is a cure to the Solanum virus, remember than a bite means your fate is sealed as becoming one of the dead.    This book is a call to arms.  We as a populace must stand out and protest the mass concealment of this ever present threat.  When the time comes, we must all be ready to do battle ungainst the living dead.  I just bagged my first walking dead in a walk in the upper paninsula, and if it wasn't for the machete I was carrying per the recommendation of this book I would have been a goner.  This book saved my life, and it may save yours as well.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Chicago accountant Wesley Gibsob (James McAvoy) feels like life is cheating on him especially his girlfriend, his loud-mouth and arragont boss that pushes him around like a high school bully, and how his father abanoned him when he was a baby. However, his life was changed thanks to a beautiful assassin named Fox (Angelina Jolie) saves his life from a mad assassin named Cross (Thomas Kretschmann) and tells our hero that he has unique superhuman abilities just like his father who was a secret assassin working for a special secret organization called \\"The Franternity\\" Whom have been assassins for many years. The leader named Sloan (Morgan Freeman) tells him what his secret is including training him to be a hitman to fulfil his destiny to be a killer but soon will discover what the Fraternity really is.<br /><br />A modest and spectacular action thriller from the director of the \\"Night Watch\\" trilogy Timur Bekmanbeton. This is a very loose adaptation of the controversial cult graphic novel \\"Wanted\\" by Mark Millar as it gives us a stunning and sometimes funny yet ultraviolent look at being a fraustrated man with rage within him. The film co-stars Terrence Stamp, this film uses nifty special effects and action sequences that will remind viewers of the groundbreaking 1999 masterpiece \\"The Matrix\\" but with gore included. The acting is quite decent including Freeman whom is flawless as always and the story isn't too bad, this movie ranks along with \\"Rambo\\" as one of the best R-rated action flicks of 2008.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers awesome picture and sound with even the action sequences to outstand you. The extras are great like alternate opening, extended scene, Profiles on teh assasins, Cast and Characters, Picture-in-Picture, featurettes, Behind The scenes of the upcoming \\"Wanted\\" video game, Digital Copy and Blu-Ray exclusives like BD-Live, Wanted Motion Comics where you can view the comic on screen with narration and sound effects and Scene Explorer which has three different perspectives with multi-angel features.perspectives with multi-angel features.
B001J1O848|5.0|Front and center are Liam Neeson's strong acting skills. Just seeing Neeson's versatility made the whole film worth it.<br /><br />This is one of those types of films that keeps you riveted to your seat during the first presentation, but on successive views the film begins to stretch the limits of plausibility. For example: What is the likelihood that Neeson's character could go into a house full of mobsters and pose as an English speaking French police officer-- and use English as the language of extortion? Another example: What is the likelihood that someone would choose to execute a person and just as they started strangling him that the pipe on which he was suspended break in such a way as to knock out two of the would be assassins? Third: How is there a party with so many people (with automatic and semi automatic weapons) where young girls are  being sold that happens-- and not authorities know that this is happening?<br /><br />One thing that this does make the viewer want to do is investigate further into different types of sexual slavery-- if for no other reason than to ascertain the plausibility of the plot.
1594200653|2.0|When I first saw mention of Judt's POSTWAR, I put it on my book list. It took me a while to get to it, but I finally did. Although it did seem to have some good points, it had more bad ones.<br /><br />The book is too long (it takes forever to finish) and somewhat superficial at the same time. Add to this that Judt jumps all over the place and very abruptly - as another reviewer mentioned, subheadings would have helped. He also seems to flip flop on many points as other reviewers have noted. I found his overuse of the colon to separate clauses irritating, and his sentence structure was &#34;overburdening&#34; many times - don't editors fix this sort of thing any more?<br /><br />One of the main reasons I am giving this book a low rating is that I found it to be unfairly anti-American.<br /><br />Some reviewers say Judt is anti-Israel which is strange given the book's Epilogue. In any case, I did find the Epilogue to be somewhat contradictory and thought it a bad way to end the book - I like a &#34;happy ending&#34;. This information should have been placed elsewhere in the book in my opinion with the contradictions removed.<br /><br />There were a lot of interesting statistics presented in the book, but this got tedious at times. I did find his summaries of the events around the collapse of Communism helpful, even if his analysis of them might be skewed at times. Same for the Yugoslav wars. I had hoped for something more in depth about life under Communism though.<br /><br />Being of French descent, I can get away with saying something here about the French, so I will. I have always been proud of my French heritage, but in the period covered in this book, the French have behaved on several occasions in ways that I find disappointing. I always suspected there was something not being acknowledged that was behind this behavior. Judt's analysis here (one of the times I thought he was right) confirmed what I had always imagined it to be - wounded pride for the most part.<br /><br />I used to think that European culture/outlook/ways were in many ways superior to American, but more recently I have come to think this is not really the case. Judt's book gave me further support for my newer way of thinking. In some ways that might be a surprise to him.<br /><br />Overall, I will put it like this. Read the book if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you about its bad points.<br /><br />I used to think that European culture/outlook/ways were in many ways superior to American, but more recently I have come to think this is not really the case.

B00186JBT6|5.0|When I first came across this item while searching for Bach organ music, I couldn't believe the price for 15 (yes, that's right, 15) CDs performed by Gustav Leonhardt and with other outstanding performers, such as, Harry van der Kamp, Anner Bylsma, Sigiswald and Wieland Kuijken.  And they are performing a variety of Baroque (and a little Renaissance) organ and harpsichord music along with some other great instrumental music, such as Telemann's Paris Quartets.  And all of this for a ridiculously low price.  Even if some of the works duplicate works already in your collection, buy it anyway.  The music is outstanding, the performances and recording are superb.  As I said at the outset, this is a no-brainer.
031606792X|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews.  I really loved this book, and thought it brought together the characters endings in a lovely way.  The beginning scenes of the wedding and honeymoon are lovely, and tho, I, too, hesitated at the first sign of the 'little nudger', I thought the storyline was handled well.  It kept me very interested, even if it was a little gruesome - hey, aren't we talking vampires here??  And the final part was great - with Bella so triumphant as a vampire, finally unburdened by her clumsiness, and we feel Edward's love for her so much more because he loved her when she was so imperfect and so breakable.  I loved it, loved the ending, think it was a great book.  I even love the fairytale cottage.  I also didn't need a romance-novel love scene with specifics.  This one was perfect.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I remember when amazon listed the special features for movies. Not anymore I guess huh? Here are the specs on Serenity [Blu-ray]:    Visual Commentary: Picture in Picture of the actor/director commentary from the collectors edition dvd.

It goes black.]    Review:  Joss Whedon did a fantastic job of makinga movie that not only the fans will love, but people new to the series/movie as well. You get the characters, their personalities, backstory, everything is seemless. He doesn't knock you over the head with it. This may look like a purely action movie but it isn't. It's hillarious, heartbreaking, intense, and one hell of a ride. You care for the characters. This is a character driven movie as much as it is anything else. You'll laugh and cry. I usualy look at my watch every now and then when I'm watching a movie, but not with this one. It keeps you hooked untill it's over. Seriously recommended for fans of Firefly and newcomers alike.    -sdw
B000000H3W|5.0|utterly classic, it retains the 3rd world metal vibe of their earlier discs but starts to show glimpses of their later more \\"progressive\\" sound. A lot of true metal purists will frown on their later discs, but have a hard time finding any problem with this one.   Gone also are the horrendous recording of the guitars heard on earlier discs.   Anyone else wonder if they got the title from Amebix? They definetly show the influence in their later days!

B001DTUTU8|5.0|As much as I enjoyed The Grinch live-action film, I have to say I am even more impressed with Horton Hears a Who.  This film really captures the look and feel of Dr. Seuss' charming children's books.  \\"Horton Hears a Who\\" is about an elephant named Horton who, one day, happens to hear a tiny voice on a tiny speck.  Within a short amount of time, he realizes that that tiny speck contains an entire world of the people called \\"Whos\\", who happen to be in dire need of protection.  Unfortunately, not everyone has the ears to hear a Who, and soon the least kind among them (an authoritative kangaroo voiced by Carol Burnett) stirs up the rabble and everyone turns against him.<br />Colorful and crazy, this animation brings Seuss' drawings to life.  Jim Carrey does a wonderful job of making Horton both silly and sincere, playful and touching as he goes against the grain of belief to hold onto a truth that only he knows.<br />Sounds pretty deep for a family film--in fact sometimes the friction provided by Carol Burnett's character can get rather heavy-handed.  But it all works out in the end, and it is Horton's compassion towards those who would harm him that brings the message home.  Simultaneously fighting this same battle is Steve Carell's character, the Mayor of Who-ville and the only one who knows about Horton.  The chemistry between these two comedic talents brings their shared situation into an enjoyable, wacky ride to the finish.<br />The two-disc edition of this DVD (this product) contains a disc of the movie, with many bonus features:  deleted scenes are organized into three categories of completion, and show you everything from rough storyboards to semi-finished products.  There is also a goofy short film set in the Ice Age world, with Sid the Sloth and Scrat the Squirrel.  Plus many behind-the-scenes extras about Horton Hears a Who:  an interview with Jim Carrey, shorts on how the film was made, and bits and pieces of Seussian background.<br />The second disc contains a digital copy of the film, which means a file that you can copy and unlock on a computer or any portable device that can play the movie back (provided the device can play Windows Media Player or iTunes files).<br />For anyone with children, this movie will appeal on all levels.  It does a nice job of avoiding crude humor and it portrays wacky, silly slapstick in a delightful way.  Very small children might be distressed near the end, but ultimately it all ends sweetly, and I suspect they'll be asking you, \\"Can we watch it again?\\"copy of the film, which means a file that you can copy and unlock on a computer or any portable device that can play the movie back (provided the device can play Windows Media Player or iTunes files).

B000CPGZHA|3.0|Its a shame that Kylie Minogue isn't as well known in the United States as she is in her native Australia or even in Europe. A few viewings of her Showgirl Greatest Hits tour could change all that. Filmed before an enthusiastic audience at London's Earls Court in May 20005, Minogue shows why she is such a fan favorite throughout the rest of the world.    The Showgirl Tour presents 28 of Minogue's greatest hits and is more of a spectacle than a normal concert. Featuring lavish costumes and twelve dancers the show is always fun to watch even if its diminutive star sometimes gets lost in what's happening on the giant stage. Highlights include Better the Devil You Know, Spinning Around, Over the Rainbow and Your Disco Needs You.     Pull up a chair, fix yourself your favorite beverage and indulge yourself in a night of campy pop fun. See it.
B001CZVVW8|5.0|The singing, the acting, the orchestra are all first rate.  Beautiful music, superb cast, everything adds up to a totally engaging presentation.  The staging is sparse -- minimalist -- but it works well and is aided by excellent camera work.  A thrilling Onegin, not to be missed!
B00000583F|4.0|Upon the first riff all I kept things is \\"GODDAMN!\\" It's like it's 1973 all over again and Black Sabbath was making the next Master of Reality. Sleep takes the production values of the aforementioned record and further exploits slower tempos & jamming that feels focused for the most part. Occasionally getting carried away with meandering here and there for the most part this cd feels like a breath of fresh air from the early 90's perspective. It feels vintage but done in way that's playing homage to what was so cool about early stoner rock like Sabbath, Cream perhaps Humble Pie and gives a lower tuned doomier feel...Great stuff. Stand out track: \\"Dragonaut\\"
B001DHXT20|4.0|This Hulk was definitely 110% better than the first movie (which sucked bigtime). You see more of the Hulk and there is a decent amount of action here.    Great story, compelling characters including Ed Norton who made a superb Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler was a nice sight to look at but her character wasn't that great however she did play a big role.    I like that this wasnt another origin story but how he became the Hulk was told using flashbacks scattered throughout this movie. Great idea !  Origin storys tend to be too slow moving for me.    I loved the Abomination and even though the fight was too short for me, it really added a lot to this movie. The effects were great and the Hulk's CGI looked better here than the first movie (the one that sucked bigtime).     It's such a shame that this movie didnt do great box office because it deserved to make a lot more. But they are still planning another Hulk movie which i can't wait to see. Hopefully they won't make us wait too long.
1582406723|5.0|You won't want to put this book down or any of his Walking Dead books for that matter. People say Zombie stories are over played, but Zombies like any genre will remain a success as long as the story is told well and Robert Kirkman knows how to tell the story well. Do yourself a story, pick up the first two volumes, Volume 1 is an intro trade, a very good one, but once you're done you'll want Volume 2 right away.
031606792X|3.0|Ah, Meyer got very creative, this I have to admit, but she also dropped the ball on everything I loved the most.    The Jacob part would have been a nice separate addition (a spin-off to a whole new series really), but in Breaking Dawn, the effect of it was that we lost the beauty of Edward's and Bella's relationship. Their romance was previously very private and intimate in many ways, and told through Bella's mind. Jacob didn't want to see the beauty in it, so we as readers really couldn't either. [I have to admit I was happy when Jacob imprinted on the baby though, just because he could now leave Edward and Bella's romance alone. It's not that I didn't enjoy his character, but I always saw him as Bella's younger brother, so his constant intruding and Bella's constant worry about him became increasingly annoying and took away from her new adventures with Edward.]    I was dying to read more about Edward, and this book really did reduce him to a smaller character. I thought it was cruel that he didn't get to write the second book instead of Jacob- now THAT would have been a treat!  It would have been perfect really.    Final and worst, Meyer took a girl that I could relate to and made her into a mom. Annoying! Yes, I understand that Meyer is a mom and wrote the series while taking care of her kids, but that's her life not Bella's.... I couldn't care less for this \\"mom-ed up Bella\\". Bella as a mom is boring, and very different to the Bella I knew. I could no longer relate. Maybe in the 10th book she could have become a mom, but not yet for god's sakes. It was all too fast, not even a real honeymoon.    But I will give Meyer credit for making Bella a vampire. We all wondered if that would happen and how. There were some beautiful descriptions of how Bella could see everything more clearly, more slowly, etc etc. The mom part killed the ecstasy of it though.     The fifth instalment will have to include the child, and unless they send her to private school far away along with \\"her Jacob\\" *evil laugh*, it's hard to see the series returning to what once was. I already miss the Bella that used to live with Charlie and the Edward who'd secretly jump through her window.
1932907009|4.0|If a mindless studio movie is what you want to write, and money is your goal, then this book is for you.  If you want to be an artist, you would be better off looking elsewhere. And that's not necessarily a shot at the author.  Many people are in it for the money.  Personally, I would rather write a great movie that will really move people one way or the other.  All you have to know about the author is that he trashes an amazingly written film like \\"Memento\\" for not making any money, yet triumphs such non-classics as \\"Legally Blonde\\" and \\"Miss Congeniality\\" because they did make money.  I'm pretty sure that 20 years from now people will be talking about Memento and not the other two, no matter how much money they made.  But I guess that's what should be expected from somebody who proudly says that he wrote \\"Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot\\".
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Metallica, this is by far the worst mixed album I have ever TRIED to listen to.  I've heard 12 year olds learn how to master and EQ their mixes better than this.   It's simple, you OVERCOMPRESSED and LIMITED the s*** out of your recording. So basically what I am hearing is overclipped, distorted, digital noise!    How this recording left mastering room in this condition for mass-production, I have no idea. But it deserves a 1 star just for that reason alone... i mean come on now, seriously.
0345495004|3.0|This is a compelling story which for the most part is conveyed in plain, simple, and often pedestrian prose. No doubt the author decided that the plot was so riveting that the appropriate style should be understated, but I think she took this approach too far. Most of the book could have benefited from the kind of lyricism displayed in its concluding chapters.  I am nonetheless glad I read it. I had seen the PBS documentary on the Wright-Borthwick romance, so the events were not a surprise, but the novel did bring them to life. This is not a great book, but its story is worth hearing. In some respects Wright and Borthwick were ahead of their time, but whenever the well being of children is a factor whether to stay or leave a stale marriage remains a difficult dilemma.

B00133KFGW|1.0|We rented this movie after my sister said it was her favorite movie of '08.  I found it completely unrealistic.  I wonder if anyone really musical was involved in creating the storyline of this movie.    One major flaw was Lyla's special invitation to be a featured performer after 11 years of not really playing the cello.  Is there a Julliard graduate out there who can confirm that after such a long lapse in practicing, there is any way that Lyla can brush up in (what appeared to be) a week, and give a stunning performance to a discerning audience?  Another impossibility is Evan/August's theory progress in one day.  It doesn't matter how amazing your genes are, you will not be writing 16th notes and more in your first day of composing if you've only been introduced to basic quarter notes in a beginner piano book.  How absurd!  And speaking of genes, although his parents were gifted musicians, Evan had ZERO exposure to music except in-utero and out in nature(??) until he was 11.  A musical prodigy may have musical genes, but is also heavily exposed to music.  Mozart began playing the harpsichord at age 3 and didn't begin composing until about 6.  He did not hop on the piano the first day and compose.    Just two examples of many absurdities.  Perhaps the greatest is the idea of two people pining after each other for 11 years after a one-night-stand.  Is this really \\"great for the whole family?\\"  I found myself relating to Lyla's dad (being protective after the party-not forging signatures and lying), who was made out to be a villain in the movie.  I do think the boy did a great job acting.

B0013LPS6Q|4.0|Boy is the album that introduced the Irish band to the world. The band were basically still teenagers at the time of the release and the album has that sense of urgency and earnestness that one feels at that age. This is the band's chance at the big time and they don't want to let it slip through their hands. \\"I Will Follow\\" is a powerful blast of rock and roll that percolates and pounds. \\"Into The Heart\\" is almost mystical in its delivery and \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" is a ripper. The album has an airy sound in places such as on \\"The Ocean\\", \\"Twilight\\" and \\"The Electric Co.\\" while songs like \\"Stories For Boys\\" and \\"Shadows & Tall Trees\\" have an endearing naivete to them. Boy is chock full of promise and potential and the band proved they were up to the task of reaching and fulfilling that promise and potential over the course of their career.

031606792X|4.0|I find myself very amused by the negative reviews of any of the Twilight Books. I'm writing this review from the perspective of the unwilling reader.  I didn't want to enjoy this series. However, once I started reading it, I surrendered my pragmatic side and dove down the rabbit hole head first into Forksylvania.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants romantic escapism.  It really is all too good to be true, so accept that and have fun.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, her writing style isn't where it should be.  Or where it could be.  I think she has potential to do more, because regardless of whether you fully identify with the heroes of the story, the story as a whole is great fun. I like her new take on Vampires. She wanted a way to make them more easily integrated into society.  I enjoyed the variation of the Vampire theme.<br /><br />I am, however, a little concerned that her Vampire mythos has inspired Edward Cullen Body Glitter to be sold in stores.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn gave us too much.  Which I suppose is great if you need a vacation from reality.  And most of us do when we curl up with a book like this.  The characters really didn't lose anything, and got everything they wanted and didn't think to ask for. Of course, since we are somewhat reality based creatures, it's easy for our brains to reject such notions, and hence get a little upset at the plot developments.<br /><br />Then again, we all know that candy isn't healthy for us but we want to eat it every so often anyway.<br /><br />The whole imprinting plot development is a frightening prospect for folks who are concerned with pedophilia.  However, we are fortunate that Meyer's characters are not plagued with such a frailties, so we don't have to worry about that here.<br /><br />This is a fairytale of sorts. Nothing more.<br /><br />I will, however, issue a challenge to Stephenie Meyer to never ever use the word \\"Ugh\\" in dialogue again.  It's time for a new expression of frustration. This shows up a few times in \\"The Host\\" as well, and it makes me cringe when I see her characters say it.<br /><br />The whole series is perfect for having a lost afternoon in a comfy chair and a book.  When you require something true to life, then you need to head over to the non-fiction section of the bookstore. If you've made it to this part of the Twilight Saga, you'll enjoy how everything is resolved for the characters.  Even if your serious side feels that everyone walked away with way too much. It was still fun.<br /><br />In the series, my favorite character was the unsinkable Alice.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|This is the third and final of Genesis' \\"complete studio works\\" CD box sets to be released (although chronologically it is the first). The quality of these box sets establishes a new standard of excellence for archival compilations of rock music. Rhino Records and the band members are to be congratulated for giving fans the ultimate treasure trove of Genesis music. The sound quality is superb, and the graphics and packaging are very attractive, with all the original album art included, including faithful reproductions of the Alice in Wonderland-inspired Famous Charisma record label on the discs. A 44-page color booklet is also included.     Genesis 1970-1975 is the crown jewel of the three boxes (actually cubes). This one compiles the early-output of this English progressive rock band - the period when Peter Gabriel was the lead singer. Since I assume that 99 percent of people considering a purchase of this magnitude (nearly $100 as of this writing) are already fans of the band, my comments will not be a critique of the music, which is superb, but will rather focus on the details of the package.        This box set contains the band's second through sixth studio albums: Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, Selling England by the Pound, and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. Like the other two boxes in the series (Genesis 1976-1982, and Genesis 1983-1998) it also includes a bonus CD of rarities, in this case comprised of BBC performances, demos and a couple of non-album b-sides. The band apparently did not consider their first album, From Genesis to Revelation, issued in 1969, worthy of inclusion in the box. I disagree with that decision, and its absence constitutes my only major criticism of the box. At the very least, several of the better tracks from \\"Revelation\\" (such as When the Sweet Turns to Sour) should have been included on the rarities CD, which had plenty of space, since it runs only about 40 minutes or so.      Each album (including the rarities CD) is a double-disc affair (or triple disc in the case of \\"Lamb,\\" a double album requiring two CDs). For each album, the first disc is a CD of the original record, with sound quality that is greatly improved from the first-generation CDs I had in my collection. The second disc is a DVD which contains the album in surround sound and bonus video interviews with each band member discussing the making of the album. There are also performance videos on the DVDs of all but the first two albums. I don't have a DVD surround-sound system, so I can't comment on that part of it, but the interviews are fascinating. All band members, past and present (with the exception of early, short-term drummers) are included, and all are quite candid in their remarks. When taken in totality over the three box sets, you get what is essentially an insiders' oral history of Genesis from the band members themselves. Most interesting is the discussion about the making of the \\"Lamb\\" album and the factors that prompted Gabriel to leave the band just as it was finally achieving commercial success both in Europe and America.     I never saw Genesis live until just after Gabriel had quit the band. Drummer/back-up singer Phil Collins then took over lead vocals, eventually leading the band to massive worldwide commercial success. So the performance videos from this era are a huge bonus. The quality of the videos - most of them from European TV programs - range from somewhat dodgy to very good. One can only laugh at some of the low-budget attempts by the TV studios of the day to add quasi-psychedelic touches to the band's performances - which seem especially ludicrous when contrasted to the stunning stage visuals that were part of the band's tour last year. It is such a windfall to finally see Gabriel in his fox-head mask, old man make-up or \\"Slipperman\\" monster consumes, not just singing, but acting out the roles. Too bad that Musical Box and Super's Ready are repeated so often, but they are two of my favorite Genesis numbers.     As much as I love Collins' vocals, I still have a slight preference for Gabriel as a singer. So, if I were going to own only one of the three boxes, this would be the one. But the 1976-82 music is also essential for any fan of the best British progressive rock. I would rank the 1983-`98 era box - with the multi-platinum Invisible Touch and We Can't Dance albums, third in order of quality, but it too is well worth the purchase.
B001KZI7FO|5.0|I got this for my Goddaughter and her sis as a momento for a \\"Polar Express\\" train ride that we went on in Cleveland/Ohio.  The girls loved it.  I ordered a bunch more after that to save for next year.
0141439475|5.0|What makes Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein most amazing isn't the intensity of the narrative, the breadth of the science (for the early 18th century) or the fullness of her characters, for this book has all of those elements. However, Shelley's understanding that the creation of a \\"spiritual\\" (read: with a soul) being without thought to its emotional or spiritual needs is possibly one of the most inhumane acts a human can make. In the case of this story, it is Dr. Frankenstein (surely not the crazy mad scientist portrayed in the movies) whose sole passion of creating life engulfs him in a mission that turns first to horror and eventually dread and utter despair.<br /><br />But this book really is not about Dr. Frankenstein, but the monster he creates. A monster created with a blank slate. One that could have easily been motivated by virtue rather than evil had his creator (or any other number of people) not ignored his basic spiritual needs of love and kindness. Once this monster understands that love cannot be given to him by humans, he makes one last plea to his creator to make another creature like him, so that he will have someone to love.<br /><br />Frankenstien's decision on whether to create a second monster and eventual unwillingness to consent to the request is the second point of concern for the novel. Could Dr. Frankenstein have averted the disaster that was to come? Would he have prevented personal disaster at the expense of a curse on humanity? These questions the reader is left to ponder, making this one of the greatest novels ever written.<br /><br />The book would not be considered \\"horror\\" in the 21st century with our special effects abilities to create gore and disgust. It would be put more into the category of psychological thriller ala the movie \\"Seven\\" where the details of the actual acts are left to your imagination and the reasons behind the acts are explored more in depth.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I am not reviewing the film but the packaging and content of the 3-disc special edition DVD.  I typically wait for a price reduction when a new Disney/Pixar DVD comes out, but I bought this immediately for one reason, the Pixar Story documentary by Leslie Iwerks.  Iwerks, granddaughter of Mickey Mouse designer Ub Iwerks, has produced yet another stellar, feature-length documentary--one that chronicles the history of Pixar up through the production of Cars.  This documentary is certainly worth the price of the upgrade and is highly recommended.  The other special features on disc two are fair, at best, and not up to the quality that Pixar once produced on their original, lavish 2-disc sets.  If it weren't for the 90-minute documentary (which ironically never mentions Wall-E), this would not be a worthwhile \\"special edition.\\"    The third disc is simply a digital copy of the film, no additional special features.  I loaded it onto my computer for fun, and I suppose if you do a lot of traveling or enjoy watching films on portable devices, it's nice to have.  Personally, it seems like a pointless waste of a disc, and I predict that this digital copy craze will be dead within a year or two.    The packaging is strange.  It tries to be environmentally friendly, though ironically the bonus digital copy disc will be worthless trash after the activation expires in one year's time.  I am all for recycling and saving the environment, but I found this to be a cheap, difficult case.
B000005JA8|5.0|Alright, how to begin describing whatever THIS album is, haha.     Okay, so you have a lead singer who has a raspy, extremely hoarse voice, and the lyrics he sings are constantly filled with creativity and emotion, but the emotion probably won't be noticeable to you right away.  It's a VERY strange and tricky vocal style the first time you hear a guy sing like *that*.      DO NOT expect to like this album the first time you hear it.  It's a perfect example of music that needs repeated listens, so it can grow on you as you remember a little bit more each time.    What's especially unique and amazing about the album is how you have this lead singer who sounds like nobody else I've ever heard, and guitar playing that's always (and I mean ALWAYS) filling your mind with these neat creative tricks behind the vocals.      It's pretty safe for me to say I haven't ever heard anything like this before, that's for sure.  Like many people, I was first exposed to Captain Beefheart by his few vocal moments on Zappa's Hot Rats, and wanted to hear more of that because his vocal style has a completely unique sound and style.       It comes down to whether you can appreciate his singing voice or not.  I believe with time and patience and a willingness to keep listening to the album, you can in fact learn to LOVE this guys music.  I believe I have.      I will be completely honest though- this is not an easy album to get into at *all*.  I don't think it was meant to be.  Captain Beefheart always struck me as a musician who likes to challenge the listeners mind.  The album works as a challenging work of art.  Give yourself the much needed time and patience to appreciate something VERY different from anything any other musician was doing at the time.  You will learn to love it then.      Honestly, if you listen to Trout Mask Replica a few times and can't get into it, just put it back on the shelf, and wait a few more weeks and give it another shot.  Keep doing this until it clicks.  No,doing so won't be forcing yourself to get into it- it will be helping your mind adjust to something different.  Trust me, it works.  Allow this album to get inside you.  You'll come around to love it.
0316143472|2.0|I've read all of David Sedaris' books and I feel like he's running out of material.  I did not laugh out loud more than two times in this entire book, which cannot be said for the majority of his books.  I felt like this book was a letdown and wish that I had not purchased it, in hardcover, no less.
031606792X|4.0|Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />I find myself annoyed that the ending worked out the way it did.  There was such a build-up for the battle that I was aching for some action.  I was almost certain Aro would bring on the chaos.  But no, peace prevails, and they live happily ever after.  Perhaps Meyers went this route since it is a young adult series.  But it seemed like an easy way out.  Had she wanted to continue the series, the battle could have occurred with us not knowing the outcome while Jacob flees with Renesmee.  A cliffhanger that would have us all waiting with baited breath for the next release.  And here she did so well fleshing out many of the newcomers toward the end.  But for what?  Plus, she fails to resolve that fact that Bella and the Cullen's are okay with letting their kind continue slaughtering humans.  I would have extended the series with the golden eyes growing in numbers and a show down coming against the crimson eyes.  If Bella is such a good person, a natural protector, a shield for others, how can she just go on forever living blissfully knowing her own mother and father, or members of the pack could be slaughtered by vampires that don't care about them?  I just see so much potential in the story once the plot gets beyond Bella's gawking of Edward and her remorse for Jacob.  I daresay it is almost idiotic to go into so much detail about the Volturi and all these vampires and then just say 'the end.'  I see why the reviews are less than the other books, although I have a different set of reasons than most.  The birth scene didn't bother me, nor did the lack of romance at the honeymoon.  People get hung up on the most banal things.  I actually think this was the best book by far as it was easily the most compelling.  But Meyers blew it by wrapping everything into a nice little bow and ending it so suddenly.  I am not against happy endings, but in this case it is just too much.  Even fantasy worlds wouldn't have endings like this.  Come on.  That and the gaping moral loophole that I mentioned just leave me thinking Meyers got tired of the series and threw in the towel.  The Volturi should have been destroyed.  They are murderers!  Hello?  And then the Cullens should have become the new rule setters and forced their breed to go 'vegetarian' or be torn apart and burned.<br /><br />Anyway.  I recommend Gabaldon's Outlander series to you all.  She makes Meyers look like the amateur(albeit talented) author she is.  Gabaldon's depth and understanding of romance makes Bella and Edward's look silly in comparison.  You will not be disappointed.ping moral loophole that I mentioned just leave me thinking Meyers got tired of the series and threw in the towel.  The Volturi should have been destroyed.

Just Dance is making the airwaves, however, every song on this CD is good from Summerboy to Poker Face to Paparazzi.

It is so compelling that I ignored champagne and fun and pretty much everything else in the world until I reached the last page.<br /><br />Despite wanting to know how things turned out, I didn't want the book to end. That's not a very original statement, but it's completely true. Fascinating plot, original characters, suspense, romance...the book has it all. I'm preordering the second book in this series right now...
B0013O123Q|1.0|I liked Memento, but this was really something else. It's bad camera angles, super shaky shots, overly dark choppy frames, and the bizarre music, it was awful. Not to mention the story wasn't developed, and you don't end up caring about anyone. Besides the extremely long and graphic rape scene, which I agree is horrific, you just watch and kinda' wish the whole stupid movie was over.

I bought this album on vinyl because the remastered cd has a terribly compressed digital sound , only to discover that this album has been mastered directly from the cd and also has that awful digitally compressed sound , which defeats the object of buying the vinyl to hear this record in it's original glorious analogue sound .   Vinyl Lovers might be the name of the record label , but do they really love the sound of vinyl , as all of their releases on vinyl have been directly mastered from the digital cd releases ( including the bonus tracks ) , and all sound terrible .  It makes buying vinyl from this record label pointless !
9562919897|3.0|The Elements of Style is concise, direct, and comprehensive in its treatment of the rules of apposite writing.  The book includes an overview of conventional rules; commas, conjunctions, independent clauses, and proper sentence and paragraph forms.<br /><br />As a reference, The Elements of Style has value; however, the book looses appeal by invoking extremes of language and punctuation to present the material.  Equal effort is required to interpret the material as there is to understand the lessons themselves.  I believe one might be better served searching for a more lucid presentation of rules and usages of writing than is provided in this book.
B001O1O7O4|1.0|This review is for the kindle edition of PERSEPOLIS. I read parts of the book and watched the movie and it is one of my all-time favorites. The disappointing part is in the sample section that amazon sends when you order a preview. They only sent the introduction which is totally irrelevant because I wanted to preview an actual chapter of the book since it is a comic book and I wanted to see how it shows in kindle format. Too bad...
B001EN71HC|4.0|Austin Powers International Man of Mystery was the best of of the three, though the picture quality is good it is not as clean as I had hoped it would be (maybe I am just really picky and spoiled since watching the Incredible HULK and The Dark Knight?     \\"The Spy who Shagged me\\" the colors are incredible and the sharpest out of the 3 movies.    Goldmember was entertaining but not as good as the first two.    If you are a die-hard Austin Powers fan, this is a no-brainer and a must buy! My wife whom has never seen any of these movies (OMG) thought they were histerical even today! Definitely Classic Mike Myers...

LOVE IT!  My kids love it too (ages 5 and 4).
031606792X|2.0|I kind of liked the first and second books but the final two installments are kind of a yawn.  Meyer's writing style is kind of sloppy and jumbled.  And she has this annoying habit of adding more characters (vampires) when she runs out of actual ideas.  And like a lot of books targeted to tweens and teens, they're really predictable and contrived.  Very tidy and wrapped up with a neat little bow.  J. K. Rowling, she's not.

1401300529|2.0|Halberstam must have spent considerable effort expanding this out to 600+ pages.  His insights are repeated, ad nauseum, throughout the text.  The narrative switches back and forth; between US pols, Tokyo and scant coverage of the battlefield itself.  Each transition is burdened with fluff, and the seemingly endless repetition of notions presented earlier.  He also lacked the ability to temper the influence of his own politics on the writing - even the portrayal of simple facts seems consistently nuanced.  The portrayal of pols and senior officers that are either evil (McCarthy, MacArthur, Almond) or helpless victims of evil (Truman, Acheson, Walker) is indicative of his inability or lack of desire to truly winnow the facts or individuals' intent.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Granted this is an adventure/action film.  And granted that it was kept fairly clean for family viewing.  Still, I had some problems with the movie.  Without going into detail, it sort of mimics the original Jules Verne story.  However, it is interesting in that it references the original story as some sort of secret code of a quasi-secret society and implies that it wasn't at all fictional when Verne wrote it.<br /><br />Here's where it goes wrong.  The characters are shallow.  The plot is really unoriginal.  The special effects are so obviously specially generated effects that they aren't particularly special at all.  Even the sentimentalism is very thin.<br /><br />There were many improbable scenes that require such a stretch of suspension of disbelief to make it work, that it didn't.  Another movie I think of, in a similar genre, had no issue with suspension of disbelief.  No, in fact, Raiders of the Lost Ark made you believe it was all quite possible.  Easily so.  Journey to the Center of the Earth did not.<br /><br />As a side note: we switched from the 3D to the 2D after about 15 minutes into it.  It just wasn't that visually appealing as a 3D movie.<br /><br />This was worth seeing once, and only if you rent the DVD, in my opinion.
B001E75QGG|3.0|This Blu-ray 2 disc edition aren't the rollercoster ride you would expect from an Indiana Jones movie. It may pretend to be, with its numerous set pieces, believable or otherwise (case in point: saved by lead-lined fridge from a nuclear blast). The plot points are also tired overused cliches which won't impress. For instance, the use of alien as the originator of ancient civilization and Russians as the villain. It would have been better if this Indy outing had used history, artifacts as its anchor.    Product-wise, the picture & audio quality is good, as expected for a Blu-ray release. The plethora of special pictures also doesn't disappoint, a standard befitting the price tag. Unfortunately, the feature movie disappoints..
B000NA2776|4.0|Mika is the kind of artist you find purely on accident. At least, that's the way I found him.<br /><br />Needless to say, his music is... different, but in a good way, of course. In an era where we turn on the radio and hear girls singing about how their boyfriends don't understand them and how guys want to get, quote, `low' with the opposite sex, it's refreshing to hear songs that are fun, enjoyable and meaningful; not just the rehashed `wahahaha' theme we always here.<br /><br />LIFE IN CARTOON MOTION begins with the song GRACE KELLY, which is about a boy who's just trying to make friends, a boy who, ultimately, tries to be someone else to make that friend. The fun lyrics and the upbeat singing--mainly its high notes--make it a great way to debut the song.<br /><br />LOLLIPOP, is of course, something to `suck' on. It's easy to say that Mika made fun of the phrase `sucking on a lollipop,' considering the song is about how constantly thinking about love is bad for your emotional health and not something sexual. It's a song that makes you go, `Hey, yeah; I don't have to worry about finding the perfect somebody right away.' It's also one of those songs that can just put you in the best of moods.<br /><br />By the third song, we learn that Mika's music isn't all just about finding friends or living life the best way you can. MY INTERPRETATION is the kind of song that can be taken several different ways. I personally think it's the way Mika reflects on what goes on in his life.<br /><br />LOVE TODAY is, easily, one of my favorite songs on the album. Upon examining the lyrics, the song is about the `different ways of love.' This also involves the love that goes on between mothers and their daughters, how men love hookers, and the way people love `big busts.'<br /><br />The next song, RELAX (TAKE IT EASY) is about how we worry about things we can't predict the outcome of. It's meant to tell the listener to stop worrying, which is something that gets in front of everyone's lives, for the worse.<br /><br />RING RING is about him and a significant other, who can't stop calling. The `please stop calling me' kind of song is different here, considering the lyrics don't actually say there's anyone calling them up on the phone.<br /><br />ANY OTHER WORLD is a song that you'll have to decipher for yourself. There's no easy way to analyze them. The `say goodbye to the world you thought you lived in' line could be reference to suicide, but that's up to the individual who hears the song.<br /><br />BILLY BROWN is another one of Mika's simple story songs. The song is about Billy Brown, whose life was `going according to plan' before he `fell in love with another man.' It's about Brown's journey to try and understand who he really is. The `you are a victim of the times' line is an easy reference to how gay and lesbian individuals are heavily stereotyped.<br /><br />BIG GIRL (YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL) is the first song I heard by Mika. It's a song that tells heavier girls that it's ok to be heavy and that not everyone's supposed to be size zero. There's always the argument that the song is promoting obesity. This is probably because of the `diet Coke and a pizza please; diet Coke I'm on my knees' line. But, as far as I see, the song is all about a girl being comfortable with her body.<br /><br />STUCK IN THE MIDDLE is a song we can easily relate to. When we start doubting our own opinions and emotions, we get what's called `being stuck in the middle,' as Mika easily states.<br /><br />ERASE is about someone getting rid of your feelings for someone else after a mistake on someone else's part. In my opinion, it's one of the most emotional songs on the CD.<br /><br />HAPPY ENDING is the longest song on the CD. Coming in at nearly ten-and-a-half minutes long, it's got two parts. The first part deals with the idea that there's no happy ending after someone leaves you. It's a sad song, but it's also very dynamic. A group of singers sing the line `this is the way you left me, I'm not pretending; no hope no love no glory, no happy ending' in a low, sad voice. Later on, a more upbeat chorus comes around singing the last line, which makes you wonder whether or not the song will end the way it's expected.  The next part (which, on the CD, the name is unmentioned) is called OVER MY SHOULDER.  This is another one of Mika's songs that can't be easily explained. I doubt anyone can easily explain it other than the artist himself.<br /><br />LIFE IN CARTOON MOTION also includes acoustic versions of the songs BILLY BROWN and MY INTERPRETATION, which are skillfully done and just as good as the non-acoustic versions.<br /><br />In all honesty, there's really nothing bad about this CD. It easily deserves five stars, and as the songs stand, the disk IS five stars. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that they decided to put acoustic versions after the second part of HAPPY ENDING, `OVER MY SHOULDER.' All the songs are progressing up to this point, transitioning from upbeat to emotion. Yet, after the sorrowful ballad, we're thrust right back into the happy.<br /><br />To me, that's something I don't like, though it's personal preference.<br /><br />Mika is a great artist that everyone should listen to, at least once. He's an amazing songwriter; there's no song that wasn't at least co-written by him. That fact alone is amazing. The only songs that were co-written on the CD were Grace Kelly, My Interpretation, Ring Ring and Erase (which are, to me, the less powerful of his songs.) Erase is the most powerful out of the four, but the ones that Mika wrote himself are dynamic and shows his style in the full.<br /><br />I definitely recommend LIFE IN CARTOON MOTION.er on, a more upbeat chorus comes around singing the last line, which makes you wonder whether or not the song will end the way it's expected.

B00005JOA0|5.0|As a fan of British period films - I expected this Anne Bronte film to be whimsical like many BBC productions - but was pleasantly surprised at the haunting darkness of the story.<br /><br />The lead female, played by Tara Fitzgerald, is almost repulsive in her abrasive and aloof character at first... but then as you discover her story, you are heartened by her strength and courage.<br /> Rupert Graves is convincingly detestable in his role as the lover, turned abusive and monstrous husband. He plays the role to the tee, and adds (in the disturbing flashback scenes) an almost creepy edge to the film.  The fact that these flashbacks involve a child that Fitzgerald is protecting, makes them all the more unnerving.<br /><br />I found the film to be engrossing - You cringe to watch the deplorable abuses and yet yearn to discover how things happened and where they will end.  You view from several vantage points, the misconceptions of relationships - and how differently people define \\"the benefits of marriage.\\"<br /><br />Excellently acted, not outdone by scenery and costuming, but wonderfully produced from start to finish.  Although definitely a darker film, this is a British period peice worth watching!

I highly recommend this movie to those in...and out of the cubes!
0345495004|1.0|I was extremely excited to read this book.  Note on the 'was excited'....bottom line is this book was plodding at best.  I found I had to force myself to read it and often times used it as a sleep aid!     Although FLW was undoubtedly an amazing architect he was by far one of the least likable humans on this earth! Selfish and self-absorbed even with those that he supposedly loved! Mamah was also selfish and self-absorbed AND totally annoying BUT at least she had moments of clarity where I think it bothered her that she had chosen the path she chose and she at least had a bit of guilt over what she had done to her family and her children.  I found Nancy Horan's writing akin to watching paint dry.  She seemed to spend a lot of time on nothing and very little time and effort on the parts that deserved the attention,   I must say that at the end of this book I felt like someone had slammed my head against a wall after a verrrrry long slow train ride that at the last second sped up and took a sharp left turn!  OUCH!

B0017ANAZO|3.0|There is much to admire about the 2008 remake of the 1939 comedy classic \\"The Women\\". How about that cast!  Having such a large assemblage of talented and attractive actors in one movie is  impressive.  The fact that Diane English, the creator of the groundbreaking comedy series \\"Murphy Brown,\\" is responsible for this new version of \\"The Women\\" is reassuring.  It is wonderful that she opened doors for as many capable women to work behind the scenes as in front of the camera for this movie.  This rarely happens today.  Another positive is the way that the women's onscreen relationships with one another have evolved from the backstabbing bitchiness of the 1939 original to a more loyal and compassionate nature in the 2008 remake.    But there are obvious weaknesses in \\"The Women\\".  The characters in this updated version have the potential to be more complex and substantive than their predecessors.  Yet Diane English's script only scratches the surface of these women's identities.  There is scant detail about their individual lives, histories, and goals.  The characters are presented more as \\"types\\" than as three-dimensional women, i.e., Meg Ryan plays the good wife;  Annette Bening portrays the ambitious career woman;  Debra Messing is the frazzled mom;  Jada Pinkett Smith, the tough lesbian;  Eva Mendes, the man-eating home wrecker, etc.    Credit the experience and resourcefulness of the superb acting ensemble  who manage to bring texture and depth to characters that the story fails to fully develop.  The genuine warmth and respect you feel between these talented actors off-camera enhance their onscreen relationships as well.    Ms. English, whose writing for the classic comedy series \\"Murphy Brown\\" was truly masterful and funny, seems rusty here.  Her humor sometimes feels forced and occasionally falls flat.     But Diane English deserves praise for bringing an all-female cast back to the big screen.  It's ironic that in the 21st century women supposedly have less value in movies than they did 70 years ago.  This makes no sense and must change.

B001ILHY2C|5.0|A lot of fun and I was attentive to the 'story' in a slick, gritty, sexy, racing, action film that was a lot better than  the lynch-mob attitude towards Anderson. I mean, like he's so Carpenter, what's bad?, except your sorry expectations. Well, mine were lifted! Better than I hoped for! Stephen King said it was the best movie of '08. BD A/V quality; full marks, sound, off the charts; this will test your speakers and LFE will test your windows.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|Being a film that I've read Roger Ebert express disgust and disappointment, but at the same time Stephen King names it as one of the year's best, of course, one wouldn't be hard-pressed to become curious what to make out of Paul W.S. Anderson's re-imagining of Roger Corman's \\"Death Race 2000\\". \\"DEATH RACE\\" is very loosely based on Corman's cult favorite; the 1975 original was somewhat innovatively exploitive, with its satiric take on bloody violence, which made it fun. Anderson is a good action director, he's good with visuals but it is the skill of storytelling  that still eludes him.<br /><br />In a future where America's economy had collapsed, the prison system has been privatized and the brutal \\"Death Race\\" is the new source of entertainment for most Americans. After tough as nails, ex-race car driver, Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is framed for the murder of his wife and goes to prison, Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) is waiting for him. After the death of a masked \\"death race\\" four-time winner called \\"Frankenstein\\"(voiced by David Carradine), Ames is forced to masquerade as him and to compete against his fellow prison mates in the bloody race. Armed to the teeth, aided by his pit mates (played by Ian McShane and Frederick Koehler) and his navigator, Case (hottie Natalie Martinez), they must fight if they want to stay alive as Hennessey unleashes the fury of her devilish race track and the wrath of his fellow drivers (such as Tyrese Gibson).<br /><br />There will always be disappointments when a movie is a remake. This 2008 re-issue exchanges the exploitive satiric atmosphere of the original into something that attempts to deliver the same concept with a straight face which results in a comatose display of emotionless machismo. Anderson's visuals are good, there are nice touches as the race has the usual advances in tech such as the activation of a car's weapons--a car has to run over a \\"seal\\" on the track to activate/enhance its weapons and defenses. (shades of the video game \\"Twisted Metal\\"?) There's a big killer-rig called \\"Dreadnaught\\", a huge 16-wheeler with a lot of horsepower and attitude. The cars are quite nice to see, I always get excited with the sound of engines and gunfire. The film is definitely a testosterone-driven affair, but sadly, the quality of the action does not match the execution of its plot elements.<br /><br />Alright, so we know this is a remake, and we are familiar with its concept--therefore the film offers no surprises. However, when it attempted to sidestep the exploitive, satiric fun of the original the experience proved a little unsatisfying. Anderson's direction is just so predictable and the script is so full of holes. The film takes place on a futuristic world where unemployment is so high and America is falling to pieces, how can Warden Hennessey get more than 75 million viewers to subscribe to pay a hefty price to watch the race? Also, how can Ames become \\"flirty\\" with his navigator when all he should be thinking about is his daughter (then again Natalie is pretty hot). I'm all about a serious tone, but plot elements and emotional inconsistencies just makes me grind my teeth.<br /><br />Now the film is an action-laden affair, Anderson does somewhat succeed when it comes to shooting these scenes. Explosions, unreasonable violence, and tricky camerawork is the film's main strength. The colors have that grayish \\"hue\\" and the camera zooms does provide some thrills and attitude. The musical track to accompany the action adds some emotional \\"banging\\" and it does fit the mood. I think Anderson should have stuck to the basics of the action and mayhem than to attempt to make a few \\"crossed\\" commentaries about the public's hunger for mass murder and violence coupled with the finger-pointing at the media to manipulate ratings (\\"Sex and Violence\\" does sell) to make money.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a hack-eyed affair in terms of the eye-candy visuals, but the plot itself is so boring that it caneasily put you to sleep. Double-crosses, set-ups, vengeance, survival and escape to freedom are all predictable elements that has been overdone; while this may not be a bad thing, the film's direction is so uneven and the plot is just so full of its own contradictions. Jason Statham is a good action star and I hope that his agent can find him more note-worthy work such as \\"The Bank Job\\". The actor exudes coolness and attitude, he should steer clear of movies that may break his career.<br /><br />\\"Death Race\\" is an affront to the 1975 original, but if you turn off your brain, it may prove a decent diversion. See this when you have nothing else to do or if you haven't seen the original film by Roger Corman.<br /><br />Rental [2 ½ - Stars, very mediocre] rounded up because of the cars and gunfire.ses, set-ups, vengeance, survival and escape to freedom are all predictable elements that has been overdone; while this may not be a bad thing, the film's direction is so uneven and the plot is just so full of its own contradictions.

B0011KQSZ4|3.0|I'm a long time fan of British comedy, so when I stumbled across this at my local video store I was hooked.  My initial impressions during the first third or so of the film were not particularly favorable.  I thought it was very slow to get moving, and had a rather grim cast to it, which makes sense given the subject matter but did little to suggest anything comedic.<br /><br />Gradually, though, the story begins to build up a head of steam and by about the midpoint of the movie the laughs are coming with greater force and frequency.  The uniquely British humor eventually reaches a mighty crescendo with a raucous, if somewhat predictable, denouement.  At points it gets a little dark, in others a bit slapstickish, and in others downright crude.  Overall, though, I believe most viewers will find this a very entertaining tale if you can hang in through the first 20-30 minutes, which are rather dry.  On a final note, this is definitely not suitable for children due to liberal use of colorful language.
032147404X|5.0|I recently brought my first digital slr and was looking around for a book that would explain how to get the best out of my camera.Scoot kelby has written this book so well,he gets straight to the point.He gave me lots of tips that I would have never thought of.I've had this book for 24hrs and I can see the difference in my photography.I would be still clueless without this book.And as for his jokes,I don't have a problem with them.I actually think hes funny so if you pass this book up you'll be missing out on a lot.

B000002UR7|1.0|It's extremely hard to believe that this is the same band that made In Rainbows. I first heard the album at the same time I first Amnesiac and I couldn't believe my ears. The band has changed so much over the past 15 years, definately for the better. Pablo Honey is to this day the only Radiohead album I just can't listen to. After the first three or four tracks it just gets so dull that I can't take it anymore. I don't understand how it's considered to be so groundbreaking when it sounds like most other 90s alternative/post-grunge bands. I think it was Radiohead's ability to try new things and their willingness to be experimental with their music that got me listening to them, and there is none of that in this album. \\"Creep,\\" one my favorite songs on the album, is definately the most experimental song on the album, and it's probably one of the most overrated songs of all time. I even hate the album artwork. Another reason I started listening to Radiohead was because their artwork caught my eye, with the one exception of Pablo Honey. It's just not worth your money or your time.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|Most of the reviews I've read on RIGHTEOUS KILL, available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment, have not been very positive, but I think that this picture has gotten a raw deal.<br /><br />The problem, as I see it, is one of \\"expectations\\".  If Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are co-starring in a motion picture, one expects something of the caliber of THE GODFATHER, Part II, or at the very least, HEAT.<br /><br />Unfortunately, RIGHTEOUS KILL is not in the same league as either of those films, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth seeing.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Avnet, RIGHTEOUS KILL is a taut, very watchable cops-and-robbers thriller.  It has the two stars playing NYPD detectives on the trail of a serial killer who is probably a fellow police officer turned vigilante.  He is killing violent bad guys who have been able to escape the justice system.  Although the movie opens with DeNiro \\"confessing\\" to the killings, there is a twist ending that astute viewers will probably guess long before it is revealed on screen.<br /><br />The script by Russell Gewietz is well-written, and the actors, including John Leguizamo, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino, Donnie Wahlberg, Melissa Leo and Curtis Jackson, deliver strong performances.<br /><br />Avnet delivers audio commentary on the DVD, and there are two \\"Making of\\" featurettes.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I was really impressed with the way their last album, Room on Fire (2003), sounded and I really liked the band's sound. I was interested to see where they were going with it and I was completely shocked when I heart the first single from First Impressions Of Earth, \\"Juicebox.\\" I was a little bit disappointed at first because I wanted to hear more songs like \\"The End Has No End,\\" but after hearing a few more songs off the album, I was addicted. The guitars are ferocious and the vocals are dark and stranger than ever. After one or two listens I came to the conclusion that this was ten times better than either of their other albums, even if it was completely different. Despite the unanimous five star reviews for their previous albums, critics gave it mixed reviews. Magazines like Spin only gave it two and a half stars when NME named it the 8th best album of 2006. I don't care what critics have to say. Buy this album. Now.
B000HT3PPG|4.0|This has long been a favorite of many at Christmas time.  It is a great production.<br /><br />This timeless classic features Edmund Gwenn as Kris Kringle.  This kindly old man is employed to play Santa Claus at the Macy's department store in New York.  He creates quite a stir in the job and it is apparent that he really believes that he is Santa Claus.  Some who do not accept this identity seek to have him committed to a mental facility.<br /><br />There are some classic courtroom scenes with the presiding judge put in the untenable position of possibly ruling that Kringle is not really St. Nick.  He faces great unpopularity even with his own family members, let alone the voters.<br /><br />This is really a fun flick.  It is well done and has some great subplots.  Two well known actresses who play in it are Maureen O'Hara and a very young Natalie Wood.  If you have not seen it already, you will likely enjoy it.  If you have watched it before, this is one that can be pleasantly viewed again.
B000GY729M|2.0|I find it quite unfortunate that with every release, The Killers sound worse and worse. This was a pretty big letdown after their highly successful debut, Hot Fuss. I've never really been a huge Killers fan, but I figured I'd give this album a listen after enjoying most of their first one. It was evident from the first five seconds that they'd over do it with the keyboards. For me, keyboards are definately hit-or-miss, and The Killers missed on their sophomore album. Aside from the album being drenched in unnecessary keyboards, it wasn't to incredibly awful. After a few listens, most of the tracks weren't half bad, and I started to focus on the positives. I liked that the album recieved less mainstream attention than their debut and that the album only included one \\"Mr. Brightside\\" that was constantly on the radio and everywhere else. Also, I've always really like Brandon Flowers' voice. It's incredibly unique and in a strange way, very soothing.
B001HPP2X2|4.0|Very interesting show about a forensic blood specialist with some secret extracirricular activities. Michael C. Hall is brilliant as Dexter Morgan, a sociopath with a conscience. A killer with a code. The writing is very clear and sharp, and the supporting cast is perfect.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Finally coming to the little \\"art house\\" movie theatre in our city (Albuquerque) was a little Swedish film I had assumed I would have to see on DVD someday:  LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  Thank goodness I was able to get in during its five-day run...it's a real treat.    This is a horror movie that is also simply a romantic drama and sometimes a very dark comedy.  It hews closely to \\"vampire conventions\\" yet turns them pretty neatly on their heads at the same time.    12 year old Oskar is a shy, weak awkward little boy.  Not surprisingly, he is prime target for school bullies and also nurses some pretty deep fantasies about exacting bloody revenge on his tormentors.  He drags through his colorless days (the film is set mostly in and around an apartment complex in a rundown suburb of Stockholm during the early `80s...and it's snowing ALL THE TIME) with little to interest him.  He lives with his mother, who doesn't seem to be home much, and only seems to enjoy occasional visits to his father out in the country.    One day, some new neighbors move in next door.  A middle aged (closing in on old) man and a 12 year old girl, Eli.  I don't think I'm spoiling much if I let you know now that Eli is actually a vampire, and the old man is her Renfield, the human who takes care of her during the day and helps acquire blood.  While Oskar doesn't figure this out for a while, the viewer picks up on it pretty quickly.      Here's what great:  the vampire in the film is stealthy, thirsty for blood and very strong (just like in all the \\"old school\\" vampire films).  She is also vulnerable to daylight, and her bite, if you aren't killed by being completely drained and having your neck broken, will turn you into a vampire.  There's none of the toying around with what defines a vampire as we've seen in the last couple of decades worth of vampire films.  Yet the movie shows us Eli as a person who is capable of human vulnerabilities and most importantly, human caring, loyalty and affection.    The film shows us the slowly developing friendship between Oskar and Eli.  These scenes are handled with great delicacy and if you took out all the vampiric elements, you'd still have a nice story about the blossoming friendship / love between two lost 12 year olds.      The film also shows us just how mundane the details of being a modern vampire are.  The acquiring of blood, the darkening of windows in a modern apartment, etc.      And when there are bursts of violence, they are thrilling in their abruptness and ferocity.  The sound editing is great, and while the movie shows you very little of what is happening, you don't feel like it is skimping either.  You are able to conjure up all you need to give yourself a decent case of the willies.    The two young actors in the lead (Kare Hedebrant as Oskar and Lina Leandersson as Eli) are terrific.  They are very natural and unforced...they feel NOTHING like Hollywood child actors.  They are not perfect physical specimens...but the both exude a particular brand of innocence that can only come from a child just barely, but not quite, pushed over into adolescence.  Even the bullies in the film, while certainly not carefully fleshed out, are not cardboard characters.  They are all the more menacing because they seem completely possible.    This movie will make you laugh as you shudder.  It will make you feel warm and sentimental, even when something brutally violent is happening.  There is nothing simple about this seemingly simple story.    It is VERY slowly paced.  While it held my interest throughout and certainly captured me emotionally, I must also admit to a little squirming in my seat from time to time.  Part of it stems from the fact that the movie is set in such a bleak time and location.  Snow falling on gray, industrial looking dwellings and schools.  A washed out palette was used overall, and this made the film seem oppressive.  While very effective and highly believable, that isn't necessarily the stuff that ENJOYMENT is made of.  But these feelings were fleeting and only sporadic.    This is a somewhat challenging film, not just because you have to read subtitles (which frankly shouldn't be considered a challenge at all), but because it demands that you see the world from a slightly different point-of-view and to show sympathy for a vampire and a 12 year old boy with murder in his heart.  But if you remember that this is, after all, fiction...I don't think you'll have any moral qualms.  I didn't!    There are many more elements that come up later in this film, but I don't want to hint at them for fear of spoiling its many pleasures for you.  Just suffice it to say that if what you've read above intrigues you about the film...you won't regret seeing it.  For me, one test of the worth of a film is if I find myself thinking about it days later.  It's been awhile since I saw LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, and I can still feel many of its moods and picture many of its scenes as though I had just walked out of the theatre.  By that measure, and many others, this film is a great success and highly recommended.

B000YXMMAE|3.0|This isn't a bad album but the innovation is really gone. What was once a startlingly good and original band has seemed to have dried up and become boring. These songs just sound so lifeless. Inorganic. Removed. In Rainbows just doesn't seem to stand up with the rest of this band's amazing discography. I think the magic is (sadly) finally gone. They had a good run though!

B0010ZR160|4.0|When 4 year-old Amanda McCready disappears from her bed in the middle of the night, her aunt does what her useless mother won't and engages a pair of private missing persons specialists to find her. They have little experience with this kind of case, but armed with local knowledge, serious courage and a dangerously evolved morality, Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and his partner in work and love, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) accept - and get a lot more than they bargained for. The search for Amanda risks their lives, probes the dark history of the local police department, and threatens to destroy their relationship... The most pleasantly surprising thing about Ben Affleck's directorial debut is how assured it is. It's nicely adapted, slickly shot, cleverly edited, and stokes the requisite tension right from the start. Affleck really knows how to build a tense scene. The performances he extracts from his cast are terrific, especially from kid brother Casey who proves his star turn as Robert Ford last year was no fluke. Michelle Monaghan is engaging as his conflicted partner, and Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are typically superb (despite faintly ludicrous characterizations). The plot topples over into semi-ridiculousness in Act 3, but by that stage it hardly matters: it's no longer about the story, it's about these characters, the choices they've made and must make now. In that regard, the final scenes are powerfully affecting, notwithstanding the hint of unreality about how we got there.
0060254920|5.0|I was pretty surprised and disapointed in some of the reviews on this book. Several of the people who didn't like it themselves seemed to think that nobody 'really' does, and that they are only saying they do because it's a popular book. What a silly thing to assume. After all, the book didn't become popular for no reason whatsoever. Honestly, I think some people simply forget how to use their imagination, and you do have to have some use of it to enjoy this book. Yes, I do believe that, as humans, we like to blend in, and so SOME people might be tempted to say they liked it just because their friends did. That is not the case for everyone, and I would say, not the case for most.     This book has a sweet, imaginative story line about a little boy who gets sent to his room and so imagines himself somewhere else, with monsters that he becomes friends with. (Obviously, these are friendly 'monsters'). There is nothing difficult about the story line, especially if you use your imagination. The pictures are beautiful, but, not every child will like them, because every child is unique. I think this is a good book for children who are afraid to sleep because of monsters under the bed, because it protrays monsters (which are very real to many small children) as friendly and playful. This is a wonderful story, especially if you have a rambuncious child with a vivid imagination. But, as with all books, before you buy it, check it out at your library or from a friend to see if you and your little one will enjoy it.

0061122416|3.0|The main theme--'Everyone has a Personal Legend, when one wants it badly enough, the universe will conspire to help one achieve it.' It's insprational reading. But according to the book, that was not just an idea, but a law.  That--is very hard for most readers to agree to.
0312370849|4.0|This novel, intriguing from the very beginning, tells the story of the Vel' D'Hiv' -- one of the largest Nazi roundups of Jews, carried out by French soldiers.  It intertwines the story of Sarah, a ten-year-old girl in Paris, 1942, and Julia, a forty-five-year-old American ex-pat living in Paris, 2002.  Julia's job takes her to researching the Vel' D'Hiv', and she learns more than she bargained for, including her family's darkest secret.  The whole novel has a melancholy tone -- Julia has her fair share of marital and personal problems in addition to the downright depressing experiences of Sarah -- but it is beautifully written and altogether enticing.  Sarah's tale is told intertwined with Julia's, deepening simultaneously with Julia's research, and some of the sense of loss and confusion that Sarah feels is echoed in Julia's chapters, in the context of her modern life.  Overall, an excellent book, and one that will really make you think.

B0019LZV4E|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!  I have since listened to the soundtracks of the stage recordings, and in my opinion, Helena Bonham Carter does a far better job than Angela Lansbury and Patti Lupone ever did.  Nothing against them, but Ms. Lansbury's singing gets grating after a few seconds, and Patti Lupone, while excellent as Evita, is far too stiff for Mrs. Lovett.  Helena Bonham Carter may not be a professional singer, but she sings it far better than the other two ladies, and is amusing, believable, and likeable (no small feat, considering her character).  And Johnny Depp is simply superb.  Yes, they're not professional singers, but the entire cast does an awesome job that comes across far more naturally and beautifully than the other recordings I've heard.  If you doubt it, take a . . . listen to the samples on Amazon.com.  Compare how the three measure up to each other.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I recieved the VHS as a gift when I was pregnant with my son.  I remember being about 7 months along and cranking this through my surround sound system.  After he was born, my mother, another big fan, watched him during the day and played the tape as background music while he was playing.      My son is now 12 years old, and a HUGE Pink Floyd fan as well as a music lover in general.  He plays in his school band and in 7th grade is already playing with the advanced 8th graders.  He is now trying to learn the sax solo from Money.       Being in the middle of 3 generations of fanatics, I can say this is well worth every penny.  I normally shun concert videos, but this one draws you in.  Every song is spectacular.  The light and video show is stunning.  With the passing of Richard Wright this year, the movie is also poignant.      An absolute must have!  Dear God, please let them release this on Blu-Ray!

I appreciate the proceeds go to charity, but her fans desevered better than a few really slight, poorly written short and by short I mean REALLY short stories and the addedums in the voice of Dumbledor are pedantic long winded fluff, frankly all I want to hear from Dumbledore is why he stayed in the closet for so long, when as the most powerful wizard of all time he could have helped so many people by being true to himself, he is by far the most disappointing of Rowlings characters and I dont want to hear from him, until he explains, i.e. Rowling explains himself or herself..whatever, this book is bad~..if you want to get your child a great book of classic fables, skip this embarassingly slight, poorly written door stop and buy them Grimms Fairy Tales..and just do as I did and just donate what you would have spent on this book to a charity of your choice..no tree should be sacrificed for this waste of ink and paper.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Mr. Nolan & Mr. Goyer master piece is nothing less than riveting. This high octane power house movie excels where most other block busters flop on the beach. The direction, acting and story strive to be as believable as possible in this hyper reality setting. The affect draws the viewer closer to this classic icon and all the emotional highs and lows that come with being The Dark Knight.     Story: My jaw is still on the floor in the movie theater I saw the TDK at(I should really go pick it back up). The writing is original, witty and stays in the realms of what is possible even it's not very probable. Basic story is good vs. evil and all the trials confronting true evil entails.     Acting: Heath Ledger should at the very least be nominated for an Oscar. I've never been a fan of his but wow he simple stopped being human on screen and turned into the essence of evil. I found his character scary because he was so believable in his role (Who was the last guy to play the Joker? Jack somebody oh it doesn't really matter because no one this century is going to out due Heath's approach to the Joker). His performance alone ranks for me personally as one of the top ten screen performances I've ever seen. Not mention the other half a dozen actors whose performances are nothing less than powerful on screen.      Originality: Most sequels are a lesser version of their predecessors or they simply suck. This is typically due to a lack of new ideas and directions. The story still played off the first movie BB premise but added new depths and character struggles (these movies tend to have the basic man vs. man, man vs. nature theme around every corner).     Special effects: Good special effects are the ones you don't know existed because they look so real. This movie has a great blend of actual action and special effects. Everything is finely crafted and looks awesome on the big screen. The bat pod was a great extra touch as well.     Music/Sound: The score is captivating and keeps the intense story going strong. Great sound effects also especially on the bat pod.    Fun: This movie was a great ride that surpassed all my expectations. It is however a very long movie that could easily be worth watching over two days instead of cramming it all into one sitting. Despite its length this movie never lets up the action or has any flaws that tend to surface during most extra long movies.      Last take: TDK took me on a roller coaster ride and I loved every minute of it. That being said I'm already a huge batman fan and especially liked Christopher Nolan's take on this recent installment. This movie is rated PG-13 but really pushes the envelope is this area (basically this isn't kids movie). TDK isn't the usual batman concept that all about being campy and fun. This movie takes you into the depths of darkness/evil and some viewers might not really enjoy visiting this dreary place. Despite the movie never losing its quality beware the length is a lot to take in one sitting. This is sure to make it onto all top critics top one hundred best movie lists nuff said.     Extra Note: Regarding the movies extras they are malnourished to say the least. You get a cool video on the batpod and the batsuit and thats about it. There is also a Gotham news special hosted by Anthony Michael Hall(He basic plays his TDK character again) that's ok but nothing to write home about. I didn't lower my score concerning the TDK depsite this section clearly lacking depth but be warned there isn't all the juicy extras most of us love paying extra for in this two disc set. I only paid $18 dollars for my new TDK set leaving me without that burned feeling some of the other reviewers have.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is my favorite and most career covering Johnny Cash compilation out there. If you're needing an introduction to THE Legend that is Cash get this CD or if you're an old fan needing a good group of Cashs songs for a road trip or kegger get it. The choice of songs on the cd range from his early material (Cry,Cry, Cry and Hey Porter to later releases such as Rusty Cage -a Soundgarden cover, and Hurt- a Nine Inch Nails Cover) That is why I feel this CD is great for both old and new fans of Johnny Cash. There's old and new on there for you to listen to. A very vital CD for anyones collection.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|First off I have to say the restoration is superb for such an old film. I have a 60\\" Sony 1080p, PS3, and a High end 7.1 Pioneer Home theater. So I can tell you that this both looks and sounds better then I ever remember it. If your a fan of the Godfather and you don't have the collection on DVD. Then this is a must buy! If you do have the collection on DVD you still might consider upgrading, I would. The only thing I want to comment on is the case itself. It's very hard to get the disks to pop out, I feel like I am going to break them every time and it concerns me. Still a must buy!
B00004U2GH|5.0|Of course I'm going to be partial to Mr. Johnny Cash. He is a legend and always will be so he gets five stars. At San Quentin is a great live album, and in my opinion, I'd get this AND Live at Folsom Prison, they're both just as terrific as the other and not too expensive. It's hard and there's really no need to pick a favorite so I won't. Just get both of them. Both albums really showcase the talents of Carl Perkins if you're a fan of his but San Quentin is the only one with Bob Wooten on guitar with Carl. I think if you really just want to sink back into a world that has long since closed its doors on us for good and get lost in what it was like to experience Great music and Great times have fun with Mr. Cashs live prison albums (both of them). They make serving time a little more bearable anyway.
0395389496|5.0|This one deserves every award it gets.  The text is magical and lyrical, the illustrations are gorgeous, and the story is simple and beautiful.  My kids LOVE it.<br /><br />This book is so much better than the DVD.  It is hard to believe they are telling the same story.  The DVD is full of the conductor, the tramp, the engineers, the wild ride.  The book has none of that.  The book simply tells about the journey, the gift, and the belief.<br /><br />I get a little lump in my throat every time I get to the end.  It is a wonderful book.
0307276902|5.0|I really enjoyed this book even with all the controversy surrounding it. It really does have a little bit of everything in it and it was one I couldn't put down. I would highly recommend it, especially for anyone who has either been through treatment or been close to someone who has.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|It comes to no surprise that this album - recorded just before Simon and Garfunkels partnership disolved - features many of the strains and sadness of such break-ups.  It is noticeable when you hear the first notes of the opening title track and the first heart-breaking line.  In fact It is evident through-out nearly all the songs that the duo was parting ways.  Even joyous tracks such as \\"Baby Driver\\" and \\"Keep The Customer Satisfied\\" cannot hide the pain and regret.  Yet regardless of the strain they were feeling, the two managed to pull off a miracle and record what many regard as their best work.    Maybe its because of the somber atmosphere that the album is so successful. After all, people often see art and brilliance in pain and tragedy.  Or maybe its because the album is just so well written and produced.  With only the cover of The Everly Brothers \\"Bye Bye Love\\" falling flat, every song here is a masterwork.  Paul Simon turns out some of his best - and most cryptic - lyrics with \\"The Boxer\\" and the title track.  The production is top notch with the thunderous drums of \\"The Only Living Boy In New York\\" and the graceful strings of \\"So Long Frank Lloyd Wright\\" being just some of the many florishes to hear.  Indeed, there may be many reasons why this album has become a classic - it did get the duo their first Grammy.  What is important, however, is the irony that two guys who were hardly on speaking terms could put out what is possibly their best record.    This all very similar to what The Beatles were experiencing with Abbey road.  Of course, that fued was between four guys.  Its way more personal when its just between two of you.  Like Paul McCartney with Abbey Road, Paul Simon wrote a few songs here that would point the future direction of his solo work.  The African world beat of his album \\"Graceland\\" can already be heard in the track \\"Cecila\\" as can the softer, more adult sounds of \\"Still Crazy After All These Years\\"; apparent in such tracks as \\"The Boxer\\" and \\"El Condor Pasa\\".  There are many parallels between \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" but perhaps the most important one is the proof that one can still work well even while under major stress. Unfortunately, it was the stress that led to the break-up of Simon & Garfunkel shortly after this release.    If the career of Simon & Garfunkel were a movie, it would definitly not have a happy ending.  Luckily, however, the duo did reunite a few times - such as at their famous Central Park Concert - which is something The Beatles never did; perhaps proof that you can build stronger friendships with a one-on-one relationship than with four people.  \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" were kind of a final signal that the 60s were over and everybody had to move on.  The greatness in those albums, however, act as a reminder to not forget the 60s regardless of how far in past they may be.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Dr Bolte Taylor paints a picture with words about the horrors and bliss associated with having her stroke.  Through this, she inspires us to look beyond the physical body that is beset with limitations and instead seek out the mental, feeling, emotional side of not just stroke victims but of all patients and of all humanity.  Through that she reveals we can shape our inner self to focus on what really matters.  I cannot imagine many people reading her book or seeing her lecture at TED.com walking away without having been greatly impacted by the beauty and truth of her story.  I, for one, have been greatly touched on so many levels by listening to and reading about her experiences.  And, I dare say, my patients have benefited as a result.
1416511946|5.0|Mötley Crüe was my favorite band growing up. Tommy and Nikki were my idols into my teenage years. I went to see them play every time they were on tour from Shout at the Devil - Dr.Feelgood. I remember seeing them in Charlotte NC on the Girls tour when GNR opened for them,and Slash had a neck brace on while playing. This book takes place right at that time and explains a lot. So after reading this it really opened my eyes to what Mötley Crüe was really like in the 80's. Now all the lyrics make sense. I figured they were partying, hard but not to this extreme. Some of the stuff just does not seem humanly possible. Leave it to Motley to see just how much drugs a human can take. I read the book in one sitting, once I started I could not put it down.     If you were ever a Mötley Crüe, Ratt or GNR fan, this is a must read book.
0805017305|5.0|I never read 'populist' books, but in this case I was so glad I ignored my silly rule.     This is truly a book which changes perspectives and life views. Its extremely well written and I won't go over the other reviews here on this site, but just want to say this is a MUST read book.     I've not been able to watch a 'cowboy & Indian' film since without a tear in my eye for the pain and suffering of such a wonderful people and nation.
B000EWBKKI|3.0|If your a fan of this movie series you might want to get this, however its only marginally better definition then the dvd (especially if you have an upconvert dvd player).  This blu-ray does not have the special features available on some of the special edition dvds.  So basicly you give up some nice special features for a marginal increase in definiton.  If its about 10 dollars or so, or if they rerelease it with special features and improved definition then it would be worth it otherwise just stick with the special editon dvd.
6304696558|1.0|Goldie Hawn was hilarious in \\"Foul Play\\" when I first saw it all those years ago and she shows another dimension to her acting and now screenwriting in \\"Private Benjamin\\".  I remember years ago when I first saw this that I laughed a lot more but I guess it's understandable as very few comedies age very well as they tend to be dated to the times that they were written for and this film is no exception.<br /><br />Thankfully this film is not just a comedy as it still retains its ability to entertain and amuse despite the time-decayed nature of most of the jokes because it is also a very good story about how a spoilt, dependent young woman becomes emancipated and self-confident to be better able to identify various attempts to exploit and manipulate her with her passing the final test at the end with the jerk she's supposed to marry.  Goldie Hawn shows in this film that she's not just a comedianne but that she's also a serious actress and the scenes when she is upset and reaching out for help on the radio chat show for example were quite moving.  This is the best Goldie Hawn film that I've seen.<br /><br />As a result, the film retains its ability to still amuse and entertain despite the poor aging of most of the gags.  Unfortunately, the quality of this dvd version of the film is very, very poor.  Both the picture (especially the picture) and sound quality are abysmal and there are no special features worth mentioning.  Fans of the film should give this particular dvd version a wide berth and wait for either a standard or Blu-ray format with much improved picture restoration and sound quality remastering with at least 5.1 surround sound options in an anamorphic widescreen format to surface.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is an archetypal story of a Hero on a Quest to save the kingdom and marry the princess. He encounters obstacles along the way but has the guidance, in this story, of two Wise Old Men.<br /><br />Carl Jung named the archetypes to show the universal nature of the collective unconscious that we all share. \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the ongoing story of one Hero--Bruce Wayne who becomes Batman, a supernatural force who combats the evil destroying Gotham City. According to archetypes, the Hero finally overcomes the evil, saves the kingdom, and marries the princess. This marriage is explicitly part of this story. However, Rachal wisely understands that there will NEVER be a time when Batman is not needed. Evil is inherent in human nature.<br /><br />The human Hero is Harvey Dent, the district attorney, who battles evil through the legal arm of the law, unlike Batman who uses \\"supernatural\\" powers and even breaks the law. Although the two don't work together, they do respect what the other does.<br /><br />On the other hand, the Wise Old Men educate and influence Batman/Bruce. Michael Caine (looking more handsome than in his youth) explains that sometimes evil doesn't have a cause or a reason--it just is. He tells a story of his youth in which a villain is caught. He and his men had to burn down a forest to capture him. Does it take extreme measures to control evil? Morgan Freeman tells Bruce that he will not be part of illegal operations. He is the morality factor.<br /><br />Of course, there's Heath Ledger, who gives an award-winning performance as the Joker, the wild card, the chaos factor. Only an excellent actor can move through heavy make-up to use facial expressions, hair, body language to personify the purity of evil, or chaos, as he explains it.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" far exceeds its reputation in illustrating a morality play through archetypes. Those who don't quite see how Harvey Dent was utterly changed fail to recognize that he was literally stripped of half of his face value, exposing raw nerves and incredible pain. The question is not What are good and evil, but how they are used--to what end, for what purpose? Relative values or eternal? The purity of archetypes or the blurred lines of actual life? It is definitely fodder for debate.sing raw nerves and incredible pain. The question is not What are good and evil, but how they are used--to what end, for what purpose? Relative values or eternal?

B00005OWEG|5.0|For me, a future Director's Cut will always be the better version because that is the version the director always wanted you to see but because of various reasons usually beyond their control at the time they had to settle which could range from budget to timing/length to censorship issues etc.  Having seen both versions I can safely say that Redux is the best because the Director has full leeway to tell the story he had always wanted to tell even if it means that this is now a more than 3 hour long movie which for me I didn't even feel the length because it was so good, so powerful and so absorbing and after \\"Platoon\\" is the best anti-war movie ever made and is a masterpiece of film direction.<br /><br />This film certainly rewards patient and repeated viewing and like any classic you pick up more from it and appreciate it even more every time you see it.  The casting is excellent with unforgettable performances by Sheen, Duval and even Brando and it's amazing that Sheen didn't even get an Oscar nomination.  While I can concede the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Melvyn Douglas for his brilliant performance in \\"Being There\\" and Peter Sellers should have won the Best Actor award that year too I find it incredible that \\"Apocalypse Now\\" didn't win the Best Film and Best Director awards.  I suspect if the voters had been able to see Redux, a lot more of the 8 nominations would have turned to wins for the film.  Does anyone even remember or care about \\"Kramer versus Kramer\\" anyway?<br /><br />This dvd version is also a treat as the sound quality has been remastered brilliantly for an excellent sound that truly gave my 5.1 Surround Sound system a great workout!  It was an excellent viewing experience for me and the picture quality although not perfect was very, very well restored making this one of my favourite dvd purchases and together with the \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" special edition dvd I have makes me content with what I have and not too bothered about looking for a \\"better\\" version.  If this ever gets to Blu-ray though, I may reconsider for the apparently sharper images this format provides but as far as standard dvd versions go this is among the very few dvds that I've seen that is full value for money given the overall package of great picture and sound quality.  The only thing is that there are no Special Feature documentaries here which is understandable given the film's length and this being just a one-disc edition.  This doesn't bother me though but for those who absolutely need more then the more recent 2-disc release is the one for you.<br /><br />Excellent film, excellent picture and especially sound quality makes this excellent value for money as well.<br /><br />Very, very highly recommended!If this ever gets to Blu-ray though, I may reconsider for the apparently sharper images this format provides but as far as standard dvd versions go this is among the very few dvds that I've seen that is full value for money given the overall package of great picture and sound quality.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|Adams is often considered one of the \\"forgotten\\" founding fathers because of his being overshadowed by such historical giants as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and Benjamin Franklin.  But Adams role in our nation's founding was massive, as this series shows.   I'll offer a word of caution from the outset.  While this series can be very educational, parents need to be aware of three scenes that may be inappropriate for younger audiences.  Two scenes involve nudity, but thankfully neither of them are sexual in nature.  Early in the series, a British tax collector is stripped, tarred, and feathered.  Towards the end of the movie, there's a scene in which Adams' daughter has a mastectomy because of breast cancer.  While neither scene would be considered vulgar, parents need to beware.  The only other \\"risqué\\" scene involves John and his wife Abigail.  After they had been separated for a couple of years with John in Europe, Abigail comes to Europe and they are reunited.  And they are REALLY, REALLY happy to see each other...if you get my drift.  Actually, it was nice to see Adams longing for his wife as opposed to many diplomats of the day who simply took mistresses.  Nevertheless, HBO being what they are, felt the need to show an intimate scene involving the couple.  There was no nudity, but there was a little more action shown than was needed in my opinion.  Now for the movie itself.   I found the series to be very captivating and accurate to historical events.  The series is based upon David McCullough's award winning biography of Adams, which is a classic.  McCullough has also written biographies of Harry Truman and Theodore Roosevelt; as well as an account of American Independence called 1776.  All great books that I would highly recommend.     The characters bear an uncanny resemblance to the originals.  Washington, Jefferson, and Adams all look exactly like their famous portraits.  The historical accuracy seems to be very detailed, evendown to the facet of John Adams having an almost constant dip of snuff in his mouth throughout the movie (he was a habitual dipper).   The movie seems to have accurately portrayed Adams' strengths, while still pointing out his shortcomings.  He was known as an intensely honest man who was willing to stand for what he believed to be right regardless of consequences.  This can be seen in his serving as the defense lawyer for the British soldiers accused in the 1770 Boston Massacre.     In the beginning, Adams was somewhat of a reluctant patriot, not nearly as zealous as his cousin Samuel.  But though he wants to give Britain the benefit of the doubt, he eventually sees that their tyranny has gone too far, and he joins the cause.   Adams had some downfalls which are depicted as well.  He could be extremely obstinate and overbearing at times.  He worried excessively about his standing in history, and at times was a little too proud of his intellectual prowess.  His wife Abigail serves as a stabilizing force in the movie, frequently bringing him back to earth.  Abigail is depicted in many ways as a heroine, which is both right and wrong.  She was a very impressive person in her own right, but I have read in other sources that her ambitious and controlling nature was at times more than her husband and children could bear.   While the Adams' clearly loved and wanted the best for their children, they were at times too obsessed with John's career and less focused on the parent/child relationship.  But in their defense, this was common practice in early America.  The paradox of this form of child raising can be seen in two of their sons.  Their oldest, John Quincy went on to be the sixth president of the United States.  Their next oldest, Charles grew up to be an embittered alcoholic who drank himself into an early grave.   The movie depicts Adams early life, days as a lawyer, foreign diplomat, Ambassador to Britain, Vice President, President, and elder statesman.  One of themost fascinating aspects of his life was his relationship with Thomas Jefferson.  They grew to be very close friends while both were serving in Europe.  Then began to drift apart in George Washington's cabinet where Jefferson was Secretary of State and Adams was Vice President.  When Jefferson defeated Adams for the Presidency in 1800, they severed all ties.  Many years later, as old men, they began corresponding by letter, in what still remains one of the most illuminating sources of historical data known to America.     The movie ends with one of those moments so bizarre that Hollywood couldn't even conceive it.  On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, John Adams dies.  His famous last words were:  \\"Thomas Jefferson survives.\\"  But unbeknownst to him, Jefferson had died just a few hours earlier.  Both of these patriots...the last two remaining from the Revolution...died on the 50th anniversary of July 4, 1776.   Overall, I would highly recommend this series, if one keeps in mind the warnings I gave at the outset.  It's well written and well produced.  Though it's over seven hours long, there are not really any mundane or boring sections of the film.  Some of the camera angles give you the feeling of peeking into the room while history is taking place.  While some may find this mildly annoying, I thought it gave an authentic touch to the scenes.  The musical score by Rob Lane was well done and enhanced the overall appeal of the movie.  You'll definitely come away more educated, and entertained in the process.  And after all, \\"entertaining education\\" is the best kind of education there is.
B001KZVQJI|2.0|It seems I might be the first one posting here that is not a Peter Jackson fan-boy!  I am interested in seeing the extended cut of this film to see if it adds any substance.  The theatrical version had many great moments...but also an hour of unnecessary \\"character development\\".  I believe the entire 1933 original version can be viewed in less time than it takes for Kong to make his first appearance in this remake.  The lame attempts at giving the characters depth and backstories added nothing to the story.  This would have played better (and probably to a greater audience) at two hours.  I am a great lover of film as both an art form and for just plain, fun entertainment...and it's sad when I see a film like this and know beyond a doubt I could create a substantially improved product using the available material.  I'll be getting this one from Netflix.    As for the \\"double-dipping\\" issue...it seems it's not a factor on this title but I understand they will hit LOTR fans hard with it this year.  Peter Jackson must have been schooled by George Lucas!
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell's books, this one included, are not \\"hard science\\" and Gladwell makes no claims that they are-- so why do so many reviewers go off about that? The books ARE good reporting on timely topics, and more than anything else, they are very motivational. I am presently searching for a new job-- it is good to be reminded in blunt terms that it's probably more about who I know than what I know!     The premise of this book, for the most part, holds true. One observation to the contrary (If you haven't read the book \\"The Greatest White Trash Love Story Ever Told\\" you might not get this)-- there are situations where the opposite of a thing actually is the thing itself. Thus some people are the opposite of what they really are--not just the opposite of what they seem. That's not philosophical mumbo-jumbo. That's a \\"fact\\" of life.
0441013597|5.0|Frank Herbert's masterfully crafted book, Dune, is one of the best books I have ever read. Set on a wonderfully unique world Arakis, AKA Dune, this book follows the life of Paul Muad'Dib. I do not want to give away any more plot points than that. However, if you are a science fiction fan, you will love this book. The story, characters, technology, and world are all wonderfully crafted. The writing style is wonderful as well. It does not explain everything for you, but it withholds just enough information to make you think. With a unique and wonderful storyline, and excellent writing style, you can not go wrong when you decide to read Dune.
0517548232|5.0|This is one of the most insightful looks at the market that I have come across. The author lays out in simple language the common fallacies of those attempting to \\"fix/repair/bailout\\" the economy. His primary lesson is that one should look at the effects of a proposed policy on the whole populace, and in the long-term, rather than simply looking at the immediate effects on a given group. Also, the last few pages provide an excellent reading list to further your understanding of economics.    I plan to regularly read this to keep my mind fine-tuned to the critical examination of new policies.

B001C08RHA|4.0|So first we had X-men, then Spiderman and afterwards other countless Marvel Comic adaptations that were either majorly or moderately successful. But what do we have to expect for Iron Man, does it live up to the expectations of the fans, does it match up Spidey or X-men? Honestly it does; this adaptation proves that the comic book genre can still bring a character from the pages of a comic and yet maintain it fresh and new to a vast broad audience.<br /><br />In this first and clever adaptation of \\"Iron Man\\" we have Tony Stark, A genius and ambitious weapons business man who finds himself after being captured by Terrorist. These terrorist have weapons built and designed by Stark; they need Stark's help to build a super intelligent missile known as \\"the Jericho\\". In his attempt to create this weapon Stark creates a better and more efficient weapon...obviously Iron Man.<br /><br />The movie is a popcorn flick above all, it does however mange to create a very well crafted origin storyline; maybe not on the level of Batman Begins or Superman: The Movie, but it still brings in a good transition of how Stark finds his true destiny and purpose. The effects for the film are stupendous all the way. The only problem I found with the movie was 2 things. One the later half of the movie changed from what seemed to be a serious comic book movie, into an adrenaline fueled action extravaganza. Sure action is cool, but the way the ending was placed with him fighting the other Iron Man...it felt sort of silly; As if the ending was just a filler to have Iron Man facing someone for the hell of using more effects and having the audience feel the use of the 135 million dollar budget for the film. Above all this the movie is still a triumphant adaptation; the majority of the characters are superb in their acting. Downey Jr excels marvously as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and it's a great movie to watch with the family...I think. Anyways a must own by fans of the genre or new comers.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ½ OUT OF 5 OUT OF 5
0316143472|2.0|A little dissappointed in this. His concert version in New York has his best stuff. I hate to say this but it is a little to GAY for me. Every character , he goes on and on about every piece of clothing they are wearing, who would even notice this except for a flamer? I only mention it because it detracts from his story. It was only semi-funny, more of a gay guy's observations of daily life and growing up with a bunch of sisters.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Come on people it's a huge green dude...What were you expecting? Spidey? Didn't think so. Hulk is that character in comics that was never truly identified to be either a hero or a villain. He is both in my opinion. He is his own enemy, Banner has to fight with his inner self (literally) the struggles between Hulk and Bruce Banner are as plausible as that of Kent and Superman, or Wayne and Batman. The only problem is how the story is adapted.<br /><br />In this first adaptation, which in fact isn't that loyal to the comic book origins; begins the story of tormented scientist Bruce Banner and his search for a new means to heal and cure people in a way never imagined. His attempts fail after he is exposed to gamma rays. This of course unleashes what is already inside of Banner. Now there are many details in the movie that I'm not gona ruin, for that you would have to see the movie. The issue with why people dislike the movie is because it takes almost 45 min of the movie to finally see Hulk.<br /><br />The movie dwells to long in the past of Banner, now I agree origin is good but in a balanced manner. The effects are amazing with out a doubt...But the storyline a times drags to long. Not to mention the final fight scene this is too dark and poorly conceived. Conclusion, rent it before you buy it. Only buy it if you are a fan of Hulk or comics.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ½ OUT OF 5

I guess if this is the worst of my problems, I am in pretty good shape. Just want to warn other potential buyers out there. This only appears to be a Season 2 issue.
B001M6KTLG|2.0|I was very disappointed in this movie.  It felt like it was trying too hard to prove it was a \\"real\\" Indianna Jones movie:  Scene with lots of bugs?  check;  Scene with lots of restless natives?  check;  obligatory car chase scene?  check.  It includes all the standard stuff that makes up Indiana Jones movies, but without any of the heart.  Harrsion Ford's voice was not up to the task, as only occasionally did it sound like the old Indy that we all loved. As someone who bought all the previous movies, I am glad I decided to rent this one, I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I totally love this Box set! I am a huge fan of Friends, and have always wanted the whole series, but never wanted to buy the seasons. When I saw this I had to have it. I got this as a gift, and fell in love with it as soon as I opened it. I believe the way it is put together is wonderful. The way they have 6 little sets with each Friend's face, and a set of DVD's in each one, that each disc has that same Friend's face on it, is just lovely. I love the giant book that comes with it.<br />I have read reviews where they talk about the cardboard that is holding the disc and how it scratches them when removing a disc. This is so not true, for me at least! If you jerk the disc out, then yes they will be scratched. However, if you slighty pull up on the disc and slowly remove them, then they are fine. I have removed all disc, and not scratched a one yet.<br />I think this is a must have for anyone wanting the whole series!

B001O6W9QC|2.0|I had high hopes after seeing movie critics praise this film.  I found it mildy amusing at times, but most of the humor fell flat.  It was a chore for me to watch the whole movie, I would recommend staying away from this film.
1881273156|4.0|This insightful, enjoyable book offers a wonderful framework for observing and experiencing  relationships; and not just romantic ones (although the focus of the book is on the dynamics of marriage). While I was reading, I often found myself thinking about the 'love language' of my mother, brother, and friends and wondering if there were ways that I could express my love that would be more meaningful to them. One aspect of the book that I found particularly inspiring was when Dr. Chapman talked about the importance of listening; letting go of your opinions and agendas and just hearing where the other person is coming from- from their point of view.    Another great book that expands on the idea of listening is: [[ASIN:0071601104 How to Create a Magical Relationship: The 3 Simple Ideas that Will Instantaneously Transform Your Love Life]] by Ariel and Shya Kane. In this book (and in the approach they teach in their workshops, podcasts and internet radio show) the Kanes talk about how true listening not only fosters intimacy and connection with your loved ones, it also pulls you into the current moment of now, which is the key to satisfaction and well-being. If you want to experience new depths of connection in your relationships, I highly recommend both of these books!
0792844890|2.0|That is weird when you remember something as being funny, but when you see it again, it really isn't.  I watched this with my kids, eek!  We have enjoyed other spoof movies, Airplane, Scary Movie..., and this one was the worst I think we have seen.  Plus, now it looks so dated.  I am disappointed that this is the best they could come up with for Star Wars spoof.  Doesn't make me want to watch more of Mel Brooks, maybe I'll let the kids give Monty Python a try.<br />I almost bought this out of nostalgia, glad I rented first.
0689865384|4.0|From a teenage reader: I think that Uglies is a very good book.  Though it did start out a little slow, but it soon picked up.  I love how the book ends and I am now reading the second one.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|The films churned out by the creative team of Disney and Pixar are so routinely excellent, that we're starting to expect greatness from everything they do.  It's going to come as quite a shock when they finally come up with a dud.  At the rate they're going, that may never happen.<br /><br />Their latest achievement is Wall-E, an innovative and largely entertaining gem from director Andrew Stanton.  The plot is simple.  In the future, a trash collecting robot called Wall-E spends his days, with a cockroack as his only companion, diligently woking at his primary task of cleaning up the mountains of garbage left behind by the human race who are now circling the galaxy looking for a new planet to colonize.  Wall-E's life is simple but lonely until he meets Eve, a probe droid sent to earth to search for plant life.  Our hero falls for Eve and whe she returns to her ship, he follows determinedly after her.<br /><br />The film has won critical praise for both its storytelling and its artistic ambitiousness.  It is a love story, a revisionist form of silent films (at least for the first 20 to 30 minutes) a satire pointed directly at our consumer culture as well as a cautionary tale about the potential results of our resource depleting lifestyle.  The movie also incorporates live action into the mix and doesn't rely on any big name celebrities to provide the voice talent.<br /><br />Yet I don't quite see Wall-E as the work of staggering genius that some claim it is.  The satire and political commentary aren't as subtle and clever as the movie's creators think they are and the movie seems to lose a little bit of steam when it shifts its focus from the love story between the two robots to the efforts of the humans to rise up against their sedentary lifestyle and the machines that are trying to keep them that way.  Still, there's no denying the magic and charm of this film and ambition is never a bad thing.

B001BPJJ9G|4.0|Just saw the DVD of \\"The Fall\\" and wish I'd seen it on the big screen. I found it surprisingly original with amazing cinematography; remarkable performances and vision. Some critics have dismissed it as eye candy. I disagree. While there is an element of Bollywood-ism, the imagery resonates at many levels. For lyric and daring I give it at least 80% ... and inclined to more. I expect it will reach global audiences, whatever its reception over canapes and punditry at NY and LA screening parties.
B00005R8GU|5.0|If you were to pick one release that perfectly blended great blues with rock, then \\"Fathers And Sons\\" would be that album. And now that 16-track 1969 double LP set is further supplemented on this 2001 single CD reissue with 4 genuinely great bonuses (all from the same sessions). It's like being handed a virtual master class in blues-rock - truly blistering stuff.<br /><br />Here's a detailed breakdown (77:38 minutes):<br />CD tracks 1 to 10 (studio recordings) and 15 to 20 (live recordings) make up the \\"Fathers And Sons\\" album issued August 1969 on Chess LPS-127 in the USA and issued October 1969 on Chess CRL 4556 in the UK (both 2LP vinyl sets).<br /><br />CD tracks 11 to 14 are previously unreleased studio tracks (14 being unreleased in the USA on album, it's Chess 7\\" single 2085).<br /><br />The studio tracks (1 to 14) were recorded 21, 22 and 23 April 1969 in Chicago, Illinois, while the live tracks were recorded on 24 April 1969 (with the same band) at the \\"Super Cosmic Joy-Scout Jamboree\\" also in Chicago, Illinois.<br /><br />The band for the sessions were:<br />MUDDY WATERS - Vocals and Guitar<br />OTIS SPANN - Piano<br />MIKE BLOOMFIELD - Guitar<br />PAUL BUTTERFIELD - Harmonica<br />DONALD \\"DUCK\\" DUNN - Bass<br />SAM LAY - Drums<br /><br />Guests were:<br />PHIL UPCHURCH - Bass on \\"All Aboard\\" only<br />JEFF CARP - Chromatic Harmonica on \\"All Aboard\\" only<br />PAUL ASBELL - Rhythm Guitar on \\"Walking Thru The Park\\", \\"Forty Days & Forty Nights\\" and \\"Sugar Sweet\\" only<br />BUDDY MILES - Drums on \\"Got My Mojo Working, Part Two\\" only<br /><br />Digitally remastered by ERICK LABSON of Universal, the sound quality is typically fantastic (he has over 800 mastering credits to his name), the 12-page booklet informative with the contributors pictured and the artwork faithful to the original. Highlights would include Muddy's mournful yet fun cover of Eddie Boyd's \\"Twenty Four Hours\\" (title of this review is its lyrics), the live version of Willie Dixon's sex song \\"The Same Thing\\" and in your face rocking of \\"Blow Wind Blow\\".

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Gran Torino is Eastwood's first film as star and director since Million Dollar Baby. This is a classic, old-fashioned movie with a broad appeal. Eastwood plays a familiar role as a curmudgeonly Korean War vet, Walt, whose wife has just died. He is estranged from his sons and their families who feel they can never do anything right. Walt lives in a neighborhood that has declined in value and is beset by Hmong and Latino gangs.<br /><br />Walt is a straightforward man who is also glaringly racist. He is haunted by memories of his brutal years as a soldier and ruled by his warrior code. When his neighbors are attacked by a gang attempting to recruit their teenage son by force, Walt emerges from his home with a rifle to expel his neighbors and the hoodlums from his lawn. The next day he find his porch filled with food, flowers and other gifts from his Hmong neighbors who view him as a hero for fighting off the gang. At first Walt rejects these attentions but with the help of a sharp and spunky Hmong-American girl, Sue, he begins to open up and appreciate his community. He takes a neighbor boy under his wing, teaching him what he knows about being a man. Ultimately Walt has to figure out how to combat the Hmong gangs which continue to threaten his new friends.<br /><br />Eastwood has delivered a movie full of heart and hope. It provides a view into Hmong culture, one that most Americans have little or no exposure to. The protectiveness that this character develops for his neighbors is touching. Eastwood delivers his usual top-notch performance as actor, portraying a battle-scarred warrior who still can take care of business despite his stoop and floppy seated old-man pants. His direction is very good but a few scenes are too long and some not long enough. The fault lies with the script which has many excellent elements but some underdeveloped sections, as well as some stock characters such as his weak and greedy sons and their snotty children. The script could have benefitted from a little more tweaking to the psychological development of the story. The Hmong actors stick closely to an accurate portrayal of their cultural psychology and therefore lack American fluidity. To my mind this lends verisimilitude to the film creating an appealing portrayal of cultural encounters and clashes.<br /><br />Gran Torino is a solid, old-fashioned movie with a non-preachy redemption motif that delivers laughs, satisfaction and tears as well as portraying the darker realms of humanity's propensity for brutality.ttle more tweaking to the psychological development of the story.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Wow this is amazing music. This album has a warmer feel than very recent albums (Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief) and is very creative with a tight sound. It is certainly different than any other album by Radiohead. I am a huge fan of earlier works such as The Bends, OK Computer, and Kid A. I had especially felt like OK computer was unmatched in terms of beautiful sound and originality. In Rainbows has easily matched this rare quality and has renewed my excitement in Radiohead.   Please disregard reviews that give a poor rating due to reasons like: \\"its slower music than I like\\", \\"my cd was scratched\\", \\"this is not the same Radiohead I remember\\", or \\"I'm giving up on Radiohead because this isn't 'OK Computer v2.0'\\". Those reviews mean nothing to the intuitiveness and quality of Radiohead and this production. Certainly if all you want in Radiohead is OK Computer, then you should not buy this.  Some albums you initially love then a month later you could care less about it. Some, you may not even make it through the first time, but it slowly grows on you to a point where you can't get enough. In Rainbows is the best of both worlds... I liked it at first listen and the more I've listened to it over the last year, the more I love it and appreciate the amazing and ingenious sound.     Its outstanding and so far holds the #1 spot on my personal list for recent times.

B000005JA8|5.0|its the only beefheart album i can still stand to listen to. dont get me wrong i likes my zig zag wandra n' sun zoom spok n' all but as a record trout mask is the only one that still interests me. Both musically and lyrically, its interesting stuff. this one is all prickly though, there is no sweet gem inside to discover when you keep listening. You just get used to don van vliet's swirling, jagged, compositions and absurd lyrics delivered in typical howling wolf fashion. In effect the album alters the range of your musical aesthetic to include naive musical trash but its fascinatingly original, creative, music and although it sometimes veers from the beaten path without regard to conventional music theory it adheres to its own skewed yet consistent structure. A fascinating misfire and a worthwhile experiment and one of my favorite polarizing artists/records.

Well, other than everyone at Fairfield High School on the outskirts of Chicago.<br /><br />Northsider Brittany Ellis has everything any teenager wants: popularity, money, and good looks. On the surface, her life is wonderful, but her perfect persona is just a cover-up for her troubled home life.<br /><br />Southsider Alex Fuentes has a bad-boy reputation, but all he wants is to get out of his gang and graduate.<br /><br />When they are thrown together as chemistry partners, life starts to make more sense. Written from both Brittany and Alex's perspective, this story shows what's going on below the surface for each person as they break through stereotypes and expectations that threaten to keep them apart.<br /><br />This is like a modernized Shakespeare story, and after reading hundreds of books with plots similar to Romeo and Juliet, some stories start to blur into each other. PERFECT CHEMISTRY is not one of those books. It was addicting and the story was vibrant. The characters came to life and it was like I was there watching the story unfold.<br /><br />The way Simone Elkeles wrote the story was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Emily Ann

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|October 29, 2009 -- I am editing a review that I left several months ago.  I still LOVE this CD and have decided to make it my signature gift for this holiday season. If you are looking for holiday gift ideas and want to give a reasonably priced christmas gift that will be thoroughly enjoyed, then this is it!  I have even thought that it would make a good Hanukkah gift idea even though it does contain songs such as O Come, O Come Emmanuel and The Spirit of Christmas Past. I think the cd is so good in its entirety that I am overlooking this and feel that even my friends who are celebrating Hanukkah would enjoy it. Since my post, this cd has won many awards including one for the beauty of its cover art. I have found it difficult to get my hands on and Amazon is even limiting sales to 3 cd's. Don't know why. If you can get your hands on it, buy it, wrap it up all pretty and give it to everyone you know!    Early 2009 - I received this cd as a birthday present on January 1, 2009 and I wish I had  gotten it before Christmas!  It is the perfect Christmas cd but it is also much more than that.  I could see myself enjoying this all year round.  My favorite song is My! My! Time Flies.  A great song!

B00005ONMJ|3.0|This historic film, remastered with adequate sound, has many things going for it, including first rate voices, a fine set, and an excellent orchestra.  (Furtwangler drags the tempo on occasion, but that's a matter of taste.)  Visually, the opera is a disaster.  Indeed, it's laughable.  The acting is on the high school level, the staging is terrible, and the camera work is of the silent era.  Moreover, the costuming does little to flatter the often hefty and physically unattractive singers. (Leporello looks like an insurance salesman; Zerlina....well, let's be kind and say nothing.) For history, this 1955 production is of interest.  Hearing it is a joy.  Watching it is another matter.

B001CTA1S4|3.0|John Patrick Shanley's play [[ASIN:1559363479 Doubt: a Parable]] won several prizes in 2005 for being one of the most subtle and thought-provoking plays of recent years.  This movie, adapted and directed by Shanley himself, will likely be remembered as one of the chief exemplars of why it's risky to adapt a play for the big screen.<br /><br />\\"Doubt\\" turns on two nuns and a priest teaching at a Manhattan Catholic school in 1964.  One old nun carries baggage she never reveals, while her very young prot&eacute;g&eacute; has not yet become wise to life's subtle cues.  When the old nun suspects the priest of an inappropriate relationship with a young boy, her silent burden spurs her to rash action.<br /><br />It's a tale that admits no easy answers.  Is the priest guilty, or is the old nun harrying an innocent man from his pulpit?  Is the young nun's innocence her weakness, or the one trait tying her to God?  This beautiful ambiguity won a Tony, a Pulitzer, and five Drama Desk Awards, all considered well earned.<br /><br />The original play has been translated whole.  The characters, scenes, and most of the dialogue have been transported intact.  Yet somehow, the play, which moved so many people so deeply in the intimate confines of the theatre, seems too small for the screen.<br /><br />It's nothing against any of the creative team or the performers.  The visual design manages to capture a perfectly weather-beaten texture reflecting the quiet desperation of the characters.  And the cast, who would probably have been perfect for a proscenium stage, acquit themselves well in their roles, all of them appearing to eat themselves from within as they engage their conflicts.<br /><br />But the play is about personal interactions, mostly in groups of two, mostly in offices, prayer gardens, and other confined spaces.  The camera begs for more expanse than the situations permit, and the movie makes up the difference by having the characters walking, moving, shifting, and engaging in other actions which don't support the scenes.<br /><br />And the camera demands a richer, more populous world than the stage permits.  Numerous characters who linger offstage in the play suddenly walk into events and demand to be treated as part of the ensemble.  When other nuns and school staff barge in, that's one thing.  But the play maintained tension by keeping the boys around whom the controversy turns out of sight.  Now we see them interact with the principal characters, and it diffuses the energy.<br /><br />Besides that, some symbols added for the cinema serve no purpose.  Notably, the weather keeps cropping in, particularly oncoming or present storms.  This implies that a massive confrontation is approaching, though the ultimate conflict is finally too small to justify the symbols.<br /><br />This movie will be handy for people who live too far from a major theatre mecca to see the original play.  And it preserves at least part of the playwright's vision for posterity.  But it feels like a strained translation from a small, intimate medium into another medium which wants something bigger.  Like any number of adaptations before.And the camera demands a richer, more populous world than the stage permits.

159448385X|2.0|My first read of this author-    The storyline here seems rather uninspired. A pretty classic love story, an abusive husband, resentment growing in to appreciation. Nothing new here and nothing emotionally touching.     All this could have been redeemed had it told something significant about the Afghan people or culture. Instead it merely showed that the Taliban is cruel and oppressive (gasp!)and that men can be abusive husbands.     A pretty well written story but I didn't come away with much at the end.
1932100660|5.0|Truly amazing that so much can be gained by means that seem so simple and inexpensive, yet truths continue to be distorted...no, flat out hidden from the public and sacrificing our health for financial gain. Incredibly upsetting that we lose so many loved ones due to something we've been taught to expect and accept as inevitable(heart disease & cancer)when all the while these things are for the most part easily controllable. The principles in this book should be taught early on in grade school instead of the system of \\"American Excess\\" which we currently subscribe to!!!!
B000026258|5.0|Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians is a fantastically gorgeous work of art. If you found Steve Reich via Eno, note that this is a bit less \\"ambient\\" than much of Brian Eno's work. The hour-long song flows together seamlessly as Reich weaves layers of instrumentation through your ears. However, the music is never repetitive enough to be hypnotic; throughout, the music changes subtly, in very fascinating ways, so that you could probably focus on it for the whole hour and still be interested. If you enjoy this album, I might also recommend Max Richter, whom I believe was a student of Reich.

031606792X|3.0|Spoiler Alert<br /><br />Why I loved it...<br />The emotional rollar coaster was a wicked trip. Bella and Edward come full circle with an expected hopeful turn of events that we all waited for. Action packed scenes that should translate very interestingly to screen. Finally a page turner with just a few speed bumps. Compared to the rest of the series, saddly, this one was the best.<br /><br />Why I hated it....<br />Too many unanswered questions.<br />As much as it was refreshing to read a different point of view (Jacob Black's), it as extremely annoying to read through these heart breaking emotions and then end the story so slighted. I feel ripped off of this character. I can only hope if it becames a movie the screen play writer ammends the mistake.<br /><br />Why do vampires get a happy ending? As much as I loved that these characters found their justice of being togteher, it just doesn't seem appropriate to gives these two a happy ending. I really expected ending this series in tears with a nice glass of wine and a tissue box.

0765318741|2.0|Book is much better than the movie, but the ending sucks. The solitude of the main character was interesting, especially for the decade this was written. But it falls short on a lot of explaination. There were a lot of opportunities to really explore the psychological aspects of an isolated man left dangling.<br /><br />The short stories (most of which were featured on the twilight zone) inserted at the back of the book by the publishing company were a lot more enjoyable than the main story. Save yourself a headache, rent the movie, or wait for it on cable.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This was my first blu-ray and it certainly started off my new PS3 with a bang!  The High Definition quality is outstanding and it really proved to me the power of my HD-TV. As for the Disk as a Blu-ray its awesome.<br /><br />The movie by itself is groundbreaking for the Batman series.  This reboot really saved the falling franchise after Schumacher.  The combination of David Goyer and Chris Nolan writing the film really serves the most justice.  The story is so original and fresh compared to the previous films.  The acting comes at a close second.  The all-star cast really pulls through and delivers real mortal lives.  Christian Bale is a fantastic Batman and Michael Caine makes an even better Alfred.  Our villains are well rounded but I wanted to see more of Scarecrow.  I thought the idea was great to have him in this film and I was kinda longing for more.  However, the film is a blast and any normal human being should find some enjoyment out of it.<br /><br />The special features are pretty interesting.  The behind the scenes clips are fun, and the In-movie commentary is cool enough.  Pretty much has your basic special features.<br /><br />If you own a Blu-ray player you gotta pick up this flick.  No collection will be complete without it.
B001O5114O|4.0|I saw Appaloosa in the theaters, and enjoyed it a lot. Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen and Renee Zellweger were all great as usual, and the unconvential triangle that forms among them is interesting and compelling.    Unfortunately, I felt that Jeremy Irons didn't come across as a bad enough villian, which is odd, because he has played really great evil villians in the past. I felt a stronger villian would have strengthened the film.    The main issue I have with this movie is that it was begging for a grand musical score, as one has grown to expect from the Western genre. I realize that they had a budget to work with, but I would rather have heard a lone harmonica playing old traditional western melodies (in public domain), accompanied occasionally by a synthesizer, than the score that they ended up using, which sounded like an afterthought.    I felt that with a bit more work, this film could have been coaxed into the realm of greatness. Instead, it is a good movie, entertaining and very watchable, but not at the head of the pack.
B0012GMYUU|5.0|Unbelievable! The tracks on this album read like a primer of how a guitar god can remake himself & not be left behind in the scrabble of \\"stuff\\" that's discarded by (pop music) society!<br />I'm not even a guitar afficianado, ( I prefer a great keyboard player , usually) but a friend recommended this Cd & I was AMAZED!<br />Every track is special; it is aggressive; it is \\"grab you by the throat & shake you hard\\" aggressive. At the right volume, I could easily picture the paint on my walls shattering to the floor! Yet every track is ALSO well thought out, and extremely well performed.<br />This is terrific stuff! Buy it if you are into extraordinary guitar work!
0316035904|1.0|I don't read a lot. But when I find an author that I like, I anxiously await every new work. (So, Lawrence Block, when are you going to write another Bernie Rhodenbarr mystery?) David Sedaris has been one of my favorites ever since I heard him on NPR many years ago. I have read every one of his books, and so when we went to San Lucia and didn't have a television and the only radio station was broadcasting in Spanish from Venezuela, our only entertainment was listening each night to a half hour of \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" on a rudimentary tape player.<br />So I was very pleased when my daughter gave me Sedaris' new book Holidays on Ice for a Chanukah present. However I was put off by the statement just beneath the title on the cover: \\"with six new stories, including one never before published.\\" Doesn't this imply that five \\"new\\" stories have been published? Then what is the meaning of new? I'll leave this problem for English majors to solve.<br />The first story \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" was in the old Sedaris mold - delightful, insightful, and funny. But starting with the next tale, the author leaves his world of possible reality and enters the fictional world. Not a wise move judging from the results.<br />\\"Season's Greetings to our Friends and Family!!!\\" is a takeoff of the infamous end-of-the-year letters that some families type up and send out to family members and anyone else they know. It had its moments, but the depressing ending was not among them.<br />\\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" was a mean-spirited take on children's Christmas shows. Unfortunately it was not saved by any humor whatsoever.<br />\\"Based on a True Story\\" is so unbelievable and unfunny that I quit reading it after a couple of pages.<br />I plodded through \\"Christmas Means Giving\\" even though my previous comments could apply to this sordid tale.<br />I haven't read the rest yet, since I wanted to write down these comments while Sedaris' stories were fresh in my head. I hope that in the future, the very talented and very funny David Sedaris will revert to his embellished but true-sounding stories that only he can tell.very funny David Sedaris will revert to his embellished but true-sounding stories that only he can tell.
B000YXMMAE|1.0|I was anticipating this release from Radiohead, and maybe I expected too much. (except for the first two tunes which I don't particularly enjoy) This is insipid drivel. VERY disappointing.
031606792X|1.0|This book is only slightly better than the 2 before it, in that something finally happens in it. Bella Swan and Edward Cullen have to be the 2 worst characters ever written. Immortality??--if I was as bored and boring as Bella, I'd be begging for the sweet relief of death. And spending an eternity with Edward--kill me now! Neither of them has anything to offer the other or the reader in terms of being interesting. There's been a lot of criticism of Stephenie Meyer about her writing of these books, but I have to say she was very smart in writing them to the teenage girl audience in the voice of a teen girl that many can probably relate to. To a 14 year old, a totally understanding guy who is great looking and takes care of you is what they think a relationship is all about.  So I guess you don't have to impress the youth audience with characters with more to them than just good looks. 15 years ago I read Interview with the Vampire and enjoyed it much more, and I can see that Meyer may have \\"borrowed\\" ideas from Anne Rice. She just didn't do it as well.
B001CRGSGK|4.0|I've written some responses elsewhere about my feelings about this album. Basically I think the music is 95/100, after listening to it about 10 times I think it will be one of my favorite Metallica albums.<br />That said, I can't ignore the bad sound. I know there is a lot of argument about this since, let's face it, \\"bad sound\\" is a very subjective judgement. So I decided to present some of my measurements of three different versions of one of the songs (just to simplify things) just as a point of departure in order to show that the problems with this release are not just peoples' personal biases.<br />Unfortunately, I don't have the actual CD to measure, for which I apologize. However, I do have the 256kbps MP3 which I bought from Amazon.<br />A quick note about that. The 256kbps mp3 is a pretty good representation of the original file. As a experiment, I took track 6 of ..and justice for all which I do have the CD of, and ripped a WAV file and created the 256kbps MP3. I then used Ableton Live to import both files, invert the phase of the MP3, mix them together, and export the result. The RMS value is a measure of the average energy of a track, and for a normalized track is an indication of its dynamic range. The higher the number, the more energy in the whole track. This isn't a perfect measure but it's a good thumbnail.) I also have ReplayGain values and have looked at waveforms. I used Sony Media Software Sound Forge v8 for all measurements, and Ableton Live 7 to do the MP3 vs WAV experiment.<br />The WAV file had an RMS value of -16.5/-16.9 dB (L/R), the MP3 -16.6/-17.0 dB and the difference file was -44.667/-44.761 dB and sounded like just a bunch of the high frequency info from the original (as you would expect). Looking at the waveforms in the editor confirmed that the shapes were as you would expect as well.<br />So here are the comparisons of the three released versions of The end of the line (all values L/R channel)<br /><br />1. 256kbps mp3 purchased from Amazon<br />Minimum sample value (dB) -0.000/-0.195<br />Maximum sample value (dB) -0.000/-0.454<br />RMS level (dB)  -9.612/10.808<br /><br />2.

Version exported from Guitar Hero 3, converted to 44.1kHz from 48kHz, normalized to -0.5 dbFS<br />Minimum sample value (dB)-0.500/-0.563<br />Maximum sample value (dB)-0.744/-0.868<br />RMS level (dB)  -17.304/-18.482<br /><br />In (1) and (2) you can easily see clipped waveforms throughout this and most of the other loud parts of the album. I have plenty of screen shots of comparisons of all three formats. The GH3 formats do not show the square wave distortion. This is different from the intentional distortion from the amplifiers that occurs before the sound hits the microphones.<br /><br />This last RMS number basically says it all. And listening, to me confirms it: the GH3 version sounds infinitely better than the LP or MP3 (and presumably) CD version. The LP version is slightly easier to listen to, but that may be because it's not possible to reproduce a square wave via a mechanical stylus whereas you theoretically can via a laser pickup.<br /><br />It's a pity, but apparently, the Metallica management and most of their fans either don't care or think the album sounds fine or even good.<br /><br />I know that I am oversimplifying a lot of technical issues here, but I hope the gist is accurate enough for what I'm trying to convey. The whole point is to try to assign some actual objective data to this discussion.value (dB) -0.000/-0.195                Maximum sample value (dB) -0.000/-0.454                RMS level (dB)            -9.612/10.808                              2.

B000I543T6|5.0|Trying to find fault here is like looking for dust under your Rolls Royce. THIS MOVIE LASTS FOREVER. It's that damn good. You don't have to love it or like it but you DO HAVE TO SEE IT.
B000FUF6QS|5.0|This is easily the best movie to come out of Scotland, although it is a bit strange and also disturbing at times, it is also charming with a superb soundtrack.
B000VI6T6K|4.0|There's really no need to say it again.  But I will anyways.  Jimi Hendrix at The Monterey Pop Festival was and still is one of rock and roll's most incredible and legendary performances EVER!  And a debut performance for an American audience at that!  You can like any guitarist you wish, that's all fine and dandy, but NO ONE is Jimi (and yes, that includes Mr. Eric Clapton).  What we have here is the 40th anniversary reissue of that performance on CD, after years of it being M.I.A. from the Hendrix catalog.  There's no doubt that this reissue is practically all pros but, believe it or not, there are also a few cons.  As a matter of fact, I found this new reissue a tad disapointing in comparison to the original 1986 release \\"Jimi Plays Monterey\\" on Reprise Records.      First off the pros of the set; all of the minor edits that were made for the original release to fit on cassette, CD, and LP have been reinstated letting you hear EVERY bit of stage patter that Jimi said inbetween songs.  Every brief tune up and even moments of almost complete silence can be heard now too, making for some groovy feeling anticipation between each song.  You even get to finally hear the announcer that introduced Brian Jones to the stage so Brian could then introduce Jimi!  These are all nice little additions, but they don't cover up for the cons of this release.    Personally, I'm not that happy with this mix compared to the original.  Jimi's lead vocals are pushed to the fore while some of his most blistering guitar leads are pushed back in the mix.  The volume levels seem to rise and fall with every track and some of the song intros have been weakened in this new mix, especially on \\"Killing Floor.\\"  On the original 1986 issue of \\"Jimi Plays Monterey,\\" Jimi's fast strummed introduction to \\"Killing Floor\\" came ripping through the speakers like a runaway locomotive!  It still does on this reissue, but with a \\"squashed\\" and \\"lessened\\" quality to it.  That really disapointed me when I heard it!  The recording now seems smothered in noise reduction (my first time ever complaining about such a thing).  The overall feeling of you the listener actually being in the audience seems lost in this new mix.  There is no \\"air\\" or \\"space\\" around what you're hearing as there was with the original release.      And then there is the AUDIBLE tape damage you now have to deal with, especially during the freak-out ending to \\"Wild Thing,\\" the most important part of the entire concert.  It occurs not once but TWICE during the ending.  This incredible coda also does not attack through the speakers as it used to.  Mitch Mitchell's drumming is pushed forward as Jimi's insane feedback is actually pulled back!  WHY?!  Is this due to the fact that while mixing and creating the '86 release, killer analog equipment was utilized and NOW we supposedly have better stuff to mix these old recordings in the all digital age?!  Well, the results speak for themselves.  This reissue get four stars for being VERY GOOD when it could have had five with a better mix.  If you own a record player, by all means seek out a mint copy of \\"Jimi Plays Monterey\\" on vinyl and get this one for your CD collection.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I seen her on SNL and loved her voice.  The CD is really good so nice to be able to find a singer that doesn't sing like everyone else.  You won't be disappointed with this CD.
B00004VVN9|3.0|I've loved this movie since it came out (yes, I'm an ancient person who saw it in the theater).      However, I just got this DVD and it appears they screwed up the transfer.  The film is _supposed_ to be a 2.35 format movie but was transferred for a 1.85 academy projection.  So all of the scenes that were shot with 65mm show up cropped, all of those shot on 35mm are full frame.  Very annoying and a waste of space that could have been used for a higher bitrate compression.    Granted, this is one of those early DVD transfers that has \\"widescreen\\" on one side and \\"standard\\" on the other.  Even for $10, I'd pass on this and wait for this movie to be retransferred correctly on Blu-Ray or some future format.
0765348780|5.0|I just finished Gardens of the Moon, and I was astonished by how much I enjoyed it.  The positive points, as I see them, are the following:    1) It's not a quest novel.  No character starts as a lowly [insert profession] in his/her hometown, then sets out on a journey in which he/she discovers hidden talents and depths to his/her soul/mind/whatever.  Not that I dislike those, but there are too many of them.    2) Erikson doesn't spend too much time dwelling on how the magic system works.  It's a Warren.  It opens.  Stuff happens.  There's a bit more about the system than this, but it's very well integrated into the story.    3) The gods aren't all-powerful, and they are competing with each other for god-space and power.  Thus, we have motivation and limits wrapped up in one convenient bit.  Again, not too much brooding on this one.    4) Erikson starts us off with very little information, and grows it throughout the book.  This is how an individual experiences the world, and I find it very refreshing.  There's no omnipotent mage who tells the main character important background info and interprets world events for us through the lens of 800 years' experience.  This leaves the reader with plenty of questions that are gradually answered throughout the book.    5) Goes along with #4.  It is hard to tell who to root for as the book develops, because many individuals have apparently conflicting goals.  Also, there is no main character who supports/is supported by 'The Light'.  Darkness, Shadow and Chance dominate this book; not surprising since it's a book about war.  Fluffy bunnies, cotton candy and kisses don't exactly permeate battlefields.      Basically, this is an intelligent person's fantasy novel.  In order to really enjoy it, you have to enjoy puzzles and surprises, and realize that confusion is simply your mind trying to figure things out.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Ten people wind up stranded at a desert motel during a thunderstorm. All is well until someone starts killing them one by one. IDENTITY is a movie w/ loads of secrets and twisty surprises. The action grows increasingly odd and ultimately turns completely illogical. In the end, we find that this is necessary to the story. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet play the central characters. The rest of the cast is equally awesome, w/ Rebecca DeMornay (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle), Clea Duval (How To Make A Monster), Alfred Molina (Species), and Jake Busey (The Frighteners, Starship Troopers) among them! There's a cop, a convict, a chauffeur, a has-been movie star, a hooker, a family, a young couple, and Larry, the jittery desk-clerk. None of these people are who or what they appear to be. Many secrets will be revealed. Many will die. This all culminates in a mindf'ing final twist that will pry your jaw open! Highly recommended...
0812977203|5.0|REVIEW: Dame Agatha's career as a writer began with a prompt from her mother and a dare from her sister. While the twenty-year-old was recovering from influenza: Christie's mother suggested she try writing a story to pass the time. As a result of her encouragement the future authoress began churning out short stories; and an attempt at a long, involved (and supposedly horrid) romantic novel called \\"SNOW UPON THE DESERT\\" which was rejected as \\"unpublishable\\" (and which has never seen the light of day in print as it is now lost for good). With some constructive criticism from author Eden Phillpotts: Christie continued to hone her craft. But it was a long-recalled dare from her sister one day in 1908 (in which she teased Agatha by declaring, \\"I bet you can't write a mystery in which the reader can't guess the murderer.\\") that sealed her fate as the soon-to-be crowned \\"Queen Of Crime\\". And so in 1915 she began to work on what was to become her debut novel \\"THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES\\". And even though it took nearly five years for it to be published: without a doubt Christie won that bet. \\"STYLES\\" is the first in a long line of masterpieces from her pen, and the first to feature one of the greatest fictional detectives of all time: Hercule Poirot (prounounced Pwah-row). The story itself centers upon the Ingelthorpe/Cavendish family, and the various sinister undercurrents which culminates in the poisoning murder of its matriarch. Luckily, M. Poirot is situated in a nearby village as a refugee from the the war. He sifts through the mounting evidence and motives, hones in on the truth about the tragedy at Styles, and prevents an innocent man from being hanged.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This is one of, if not the best movie of 2008. A great love story that's touching and funny. The movie looks absolutely beautiful on Blu ray and sounds incredible. Not just for kids. In fact, adults will get more out of this movie in my opinion. Just great!
B000003C2U|5.0|I've always loved this album, ever since the sound hit my ear drums, but what I've always hated, was the mixing. I know they could have done better, and in my opinion this should DEFINITELY get remastered. I'm no audiophile, but you don't need to be one to hear those bad mixes.
0316096199|5.0|Received my order timely and the book was in excellent condition.  Exactly what was ordered.
0061139378|4.0|All of my friends said \\"Do not read this book. It's really scary.\\" Naturally, when someone says that it makes you want to read the book even more, so I read it. It was a fairly easy read, and interesting as well. I didn't think it was scary at all though. I would definitely not call it horror, it was a fantasy book. The story line was entertaining and action packed. The characters were very well thought up and the descriptions of them precise. The end was wrapped up very nicely, and I think even a hint of comedy shone through. Absolutely a great book. Even if you do think it is scary, it is not gory. I reccomend it for anybody wanting a change from normal fantasy books.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Hatari! is an outstanding John Wayne movie.  Set in Tanganyika, now known as Tanzania in east Africa, Sean Mercer (John Wayne) stars as part of a team of big game hunter who capture animals for shipment to zoos around the world.  But the fun of the movie is the arrival of Dallas,( Elisa Martinelli) a photographer from the Baliz Zoo sent to photograph the capture of the animals only to be a total pain in the butt for John Wayne who really wishes she wasn't there.  This movie is a full of action and a lighthearted comedy to boot as Dallas just seems to be a natural around the animals, particularly baby elephants who just seem to flock to her.    While probably not known to the average movie watcher, Hatari! is famous, not for the movie, but for a well known tune \\"Baby Elephant Walk\\", by Henry Mancini.      The movie is long; over 2 and ½ hours but it is well worth seeing for the scenic beauty of Africa and the fun and humor of the interplay between the cast members, not to mention the baby elephants running through the town in search of \\"Mama\\".  This is a genuine classic movie that can be watched and enjoyed by everyone in the family regardless of age.  You won't regret watching Hatari!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|As an avid Alanis fan since '91, I own each and every one of her albums (the original disc, not digital copies), and I have memorized just about every track she's ever recorded.  LOL (I'm not psychotic I promise) And I can tell you, based on my thorough familiarity with Alanis' recording career, that Flavors of Entanglement is neck-in-neck with Jagged Little Pill.  Until now, she has never been able to re-create that magic she sparked with JLP.  She now is exploring different avenues of synthesizers, drum machines, heavy-bass dance tracks, etc., and she masters it effortlessly.  It's as if the lyrics are like a 'Jagged Little Pill pt. 2' and the music is just a brilliant orchestra of color set to a modern sound.  She opens up on songs like 'Tapes', 'Not As We', and 'Madness', and we come to learn why we love her so much!  It's really a quite magnificent record, and I am so proud of her!  GET IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!  :-)
B00001NTXN|1.0|Inspired by the other reviews of this game, I got it for my 6 and 8 year old. I was sorely disappointed, though. The major problem I have with it is that it really has to be played in multiples of 2--ie, 2 or 4 people. 3 people doesn't work very well at all, because then there's not really an opposite opponent for the 3rd player. I found this very limiting, since it's usually my 2 daughters and I who play games together.     That said, it was easy enough that my 6 year old could play with my 8 year old while I did other stuff, but I was looking for a family game.

1591841992|5.0|The book was not what I expected. I was thinking quick and dirty simple math formulae but what I found was something more robust and comprehensive. The book began with the 5 W's (Who, What, When, Where, Why...) and finished with process flow diagrams and XY charts. Examples of effective, simple, basic shapes are introduced at the beginning. Four steps of visual thinking are presented with examples. The thinking process of Looking vs. Seeing are presented in three separate chapters. These chapters show how to layout the most effective visual diagram tailored for the audience. The SQVID (Simple, Quality, Vision, Individual, Delta) method is presented enlarging the visual content methods.<br />The book is a concise course in data presentation/analysis. The chapters can be read at once or as needed. I suggest scanning the book for familiarization with the contents. Then cherry-pick or smorgasbord what you need, when you need it, for who you need it...<br />If you work in this kind of business situation or are a student with term papers and theses ahead then this book is for you.
B001EOQWEO|2.0|I've tried two copies of this movie from Amazon and both skip/hang multiple times within the first 15 minutes of the movie.  After the first 15 minutes, the movie plays perfectly.  I've had the issue on my PS3 and Gateway laptop.  Oddly enough, it works perfectly on my very old standalone DVD player and Honda Odyssey built-in DVD player.  I don't know what Disney has done, but I've never experienced this with any of their other DVDs.    Update 1/6: I called Disney (1-800-723-4763) and they are aware of some copies of disc 1 (of the 3 disc set) that have the issue I've described.  They are sending me a pre-paid return envelope and will swap me disc 1 for one they guarantee works.  I'll update when I receive and test the replacement copy.    Update 1/31: The replacement disc Disney sent appears to work perfectly.  I've only tested the sections that were bad on the previous disc(s), but all in all it appears this disc doesn't have the same skipping issues.  Disney sent the one-disc version (packaging and all), so it appears the one-disc version didn't have the same issues as the 3 disc version of disc 1.

B0011V9XT6|5.0|I have previewed a number of Blu-Ray music videos lately and I would rank Beyonce Live as one of the tops. The quality of the production is excellent with shots ranging from beautiful close ups of her and great stage shots of her performing troupe.    The video production in Blu-ray brings up how truly beautiful and talented she really is.  You know how good the performer is when you see a live performance.  Beyonce really delivers in this video and makes it look easy.  She dances as good or even better than her backup dancers while delivering excellent vocals. You will be able to witness the energy of her fine,live performance.    If you have a sound system the recording of the music, sounds concert like.  I have an older-tube hd TV running the video at 1080i and the video reproduction remains great.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Without giving anything away about the actual movie, in my opinion, this installment of this franchise is absolutely the best and enters into an entirely new dimension all its own.  It certainly brought back fond memories of wanting to be Batman as a kid and now as an adult, and based on this character's portrayal I felt very much like all of it could be possible.<br /><br />As far as the features go I am extremely impressed with the choice of the director to use different aspect ratios to bring me closer to the movie like being told a story precisely as intended and I wasn't once distracted by the changes at all.  It was all very natural and captivating.<br /><br />What impressed me the most were the two rather new Audio installments of True HD and Audio narrative for those with failed eyesight or blind.  I know that neither of these are brand new, but I feel that for the first time they were executed in a way that the technology was meant to be presented.<br /><br />While listening to the Audio for the sight impaired, I could easily imagine listening to the entire movie, and for a large part I did, emersing myself in the story.  The technology is still something that I believe can be improved upon, as with everything, but I felt it was tasteful and not distractive at all.  Very fluid.
B001ED7C5I|5.0|Tracy Chapman's new CD stands out because of her depth as songwriter, powerful vocal performance & unique sound.  \\"Save Us All\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the CD with its slap-happy rhythm & joyful expression of tolerance, \\"I've heard that your God's older, Buddha, Allah, Krishna, manifest with many faces, worshipped the world over in foreign places; I assume your God must love you.\\"  Chapman revisits the theme about the need for redemption on the hauntingly lovely title track, \\"To our Father, what good may come to let the children walk alone, to fear to fail & need no savior to be at peace in our bright future?\\"  \\"For a Dream\\" also has a spiritually soothing quality.  \\"Thinking of You\\" glides on Dean Parks' pixie-like guitar, \\"You floated on the air, far away at light speed; I guess some objects do defy the laws that we conceive.\\"  \\"Something to See\\" envisions a day when war is a history on a lovely track.  Chapman examines many religious beliefs with a joyful, tender spirit.  From track to track, \\"Our Bright Future\\" is a consistently excellent, a pleasure.  Bravo!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Good Test   Do you believe you are a good person? Have you kept the Ten Commandments? Take this quick test to see if you are. Ready? Have you ever lied, a white lie, half truth, exaggeration etc?  What does this make you?  If I lied to you what would you call me... a liar. Have you ever stolen something regardless of its value?  What does this make you? A thief?   Have you ever used God's name as a cuss word? If you have you have, instead of using a four letter filth word to express disgust you have taken God's name, He that has given you your life, your family everything you hold precious to you and you've used it as a four letter filth word to express disgust. This is called blasphemy, and every idle word a man speaks he will give an account of it on the Day of Judgment. God will not hold him guiltless that takes His name in vain.    Have you ever lusted? Jesus said whosoever has looked upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. Are you guilty? Please listen to your conscience that God has given to you and be honest. You can't tell me that you do not know what is right and wrong.  If I reached into your back pocket and took a twenty dollar bill without your consent, you'd be alright with that? You know the basis of what's right and wrong, listen to your conscience and be honest with yourself.   If I may continue, in knowing that you have answered these questions honestly, then by your own admission you are a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart. And these are only four of the Ten Commandments.  So, if by these standards God judges you on the Day of Judgment do you think you would be innocent or guilty? Do you think you will go to Heaven or Hell?    You may object by saying, \\"Well I don't believe in Heaven or Hell.\\" If I stood on top of a building and just before I jumped I yelled at the top of my lungs \\"I don't believe in gravity,\\" that isn't going to change reality.  You see gravity is a law, and even if I believe that this law doesn't hold true doesn't change the fact that that if I jump it's the merciless pavement that I am going to meet.   If your answer is Hell, then does this concern you? Think of how much you value your eyes. If I were to offer you one-million dollars for one of your eyes, in a painless procedure, would you give it to me? Now if I offered you two-million dollars for both your eyes would you give them to me? How about five million? Ten? Twenty? Thirty-million? No man in his right mind would offer to give up both his eyes for any amount. If so what would you do with your money? See the world? If this is how much you value your eyes then how much more is the value of your soul?    If you think you would go to Heaven, why? Do you believe that God is all loving and good, and therefore will overlook your sins? Try that in a court of law: you are standing in front of a judge; you are guilty of a serious crime like murder. The judge says\\" You are guilty and all the evidence is here what do you have to say for yourself before I pass sentence?\\" And you stand up and say, \\"Yes, judge I just have to say that I believe that you are a good man and therefore will let me go.\\" The judge will probably say something like, \\"You're right about one thing I am a good man. And because of my goodness I am going to see to it that justice is served. Because of my goodness I am going to see to it that you are punished for what you have done.\\" You see God is love, but he is also righteous, holy, just and pure. It is because He is good that by nature he must punish the wicked: liars, thieves, fornicators, etc. \\"Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, or covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortinoners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\\" 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 He demands righteousness even in the inward parts.   So thetruth is, if God gives you justice you are not headed for Heaven you are headed for Hell. The bible describes hell as a literal place of torture Hell is not a term for the grave but a place where God will punish those who have violated His law. This punishment will be conscious and eternal. The bible describes it in several ways:  \\"Shame and everlasting contempt\\" (Dan. 12:2); \\"Weeping and gnashing of teeth\\" (Matt. 24:51); \\"Eternal fire... the blackness of darkness forever\\" (Jude 7, 13); \\"He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone... the smoke of their torment ascended up forever and ever: and they have no rest day or night.\\" (Revelation 14:10, 11)   Do you see your need for God's forgiveness? How you have violated His law and remain under His wrath?  If you do I have got some wonderful news for you, put yourself back in the court room. You are in a civil court this time there are multiple crimes against you. Your fine has been set at $500,000 or life imprisonment. You can't pay your fine and you are being led off to prison when all of a sudden someone you don't even know steps into the court room and walks up to the judge and hands him a check for $500,000. And pays your fine in full. The judge says to you, \\"Wait your fine has just been paid for you. You are free to go. I can't hold you here anymore, leave, you are free to go on the grounds that this man has paid your fine; and his sacrifice is a demonstration for his great love for you.    That's what happened, that's what God did for us 2,000 years ago!  Jesus stepped into the court room and paid our fine when he died on the cross for our sins. The God of the universe humbled Himself, and became a man, and died on the cross for you and for me. The Bible says that, God demonstrated his live for us that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.  Jesus Christ redeemed us from the cures of the law being made a curse for us.  You see your need for God your need to get right with Him, what do you do? Repent and put your faith in Christ. Repentance simply means turn away from your sin and turn toward God. Desire to have nothing to do with sin. Desire to live in obedience to the Lord. Confess and forsake your sin and begin to move toward God with a desire never to go back to sin. You won't be perfect but Jesus is perfect and he died for you and he will give you the power to overcome your sin. When you are born again you put your faith in Jesus Christ. It doesn't just mean intellectually believing that he died on the cross. The demons believe and they tremble, they know that's true. You must put your faith in Jesus. That means to trust Jesus the same way you would put your trust in a parachute if you were jumping out of a plane at twenty-five thousand feet. You know that it's the only thing that's going to save you. If I told you, you were going to jump and there was a parachute under your seat what would you do? You'd put it on. Would it do you any good to just believe in the parachute? No. And that's what the bible says put on the Lord Jesus Christ. How do you do that? Obey the gospel, repent of your sin, and trust Jesus Christ. And you will become a new creation in Christ.    Please place your faith in Jesus as you would a parachute. And entrust your life to Him; he is the only one who will be able to save you from sure death when you jump. Don't delay because you never know what tomorrow will hold- if it ever comes.   Thank you for listening to me and I will be praying for you.  ~M.C.
B00065MDRW|5.0|What can one say about an album like \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\"?  The word \\"classic\\" immediately springs to mind, quickly followed by \\"incredible\\" as well as \\"stunning\\".  I pay absolutely no mind to the few musically illiterate people who have said this album is \\"overrated\\"...what garbage!  This album is a one-of-a-kind & was way ahead of it's time then & even now. Besides King Crimson & possibly their fellow UK counterparts Soft Machine, no one was making music like this in 1969.<br /><br />Opening with the classic \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" with it's crunching guitar riffs, wailing sax & heavily distorted vocals perfectly creating an eerie, paranoiac feel. In sharp contrast is the hauntingly beautiful \\"I Talk To The Wind\\" featuring wistful vocals & gorgeous flutes floating in the background.  Next is \\"Epitaph\\", with its' climactic, sorrowful Mellotron strains & the 12-minute plus \\"Moonchild\\", which starts off nicely but breaks down into a lengthy stretch of weird, random percussion & guitar pieces.  Pink Floyd did a similar thing on \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" from their \\"Ummagumma\\" album released later the same year.<br /><br />I agree with many of the reviewers that the superior musicianship of the original lineup is what made this album what it is: guitarist/mastermind Robert Fripp, bassist/vocalist Greg Lake (who would later join Emerson, Lake & Palmer), keyboardist/flautist Ian MacDonald (who later turned up in Foreigner), drummer Michael Giles, & lyricist Peter Sinfield. Sadly, most of the lineup splintered after the release of this album, with only Greg Lake remaining for the band's 2nd album \\"In The Wake Of Poseidon\\" before he too departed to join Emerson, Lake & Palmer in 1970.<br /><br />I have the 2004 Original Master Edition of this album with 24-bit remastering; the sound quality is absolutely amazing, the best that you'll find with a domestic release.  I've heard that the Japanese reissue sounds even better, but if you're like me, you don't want to shell out over 50 bucks for a CD, even for this.  I do agree however, that if you have the original vinyl LP &/or the 1st CD pressing from 1988, you'd do very well to replace them with this CD edition; you'll be impressed, trust me!don't want to shell out over 50 bucks for a CD, even for this.

B001HBYHFA|1.0|This movie is nowhere near its 4.6 rating.  Acting and dialog were mediocre, character development was lacking.  If you compare it to movies like Mad Max then maybe 3 stars, otherwise if you are not a fan or this series, don't waste your time. It was very disappointing.
1400079179|1.0|Catholic church has denied the ultimate truth and sealed the greatest mystery behind Vatican's doors; the Mary's blood line and cover up of her relationship to Jesus. Gift wrapped in a religious sect chase for Holy Grail and its secrets. Dot by dot clues everywhere waiting to be solved, exotic locations to visit, romance at Paris, mystic Opus Dei religious sect and everybody is on chase or being chased.<br /><br />Rewrite history and you have bestseller that sold million of copies worldwide. The book is fun, but far away from any masterpiece. If the reader knows any history of Europe, the religious dogmas and early ears of Christianity, it will be a little hard to dwell into the writer's world of clues.<br /><br />The historical elements are incoherent and may cause reader to keep distracted about the made conclusions. Brown's historical bricks to build the house stands on rumors (represented as facts), imaginative connections (unreal facts) and bold connections (bloodline) to seal the plot. The religious issues are subjected to pot of hodgepodge where all ingredients, regardless of their real historical backgrounds, are stirred and boiled. It seems well calculated to consider the reader to be unfamiliar with the tenets that the book knots together. Undoubtedly many are exited by the conclusions and conspiracy theories drawn.<br /><br />One (1) star. The idea is interesting, but the prose used in the book reads like a movie transcription (which it did). Characters are cardboard thin because constant \\"on move\\" drive is the leading force. If one is unfamiliar with the history of Europe and Christianity, the reader will get a ride of a lifetime. For those readers this book might be 3 stars.
0061537934|5.0|I have just completed The Art of Driving in the Rain. It was a tearful final few pages, and I don't have a habit of crying. I am British, and the stiff upper lip is quite dominant. But for those final pages, the pages where enzo and denny have their final moments together, for those pages I cried.  This book took me by surprise, I was wandering those BookStar, carrying my dog, when a staff member came right up to me, out of the blue and told me to read it. I am so pleased she did.    Thank you Mr Stein for writing it and thank you Harper for publishing it!
B000000YBQ|3.0|Unfortunately, on this CD and its companion, SUNDAY AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD, the piano is plagued by distortion.I tried to pick out the songs with less distortion for the purpose of making a mix, but I realized I would always be listening for distortion, so I put them away.    It's a pity, because the session took place ten days before Scott LaFaro's death, and the recording of his bass is superb.    If you're willing to overlook the buzzing of the distortion in the piano, buy them both. The musicianship is extraordinary.
B00023B1A8|5.0|I bought this on a whim, after reading some less than favorable reviews here. But I grew up with these guys' music, and felt my concert DVD collection was incomplete without them.    I was pleasantly surprised! I'm really not sure why some reviewers didn't like this concert. This is by no means as mimimalist as implied by some: the choreography is actually quite stunning, and the video quality is more than acceptable. The DVD has Dolby 2 and Dolby 5.1 soundtracks, and both sound great. As for the performance, I thought the guys are in excellent form - the voices and harmonies are very good, and there are some very enlightening instrumental performances by all three gentlemen. Some might argue that the set list is incomplete, but the essentials I wanted are all there. And they play to a very appreciative crowd.    If you like CSN, by all means get this - in my opinion, this is a genuine and faithful rendition of the CSN we knew in back in the day. Recommended without reservation.
B001GQACGO|2.0|There's only two decent songs on this 2 disc project-the rest felt like she thought that just because she was on the track that of course it would sell.  The first disc completely bores me to tears and the second had me tuning out after Single Ladies.  After listening to the CD several times I left with wondering whether Beyonce has already peaked and we're slowly seeing the slide on the other side of the mountain-until she hits the comeback slope of course.  You're better off buying the downloads of If I were a boy and Single Ladies.  The rest is a waste of time and money.
B000002I53|5.0|The same reviews and comments appear on Amazon's listings for different versions of Coltrane's My Favorite Things, so there's some confusion with respect to the real album and a bootleg recording with the same name but of a different recording session. Click the links in here to see what's what.    The \\"original\\" version of this album has on its cover a blue background and a waist-length picture of Coltrane holding a soprano sax. [[ASIN:B000002I53 My Favorite Things, original version link.]] It contains four songs:  1. My Favorite Things  2. Everytime We Say Goodbye  3. Summertime  4. But Not For Me  This is the version to which my five star rating applies.    And there is a \\"deluxe\\" edition of the original album, with a gray cover and a small insert picture of the original album art. [[ASIN:B00000348A My Favorite Things [Deluxe Edition].]] Plus there are import versions of the original album, with the original cover art surrounded by a purple square border. [[ASIN:B0010MTL66 My Favorite Things, import version link.]] All of those contain a total of six songs, including the original four, plus extras My Favorite Things, Pt. 1 and Pt. 2.    The \\"bootleg\\" version people are referring to is presumably the one that has a swirly gray background on its cover art and a close up picture of Coltrane, with the words \\"Fourstar Masters of Jazz\\". [[ASIN:B000S98XZW My Favorite Things, bootleg MP3 link.]] That album contains six songs:  1. My Favorite Things  2. Blue Train  3. Impressions  4. Spiritual  5. Naima  6. Traneing In  That album is currently available only as MP3 download. (It says it is also available in CD format, but if you click that link within the MP3 listing, you get the original CD, not one that corresponds to this bootleg recording.) The sound quality of the bootleg is noticeably inferior to the original album recording. And, of course, the bootleg isn't even the same music.    There is also a \\"legitimate\\" live album called [[ASIN:B000QFAG2Q My Favorite Things:Coltrane at Newport]], which has a cover with a black background and contains six tracks:  1. I Want To Talk About You  2. My Favorite Things  3. Impressions  4. Spoken Introduction  5. One Down, One Up  6. My Favorite Things    Most of these versions are available as both CDs and MP3 downloads, so it's not particularly useful to attempt to distinguish them by CD vs. MP3.
0765348276|4.0|I was a bit skeptical about this book, but it turned out to be a fun vacation read. Scalzi managed to win me over despite the fact that military sci-fi is not my favorite sub-genre. The basic premise of *old* people going to war was great. The main character had real depth and his development is what kept me hooked. Some of the secondary characters and the overall cultural milieu were less compelling. Some other characters felt a bit shallow. Perhaps this is because, as you might expect in a war story, many characters don't last very long. The setting felt a bit contrived at times, as if it were only serving to provide character development for the protagonist. (And that development, as I said, was good... I'm just not sure I fully believe in the military/political structure of the Colonial Defense Force.) The romantic sub-plot was solid and surprising and is what ultimately makes me want to read the sequel.
B00136Q6D0|1.0|I am attempting to like this.  The horrible hiss that fills in between the notes is louder than some of the music.  It reminds me of the low quality of initial compact disks and the flat quality and amplified hiss that came in those initial jewel cases.      This review is for the Amazon mp3 download.
0375826726|1.0|I loved the first two books - couldn't put them down.  This third book I have been forcing myself to read for about three months now, and still there is no end in sight.  It sucks.  What's it about?  Bla bla bla bla bla.  I am 500 pages in, and nearly nothing significant has happened, other then in the first two chapters.  I hate it, but I'll have to finish it, and the upcoming fourth book, just so I can lay them to rest.  I'll probably burn them so no one will find them and torture themselves by reading them.
B001K98MFU|5.0|I got the full japanese version from oversees a couple months ago, it cost 4 times this one's price.  It's the same product though.<br /><br />Before I got it, I had reservations about possible video quality, due to the age of the original production.<br /><br />I was not surprised after popping it in, I was blown out of my chair!  I own about 250 BluRay discs, and about 200 HD-DVD's.  This, believe it or not, is the most impressive, beautiful, and visually stimulating hi-def disc I own, period.<br /><br />I play it back on at 46\\" 1080P using a PS3, using the HDMI interface.<br /><br />Um, wow.

B000J0NIIW|4.0|I just bought this item.  And, I bought an extra battery after reading the reviews on here.  I bought a dirt devil vaccum broom.  I didn't like it and returned it.  I was looking at the irobot vaccums.  The cheaper idog requires a little work to close off rooms in a big area and it has to be returned to the unit.      I charged this unit for 8 hours.  I used it on my kitchen floor and it was amazing.  It picked up all the dog hair.  The floor is hardwood.  I also used it on a thin Aubosson rug that I have in the family room.  It was amazing there too.  The thin rug is sucked up by the oreck even on hardwood mode.      I had some pine needles in the garage from the Christmas tree.  I used it there and it picked up like a champ.      I have a German Shepherd dog.  He sheds alot.  I have the oreck vaccum and the Ironman canister and some other vaccums at the house.  I live alone and want something quick to use to clean up the hardwoods and maybe the thin rug.  I don't want to string a vaccum out.  This is perfect.  It glides so easy.  And it is easy to put in the sideways mode to go under hall tables.     I'll have the extra battery.  Charge it, take it out of the charger and wait for the machine battery to run down like one of the reviews suggested.    I have maid service twice a month and just need a touch up and this is perfect.  I have researched many things.    Pay the extra money and get the extra battery.  This little thing is made for quick clean up.  It even sweeps up pine needles like a champ.  I usually don't write reviews but after the mediocre rating that I saw on here, I offered a few cents worth.
B001L5VYFI|3.0|I'm Sorry, This is great music but NEW is not the label that should be applied. Re-Package is the applicable term.This was truly inspirational music 35 years ago which, sadly still rings true today. If you do not have the originals then by all means this is a wonderful collection, go for it.

B000007VRQ|4.0|I think this recording is best looked at not as a Genesis album but as an under-appreciated gem of British psychedelic pop. It's character is much closer to that of something like [[ASIN:B000T05R90 The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]] or [[ASIN:B000001F5R Days of Future Passed]] than to any of the later Genesis albums.    Sadly the recording is pretty poor, but the songs are for the most part lovely.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible is classic Whedon: the height of tragicomedy.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will become a part of you.  Really.  You will be singing the songs for the next few weeks, discovering new cleaver twists and nods in the lyrics days later (the lyric \\"head up Billy buddy\\" appears in two different songs, one referencing the other), and some of the truly inspired complex rhymes are just delightful.<br /><br />It doesn't take long before you start rooting for the would-be villain Billy in his quest to impress both Penny (his laundry mat crush) and Bad Horse (The Thoroughbred of Sin), the equine head of The Evil League of Evil.  The acting is solid all the way around, but Harris truly steals the show.<br /><br />I got this a week ago for Christmas, and it's embarrassing the number of times I've watched it already.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We purchase at least one new family game each year.  After some extensive research, I decided to purchase The Settlers of Catan.  When we opened the box the day after Christmas, we were overwhelmed!  The directions, the set-up, well.. everything seemed so overwhelming!  My ten year old son and I decided to take the advice written on the box and watch the directions online.  We proceeded to watch sample game play online, and we were even given the opportunity to print out an additional cheat sheet/synopsis directions at the end of the viewing.  This was a huge, tremendous help!    After we watched the directions and followed the written directions to set-up the board, we started playing.  Two of my sons, my husband, and myself played the first match.  We had an absolute blast!  With only four people playing at a time, it was a little frustrating on making someone set out each time.  We all wanted to play!     My housework has suffered over the break, but oh, have we had a great time!  Last night, my husband and I decided to play Settlers after the kids went to bed.  Unfortunately, you really need three people to play.  We were tempted to go wake one of the boys up!      After some family battles about who gets to play and when, we purchased the extension pack.  This pack allows for 6 people to play at one time... which is perfect for my family.  The directions on the extension pack change the game play a little, but I have yet to get to play it.      Now, about the game.... It is a strategy game.  Most strategy games are not able to be understood properly by young children; my seven year old loves this game!  Now, he sometimes makes a few choices that we wiser, older people wouldn't make... yet it works for him!  He wins quite often!      The premise is that you connect settlements and cities with roads across the different landscapes.  You get the products that each type of land produces. These products allow you to buy the above-said settlements, cities, and roads.There are also Development Cards... these cards allow you to do special things on your next turn.  They are purchased using the products from the land.      This game is loved by all six in my family, even by my husband who says he doesn't like games!  I highly recommend it.
B001EC9V58|5.0|....it IS Scary and a damn good horror movie.The remake(Quarentine) is the EXACT same movie but there is somthing about REC being foreign that makes it more believable in my opinion,making it much more intense.The final 15 minutes of either film is what white knuckle FEAR is all bout.

0312370849|5.0|This story is a powerful, well written story than evokes tremendous emotion in the reader. The parallel story lines prevent the reader from putting the book down during the truly horrifying moments.  Written in the first person, a writing style that enables the reader to more clearly envision the events, the story is cleverly crafted with just enough detail to allow the reader to empathize with Julia, the voice of the story as she desparately seeks out Sarah's story.  This is by far the best book I have read in years.
0596522347|5.0|Nancy Duarte's \\"slide:ology\\" is obviously a work of love. Nancy has poured her years of successful design and business experience developing presentations for many major companies into a book that beginners and experts alike will benefit from.    Beginners -- those who've been tasked with creating presentations despite the fact they don't have a creative bone in their bodies -- will find in these pages answers to the questions they hadn't thought of. They'll discover what to do, how to do it, why they should do it, when, where and most importantly, who to do it for. With clear prose and compelling graphics, Nancy offers examples and case studies that reinforce the theories and practices behind creating powerpoints that truly communicate. In this respect, it is truly a masters' course in developing successful presentations.    Professionals -- those who've got a background and/or training and experience in creating powerpoints -- NEED this book on their bookshelf next to those of Edward Tufte. It will remind you of why you do what you do and help freshen your approach and design thinking. It will give you ideas and help you advance your skills even as it helps you improve the success of your presentations.
B000OVLBF8|2.0|I must agree with ma017's review.  Too much devoted to the visual effects, which are truly spectacular, and way too little effort spent on an intelligent story and character development. The direction was substandard also.  You have a great cast who deliver their lines like they can't wait to get it over with so they can collect their check and burn rubber getting out of there;-).  The hottest thing about this movie is Eva Mendes who has way too little screentime IMHO.
B00065MDRW|5.0|In The Court of the Crimson King  Album Rating: 10  Best Song: The Court of the Crimson King  Released on October 10, 1969, \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" is considered by many one of the King Crimson's best albums, and one of the most, if not the most influential albums in progressive rock history. While the album may not be one of the most well known albums, the progressive rock cult certainly was influenced by it, and it's easy to see why. Using a wide variety of different instruments, rock instruments do not take a lead in this album. Take for instance \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" lead by a soft flute, or \\"Moonchild\\" with no lead but a ton of strange instrumental parts. This album, even in the progressive rock camp, is very experimental and one of the most influential of all time.  The album starts of with what remains as one of King Crimson's most well known songs \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" with loud saxophones and loud disoriented vocals from Greg Lake, this is considered a classic by lots of King Crimsons fans, but not me. Those loud disoriented vocals aren't that good, and the song drags on to me. A decent song, but easily the worst on the album.  It gets picked back up immediately by a soft flute introduction to \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" which is a nice soft relaxing tune, with a nice hippy feel to it for me. Constantly lead by a flute, and fun lyrics, not that I know what they are about. This is where the album gets good.  We got into the epic \\"Epitaph\\" with it's soft drums and heavy use of the meltron, is just genius. The song feels like an epic soft-rocker, and has the epic lyrics about mankind and death. One of the best songs on the album, though that's along with everything besides the first track. Strangely this was released as a single a couple of years later in 1976 leading in front of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" after the \\"A Young Person's Guide to King Crimson\\" a 2-cd compilation released by King Crimsons where they choice some of the best songs from their albums prior to that.  Next up is the very experimental \\"Moon Child\\". We're treated too a two and a half minute meltron ballad, and then go into a random instrumental phase. Tons of instruments are played in this, and it's just feels completely random. I know a lot of people who hate this song, I have friends who think it's stupid and boring, but I think it's pure genius. The actual song part is really good, and I always listen to the crazy experimental part too as I find it enjoyable, especially towards the end.  Finally we have the closing epic \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\", and I can't emphasize on how great this song is. The lyrics are very fantasy-like, and whatever he is talking about has background things doing it perfectly when Greg Lake says \\"The purple piper plays his tune\\" you hear a flute in the background, everything in this song is just perfect. The haunting vocals, the strange instrumentals, the aahs after Lake says Court of the Crimson King, everything is wonderful. This is the progressive masterpiece, and the crowning achievement of one of the greatest progressive albums ever.  This album was the album that set the standards for progressive rock in the seventies, this album was the album that influenced many, and this album is one of the best progressive rock albums of all time. Soft and haunting with fantasy lyrics, though it is a rare thing, King Crimson hit the mark on their debut, and I can't say it is their best as I haven't listened to all their albums, but I think it will be, along with one of the best albums of all time.    Song Ratings:  21st Century Schizoid Man - 7/10  I Talk to the Wind - 9.5/10  Epitaph - 10/10  Moonchild - 9.5/10  The Court of the Crimson King - 10/10
0142412147|5.0|I read this book in a few hours one day, and I loved it. The stories are \\"romances,\\" but not in the cliché sense - they are very witty, intelligent, and observant narratives. The characters were all very well rounded and dynamic. The way that the three stories were tied together added a fun twist to the individual plots.    Another success for these three wonderful authors.    Also - it by no means has to be Christmastime for you to enjoy this book.
0316017922|1.0|This book is full of preposterous assertions. I cannot figure why people continue to lend credence to this guy's insistence on stringing unrelated ideas together.  Early in the book he gives an example of how a young boy is encouraged by his mom to question the doctor but when it comes to children in the Bronx, being taught to quietly walk in an orderly line is the key.  He concludes the book with the sad sad moral that he is lucky that a slave owner rapist violated his grandmother and gave his family the gift of whiter skin. This book is a travesty. It does a disservice to poor people, people of color, and thinking people.
0316017922|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell created a compelling debate on the factors that drive change in the book \\"The Tipping Point\\" and postulated on the way we make decisions in \\"Blink\\", and now takes explores the factors that lead to success in his new book \\"Outliers\\".  Outliers follows the path he laid out in his previous work of presenting a thesis, illustrating examples and drawing conclusions.  His work is less about a true scientific methodology, and more about a conversational observation of what seems to be.<br /><br />Outliers postulates that what leads to success is less about hard work, or rising beyond ones circumstances to achieve something, and is more about inherent factors such as your birthday month, your social environment, and the precise positioning of where you are born in the timeline of progress in a particular area.  For example, hockey players in the Canadian leagues start out competitively at a very young age.  But remarkably, it appears that those who are born within the first quarter of the year get the perfect start to their careers, balancing the optimal developmental age and the highest amount of practice time available when compared to those who are born later in the year.  While talent certainly plays a role, this birth month factor shows up so consistently as a factor in determining success, it seems that if you were not born during that point of the year you needn't bother.<br /><br />In another example, Gladwell looks at why some of the richest people in the world all had a similar factor critical to their success - the amount of time they were able to practice their craft.  Gladwell identifies a ten thousand hour threshold, and shows examples of how people like Bill Gates had access to computer equipment and the time to use it and this one factor is enough to make the difference to influence success.  It is an interesting thesis and Gladwell uses multiple examples to highlight this.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Outliers\\" has the same positive attributes as his other work; well written, easy to read, interesting and thought provoking.  However, it also suffers from some of the same criticisms.  His conclusions are largely circumstantial, and are never documented enough to really hold up as a scientific study.  There doesn't seem to be a use for the conclusions he draws.  If success is so hinged on the factors here, then what can we do about it?  An interesting question that could have used more exploration here.l written, easy to read, interesting and thought provoking.  However, it also suffers from some of the same criticisms.

B00005NKKY|5.0|I bought this album in 1968, stupidly warped it in the back window well of my VW while driving to college from Iowa to Oregon in 1970, and bought another copy as soon as I arrived in Portland. To me, side 1 one of this album is the apogee Simon and Garfunkels' musical, creative and emotional genius. While in college I moved on to more Important Things--jazz, rural blues, Frank Zappa and on and on.    Now, some 40 years later, I found myself humming \\"Old Friends\\" as i watched a couple of old men in downtown Portland. It all came flooding back and I had to buy the album (now as MP3's) again. At age 56, this album carries even more meaning for me today.    Looking back, i think that Paul Simon is what some call an \\"old soul.\\" It is astonishing that he would have written this material as a relatively young man.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Viva La Vida has seven Grammy nominations, and I hope they win them all, including best album. I haven't actually heard the other contenders, but I find it hard to believe that any album better than Viva La Vida could have slipped past my radar. Perhaps best selling Tha Carter III by Lil Wayne should get runner up or honorable mention, but 2008 was really Coldplay's year. They have hit their stride with their fourth album, and Brian Eno was the perfect producer for them at this juncture in time.<br /><br />Some ambitious fans have posted the chords and tablature to the entire album, explaining which songs are played with a capo or whatnot, and it makes it easy and fun for me to play along with the whole record, from start to finish. I really like the way it all flows together, with a variety of keys, tempos, moods, and grooves, that all work together to form a cohesive whole. I wouldn't change the order of any of the songs, they are not just random songs, they all fit together perfectly.<br /><br />The band plays as an ensemble, without much in the way of guitar solos as such, but they always craft their ensemble sound so it gives a lush carpet of support for singer Chris Martin. There is some amazing playing, but it just doesn't get in the way of songs.<br /><br />I am voting Viva La Vida top album of 2008, whether or not it gets the Grammy. Viva La Vida! Long Live Life! Live Long and Prosper!<br /><br />10 Records to Compare and Contrast with Viva La Vida<br /><br />1.  [[ASIN:B00001OH7W Low]] by David Bowie and Brian Eno (1977) .... Speed of Life, also an instrumental overture, if you will, kicks off this Bowie/Eno collaboration, just like Life in Technicolor, a Coldplay/Eno collaboration, kicks of Viva La Vida, or Death and All His Friends.<br /><br />2.  [[ASIN:B00002496Y The Queen Is Dead]] by The Smiths (1986) .... Cemetry Gates, for starters, but how about I Know It's Over, Never Had No One Ever, The Boy With the Thorn in His Side, There is a Light That Never Goes Out, or Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others, to compare and contrast The Smiths with Cemeteries of London by Coldplay(?)<br /><br />3.  [[ASIN:B000002OH3 Into the Great Wide Open]] by Tom Petty (1991) .... The title track is somewhat similar to Lost! in that it starts in Em and then goes to a forceful statement with Major Chord cadences. Into the Great Wide Open is actually closer to Cry, Baby, Cry, by The Beatles.<br /><br />4.  [[ASIN:B000YY67BI Axis: Bold as Love]] by Jimi Hendrix (1967) .... One Rainy Wish is kind of like 42, in that it starts with a pensive, dreamy, minor riff, then builds up into a heavy part. Coldplay's 42 kind of has a middle where the energy ratchets up and then there is a release, where they surf the wave, like an ice cube on a skillet, riding to its own melting.<br /><br />5.  [[ASIN:B000002H70 Disintegration]] by The Cure (1989) .... Lullaby has that Japanese sound, as if they are playing kotos, and that is what links it with Lovers in Japan, beneath the Osaka sun, in my mind; but this whole album by The Cure compares nicely with Viva La Vida.<br /><br />6.  [[ASIN:B000002LK1 Violator]] by Depeche Mode (1990) .... DM master the techno beat, but with its slow and heavy groove of Policy of Truth, or even Personal Jesus, it kind of brings to mind Coldplay's Yes!<br /><br />7.  [[ASIN:B0001FAFDQ Is There Love in Space?]] by Joe Satriani (2004) .... Joe Satriani claims Viva La Vida is a rip off of his song, If I Could Fly. Coldplay say, Joe, with all due respect, it is only a coincidence.<br /><br />8.  [[ASIN:B000065V96 Peter Gabriel 1: Car]] by Peter Gabriel (1977) .... Solsbury Hill is not so much like Violet Hill, but both Peter Gabriel and Chris Martin really cover a lot of musical territory, and the songs, though diverse, weave together in a tapestry that tells a single story.<br /><br />9.  [[ASIN:B000002L7R Around the World in a Day]] by Prince (1985) .... Raspberry Beret is my pick to compare and contrast with Strawberry Swing.Hah. I bet you thought I was going to compare it to Strawberry Fields, by The Beatles. But I am saving them for last. ATWIAD by the AFKAP (Artist formerly known as Prince)--in other words--Prince, is a good album to compare with Viva La Vida because it also incorporates psychedelic sound, as well as sitars, middle eastern, and world music, into its rock.<br /><br />10.  [[ASIN:B000002UB3 Abbey Road]] by The Beatles (1969) .... The End, a song fragment that is the culmination of a suite of shards (Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight) is very much like the end of Death and All His Friends, which also ends on a song fragment called The End:<br /><br />And<br />In the end<br />We lie awake<br />And we dream we're making our escape<br /><br />While of course, The Beatles end their The End with:<br /><br />And<br />In the end<br />The love we take<br />Is equal to the love we make.ut I am saving them for last.

1416955070|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books. I usually don't read too much fantasy stuff - I usually can't get into it too well. This book was exactly the opposite. I was hooked quickly and the fast pace ensured that I would finish it quickly, also.<br /><br />Clary seems like a real down-to-Earth character, despite everything that is happening to her (I won't tell you because I don't want to spoil it!). The way she reacts is the way I think I would react if any of this happened to me. All the characters were described really well and had growth in the book.<br /><br />I would only change one thing, though. Everything would get really exciting, and then slow down dramatically, then get exciting, and slow down again, etc. I think this book would be even more incredible if it didn't slow down so much in between the main events.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a great book and if you are debating whether you would like it, you most likely will.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GKJ2E8 Wanted (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]     People seem to rate this as though it's only an action flick when it is more an adult fantasy. It's the story of an hopelessly bored office nerd with greater potential than he can imagine. In effect, his boredom stems out of his potential. Although the action and acting are great the story line and moral of the story are what stood out to me.     Basically, Wesley (James McAvoy) is snatched out of what seems to be an endlessly meaningless existance, conditioned by having the heck beat out of him until he learns to fight back. After being mentored by Fox (Angeline Jolie) and deceived into killing his own father, Weslay takes control of his life. After discovering his true identity by studying his father as a supposed enemy, he followed in his father's footsteps by completing his plan to wipe out the corrupt cell of the Fraternity (Assisins of Fate) that trained him, with the help of his mentor, Fox, who was true to the code but deceived as well.     We've watched the movie multiple times and wonder: what's not to like?
0123694965|5.0|Jesse Schell, game design professor at Carnegie Mellon University, wrote an introductory book that was published in August, titled \\"The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses.\\" The back overleaf quotes Will Wright saying, \\"Easily the most comprehensive, practical book I've ever seen on game design.\\" I will try to briefly state why I agree and offer details to help you decide if this book is for you.     Each chapter of the book adds a node to a network of relationships between the designer, the game, and the player. Throughout, Schell boxes 100 tips, with questions that induce a novel perspective on the design. He calls these lenses. I applaud the volume of diverse traditions, such as: psychology, storytelling, engineering, business, and management. They are so diverse as to change not only perspective, but also target. \\"The Lens of the Puzzle\\" looks at the mechanisms of the game; whereas, \\"The Lens of the Team\\" looks at the developers of the game. This is an eclectic approach that distills many abstract tips on what to consider when designing. Some experience and diligence with most of the 100 lenses would almost guarantee the reader is a competent designer.     Most lenses seemed crystal clear and provoked thoughts. Oftentimes, Schell deploys the wheels that others have invented. Many lenses refer to prior literature, such as Barry Boehm's spiral model of development (82), Scott Kim's thoughts on puzzles (209).     Furthermore, Schell gives us some original gems on the psychology of games that expanded my mind. He touches on the tactile aesthetics of the Rubik's cube (213), the learning curve of a jigsaw puzzle (215). He has some tips on personal communication that, upon reflection, exposed mistakes I have made, and would be more likely to continue to make had I not read Schell's advice. For example, in \\"Coping with Bad Suggestions,\\" rather than agree or disagree, he advises to \\"understand why the client is making the suggestion\\" (417). He gives similarly importantadvice for playtesting (389).    Perhaps the inevitable danger of writing a comprehensive book is that one's own rough facets become apparent when placed side-by-side with one's brilliance. In a few spots, I would like to see wheels being reused rather than reinvented, such as mathematical graphs (132), epistemics of players (139), military tactics (141), risk and return (181), interface affordances (212), models of human-computer interaction (225), and plotting interest (247). I don't disagree with what Schell wrote there, but would rather dive deeper by leveraging prior literature (as he did in other lenses).    The book is well-presented with modest illustrations and easy to read from beginning to end. On an editorial note, although I affirm Schell's eclectic approach to game design, after reading the book, I wish it were easier to find the information I wanted to refer to. The table of lenses at the front of the book was not enough for me. The lens titles are not always evocative and distinct.    To summarize:   * What you will find in this book: informal habits of a professional game designer.   * What you will not find in this book: details or examples of designs and their implementation.    Game Developer magazine nominated The Art of Game Design for the Book of the Year. It got my vote.

B001782N4A|4.0|I like it. It is misleading for Amazon & Target to claim that it has \\"head spinning action\\" because it does not. It does make the R2D2 sounds when you plug in a device, and it does function well as a USB hub.  One reviewer wrote that his said \\"demo\\" on it. That is because it is a sticker on a button that you can push for a demo of the sounds it makes- you can remove the sticker.  I would have been disappointed if I had expected the head to spin, but I just wanted a functioning USB hub that sits on my desk & looks like R2D2 & it does that really well.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|The quintessential flick for anarchists, angry guys, or cult film lovers.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt team up to create an extraordinary film.  It is not for the faint of heart, nor is it for the extremely sensitive.    The Narrator, Ed Norton, suffers from insomnia and finds his solution going to various support groups until he meets Marla Singer, Helena Bonham Carter, who upsets the balance that The Narrator has achieved.  Enter Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt, who solves The Narrator's housing, sleeping, pretty much all of his problems.  Once realizing what he's gotten himself into The Narrator has an entertaining journey of discovery which leads to the establishment of a new life.    Fight Club is both entertainment and social commentary.  When Pitt's character Durden criticizes so many things taken for granted or thought of as necessities in modern society one has to wonder how far off the mark he really is.  The Spartan existence of Durden almost seems attractive when he explains how frivolous materialism has made humanity.    If nothing else you will have an altered view the food industry.  And a distinct wonder of what you really can accomplish.        All told this is a great film, with a fascinating if bizarre story.  The cast is perfect in brining the dysfunction of the world to the forefront of your mind.

0545128285|3.0|'The Tales of Beedle the Bard' is the final piece of the Harry Potter story. In the 'The Deathly Hallows', the book of wizard nursery tales is inherited by Hermione Granger after the passing of Dumbledore.    The book contains five tales with the main focus being the final tale of the three brothers. While the book added a crucial part to the story of Harry Potter, the entire book was not required. I was very happy to hear the Rowling took the time to actually write the book and complete the package. While the Harry Potter story in no way need this book it was a little side dish that made the meal very good.    I thought the stories were interesting. I enjoyed the tales of the three brothers, the hopping pot, and the fountain story very good. The other tales were okay.    If you are a Potter fan than you need to get this book. It is fun to read and without any new Potter books coming, this may be your last chance at something new. If Harry Potter was good but not great for you, than you may want to pass on this book.
0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers is a vivid work of journalism that presents in an engaging manner evidence for the thesis that individual success depends more on circumstances than on innate ability.    Its strengths include that it is organized around interesting stories.  These stories include: why birth month often determines sports success; why Bill Gates was successful;  why having the highest IQ is not the key to success; why birth year is correlated with success; the roots of family feuds in rural Appalachia; why some airlines have worse crash records than others;  whether there are cultural roots to math success; whether extra time in school can help the disadvantaged.     Another strength is that in some cases the book is based on solid social science research. For example, it seems that the findings on the role of birth dates and birth year in success, the limited role of IQ in success, the importance of culture in explaining life patterns, and the importance of time on task in education, all seem to be backed by considerable social science evidence.    One weakness is that many of the individual stories in the book, by their very nature, are anecdotes that can only illustrate rather than prove an argument. Was the key to the Beatles' success  the many hours they spent performing in Hamburg? Maybe so, maybe not.     Another weakness is that the stories and evidence are not linked to some underlying theoretical framework. Gladwell is a journalist, not a social scientist. Circumstance is clearly important in explaining success. But quantitatively how important is it? Gladwell does not attempt to explore that question.    Finally, the book only very tentatively explores policy implications. His thesis has potential implications for public policy towards income distribution, progressive taxation, education policy, and many other issues. Of these policy issues, only education policy receives any attention, and even there he doesn't explore the education policy implications as much as he could.    However, the book makes an important contribution in bringing to broader public attention the important issue of how much success depends upon circumstance. The book popularizes what would otherwise be an arcane social science discussion.
6304712936|5.0|The title alone is just one of many reasons why Amadeus remains my favorite drama. After seeing it nearly 15 years ago, it puzzled me as to why the film was titled after Mozart's middle name. This film isn't about Mozart, but rather of Salieri-an ambitious, envious and tortured soul who is a prominent but less celebrated composer in Mozarts' time. There is no rivalry-at least from Mozart's point of view, and Salieri understands that if he cannot be Mozart's equal, he will do everything in his power to bring him down. To Salieri, it is deeper than mere jealousy. It is an injustice for a cocky man such as Mozart to be so endowed with musical gifts while men, such as Salieri, struggle in vain to find one right note. His adversary is not Mozart, it is with God, and Salieri's secret, internal struggle to extinguish Mozart's talent, consumes his life. When I finally looked up the title to this film, I found \\"Amadeus\\" is Latin for \\"loved by God,\\" and it is a perfect summation to Salieri's inner conflict. This story isn't meant to be historically accurate, but the premise is interesting and the performances, like the music, are perfect. I've seen the director's cut and I think the additional footage is unnecessary. The original version was precisely edited, while the director's cut had this unfortunate effect of altering my perception of Salieri. The extra scenes made him more contemptible rather than someone we're supposed to pity. Despite the films' serious undertones, it has a lot of humor. Mozart was never described in my school textbooks as a giggly, farting, drunken mess, but it only adds to his unworthiness that Salieri condemns and seeks to destroy. Enjoy!
0743435729|5.0|After reading this book's predecessor, On Basilisk Station, I eagerly tore into The Honor of the Queen, anticipating a tight plot, intriguing characters, and well written, explosive action.  David Weber did not disappoint.  This book was just as captivating as the one came before it, if not moreso.  This review contains spoilers.     The overall idea of the novel is intriguing.  I, for one, was interested to see how Honor Harrington, a naval officer accustomed to a world where sexual discrimination is but a memory of the past, would fare on a planet where women have no rights.  Having a rather feminist mindset myself, the issue struck me as interesting and, at times, really made my blood boil, so I felt as though I could relate to Honor on some level.  The author handled the concept surprisingly well, as most male authors seem to be unable to fully grasp the emotions and the seriousness that comes with a topic such as this (no offense male authors).  That alone would have been enough for our heroine to handle.  But, of course, things are never quite that easy for Honor.      The Peoples' Republic of Haven entering into the fray was, well, pretty much expected.  At this point, even after reading just this book and the previous one, it can be expected that Manticore and Haven will always find some way to be at odds with each other until a full blown war breaks out.  Regardless, it added a sense of urgency to the book, which became even more dire and even chaotic when the Masadans rebelled against the Peeps.       The characterisation of Honor Harrington was spot on.  She's a very likable heroine, but isn't without her faults.  In fact, I believe that's one of the things I enjoyed about this book so much.  We finally get to see Honor get pushed over the edge.  She's usually so calm and collected, fully capable of holding herself in check and never allowing her anger to really show beneath her cool surface.  To see her lose control for a moment and release her anger onsomeone who could, potentially, ruin her career was a bit refreshing.  To me, it shows that she isn't impervious to mistakes and that she is, in fact, human.  She was intriguing in the previous book and just got better in this one.  She seemed a little more three dimensional here than she did before...perhaps that was because she had to deal with a lot more (the death of her mentor, trying to seal an alliance with a planet that despises her for her gender and position of power, trying to protect said planet from their enemies and Manticore's enemies, her acquired injury, her own inner and emotional turmoils, and being the best Captain she can be while still upholding the Queen's honour).  Yet, she still manages to keep everything together to save the day (at risk of destroying her ship and crew) and seal the alliance.       As before, Nimitz proved to be an asset to the story.  Though he may not have been a bit part of the overall plot, he is an enjoyable character and his interactions with Honor and others are often entertaining to read about.  I would like to see him play a bigger role in future books, as he (as a character and a member of a very gifted species) seems to have a lot to offer.      Another thing I really enjoyed about The Honor of the Queen was the varying personalities when it came to some of the more minor characters...especially those who came from Grayson and Haven.  The idea that not all bad guys are bad was definitely reinforced here.  The characters of Yanakov (Grayson) and Alfredo Yu (Haven) were especially interesting.  Both of them were decent people who were doing what they believed was best for their people.  Characters like them lesson the whole good guy/bad guy layout many books seem to have.  They add a new level to the story and force the reader to look beyond their association with planets and governments and look more at the individuals themselves.        One thing that did become a bit tiresome was how everyone who dislikes Honoris automatically a \\"bad guy\\".  It just struck me as a bit unrealistic that everyone on the \\"good side\\" likes Honor and anyone who doesn't is pegged as a \\"bad guy\\".  Hopefully that will lessen in future books.      The last hundred pages or so were fast paced and exciting, often keeping me on the edge of my seat.  Weber really excels when it comes to writing explosive space battles...even if his tendency to interrupt the flow of the space battle to explain a piece of technology can be, at times, annoying.     The Honor of the Queen can be read as a standalone novel, but is best read after On Basilisk Station.  In short, it's a great followup to the first book and, in many ways, is better than the first book.  I look forward to reading the next books in the series to see what future adventures await Honor Harrington
0810979772|5.0|Do not buy this book expecting it to be like the other WHIMPY KID books.  This is just what the title says: DO-IT-YOURSELF.  Encourage your kids to read it, write along, and be creative.  Assure them it is safe for them to write whatever comes to mind.  Tell them they do not have to share their writing with you unless they want to.  If you have a child who is not excited about reading and writing, the DIARY OF A WHIMPY KID books and this handbook could change that completely.  You might want to consider buying two books so you too can complete one and you can model the creativity and honesty that you would like to see your child reveal in his or her writing. This is an incredible opportunity to bond with your child while providing unique opportunities to improve writing and reading skills. Did I mention, you will laugh ever step of the way?
B00005LK94|4.0|Thirteen-year-old Amy (Anna Paquin) is reunited with her father Tom (Jeff Daniels) in Canada after her mother's death. One day she discovers a nest of abandoned gooose eggs and starts to raise the birds when they hatch. The hatchlings need to migrate south for the winter, but have no adult birds to guide them. Luckily Tom is mechanically skilled and loves to tinker with things like gliders. Father and daughter train the birds to follow them in ultralights, and lead their winter migration, breaking more aviation rules and regulations than I could count.<br /><br />This is a great family movie (except for a bit of language) for those who like nature, animals, or girl power. It's one of the few films with a direct reference to the Bernoulli principle. The flying scenes really make you feel like you're along for the ride. Two wings up.
0887307280|3.0|This book reads more like a romance novel than a business book. The author has some good ideas, but nothing new or earth shattering. The big put off for me is how he \\"interacts\\" with Sarah who owns a pie making business. Starring into each others eyes and her 15 minute description of lying in bed as a child dreaming about wild horses, which I can't find any connection to business. This would be a much shorter book, and better, if the filler was removed and just business basics were left.<br />With that being said the actual business parts do have some good ideas and ways to look at situations in a different light. I would recommend it as decent reading if you get it at a good price.
B001MWMVQQ|4.0|After Joss Whedon's DOLLHOUSE, the most anticipate new series of the 2008-2009 television schedule was J. J. Abrams's FRINGE.  The quick review is that FRINGE has been a disappointment.  The news, however, is not all bad.  While it has some problems, some of them perhaps insoluble, it has gotten progressively more interesting as it has gone along.  At the end of the first 5 or 6 episodes, I found myself not really caring what happened next on the show.  But after the fall finale, I discovered that I did.  I'm not sure this will ever become a truly good series, but it is at least one that I plan on continuing to watch.<br /><br />The core problem with the show is that the two leads - Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson - are simply not very good.  I like Anna Torv, consider her very attractive, but she isn't an especially compelling actress and she lacks charisma.  If she were a sidekick instead of the lead, she would be fine.  Unfortunately, she is called upon to carry the show, to be FRINGE's Sidney Bristow, and she simply isn't.  Additionally, unlike many of the other Australian or British actors currently on American television, Torv frequently loses her American accent.  I never, ever found myself thinking while watching Anna Friel on PUSHING DAISIES that she was British or that Yvonne Strahovski on CHUCK was Australian.  Strahovski seems American; Torv always seems like an Australian trying to sound American.  Mind you, I like Anna Torv.  I find her to be a pleasant screen presence.  But she is asked to be a lot more than pleasant and she doesn't quite manage it.  With coaching the accent can improve, but I'm not sure she can grow into the role.  As a result, I fear she is a permanent limiting presence on the show.  This bothers me, because, as I said, I really do like her.  Similarly, Joshua Jackson is not terribly appealing as Peter Bishop.  It isn't helped that his brow seems to be knit together in a permanent scowl.  He isn't the ostensible lead on the show, however, so he doesn't hinder the show to the same degree as Torv.  However, he would seem to be positioned as a potential love interest for Torv and the two of them completely lack any interpersonal chemistry.<br /><br />Beyond Torv and Jackson, however, the news is largely good.  John Noble chews his way through scene after scene with tremendous aplomb as the show's mad (literally) scientist Dr. Walter Bishop.  A great deal of his character depends on how it is written, but Noble brings a great deal to his performance.  Many will remember him from the LORD OF THE RINGS films, but I think that after FRINGE most will remember him from.  Also superb on the show is Lance Reddick, who has a recurring role on LOST as well as on FRINGE.  He has an unforgettable presence, extremely tall, head shaven, very dark skinned, and haunting, huge eyes set in a face with somewhat sunken features.  If anything he has been under utilized so far on the show.  Hopefully that will change.<br /><br />So, there are some inherent cast problems that I think will continue to haunt the show and limit how good it can become.  Initially the show suffered from some uncharacteristically weak writing (uncharacteristic given the excellent writers on the show), but that has improved sharply in the last 3 or 4 episodes and the prospect seems very good for the rest of Season One to be very good.  Plus the show shows promise in other ways.  Every good show of this sort requires a good villain.  So far the villains have been at best weak.  We haven't yet been able to determine whether Blair Brown is friend or foe.  But in the two most recent episodes Jared Harris has appeared as David Robert Jones who has real potential as a villain.  The show also has a very intriguing character known simply as The Observer who is quite enjoyable.  He frequently shows up in episodes in the background of scenes, though he has also featured prominently in a couple of others.  I think he will become increasingly important as the show progresses.<br /><br />Do I recommend this show to others?  Absolutely.  It has a lot of potential and after a rough start has started to fulfill the good things people were hoping for it.  I think much the same thing might take place with DOLLHOUSE, even more eagerly anticipated than FRINGE.  Multiple sources have reported initial problems with the show that apparently are improving as it progresses.  Given that DOLLHOUSE has perhaps the most impressive collection of writers currently working on television it would be surprising if it did not improve.  Interestingly, FRINGE and DOLLHOUSE are the two shows that FOX has chosen to try out something new.  Calling it \\"Hands Off Remote\\" viewing, FRINGE has had far fewer commercials than other TV shows.  Most shows today have about 18 minutes of commercials per hour.  FRINGE has averaged about half that much.  So far I have to confess that I haven't acclimated myself to the smaller commercial times.  I of course never watch commercials, just as I'm sure most viewers do not.  I run to the restroom, run to the fridge, dash to my computer to his a couple of TV boards to see how others are responding, and so forth.  But I never, ever watch the commercials.  I suspect the only time that this is going to have a real impact on my viewing will be when I get (if I do, and right now I suspect that I will) FRINGE and DOLLHOUSE on DVD.  Then I'll greatly appreciate the few additional moments of story.Do I recommend this show to others?  Absolutely.

0375714839|5.0|It's not only a great story, but it also is complimented by the visuals. This book is extra special to me because i can relate to a lot of what she went through during her years in europe. When she says she feels like a foreigner out of her country and in her country. It's just a great read. Now I want to watch the movie.
0790729628|5.0|I have always been a sucker for blades of light coming through Venitian blinds, especially at sundown. Team that with some beautiful jazzy background music and I am a goner.  BLADE RUNNER has a mother lode of these mood inducers, and all of the silhouettey, shadowy sci-fi special effects a person could want.  I have also always been a sucker for 1940s pompadour hairdos especially when worn by Replicants in the Future.  This movie is a feast for the senses.  Harrison Ford and Sean Young are Young and Ford and young and beautiful--more perfection to add to the futuristic landscape.  I am waiting for the jury to return on which DVD is the best to purchase.
0810993139|5.0|Readers of all ages will find themselves laughing out loud as WIMPY KID paints a clear picture of some of the awkward moments kids endure in today's schools and families. This is a great book for teaching students to be honest with their writing. A strong voice carries the reader through with a swift, fun pace. The book also features dozens of hysterical sketches. Be sure to check out the other three books in the series. This book would make an exceptional gift for a teenage boy.
B00000IQW5|4.0|Pete (Richard Dreyfuss) is a firefighting pilot in the West who promises his girlfriend Dorinda (Holly Hunter) that he'll give up his dangerous job. Before he can do so, he is killed trying to rescue their friend Al (John Goodman). Pete then finds himself talking to an angel (Audrey Hepburn, in her final role). He is assigned a new mission- to become a guardian angel to an up-and-coming pilot, Ted (Brad Johnson).<br /><br />Steven Spielberg directed this film, which is based on the 1943 Spencer Tracy movie A Guy Named Joe (not available on DVD). Aviation buffs will enjoy numerous flying sequences showing the Forest Service pilots in action as well as around the airport. Although the story is set in the present day, Spielberg used many World War II era airplanes to give the film a sense of timelessness which suits the story fine. The second half of the movie may remind audiences of the Patrick Swayze tearjerker Ghost, released a year later, as we see the deceased Pete in scenes with his friends, who cannot see him, yet interact with him in unusual ways.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Being behind the curve (read: someone who never watches MTV or reads Rolling Stone), I had not heard of Vampire Weekend until I read the Best of 2008 Music section in the BOSTON GLOBE.  At least four of that paper's music critics listed this CD as one of the year's best, so I bought in.<br /><br />A strong taste of pop for sure, with a nice hint of afro influences a la Paul Simon (who also mined the African continent for musical inspiration).  The music is undeniably peppy and catchy and even naysayers will have to catch themselves from toe-tapping along.  The album opens strong with \\"Mansard Roof\\" and goes one better with the best tune of the set, \\"Oxford Comma.\\"  You quickly find similarities between the songs (to some, a weakness, but to others, a strength).  The lyrics are clever and oh-so-collegiate (I mean, writing about punctuation?  Let's pull an all-nighter to finish our thesis and write a song about it!).<br /><br />Catchy tunes have their limits, however.  The song \\"One (Blake Has a New Face),\\" for instance, burrows in your head and then won't leave it.  You know the feeling -- when an overly-repetitive song bounces around in your head all day long even when you try to will it out once and for all?  Listen to \\"Blake\\" at your own risk.  Still, overall, great fun.  To those who say these guys from Columbia are overrated or overhyped, I say, \\"Relax.  Have some fun.  This isn't Beethoven we're talking....\\"
B00000IMYA|3.0|This recording is indispensable for Ellington fans, big band fans, and serious jazz music aficionados, but I think for the most part, the uneven recording quality and excessive tracks of pretty meaningless introductions, not to mention the riot quelling track, sort of miss the point and, I think, detract from the music. Sure, some of the solos are really hot, and the recording assures that the subtleties and intricacies of what was no doubt an epic performance are not lost, but still, how many times do we need to hear Duke's introduction? For me, the big selling point of this work is the liner notes, which are jam packed with photos, original liners, extensive musician and soloist listings, plus updated liners and session notes. I doubt there is an Ellington fan who wouldn't learn something by reading these notes once through. Long and short, I would say most casual fans can make do with the one CD set which eliminates most of the talking tracks and intros, but serious fans should go ahead and get this one. For pure music, this is not the greatest, but for jazz history and documentation, it is unsurpassed.
B001MWMVQQ|5.0|Great Show! Looks like it's going to have an on going plot. As long as they do begin to give you some details on the overall story the show should stay great. I hope they don't get lost as they did with \\"Lost\\".

HIGHLY recommend these guys!
B00000295Y|5.0|What can be said?  Nothing really.  I mean, do I have to explain why this CD is so great?  Do I really need to tell you how awesome DJ Mugg's production is - EVEN to this day?  I'm gonna be listening to this CD even when I'm 80 years old, I don't care!!    Standout tracks:  Just listen to the whole thing.  DJ Mugg's is a legend and strangely enough B-real's high pitched voice fits in perfectly over the dark grimy beats.  If I was a criminal, this is what I would listen to before I go do a \\"job\\"

1400063515|2.0|I just finished reading the Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.    The book is about the disproportionate effect on our world of highly improbable events, and the difficulty of predicting those events. The name comes from David Hume's observation that many generations of Britons' only seeing white swans was not proof that there is no such thing as a black swan (which do, in fact, exist).    I found the book very disappointing. It started out with so much promise; I looked forward to reading all sorts of anecdotal stories of these so-called black swans, and about the disproportionate effect on our world.    Instead, what I got was a 300 page diatribe by one statistician against all the others in the world who disagree with him, punctuated by an occasional gratuitous insult of the French.    After enduring several hundred pages of personal stories about the author's quest to make his statistical theories known (which are not quite as controversial as he would make you believe, by the way), finally in Chapter 15 it seems that he will get to the meat of the matter. Unfortunately, even though the next three chapters were laden with graphs and figures, I encountered no such explanations. Or, if there were any, they were muddled at best.    Even the anecdotes were disappointing. I was excited to start reading about a great vindication of his - the collapse of LTCM in 1998 (which was run by several of his statistical nemeses) - expecting to find a wonderful explanation of what went wrong, and all the financial turmoil which resulted. Instead, he simply stated \\"it went bust.\\" Duh.    I have no idea why this book has been so highly touted. Perhaps it is because it came on the heels of 9/11, and just before the credit turmoil which started in 2007. But it's not worth your time.
1400032717|4.0|With a unique style and fresh voice Mark Haddon has created a wonderfully memorable first novel.  \\"The Curious Incident of The Dog In the Night-time\\" is told through the eyes of Christopher, a 15-year old autistic boy, and chronicles his search for the killer of his neighbor's dog.  However, what starts as a mystery that Christopher compares to his favorite book \\"The Hound of The Baskervilles\\", turns into much more as he overcomes his fears and limitations to try and put order in a chaotic world.<br /><br />By writing a story in the first person when that person is autistic and can't understand emotions or other peoples intentions would at first seem limiting, but Mark Haddon expertly creates such a fascinating voice in Christopher that you fall in love with him within the first few pages.  Using a quirky style that includes maps, charts, smiley/frowning faces, text book descriptions of statistic theory and chapters that are prime numbers, Haddon keeps the reader drawn into Christopher's way of thinking and reminds us without being sentimental or condescending the difficulties Christopher has navigating through a normal day.  \\"Prime numbers are what you have left when you have taken all the patterns away.  I think prime numbers are like life.  They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them\\".<br /><br />Christopher needs order and clarity in his daily routines and without them has trouble functioning, which poses a problem when trying to solve a mystery.  However, to Christopher no event is random, and if he can just get the facts then he can put the pieces together and create logic.  It is during this pursuit of clarity that Christopher must confront his disorder and his own fears to get at the truth.  He can't lie (because that creates infinite alternate possibilities), he does not understand metaphors (because one thing can not be another) although he does like similes, and he doesn't look into other people's faces (because he gets confused between expressions that can mean different things).  It are all these issues due to his autism that makes his journey so heartwarming and painful at the same time.<br /><br />The murder mystery is just a catalyst for a larger adventure that Christopher must undertake and his story is an entertaining, witty and insightful one.s (because he gets confused between expressions that can mean different things).

0312360266|5.0|Ok so I'm not going to write about what is in the book but just tell you that if you are totally in to Vampyres that you are going to want to read this series of books.  My husband bought me Marked for X-mas and I read it in 1 1/2 days, then I bought myself Betrayed and just finished that tonight, that took 2 days...(kids).  I already purchased books 3 & 4 and have 5 on pre-order but I don't think I can wait till they get here.    These are so easy to read and you just kind of find yourself caught up in them and before you know it, that first book is done and you are craving the next.  OMG, I have read some Vamp books before but this series is so far UNBELIEVABLE!!!  I love it.  Thank you P.C and Kristen for writing these.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT.
B000000IVI|5.0|I have been a Trower fan since Procol Harum, he has always been an excellent player. I remember when this first came out in 1974, I bought an eight track tape of it. All my friends who had not heard it, they all ended up with a copy. This at the time was one of the best albums I had ever heard, and I still listen to it quite a bit. I have always had a copy of this in one form or another, and always will, this master copy for sound quality you can't beat. I love the deep rich bass lines from Jimmie, Robin's guitar has never sounded better, same with Reggie on drums. Jimmie's vocals I just love what a perfect fit, this to me is a masterpiece. It all fits together like a puzzle, all their albums with Jimmie doing the vocals are great. I wish he were still with us, this is a must for Trower fans, (the gold copy).

B00004ZAV3|5.0|OK, the goal of this review is to help you determine whether this is the right purchase for you.  Everyone has different taste and the Beatles have some really widely varying styles of songs, so I'm not going to make any judgments on these songs.  I'll let you do that.    The Beatles have a ton of great songs and even having 27 on one CD is going to leave out someone's favorite and include songs that some can't stand.  If you can live without the songs that aren't on this CD (such as anything from the famous White Album) and you want to minimize your investment, then this is the CD for you.  If you like what's on here, but feel it's still missing a lot, then you should get the Red and Blue albums INSTEAD of this CD.  If you get the Red and Blue albums, you'll be getting EVERYTHING that's on Beatles 1 plus a whole lot more, although you're still only getting maybe 4 songs from the White Album, so check out the White Album and see if there's anything on there that you can't live without.  If so, then adding the White Album will pretty much complete your \\"greatest hits\\" collection, although you'll still be missing a couple titles that are dear to some like \\"Lovely Rita.\\"  If you're not getting virtually everything you want from the Red, White, and Blue albums, then you pretty much want everything and should just get all of the individual albums and forget the Red, White, and Blue albums altogether.  You could look at the Anthology (1, 2, and 3) collections, but then you're starting to get into alternate/unplugged versions of these songs, which might not be what you're looking for.  Definitely read the reviews for the Anthology series before buying them or you might be surprised by what you get.    In summary, if you're looking for a solid, mainstream collection and aren't sure what you want, then here are your choices:  1. Beatles 1 (27 songs, cheapest and briefest)  2. Red+Blue (54 songs, including all of the Beatles 1 songs)  3. White (30 songs, including about 4 that are also on Blue)    If you're a huge fan of the White Album and just want to add in the best of the rest, then you might consider getting just the White Album plus Beatles 1 as there is no overlap between the two.    Hope this helps!
B000WMA6FA|5.0|With endless comprehensive reviews of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" available on Amazon and no reason to speculate about whether the film or the book is superior (different mediums, different strengths), it is worth noting the following about this DVD:    - the print of the film has been restored from the best available sources and is very good. The restoration comparison really demonstrates how much clearer the picture is, restoring much of the skilled lighting and preserving the deep focus photography  - the commentary is very helpful because it provides the historical context of the story as well as information about the courage of Darryl F Zanuck to produce a box office hit of almost documentary content.  - the newsreels are particularly cogent. We see people whose story the film tells.  - the A&E Biography program on Zanuck is a worthwhile documentary on this giant of the film industry.  - The original theatrical trailer is included. It generates interest in the film without actually showing any scenes from it.  - Zanuck's tagged on upbeat ending does undermine the integrity of the book, the ending of which would never have survived the censorship.    This is a very good package and can be purchased as part of one of the Ford at Fox sets.

But Shortly Aftyer A Few Days of The Mogwii Named Gizmo, The Rules Are Broken, and The Cute Little Fuzzy Mogwiis Turn Into the Slimy Green Evil Monsters Known As The Gremlins. Wen Thay're Not Watching SNOW WHITE at The Kingston Falls Movie Theatre, Thay're Attacking Inecent Pepole in The Small Town, and Distroy A Bar. So It's Up To Billy, Mogwii Gizmo, and Billy's Friend Kate To Help Save The Town From The Evil Green Slimy Monsters.    GREMLINS is An Absolute Clasic Horror/Comedy of the 80s Next BEETLEJUICE. Zach Galligan Plays Billy Peltzer, and For His First Film To Star In, He Was Great. Pheobe Cates (From FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMOUNT HIGH) Plays Kate Baringer, Billy's Girlfriend In The Film, is Absolutly Belivable and Great as A Girl Who Has A Bit of A Dark Secret of Her Christmas One Year as A Young Girl. Howie Mandel (Who's Done Voices in MUPPET BABIES & BOBBY'S WORLD) Plays The Voice of The Mogwii Gizmo, and The Voice is Very Cute and is Probly The Best Carecter in The Film.    The GREMLINS Look Fantastic and Are Brilliantly Evil (Even If Thay Do Watch SNOW WHITE).    I Also Recomend To See [[ASIN:6302517052 Critters]] (Simeler To GREMLINS) & The Sequel [[ASIN:B00006HB4E Gremlins 2: New Batch]].

The Deleted Scenes Are All Great, and Hopfully There Will Be An Extended Edition of GREMLINS and GREMLINS 2 Someday. The Origanal Making-Of Feature Back When The Film Was About To Come Out is Another Great Feature on The DVD as I Find It Interesting To See a Making-of Back During The 80s. Photo/Storyboard Galleries Ussally Bord Me, But The Ones on This DVD Were Grat, and Some Were Just Very Funny. CAST/CREW Film Highlights Are Always Good Cause You Might Just Know You Might've Seen An Actor In A Film Buit Couldn't Remember What The Title Was. The Trailers For both GREMLINS Films Are Great Fun As Well.     Though The Features Are Great, It Defenatly Needs More Accturally Be A Spiecial Edition.    Overall Ratings:  Movie-5/5  DVD-5/5
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|I have been a lifelong movie & avid DVD fan. For the first time I have been cheated. This movie is absolutely '*****' spectacular, however if your looking for a depth of extras on this bonus disk, you'll come up pretty empty. Nearly every film these days is also prepped for DVD during production, so there really is no excuse for such a lackluster release of the biggest film of the year.  There is NO AUDIO COMMENTARY, NO IN DEPTH PRODUCTION DOCUMENTARY, & the only substantial extra feature you get is 6 COMPLETELY WORTHLESS 'GOTHAM TONIGHT' news segments played in the background of the film.  The Blu-Ray version contains 'Gotham Uncovered' sequences (total running time about 35 min.). I there was plenty of space to include these features (& many more) on this release. This version is a rotten apple. Why bother with the Special Edition at all, Warner Bros?

0385751532|5.0|Excellent book. This captivating story was well written. People of ANY age can relate to this book. Even though it's a book about the Holocaust, almost anyone that understands the bonds of humanity and friendship can relate to this storyline. In addition, most human beings have experienced a \\"fence\\" in their life. We have all (at one point or another) had a wall that separated us from someone or something. Overall, I think the author very respectfully told a story warped around a horrific time in human history. I would love to see the movie, I hope they did the book justice.
0061122416|5.0|I loved this book. It took months to actually get into the book, i heard about it, and tried reading it, but gave up. But with a free afternoon, i sat down and opened up something deep down inside. Beautiful book, beautiful story. Where someone actually got to write down the words of feeling deep within someone it can take a life time to understand. A book for life..
0060090383|5.0|This is the first Marian Keyes book that I have read, and I loved it.  I'm planning on reading all of her books, since I really enjoy her style of writing and her sense of humor.  I recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about addiction while also enjoying some good humor and a great storyline.
0446615641|5.0|Author David Baldacci's Camel Club, a key element in the book, excludes dromedaries and his Oliver Stone, a central character, only directs himself to the kitchen. Nevertheless, this book is a very fast read. The story centers on a plot to avenge the murder of a high CIA operative. The avenger is the dead man's son, Harry Finn, the kind of guy who can take out a platoon of hostile gunmen by using his strength and cunning.    Another vengeful (and tough) character is Annabelle Conroy, whose mother was murdered by a vicious casino owner. So, the tale is largely about revenge. How Finn's and Conroy's lust for payback come together is an integral part of the book.    Finn's \\"day job\\" is working for the Department of Homeland Security to determine how tough security really is around potential terrorist targets. He repeatedly finds that this security is very flimsy and easily penetrated by someone as clever and resourceful as he. Although this is a work of fantasy, it suggests a real need for increased vigilance.    The book suffers from a couple of bizarre coincidences as the conclusion approaches. One expects this sort of thing in a thrilling spy games yarn, but Baldacci drops some real whoppers here. Not to worry, though. It's still an exciting conclusion.    I can see movie written all over this novel. If it is produced, it will be a challenge for Hollywood to top the book.
1439102813|5.0|One of my favorite books this year.  I highly recommend this touching story of Dr. Alice Howland and her very personal journey into Alzheimer's.<br /><br />When Dr. Howland, a decorated Harvard professor starts having slight memory lapses she chalks it up to menopause, what else could it be, with her schedule she doesn't have time for much more, that is until the lapses are more frequent and more terrifying.<br /><br />With her husband a Harvard Research Scientist they explore the possibilities and medical trials with each wanting to take a different approach.  What ensures are a couple of heartbreaking discoveries, laughter and the healing of old wounds.  But what is lost is what makes this book so remarkable - Alice takes you on her own personal journey though this disease and you see it from the inside, from the person and not just the textbook.  When she makes the comment of -- how can you remember what you have lost when you can't remember what had you had-- just brought the whole thing home for me.  What if you can't remember the person you once were and the people that had meant so much to you?<br /><br />Near the end of the book Alice gives a speech to the Dementia Care Conference that is just heartbreaking.  For that one moment in time, she is once again the Alice Howland that her friends and colleagues know, love and respected.  For that one moment in time she is Still Alice.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.
B001L63O1E|5.0|If you don't like progressive rock, stay away from this. The lyrics are kind of hippy-trippy. The musicianship is superb. I was blown away by the clarity of the Rhino-remastered CD. If you have the gear to appreciate it, I'd recommend the CD rather than the download. Frankly, some modern recordings are so poorly recorded and mixed that I don't sense much difference between the CD and a compressed MP3 file. (U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind being a case in point, but it is typical of many hit albums nowadays.) The Yes Album is nearly 40 years old, but the sound has a richness, detail, and sparkle to it that is remarkable. It's a great album either way, but if you get the MP3 you may not know what you're missing.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|Not much to say about this one.  It's too musical for my own tastes, I reocommended it to my 17 year old daughter.  The bursting out in song at the beginning turned me off.  The movie just didn't work for me. I have heard others say good things about it so I rate it a 3.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Great action movie... almost as good as the Bourne series... not to mention Liam Neeson's performance.<br /><br />Two thumbs way up!
B0017R5UAA|5.0|This is one of the most original albums I've heard over the last several years. Earthy folk ballads suffused with choir sound gives this album an Edenic feel. Many tracks sound like lush soundtracks accompanying a sojourn through green shimmering glades. But this music is not precious. It's earthy and feels authentic and never pretentious.<br /><br />I don't read a lot of music reviews, but I have to assume Fleet Foxes have been compared to a band with a similar sensibility and sound--My Morning Jacket.<br /><br />Those who like the Fleet Foxes might look to these bands: Rosebuds, Midlake, Marjorie Fair, and the Innocence Mission.
B00110K62U|2.0|This is a travesty and not worth buying if you already have the original CD. Even the first DVD is better. For a REAL treat, track down the original recording in French. If you know the dialogue, you will follow the emotion of the original language for a truly superlative experience!
B0017ANAZO|3.0|A \\"feel good\\" film, definately a chick flick.  The value of friendship is the central message.  The actresses are top notch, but some of the dialogue comes across as very fake.  It's a common theme done to death.  The title is somewhat a giveaway.  It is enjoyable for a casual watch.
031606792X|5.0|I blew through all 4 books in this series in about 4 days and now am slowly rereading them and savoring each chapter.  The first book is great.  The second book is my least favorite.  The third book is very cool.  But it is the fourth book that I keep picking up to reread a chapter or just peruse here and there.    I've read many of the negative reviews here, and need to state that I respectfully disagree with oh, all of them.  **SPOILERS BELOW**    These are young adult books - so no surprise that there's no detail on the sex scenes.  And you know - sometimes having things left to the imagination is the sexiest option.    Of course the pregnancy is freakish - have you read the series folks?!?!  We're talking about a half-human half-vampire child here.  You can't really have expected Bella to be taking Lamaze classes at the local hospital.    While the delivery of the baby may seem horrific, remember that Carlisle was gone and Edward was out of his mind.  The baby was HUGE and Bella has been referred to as tiny in every previous book...we were even told she weighed 110 lbs in an earlier book.  No surprise a \\"C-section\\" was needed.  And remember - half-vampire baby....not your normal development with that tough vampire-sac surrounding her.  Edward did what he had to to save Bella.    Had Edward changed Bella with a bite it could have had the potential to be personal, romantic, and beyond erotic.  But again - Bella was basically dead and he needed to get his venom to her heart.  Syringe to the heart sounds pretty quick & direct to me.    Yes, there was a buildup to a confrontation with the Volturi.  But I wasn't looking for a battle....I was looking for some sort of resolution where the covens could just exist without harming each other.  If a battle had been necessary, fine.  But it was resolved without one.  Fine.    Edward & Bella do change a LOT in this book.  But they've been evolving throughout the series.  Edward & Bella are happier.  No more battles about \\"changing\\" and no more doubts about together forever or their love for each other.  Also, in the past 3 books Bella has worried about endangering the Cullen clan due to her human-ness.  No worries on that front any more.    Jacob never imprinted on Bella.  He fell in plain human love with her.  You can see their relationship evolve in New Moon.  As seen with Nessie, imprinting is instant.  I was happy he found love as well as a place with Bella forever.    In the prior books, Charlie has clearly been painted as not wanting to know too much about his daughter's personal life.  Yes, he's a loving father, but Renee is the one who wants details details details.  How many times does Bella talk about appreciating her dad not asking too many questions?  She starts to cry and he runs.  She wakes up screaming from nightmares & Charlie isn't there every single night.  She & Edward have a tense conversation & Charlie delights that they may be fighting rather than goes to talk to Bella.  So no, it TOTALLY did not surprise me when Charlie accepted the \\"new\\" Bella and her life with little/no questions.    I could go on and on standing up against each negative review of this book because I feel that strongly that this book was just amazing.  But for now, I'm just going to go back and reread Breaking Dawn again.
1592332803|5.0|As an avid cook and baker, I can say that hands down, this is the best (vegan or otherwise) cookbook that I own (have over 30 +).  I seriously praise this book out loud just about everytime I use it. My partner and I do 95% of our eating at home, and this is the go-to guide for baking. I find that aside from the excellent recipes themselves, the miracles of this book are in the details.  The author has packed this thing with info in really digestible easily absorbed ways: like little cook's tips, or facts, or lists.<br /><br />While baking (sweets) isn't necessarily the most healthy thing one can do, my grandpa is 91 and still alive, and made and ate killer baked goods! The author of this book is very thoughtful and thorough outlining other food politics to consider such as buying and baking with seasonally fresh and locally grown ingredients or explaining fair trade products and why you would consider using them (\\"hey this chocolate cake is made with chocolate not picked by child slaves, cool!\\"). This book includes all sorts of ingredients differences (banana vs. flax vs. egg replacer), all the different kinds of sweeteners, along with a seasonal appendix as well as other \\"themed\\" lists.  Very thoughtful, helpful, and convenient.  We have made about 50% of the recipes in this book, and not one has been bad.<br /><br />The world of store-bought vegan baked goods is full of variables too often with dryish tasting results.  This book definitely proves that vegan baked goods hold their own and can and do taste better than their non-vegan counter parts.  My wishes for this book were that it had more savory recipes, and that the result quantities were a bit more specific.  A couple of times I have made standard size muffins planning on batter for 16, and getting batter for 7 or 8, so sometimes the book could better specify what size vessel would result in the projected quantity...but this aside, the recipes, clarity and info delivered in this book, absolutely qualify it as a must buy. You do not have to be vegan to enjoy, but you should like to enjoy really tasty, moist yummy baked things.<br /><br />For those who critize this book for saying that it uses Ener-g egg replace or Earth Balance too much - I would note that I have never used the egg replacer in any of the recipes that called for them, and I always try to use earth balance in moderation, all you have to do is switch out the ingredients with something else. The flax and water combo works fine in most dishes, or if its a sweet one bananas work wonders.  Coconut oil is a fine stand in for earth balance in most situations, and is by far a superior quality ingredient.  Don't be so nit picky folks, just like in all cooking use this book as a guide, but have fun and riff with the recipes. Maybe those oat bran muffins would taste more to your liking with blueberry jam inside instead of strawberry.  Or mash up that banana and melt some chocolate chips and use that as a filling instead. Remember the title is \\"The Joy of Vegan Baking\\"uy. You do not have to be vegan to enjoy, but you should like to enjoy really tasty, moist yummy baked things.

0316017922|5.0|I like the way Malcolm Gladwell writes, his style is light and easy to read but it makes you look at something in a different way. It's a different angle on success. Frankly, I always thought is all on the individual but I see his point,your parents, your parents' parents and so on will give you certain unique opportunities, beliefs and work ethics. It sounds like common sense but I never thought it through until now. I begin to think about my life and my parents.<br />I read all of Gladwell's three books and this one is my favorite. I loved The Tipping point, Blink not so much but this one I could relate my own life.<br />Two things I love about his books, one is that he has good stories to make his point and secondly, he summarize things, he wraps it up so it makes sense to you.<br />I look forward to his next book
B000YJ85VS|5.0|At 270 pages (including TOC, Indices etc), this book is packed with an absolutely mindblowing amount of insight.  I say that b/c most of the things described are things most of us seldom if ever consider. Yet they are far from trivial. All in all, this is about the most excellent book I've read. It's interesting, relevant, compelling and important.  Each chapter made me rethink things about my life that to date, have been axiomatic as far as I was concerned - and all the changes are for the better.  Dan Arielly is truly an admirable and amazing human being and this books contains 270 pages that shows how utterly brilliant he is<br /><br />I don't think I could find anything to complain about w/ this book, hence the 5 star rating.<br /><br />The strengths:<br />-It's very easy to read. I've read it several times and think about it frequently. I started reading the book at 10:30 PM one night and had it finished by 2:30 and I'm no speed reader (not to mention I stopped frequently to think about what I was reading)<br />-It's thorough.  Only once did I think \\"Yah but he didn't consider this\\" (It was in chapter one and my suspicion was not only incorrect, it actually supported his contention).<br />-It is interesting. Like I said, I couldn't put it down and provides food for thought like nothing I've read in a long time<br />-It's helpful - learning why we do counterproductive things and how to change is something everyone can benefit from.  I challenge anyone to read chapter 1 and say they haven't frequently made dumb decisions b/c of relativity<br />-It makes you think. And think, and think and think.  His optimism and passion for the subject matter is infectuous, yet not once did I feel like he was trying to hard sell me on anything, preach or anything other than just express his views.<br /><br />The book starts out with a story about a tragic situation that happened to the author and how he handled it.  It becomes readily evident that the author is a true humanitarian and cares deeply about making life better for people.  It also exudes an optimism that's really inspiring - yet does so completely indirectly and completely effectively.<br /><br />Chapter 1 is IMHO, the most compelling, mainly b/c it made me realize how often I did counterproductive things b/c of this phenomenon (and worse yet, when I did them I frequently thought I was doing the right thing).  If you've ever had a feeling like you're doing the right thing but getting consistently opposite results than you'd expect, it'll be particularly insightful.  In my case, I realized how insanely \\"pound foolish\\" I am even though I worked very hard to be \\"penny wise\\".  After all that effort I'd still have very little to show  for it and now I see clear as day why that was.<br /><br />The next chapter discusses irrationality of markets.  So much of what we learn in Econ is based on rational decisions and this really introduces so much to explain why 'efficient market theory' explains a lot but never works quite perfectly.<br /><br />The 3rd chapter, The Cost of Zero Cost will resonate with any American person to an extent that's hard to describe.  Not only did I notice how frequently marketers use this technique, but realized that it's the key to just about every Infomercial's success.<br /><br />The next chapter, The Cost of Social Norms is really cool but it's much different than the others in that we all know we do weird things when it comes to family and customs. It was a lot easier to accept b/c I already knew we did this - but not to this degree<br /><br />Following is The influence of arousal.  All I can say is YEP<br /><br />Then comes Procrastination and Self-control.  Personally I'm not sure i experienced this phenemenon very much but certainly know people who fit this category to a T. The implications for bosses is huge though, as well as HR departments and educators<br /><br />Next is the High Price of Ownership.  This is just so dead on it was like getting slugged over the head - I see this all the time, constantly and never once considered why it was.  Now I know<br /><br />Following is Chapter 8 - Keeping Doors open \\"Why Options distract us from our Main Objective\\"  - The title says it all<br /><br />Chapter 9 - The Effect of Expectations was very intuitive although something I was very familiar with b/c of my background.  Makes me wish I could sell a product generically called Placebo - I could market it as a  for so many different ailments I'd be rich - before the FDA and FTC locked me up.<br /><br />Chapter 10 - The Power of Price - To say I felt \\"Dumb\\" after reading this chapter would be a huge understatement.  But the good news is that my days of being a sucker are over and yours will be too after reading this chapter.<br /><br />The next two chapters deal w/ the Context of our character.

B00004Y6NW|5.0|This is a great album!  The lyrics are great and so is the music.  Some people say that Sultans of Swing was the best song on it, but I have to disagree.  I can't decide between \\"In the Gallery\\", \\"Wild West End\\" or \\"Six Blade Knife\\".  Heck, I like them all!  When I first bought this album years ago, I listened mostly to Sultans of Swing, but after listening to the entire album several times, the other songs really grew on me.
B000G7599Y|5.0|I got this set by chance. It was through the end-of-year reduction of 2008 (also, sadly, owning to the economic slowdown sweeping the world) that I found this collection particularly affordable. As a multi-year music listener, Böhm's renowned interpretation of Mozart's last six symphonies has been drawing my frequent returning to, however, when it comes to his early compositions, it was my serious consideration whether the whole set was worth buying had there not been any reduction.    Concerning musicology and discography, Mozart's symphonies are difficult to number and categorize, for many of them were composed when the genre had not received a definite character, which by following Haydn's path Mozart had helped to establish and prepare the coming of Beethoven's unsurpassable nine (though I would argue that Mozart's last three are the veritable incarnation of depth, loftiness, and brightness, from nowhere but Olympus could such music come).    As it happened, I was proved worrying too much. Whether in artistic or technical sense, this set deserves a wholehearted recommendation, and of course the price cut made it an over-qualified bargain. Going from the first to the last disc, we are presented an incredible panorama of how a great musical genius had been growing. Light and entertaining in the beginning (indeed many of his serenades and divertimentos are inseparable from the symphonies), through structure-widening and content-complicating phases, to the final sublimation which is robust and delicate, immense and clear. However, from A to Z they are perfectly satisfying, to which Karl Böhm and Berliner Philharmoniker are great contributors.    Given in a fine set which celebrated the 250th anniversary of Mozart, this set is great inside and tasteful in outer appearance as well. I bought it with another set also under Karl Böhm's baton, that is, Mozart's wind concertos and serenades. Together they marked my happy ending of 2008. Hope you also get one by good chance and in good humor.
0385340567|1.0|Another left wing artist, in this case Child, successfully alienates his core audience with his \\"Child-ish\\"  leftest political tripe.     The only Reacher novel I didn't bother finishing.
B001ED7C58|4.0|First, my review for the compilation itself, seperate from my movie-related opinion. This is where my 4 given stars are from. A lot of the songs on this album are fabulous. My instant favorites were from Iron & Wine and Rob Pattinson. Flat-out perfect, and even if I couldn't purchase the MP3s seperately, those two alone are worth the price of the entire album.  I really liked most of the other songs from the start, and I am growing love them. Supermissive Black Hole was already a song I liked, but it's getting *much* more play now. I still don't like Go All the Way, but then, I'm not a huge Perry Farrell fan. I'm also not a huge Linkin Park fan, but I do like the song chosen for the album. Tremble for My Beloved is okay, but it definitely doesn't speak to me like some of the others. Love Eyes On Fire. Cool song that I wouldn't have found otherwise.    Now, for my opinion on how the music relates to the movie.  I must admit, I was severely disappointed with all but Never Think and Flightess Bird when I heard the sample tracks. Mainly because in my mind, after reading the series I had an entirely different soundtrack chosen in my head. If I were in charge, I'd have hired Hans Zimmer. Edward and Bella are an epic love story, and I don't think a lot of what's here, or even what's in the movie that didn't make the album, is right for the story. And that's coming from someone who really does like the majority of the tracks. Great for a CW show, but I think some of the songs lack the depth thatI was hoping to find. In the movie there were too many guitar riffs that plyed during peak drama moments... I would have rather heard more moving orchestra or piano pieces. More of songs like Bella's Lullaby here on the soundtrack.    Speaking of which, I'd actually been hoping for something a little different for that song. Since Edward penned the song in the book, I was hoping for something entirely piano, and perhaps more melodic.    Anyway, I do like the album. Since I reconciledwith myself that just because many of tracks aren't the ones I would have chosen and liked the songs for what they are, I have enjoyed listening to it immensely.  Also, knowing that Stephenie Meyer listened to Muse and others while she wrote, and that they helped inspire her writing (something I only recently discovered), has helped me enjoy the songs as part of the Twilight soundtrack.

B001H5X7I4|1.0|I was very excited to watch this movie as I have loved a few of Ben Stiller's movies in the past such as Dodgeball, Zoolander etc. etc.  I also love Robert Downey's performance in Iron man earlier this year and thought Jack Black was great in Holiday, and Saving Silverman.  I even liked Tom Cruise's star turn as an evil media type in Magnolia.      Based on the above paragraph you would think that I would love Tropic Thunder?!?  I did not!  Not even close.  I shut it off after the director got blown up by the land mine.  That was it!  That was all I could take.  This movie was just too violent and gory and disgusting.  It was NOT intelligent satire.  It was just gross!!      Especially after seeing some recent news clips of the fighting in the Middle East I just couldn't find anything funny about how Mr. Stiller was depicting violence and gore.    It is a shame because the premise was great and Stiller is usually very adept at creating somewhat silly and benign satire.  AND the first few minutes with the fake trailers were HYSTERICAL!  That WAS satire.  Then it just got gross.  I can't even recall how many times I had to cover my eyes because what was on the screen was just gross!! And when I wasn't covering my eyes I wasn't laughing at the jokes either.  (they weren't funny) It is like Stiller and crew used up all their creative juices and monthly humor allotment on the fake trailers in the beginning.    Horrible movie!  Save your time and money and go take a walk and watch the sunset.
B001KVZ6C0|5.0|I'm going to try and do this film justice by reviewing it with as keen an eye as I can muster, but I fear I'll still fall far short of the mark ...so here goes...<br /><br />SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the best movie of the year for a couple of reasons. The first is that it is both compartmentalized and global at the same time. It harkened me back to my love of another favorite film of mine, [[ASIN:B00000F214 The Usual Suspects]], in which a man sits in a police station and tells his story in flashback. But any similarities between these two ends with the police station and their equally excellent scripts (sidenote: The Usual Suspect remains my top favorite film script of all time but this one's pulling up close).<br /><br />Slumdog takes place at a police station as young man named Jamal (Dev Patel) goes through a tortuous interrogation at the hands of India's police force. Having recently been on India's version of \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\" -- and answered all of the questions correctly so far -- he was whisked off to the local constables office on the possibility of having cheated. The show has had lawyers, doctors, physicists, and many other well-educated people on the show who didn't get as far as Jamal, so how did he -- a chai tea delivery boy -- get so far (only one more question remains and he'll have his million)?<br /><br />The story is complex, funny, grotesque, horrible and loving, all within the same breath. Each answer comes not from Jamal's limited education, but from his time on India's hard-bitten streets where he grew up an orphan along with his brother, Salim (Madhur Mittal). Having watched their mother murdered during a religious uprising against Muslims, Jamal and Salim had to make their way in the world on their own, their paths separating wildly and then re-merging, often years later. But during their younger days as little kids, they encountered a pretty young orphan girl named Latika (the amazingly beautiful Freida Pinto), whom Jamal finds an instant fascination with. And it is his fascination and love for her that will drive him for the rest of his young life ...which include his chances on the millionaire show. Separated time and again (including thanks to the departure from his brother as he falls in with some very bad gangsters), Jamal never gives up his quest to be with her, even when it seems impossible.<br /><br />It is Jamal's remembrances of his street life that are the hardest to watch, making for some gritty scenes (and some funny ones, including a scene where Jamal must jump down a latrine hole in order to escape and get a much-wanted autograph from a local movie star). Forced child labor is nothing new in India's slums, and it is brought into nauseating focus as we watch kids beaten, deformed (\\"Blind singers earn twice as much\\") and sent onto the streets to beg for money ...all at the hands of adults wanting to take advantage no matter the cost.<br /><br />The stories back and forth nature (like the aforementioned The Usual Suspects) was a great way to show Jamal's life in a bubble. The audience really, really, really cared for him and wanted to see him win (the show I went to had audience members applauding -- loudly -- when the film ended), showing how well the script was put together and how well acted the film was by these relative unknowns (the only actor I was familiar with was Irrfan Khan who was in another favorite Bollywood film of mine entitled [[ASIN:B000U2U0E4 The Namesake]] ...note: see that movie, too!)<br /><br />Hollywood should take note of this film, and apparently has as the Golden Globes have come out with their nominations (2008) and listed it among four categories (Best Director, Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay).<br /><br />One final note: This film is truly an independent, tolling in at $15 million for production costs. I've seen much, much lesser films (in terms of quality) that had a budget ten times that. But one can't forgetthat filming in India is much cheaper than here in the States. Still, Hollywood, take notice! This is what great cinema is all about.<br /><br />Oscars! Here comes Bollywood!he States. Still, Hollywood, take notice! This is what great cinema is all about.     Oscars! Here comes Bollywood!
B000127LW2|5.0|Very simply, my favorite of all the star treks.<br />Love voyager and really wish they would do a movie since it ended after only 7 seasons.  There was alot more they could have done.<br />In any case,  5 stars for Voyager.
B000002IM7|5.0|Where does one begin when decribing this band? There's so many different categories that King's X could fit into, and yet, they stand alone. Imagine the best of Rush, Sabbeth, Pink Floyd, Zepplin, Hendrix and the Beatles all rolled into one, and that would only BEGIN to describe them! From the trippy opening track,\\"In The New Age\\", the beautifully haunting \\"Goldilox\\", to the thundering final track \\"Visions\\", a more perfect album you'll never find(until you purchase \\"Grethen Goes To Nebraska\\"!). Yes, there are elements of their faith throughout, but they are never preachy or in-your-face with it, so even non-believers can enjoy the brilliance that is King's X. Still my favorite disc of theirs after all these years!
B00004VXF2|5.0|Wow, what a killer album! What's this \\"noise\\" everyone is talking about? All I hear is an hour worth of pure Heaven. The awesome vocals that express pure emotion with poetic lyrics over crazy drumming and virtuoso guitar playing really make this album special. My favourite song is the second one, \\"Part II\\", which is really danceable. Too bad it only has four songs, I'd love to hear more! Music to my ears. Who needs that junky \\"Transformer\\" cal when you have this gem of an album? \\"Part III\\" totally spits over all of his Velvet Underground work, as well as his solo stuff. Anyone who rates this under 5* will be accused of blasphemy!
B00000AFWW|5.0|This is a much more mainstream record than other Hole releases. The Album description  references The Go-Go's & Fleetwood Mac as comparisons, I personally disagree. This arrangment is more like a rockier version of The Bangle's. I own each Go-Go record, and while playing this album they do not come to mind at all. I believe the comparison's might be due to the lead singers having a similar sound of singing. Stevie Nicks & Belinda Carlise share the deep contralto vocals, as does Courtney. If you notice, the Bangle's main vocalist sounds nothing like this, therefore, they aren't referenced even though the Bangle's musical arrangements are more identical. The guitar style of this album is nothing like that of the Go-Go's or Fleetwood Mac. I could even hear some REM similarities, or even Tom Petty, or the Pretender's. The guitars are acoustic, twang-y and share a rock n roll. The Go-Go's are more punk, and use electric guitars, but I digress.<br /><br />Something else that stands out in this album are the background vocals. The harmonies throughout the songs adds to it's perfection. Boys on the Radio and Heaven Tonight are unbelievable.<br /><br />I don't understand how anyone could dislike this outstanding collection. I read ALL of the 1 star reviews and many of the consumer's are let down by Hole referring to them as Pop-sell-Outs and other bands like L7 are much better and would never do such an album. I beg to differ... L7's &#34;Bricks Are Heavy&#34; is very polished and more on the lines of &#34;Celebrity Skin&#34; in contrast to anything else they've done.<br /><br />Am I the only person in America that's heard &#34;Pretend We're Dead??&#34; how much more Pop can you get? or &#34;The Masses Are Asses&#34;, &#34;Monster&#34;, &#34;American Society&#34;, &#34;Wargasm&#34; &#34;Diet Pill&#34;? What about all those songs? they're all very &#34;Celebrity Skin&#34; if you ask me, And &#34;American Society&#34; sounds like Bananarama if you ask me.<br /><br />I bought this album in 2004, I heard of the band and Courtney Love my whole life but I never got around to hearing the band's wickedness until one night...

B0000028M7|5.0|Even though \\"DIRT\\" was released back in the early '90s, it still sounds as fresh and current as anything out there today. From the thundering intro of \\"Them Bones\\" to the haunting final track,\\"Would?\\", not a bad track on this disc. I wouldn't lump them into that \\"grunge\\" label. Yes, they're from Seattle, and yes, there are elements of that style in their music, but there's far more going on with their songs than just a  bunch of noise. Haunting lyrics from the late Layne Staley, and crunching riffs from guitarist Jerry Cantrell highlight their best release, and one that everyone should own.
B00005V0X5|1.0|This album is typical, cliche generic trash metal! LOL, I said \\"trash\\" instead of \\"thrash\\"!!!!! LOL!!!!! Anyway, this album is pathetic. Their best album is obviously \\"Risk\\". Skip this junk! All of the songs sound the same and Mustaine's anti-war statements are appalling. War rules!
B000002GK1|5.0|Like a punch to the face, this disc comes at you. From the opening track, \\"Rusty Cage\\"(my fave),it bulldozes it's way right over you, never letting up till the end. Heavy, down-tuned riffs pummel ones brain on the brilliant \\"Outshined\\", to the hair-raising wails of Cornell on \\"Face Pollution\\". This is the CD I put in when I feel like getting a speeding ticket! For someone looking to discover Soundgarden for the first time, this is the CD to get first. Highly recommended!!
B000PTYPAC|5.0|This album is real punk! Who needs that lame \\"Sex Pistols\\" band? We've got the best punk album ever, \\"Riot!\\", right here. Anyone who claims Paramoar is \\"emo\\" is obviously very ignorant, we have hardcore punk right here! Hayley Williams is one of the best singers ever, better than the manufactured Patti Smith, PJ Harvey or Nico crap. If you want to hear one of the best albums ever, you should check out \\"Riot!\\" right now.
B00133KFGW|1.0|So, so bad.  Sort of a \\"Oliver Twist\\" - boy deprived of his rightful destiny, in this case musical genius; and his misadventures while \\"following the music\\".  The film had so many plot holes that made it absolutely impossible to buy into the story.  I never believed from the get go that the two musicians fell in love, that they could never have found each other earlier, that a baby could be born and given to an orphanage without the mother's consent or even knowing what really happended, etc. etc.  The dialouge was insipid and contrived; the dialouge during the scene where the two musicians have their once in life time one night stand;actually made me cringe it was so melodramatic and stupid.  This movie is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen because of it's pretentiousness while it actually insults the intelligence of its audience.
B00005IC2H|1.0|You heard it here, you delusional souls! \\"Ambient\\" is another word for \\"boring, dull and pretentious\\"! What's so special about this album? The dumb atmosphere? I say you listen to a Madonna or Britney Spears album if you want atmosphere! Sigur Ros are so stupid that they don't even know how to write properly- note how all of their songs are in a made-up language. They thought, \\"Hey, let's be cool and not pass kindergarten and make music with two chords on the guitar and mess around with a piano and people will worship us!\\". Sigur Ros are dumb one-trick ponies who will do anything to take your money. Support REAL music- KoRn, Nickelback, Metallica, Taylor Swift, etc. Avoid this Agaetis Byjurn crap like the plague.
B0014YPEI4|5.0|Just purchased this item. This is the most accurate Allosaurus replica available short of an expensive museum statuete. Papo has done it again.  Stance, detail, it is all here. If you collect dinosaur figures, this is a MUST HAVE!!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This is true country music! Almost as good as Carrie Underwood. Leave it to Taylor Swift to make a classic album. Who needed that \\"Folsom Prison\\" Johnny Cash junk? We have the true country legend right here! GO TAYLOR!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|There Will be Blood is EXCELLENT. I have not seen filmaking of this quality in some time: Consistent brilliant acting, flawless directing, phenomenal music, great editing, etc., etc. Daniel Day Lewis owns every scene he is in.      TWBB stands alone in a vast sea of \\"&^%$ films\\" that are coming at us at an unprecedented scale. It is refreshing that hollywood has taken a risk in creating a film of this nature. Hopefully we can have more (knock on wood).
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Nostradamus is 100 minutes of pure bliss! Not lame false metal stuff like \\"Painkiller\\" or \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\", \\"Nostradamus\\" is TRUE METAL! The non-cheesy vocals, intriguing concept, razor-sharp drumming and killer riffs make this easily their best album! No Spinal Tap here! This is definitely the best album of their career.
B000000OAC|5.0|My sister wanted this item on CD to replace her outdated cassette tape. Found just what we needed at a great price, shipped quickly. Couldn't be more pleased!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Spectacular movie. Must have........ The movie is long. The story is intertwined with many, almost too many, messages and themes. It makes for one of those movies that you want to see over and over again to pick up everything.  Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is in the stratosphere. Top 5 movie villians in my rating. Michael Caine as Alfred should be a Best Supporting Actor nomination if not the all out winner. Christian Bale will be forever known as \\"Batman\\". He has set the bar!  The Psychology of Batman segment on the the \\"Extras\\" DVD is brilliant. Little is said about Heath Ledger (RIP), but plenty on the Joker character. This will remain one of my favorite movies of all times.
0525951113|5.0|At thirty four years of age, Matthew Sobol, the genius behind successful CyberStorm Entertainment dies from brain cancer.  However, the brilliant game maestro would not allow something as petty as death preveng him from causing global havoc from the grave.  He somehow kicked off a war from cyberpsace against mankind.<br /><br />Concerned authorities enter Sobol's mansion in Thousand Oaks, California only to find themselves under attack in spite of the fact that no human is inside or on the grounds; the police suffer several deaths as they retreat.  Sobol has left behind the greatest weapon of mass destruction ever created; his daemon computer processor has taken control of most of the world's major computer systems and has signed up brilliant quisling humans as foot soldiers to carry out the plan for world domination.<br /><br />DAEMON is a fabulous futuristic AI technology thriller as the twisted but brilliant late computer game creator Sobol sets in motion a doomsday machine after he dies.  The story line is fast-paced from the onset even with complex vernacular as Daniel Suarez assumes his audience can do more than breath and chew gum refusing to dumb down his tale.  Readers will relish this superb science fiction book with a great finish that sets up AI part two.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
0321200683|5.0|If you are looking for a book on messaging, this is an excellent book. It is a very good source of learning messaging technology if you are a novice in this area. It is also an excellent source of advanced knowledge for more experienced IT professionals, who may be interested in more details and would like to see a structured approach to messaging.    In many situations messaging is an excellent way of integrating applications in an enterprise. However, messaging is not the best solution for all the integrations needed in an enterprise. There are many other ways of integrating applications and Service Oriented Architecture provides a more comprehensive method of integration as it encompasses many different technologies including messaging, RPC, sockets, ORBs, and ESB. A book by the present reviewer with the title \\"SOA-based Enterprise Integration: A step-by-step guide to services-based application integration\\" provides a more comprehensive description of the integration patterns. The book is being published by McGraw-Hill in May 2009.
0812548094|3.0|Just finished reading Stone of Tears, and it is definitly middle of the pack.  The books are well written, and are entertaining.  However, the swiping of ideas from Brooks and Jordan are pretty common.  Any reasonable person has to admit the book lacked originality.  Darken Rahl being Richard's father was the worst(Luke, I am your father. Noooooo! Ben, no wait I mean Zedd, why didn't you tell me.)  Overall, worth reading while you are in between other books.
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was my favorite book of the Twilight series by a mile!  The plot takes the most fascinating turns in its final installment, and it was very difficult to put it down. I am really quite shocked to read some of these negative reviews, and I think there would have been an even bigger uproar if things had ended differently...
1416562591|4.0|Adiga has written a unique novel which is at times wonderfully funny and at times disturbing.  His tale of the lowly born Balram (i.e. The White Tiger) is on the whole entertaining.  The book charts Balram's desire to rise above his lowly status and the treachery he commits to do so. I think this book falls short of a 'great' read - because the wit and humour in the main character falter as the book goes on. At times the author wallows in brutal realism. However the perspective is wonderfully refreshing, and the material thought provoking.  Well worth a read!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|there are many movie soundtracks that dont include every song from the movie and that is always a downer. this cd is quite the opposite. everysong from the movie is in it and they are all in order
B00005JKCH|5.0|What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain.<br /><br />After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.<br /><br />**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.<br /><br />**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.<br /><br />**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say \\"Oh hey!!!\\" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the \\"oh hey!!!\\" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, \\"hey what's up,\\" and more close could be running up and giving them a hug).<br /><br />**There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day.<br /><br />**If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that..<br /><br />Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight. Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment.ime they happen to meet up by chance, they would say \\"Oh hey!!!\\" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Ok to start it off I was writing this as a 5 star review and then a friend said to me how much better of a character The Joker was with Heath, than with Jack....hold on really. To me that was the kicker, I thought Heaths Joker was great (but maybe overhyped by fans and critics due to the tragedy that befell him, after all very few will speak ill of the dead) but, Jack's Joker carried the movie, he was stellar and he was as smart or smarter than batman. Thats always been the kicker for Batmans and the Characters, they are often ordinary people, few powers, but the villians are maniacal (with both Heath and Jack do fantastic), and intellictual, which come out in the writing of the Joker but I did not see in Heath's portrayal. So to me this movie is so much more complete, however has two flaws, 1. I am disappointed that anyone states Heath is better than Jack, and 2. The 2 face character was in then out, they developed his backround then he was gone....he was not really a villian or a part of the movie
B00004T0P1|5.0|a classic cd perfect for somone who is a huge dinosaur fan. the songs are splendid

0956010903|5.0|The book is beautiful!  I bought it as a Christmas Gift and looking at the current selling price for new & used it has become a good investment.
B000002JSP|5.0|I went back to listen to this record after I picked up the Plant/Krauss combination which worked so well (has Grammy nominations) since I always liked this album and the country tinged \\"Hot Dog\\" was one of my favorites with its upbeat pace and humor/fun - it always seemed like that to me.    The only reason there is anything that is negative about this record is that Zeppelin was always up against themselves (with IV, Houses of the Holy and others rock classics) but this was the first record I heard as a new when when I was young when my older btoher bought it home, so I did not really have many preconceived notions about the band or what I wanted to hear from them.    From the openiing of \\"In The Evening\\"  to the end of \\"I Am Gonna Crawl\\" this is a solid record and a change of pace and style from other Zeppelin Albums, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade isn't your average diva. She doesn't do red carpets. She's never done intimate, sit down interviews with Oprah or Barbara Walters, made millions publishing the first photos of her baby, or used her image to promote perfume or lingerie (although that would be interesting). Most of all, she and the band release music when they're ready to. That's almost unheard of in a world where most artists will churn out bland crap at rapid fire speed in order to top the charts. Sade's an anomaly in that way by playing by their own rules and yet they're still on top. Since 1985's Diamond Life and counting.<br /><br />Using elements of jazz, funk, soul, pop, chillout, and world music, the exotic British-Nigerian songstress took the music world by storm with bandmates Stuart Matthewman's sax and guitar, Paul Denman's bass, and Andrew Hale's keyboard by her side. Can't forget backup vocalist Leroy Osbourne who's been on board since 1988.<br /><br />The bossa nova single Smooth Operator caught the ear of listeners everywhere with it's sexy sax and tale of a heartbreaker whose \\"eyes are like angel's/But his heart his cold.\\" Your Love Is King is a sophisticated dedication to a super lover who makes Sade's \\"soul sing\\" and Hang On To Your Love is the advice given to couples  \\"down on luck\\". The downcast Jezebel tells the story of a young woman selling her body in order to make it in life. \\"It would seem she's on her way/It's more, more than just a dream/She put on her stockings and shoes/Had nothing to lose - she said it was worth it... Every winter was a war she said/I want to get what's mine.\\"<br /><br />Released as the first single from the follow-up Promise, The Sweetest Taboo became the group's next hit and signature song. Opening and closing with the sound of a light rain, Sade is caught up in the \\"quiet storm\\" of a man whose love is beyond words. However the explosive torch song Is It a Crime longs for a no good lover you can't shake off. Sade steps away from her usual icy vocals for a more expressive delivery and knocks it out of the park. The single version of Never As Good As the First Time benefits from Leroy's warm background vocals and a lively, sweeping production.<br /><br />After a 3 year hiatus, the band returned with their most misunderstood album Stronger Than Pride. Moving completely away from jazz, the peaceful, almost hushed Love Is Stronger Than Pride mixes Sade's airy tone with Leroy's rich vocals. The tropical jam Paradise picks up the tempo and the funky Nothing Can Come Between Us is a certified head nodder.<br /><br />Love Deluxe (a precursor to neo-soul imo) brought back the jazz of the band's earlier work. The underwater rhythm of No Ordinary Love became another hit and featured Sade as a lovestruck mermaid in the memorable video. \\"Keep cryin' for you/Keep tryin' for you/Keep tryin'/And I'm fallin'!\\" The beautiful Like a Tattoo, while not a single, makes a well deserved appearance on the compilation. It shares the story of a war vet Sade once met a NYC bar. Although it'd been years since his experiences, \\"the war is still raging inside of me\\" and would forever haunt him.<br /><br />I could listen to Kiss of Life on a constant loop and never get tired of it. Such a jazzy, ethereal song that's positively high on the very idea of love. \\"When I was led to you/I knew you were the one for me/I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat/When I lay eyes on you/Ay ay ay/You wrapped me up in/The color of love!\\" Sade's silky vocals, the band's intoxicating groove, and those lush strings! I love everything about it. I've never heard the band as old school bluesy as they are on Please Send Me Someone to Love, a cover of the \\"heal the world\\" Percy Mayfield tune.<br /><br />Another song I never get tired of is Cherish the Day. The single version retains that hypnotic guitar and airy atmosphere with heavier drums added in. \\"I cherish the day/I won't go astray/I won't be afraid/You won't catch me running... Won't run away/Won'tshy!\\"<br /><br />The emotional closer Pearls tells the woeful story of a Somalian woman \\"scraping for pearls on the roadside\\" in order to keep herself and her young daughter alive. \\"The sun gives her no mercy/The same sky we lay under/Burns her to the bone/Long as afternoon shadows/It's gonna take her to get home/Each grain carefully wrapped up/Pearls for her little girl.\\" Sade's shouts of \\"Hallelujah\\" will grip your heart and refuse to let go. Powerful.<br /><br />Sade once said that it was her dream to use her music to attract people from all different races, backgrounds, and walks of life. It's safe to say she and the band have done just that. Sampled by rappers (Krayzie Bone), covered by rockers (Deftones), and admired by pop stars (Beyonce and Christina Aguilera), Sade continues to follow the beat of their own drum and we wouldn't have it any other way.n woman \\"scraping for pearls on the roadside\\" in order to keep herself and her young daughter alive. \\"The sun gives her no mercy/The same sky we lay under/Burns her to the bone/Long as afternoon shadows/It's gonna take her to get home/Each grain carefully wrapped up/Pearls for her little girl.\\" Sade's shouts of \\"Hallelujah\\" will grip your heart and refuse to let go.

B001GQO50I|3.0|The only thing I can think of is that new listeners/younger first timers hearing the Doors have an advantage over us old hard-liners.   I have owned The Matrix Tapes (2 Disc) on Swingin' Pig Records for about 18 years and have listened to it once maybe twice. The reason being is it is such a bad recording it is very difficult to take listening to even though I believe it is un-cut and un-edited. I purchased this recording of those nights and was surprised to be able to hear it, even though if these were first-generation recordings as the packaging says they should sound better than they do.  I guess the surviving Doors may have been thinking that this recording would be interesting for new Doors listeners due to the time and place they were recorded and so for that reason alone I would give it a 3rd star - why they didn't release this as an unedited set who knows - I think that might be one of those questions for the ages.  If this is any indication of the past releases of the Doors recordings - it will probably be re-released again as have their original albums numerous times - maybe we'll have another opportunity to pay $20 plus for a re-mastered version of this show with 2 bonus tracks.  What's next Rhino? - The best suggestion I would give to them is to try to reproduce \\"The Stages\\" box-set - in my opinion that is THE best package of Doors material authorized or not.   I really liked the album cover and the photos on the inside - that would also be a plus as far as the star ratings go as well.
1433502410|5.0|I guess I've become a collector of Bibles, as I now have several.  Some are study Bibles while others just have the scriptures.  I keep adding to my collection as I expand my translation horizons.  With this Bible I believe I've found a work of art.    This Bible has maps, 200 of them throughout the book and not just in a section in the back.  It has a cross-referenced concordance, it has notes as few other Bibles have.  And the price is very reasonable.    It is hard to call this Bible, or any other for that matter, \\"definitive,\\" but this one comes close.  It raises the bar on study Bibles that few future producers and editors will be able to match.  While one can say \\"scipture is scripture\\" this Bible pushes the creative envelope to new heights.    I guess what I'm trying to say is I really like this Bible and recommend it to any student of the Bible.  The notes will aid in comprehension.  In the past I've resorted to Bible handbooks to fulfill my quest for interpretive notes.  This Bible has good notes throughout.  Note that I still will use my handbooks, but this Bible enablesme to bring it to my Bible studies without needing to lug my handbooks along with me.    Buy this Bible, you will not be disappointed.
B001GQACGE|1.0|I don't know where to begin. It's all a bit too try hard, especially DIVA where she comes across very obnoxious. I'm disappointed. Single Ladies and Sweet Dreams are the only songs I can stand. The rest are too bland to listen too.    As they say in the hood, Puff Puff Pass!
B001O8D47S|1.0|This movie is neither intelligent nor humorous.   While I am unfortunately acquainted with women who are as self-indulgent and insipid as the women in this film, I would certainly never waste two hours with them.  Why then waste two hours with \\"The Women\\"?      This film may have been tolerable had the characters not been turned into caricatures. Jada Pinkett Smith as the \\"lesbian\\", Eva Mendes as the \\"mistress\\" and Annette Bening as the \\"feminist\\" were cartoonish.    Meg Ryan's portrayal of the betrayed wife was completely flat and all I can say about the Debra Messing character is that it defies description.       This movie is a complete waste of time.
0316017922|4.0|Outliers is book about how culture and community appear to be greater determinants of individual success than talent or even will. It's about how successful people, \\"are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. . . . It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.\\"<br /><br />Outliers begins with a look at why certain five-year-old boys enjoy an advantage in ice hockey, simply because they are born in the first 3 months of the year, and because of that advantage, they are generally bigger than their peers who were born at the end of the year. It explains how these advantages accumulate over time. We learn what Bill Gates, the Beatles and Mozart had in common: along with talent and ambition, each enjoyed an unusual opportunity to intensively cultivate a skill that allowed them to rise above their peers.<br /><br />The author even compares 2 geniuses to show that middle and upper-class children have more opportunities to succeed. He compares the lives of two geniuses -- Christopher Langan, a man with an IQ of 195 who was virtually shut out of higher education: he grew up in poverty and says he was beaten by his stepfather from when he was almost six to when he was about fourteen. The other individual was Robert Oppenheimer, who grew up with every advantage, tried to poison his mentor at Cambridge University and was still allowed to continue his studies. The author dismisses the notion that the \\"gifted child\\" who scores at the top of intelligence tests has advantages. He states that some smarts are necessary for success, beyond a certain level they don't give any addition advantages. He also tells us that since life is so unpredictable, \\"luck\\" to a certain extent plays a role in determining someones success, in addition to being born at the right time, to the right social class, or being in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, however, I thought it was a bit strange that all of his examples were male-based. He either chose not to address the topic of successful women, or maybe successful women do not fit into this model? I guess I'll just have to continue to wonder about that one!ss, in addition to being born at the right time, to the right social class, or being in the right place at the right time.

Now I can't lie, I've been a fan since the mixtape days when the Unit was still grinding . Now they do have skills and are good rappers. The problem they have is over saturation, if you put out to much product in just a few years your gonna run outta things to rap about. Now by the time this CD came out 50 Cent already had over 15 CD's worth of material out there including GRODT. Now for someone to have so much material out like that and then be barely dropping a sophomore album, what would you expect?<br />This is not the best album you'll ever hear, as a matter a fact its about a half & half album. I was disappointed but not by the whole album. I should have known it was coming though because you could tell from his mixtapes he was going down hill. Most of you already know how the CD plays out so I'm gonna break it down, what he should of kept and what he should of got rid of, like I said before its half & half.<br /><br />  -----THE GOOD-----<br /> I'm Supposed to Die Tonight<br />  Candy Shop<br />  Get in My Car<br />  Ski Mask Way<br />  A Baltimore Love Thing<br />  Ryder Music<br />  Disco Inferno<br />  Just a Lil Bit<br />  Gunz Come Out<br />  Position of Power<br />  Hate It or Love It<br /><br /> -----THE BAD-----<br />  In My Hood<br />  This Is 50<br />  Piggy Bank<br /> Gatman And Robin<br />  My Toy Soldier<br />  Build You Up<br /> God Gave Me Style<br />  So Amazing<br />  I Don't Need 'Em

You'd think this never happened in the history of mankind, from the relentlessly grim way that Harrison Ford plays it. You'll laugh every time someone calls him \\"Dutch.\\" I liked the relaxed soundtrack, though. Why this has to go on for over two hours, I don't know. It's silly soap opera to the core, but it's not the worst movie of its ilk ever made.

B000JIHP88|5.0|We have twin girls and wanted something for them look at while they were falling asleep. We read the other reviews about this mobile and bought it, and we love it! They LOVE watching the animals go around and the leaves going up and down. We usually use the rainforest noises which are very gentle, while we play lullabys on our iPod. The classical music is really nice, too. The best thing is that it plays for a long time. I've heard other people say their mobiles only go for a few minutes. We never use the light feature, but maybe when they get older and we take off the mobile part the light will come in handy.    The girls were in separate bassinets in our bedroom and there was no way to attach this, so we (eek!) attached it to a dining room chair and put it between them. It worked out great and we could move it to our living room for when they were in their Pack n Play. Now they're sharing a crib and the mobile fits great. Our the crib bars are round and decorative, so it doesn't fit as well as it would if they were square, but it's still sturdy and I'm not worried about it at all. The first time our daughter saw it from directly underneath, she started laughing! I'm online today to buy a second one so they can both lie centered under their own mobiles, instead of watching from the sides!

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", the new film from director Danny Boyle (\\"Trainspotting\\", \\"28 Days Later\\") is the foreign film break out this year. There is always one. One film containing believable characters, an interesting story and great filmmaking that attracts more than the core audience of foreign film aficionados. \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is the film that will play in multiplexes across the country.<br /><br />Jamal (Dev Patel, BBC America's \\"Skins\\") is a contestant on the Hindi version of \\"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire\\" and he is doing quite well, surprising everyone even the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), an oilier version of our own Regis. Jamal reaches a very high plateau just as time runs out. Join us tomorrow as Jamal goes for the big 4 million-rupee question. As Jamal and Prem walk backstage, two cops take Jamal in and begin interrogating him. A little slum dog like him could not possibly have the intelligence or knowledge to make it this far. Doctors and professors don't make it this far. He must be cheating. Who is helping him? How is he doing it? Thus begins \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", director Danny Boyle's newest creation and a film that easily erases any memory of the travesty he last perpetrated on us. (That was called \\"Sunshine\\" and I don't recommend it. At all. In fact, sorry to bring it up again.)<br /><br />As Jamal sits in the police station, the Inspector (Irrfan Khan, \\"A Mighty Heart\\", \\"The Namesake\\", \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\") shows a VHS tape of the show he was just on, starting with his introduction. Everyone politely applauds as Jamal enters and Prem tries to get a few personal facts out of the young man. When Jamal manages to make the audience laugh, at Prem's expense, the tides turn and Prem, always aware of his status as one of India's biggest personalities, is a bit taken back. But as he is being watched by millions of people, he laughs it off. They start with the easy questions and Jamal answers the first.<br /><br />For each of the questions, we revisit a part of Jamal's life, watching how he grew up in the slums, the lengths he would go to to get an autograph from one of his favorite stars, a particularly harrowing stay in an orphanage right out of a Dickens's novel and much more. We quickly get the rhythm director Boyle wants to show us. Jamal is able to answer all of these questions because he has experienced something in his life providing him with the answer. It is almost as though he is fated to appear on the show at this time, because all of the questions seem to be written for him, catering to his knowledge.<br /><br />The film presents an episode from Jamal's life to give us the background on how he obtained the knowledge necessary to answer the question. And as we watch these moments, most form the coherent narrative of the young man's life to this point. Early on, he becomes an orphan, living on the mean streets of Bombay with his older brother, Salim, and an orphan girl named Latika, whom they befriend and adopt. As Jamal grows up, he makes decisions that will affect his life based on Salim and Latika. In fact, early on, he develops a love for Latika, believing her to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Throughout his life, she is always on his mind and he desperately wants a reunion. Again, the fates seem to step in.<br /><br />As the story follows many twists and turns, Jamal, Salim and Latika end up in an orphanage where all the children are expected to sing, literally, for their supper. When they achieve a certain skill, the director of the orphanage uses a truly Dickensian method to eke more money out of the children's earnings as street performers and beggars.<br /><br />Jamal does not have an easy life and all of these harrowing moments are shown to us, giving us a unique portrait of what his life is like and a snapshot of the time and place.<br /><br />As a young man, Jamal's infatuation with Latika (Freida Pinto) knows no bounds and he tries to relocate his brother, now awell-known enforcer for a local gangster, in the hopes of locating her again. When he finds out she is the 'kept' girl of the same gangster, he decides to pay her a visit. He soon realizes he must have money, to help them both escape, and decides to appear on her favorite show, \\"Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?\\" He figures any money he wins will help them and his appearance will also attract her attention, proving his love and devotion. More, it will provide a sort of calling card to her, hopefully prompting her to take the next step and meet him, so they can run off together.<br /><br />He surprises himself when he realizes he knows most of the questions.<br /><br />At first, Prem is entertained by the little 'slumdog' sitting in the chair opposite him. His appearance could only help improve the already outstanding ratings of his show, and increase his already great star power. But Jamal gets over his stage fright too quickly and begins to verbally spar with the host of the popular show. Then he begins to answer many questions right.<br /><br />How is he able to answer questions that doctors and lawyers have failed at? Therein lies the story.<br /><br />Prem tries to maintain his show's reputation and the suspense by drawing things out as much as possible. When they reach a high plateau, he is happy to realize they have run out of time. The 'slumdog' will have to return tomorrow. His director and producers are thrilled, but Prem is happy to see the police take him away.<br /><br />Directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan and written by Simon Beaufroy (\\"The Full Monty\\"), \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is very close to a perfect film. Boyle and his co-director weave a stunningly complex tale of three young people who start out the same and follow their lives down different paths. It is the lifelong love Jamal has for Latika that will bring them all back together in a completely rousing, believable and very romantic finale.<br /><br />Naturally, there are moments as terrifying as others are amusing. Yet, Boyle achieves a fine balance making them all seem believable and taking us on a journey through many emotions. One moment we might laugh at Jamal's predicament, the next cry at his misfortune. The remarkable thing about this is that Boyle manages to make everything seem natural, to flow with ease. Nothing ever seems forced or cinematic.<br /><br />Quite honestly, there isn't a single thing I can think of to criticize about this film. No false steps, no story holes, none of the acting sticks out for the wrong reasons. What is clear is that Boyle and his team film many scenes in India, on the crowded streets of Mumbai, in the slums, making the film all the more authentic. I know this must seem like a given, but it is difficult to control all of the elements of a film shoot on any actual city street. When you multiply the crowds and decrease the size of the streets, the job becomes all the more difficult. Yet, there are a surprising number of scenes set outside in Mumbai and in very wretched, horrible looking slums.<br /><br />There have been more than a few films in the last few years to use game shows as part of the story, providing a certain amount of dramatic subtext to the main character's story. Generally, these seem forced and don't really work. In \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\", there is a key difference; the game show host is a character in the film, involved in the story and the game show is used as a framing device to show us various key moments in Jamal's life. This technique is so much more inherently engaging it makes all the difference in the world.<br /><br />Even the overly romantic nature of the climax seems well earned by the viewer and fits with the rest of the story.<br /><br />Boyle is a very good filmmaker who takes his time and seeks out the right projects. When he finds the right project, because there have been missteps (\\"Sunshine\\", \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\"), he knocks them out of the ballpark.of locating her again.

B001GQACGE|1.0|If you are reading this trying to decide whether or not to buy this album, don't. I would like to recommend 3 excellent albums as an alternative-Janet Jackson's 2008 \\"Discipline\\", Toni Braxton's 2005 \\"Libra\\", and Deborah Cox's 2008 \\"The Promise\\". I went online and listened to samples of all the tracks from Beyonce's \\"Sasha Fierce\\",and they were all so trite and bland-totally left me with the impression that people only buy this album because 'hey, it's Beyonce!' I seriously don't get why crap like this sells so much better than the really good R&B records. True; Janet's record label quit promoting \\"Discipline\\" after one single, Toni's label never bothered promoting \\"Libra\\" at all because they were too busy with JoJo (another brainless wannabe like Beyonce), and Deborah is on an independent label that probably doesn't have the resources for a big promotion blitz. But even so those three all put out awesome albums in their most recent outings, and heavy promotion or not there was still enough buzz about their albums that fans knew they were coming out-and yet none of those albums got ANY attention at all! And Toni/Janet/Deborah have all worked hard over the years and paid their dues! All Beyonce does is get in the studio, throw a bunch of tracks together with hardly any thought-and yet she sells just because her name is Beyonce?!!?!!!?! C'mon people, wake up and go for the real R&B talent-and stay away from Beyonce!

0596522347|5.0|If you ever need to give PowerPoint (Or Keynote) presentations, this book should be on your desk. Slide:ology, written by Nancy Duarte, is a well-designed and easily readable book that gives you an excellent overview on how to create great presentations. Hereby, the book focuses more on the generic concepts as slide:ology is not a dedicated step-by-step how-to book for using PowerPoint. Rather, it is more of a style book with highly inspirational qualities. In my opinion, the most valuable information gathered from the book is how it changed my way of thinking when preparing presentation slides.    I particularly liked the the chapter on color theory and typography; topics that are probably more often than not ignored by many professionals while preparing their slides. Another section that I thought was very good is `Classifying Diagrams' starting on page 44. This section provides a library of graphical forms and shapes that give you a good starting point for designing your own illustrations.    The book is loaded with case-studies and examples that tie together all those theoretical pieces of information quite nicely. For example Nancy Duarte's company Duarte Design helped Al Gore with his influential presentation about global warming.    As mentioned above, the book is fairly neutral in terms of presentation software used. Occasionally it provides some tips for using e.g. PowerPoint, but Slide:ology is fairly high-level in that regard. If you are looking for a more hands-on guide to use PowerPoint, you may want to look elsewhere.    Slide:ology certainly emphasizes the creative aspects of creating presentations, which is a good thing. Notwithstanding, one recommendation for improvement would be to include a chapter for the time- and/or resource-constrained presenter. Let's face it - in many organizations/departments, it might be difficult to nearly impossible to get your hands on a first-class designer who churns out those nice looking graphics as shown in Nancy Duarte's book. In that regard it would have been nice to have a chapter that addresses that issue.    Lastly, slide:ology also has its own website at [...] which is essentially Duarte's company blog. Nevertheless, it contains a wealth of additional information and it is certainly a good companion to the book. Overall, I highly recommend this book. May it help reduce the vast amount of mediocre presentations out there.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|We received this movie as a Christmas gift.  We attempted to watch it while the kids were watching another movie downstairs.  We forced ourselves to watch the first half hour before we decided it was so not worth our time and the title had nothing to do with the movie - except for the first scene, at the airport.      The great line up of performers gave us false hope in thinking this was going to be an entertaining movie.  The lack of storyline listed on the back cover should have been our first red flag.      Some of the storylines could have been made into something worth watching - like the stepfather/stepson relationship or maybe even the Prime Minister and his secretary. But because they jump around between so many storylines (mostly shallow and self-serving, oh, and don't forget the porn dropped in for what, shock affect?) it was way too difficult to make sense of any of it.  Porn is not our thing and has NOTHING to do with love, neither does a guy who thinks he's a sex-god but constantly complains he can't get a girl.    Whoever thinks this movie portrays LOVE has never experienced true and lasting love.  This distorted view of love is a major part of the reason our world is in the state it is in.  True love is about self-sacrifice and putting someone else before your own desires.  IF you actually want LOVE, in the true sense of the word this is the wrong place to find it.    Love, actually, has nothing to do with this movie.  Hard to believe but Wall-E is a better romantic comedy.  At least the two robots put each other first and take care of each other.  The kids had the better entertainment option for the night.  Lucky them.
B000V9C7CO|5.0|Opeth has become my favorite band!!! I have downloaded every album of theirs off of Amazon. Deliverance is surely no exception as it is one of their heaviest albums to date. I watched the making of Deliverance and Damnation on Their DVD \\"Lamentations\\" and it has the genius influence of Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree who contributed great ideas and musical contributions as well. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about any of their albums I love all of them as well as their concert DVD's. I can't wait to see them when they come back to the US!!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Our children received this as a Christmas gift and wanted to watch it the first night they got it.  And they've wanted to watch it every night since.  As parents we found ourselves laughing and cheering on the robots.  The animation is incredible and who would've thought you could make a captivating love story about a trash compactor?    There is no content or inuendo to be concerned with for children of any age.  It was clean, wholesome, family fun.  Pixar did a GREAT job and should be commended.  They should take note and make more inuendo-free movies.  Another homerun for Pixar - like Nemo.    We had no trouble with our dvd (we did not get it from Amazon) nor do we know anything about deleted scenes as we did not see it in the theater.
B00008G8LF|3.0|\\"Anna and the King\\" is full of beautiful Cinematography, competent acting and some moving points of story line but overall it missed continuity.<br /><br />The whole romantic subplot between Anna and the King was either far fetched, or Anna, wasn't the kind of woman that the story leads you to believe.<br /><br />The plot of the war between Burma and Siam was much more interesting, but the \\"British as bad guy\\" theme, although likely true, came across as a bit ham fisted and lost credulity with me. Much more interesting than that, was the view of changing cultures at crucial turning points, progressive or traditional, begs the question \\"What is necessary to survive/ if we do that will we still be who we are?\\" This movie has a couple of heart wrenching examples. Today the whole world deals with similar questions.<br /><br />So the deal is for me, this is a movie that you have to be in a mood for.<br />3*
0670019925|5.0|I love reading a David Lodge novel and can never wait for them to appear on the book shelves.  I haven't as yet completed reading this one and am still relishing every word and wacky situation he conjures up. I find his characters and situations totally credible and the predicaments described of encroaching age in this novel, insightful as they are sad and perversely humorous.<br /><br />Rarely, oh, so rarely does a novel actually bring one to physical laughter but I have enjoyed laughing out loud many times while reading this novel. My thanks to David Lodge for a splendid, well paced and written novel and please don't keep me waiting for the next one. And no, I am not connected to any book publisher or marketing concern; I just appreciate talented and humorous writing that has a touch of the best of British to it.
B0019HQIGS|2.0|First off, I'm a major John Mayer fan. I have all his CDs, along with the \\"Any Given Thursday\\" DVD. I think he's very talented, both as a musician and as a songwriter. I'm still a fan, and am eagerly awaiting his new CD later this year.<br /><br />So why did I give it only two stars? Overall, my disappointment is a result of the song list. I like the songs themselves, but there aren't enough upbeat tunes in this concert. Obviously the acoustic set is subdued, but most of the \\"band set\\" is comprised of slower songs as well. It leaves a final reflection of \\"Well, that was a sleeper of a show.\\"<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />I like the idea of splitting the DVD into three sets of different genres: solo acoustic, blues rock, and the full band set.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of interview time (much shot while John drives his car around town) spread across the disc.<br /><br />On the down side:<br />The acoustic section is painfully boring. Even though \\"Daughters\\" and \\"Stop this Train\\", are basically acoustic numbers anyway, I don't think the songs in this set translate over to straight acoustic well. And he ruined \\"Train\\" by substituting the piano part with whistling - that just seemed awkward. Even when he brings other musicians onstage to share the guitar duties, it still feels empty. And his version of Freefallin' is just plain horrible. He trudges through it like it's a dirge.<br /><br />I know he's expanding his blues skills, but when he nonchalantly played aimlessly wandering blues licks between (and during) songs it was more annoying than entertaining. Ditto for the \\"Slow Dancing on Mulholland Drive\\" section, which is just him talking and playing more blues runs. By the way, that \\"special feature\\" is only about five minutes long, barely worth listing on the package.<br /><br />If you like the John Mayer Trio CD then you'll be pleased with the second set. It's done well, with a good amount of backstage footage of John, Pino, and Steve.<br /><br />The 'band set\\" should have had more of his older songs. Of the nine songs in this set, seven are from Continuum. Since the \\"Thursday\\" DVD came out prior to Heavier Things, he should have included more songs from that CD on this video. It's unfortunate that, with the exception of \\"Something's Missing\\" on \\"Thursday\\", there is no live footage from that album available. And as I mentioned above, many of the songs he chose for this set are slower ones, which drained the excitement out of what could have been an electrifying performance.<br /><br />That's my opinion of this DVD, but seeing how many four and five star ratings others have given it, maybe you shouldn't take this review too seriously!<br /><br />If you're at a toss-up of which live JM DVD to buy,I would suggest \\"Any Given Thursday\\" over this one.
B00000JG41|3.0|3 1/2    This was a little tough to digest upon release, although soon enough Bungle's take on even more genres including doo-wop and adult contemporary bled through suitably enough. Not every track can match the transcendent power of their finest genre mix-ups, and California's minimalist pseudo-sincerity, as opposed to Volante's dense chaos, often makes these compositions either resonate hauntingly or fall apart in vacant experimentation because for the first time the band dabbles with actual straight forward songwriting.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|When I saw the previews for Wall-E in theaters last spring I decided I had to see it.  I missed it in the theater, but finally rented it last week.  What a treat!  I didn't even think about the lack of dialogue.  The story is enchanting, the characters are charming and recognizable (I know someone like M-O)and the overall effect is pleasing on so many levels.  I watched it 4 times and then decided I had to buy it.  The vision of the possible future of the human race is disturbing, to be sure, but delivered gently and with humor.  A lot of careful thought went into this movie.  I recommend it wholeheartedly.
B00000HZH7|5.0|This album is great. The lyrics are great and so is the music. This could be Possessed greatest album they have realesed.And for all those retards saying that death metal should be funny and that they dont know how to sing and play and that their lyrics suck, what kind of music are you listening to?? (Poison, Cinderella, Faster Pussycat). This is a true DEATH METAL album and I recommend this album to anyone who loves great riffs, vocals, and satanic lyrics.BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
031606792X|2.0|Spoilers below. Duh.        Well, let me just start out saying that I completed the whole series in less than a week. I just finished Breaking Dawn and I am already here writing about how I cringe at the lack of satisfaction.    I do have to give you this... The wedding, the honeymoon (pre-pregnancy debacle), and Bella being a vampire storylines were incredible. My heart raced with Meyer's almost-excessive description of Bella's emotions, for example during the wedding. I also enjoyed Meyer's subtle humor she implanted on many of the characters although I can remember no single scene through my anxiety, of which you will experience should you choose to continue reading!    This is where my positives end and negatives begin. Pregnancy? Where did that come from!? Uh, how about NO! They get married and WHA'BANG, she's pregnant. I feel as if the pregnancy and subsequent baby Renesmee pages within the book could be torn out and burned. Seriously! (Don't get me started on the naming of the child too, Renesmee? I couldn't pronounce that even on the last page!)     As for the lack-luster, passionless Bella-becomes-a-vampire, thing wasn't spectacular either. Granted, IT FINALLY HAPPENED (there is a God!), but how the whole affair is described... Edward rips Bella's womb open with his vampire-serrated teeth and subsequently injects her dying heart with his venom with a syringe! Where's the intimacy? Where's the passion? (I guess I am biased though. I think he should have just let her become a vampire back in Twilight. Damn, Carlisle... suggesting Edward suck the venom out! Who does that!?) The whole series was building on the impending neck bite by Edward, turning his love into an immortal. Meyer destroys such a satisfaction for readers! Would a vampire snarl and gritted teeth be appropriate here on my part? I think so.    As for the fight with the Volturi... A big problem is that it NEVER happens. Meyer keeps building and building. She carefully describes the \\"abilities\\" ofall the characters and when it comes down to using it in a real fight... Well, Bella does her shield thing and all is honky dory by page 739. I would like to see some supernatural dismemberment here!       Speaking of \\"abilities,\\" I feel like this whole super power thing got way out of hand. Isn't it enough to allow for the MERE EXISTENCE of vampires (and shape-shifting wolves)? I accept that Alice's ability to see into the future and Edward's mind reading ability added to the story but, it became EXCESSIVE when it seemed that everyone had a talent for something! I think the mere existence, the out-of-world thought that vampires exist among us would be QUITE ENOUGH to move a great storyline along.     I recommend borrowing this book from someone else who made the mistake of paying for it, like me!    I plead to Stephanie Meyer, could WE PLEASE HAVE A REWRITE!? PLEASE! (And forget having the stupid baby! That was undeniably the worse plot twist ever!)
1400082773|5.0|I decided to read this book to find more about the man the world has enthusiatically endorsed as its new leader. That may seem funny to US citizens but in a survey in Australia over 70 percent of people said they supported Senator Obama . With all its power and influence the US calls the shots certainly it does in Australia . When reading the book I thought at time Obama was concentrating on the US Black / White issue as he said he might in the introduction. But thinking more I believe the book is more about the human condition. It is great that he has had such experience in some many environments hawaii, Indonesia, Kenya, New York , Chicago to bring to the presidency. I felt empathy to all the people he described so well even thought I have not had his experience as a white middle class australian.<br />He writes as weel as his speeches and I truly hope HE CAN  bring new hope to a trouble world.
B000OCZ80Q|4.0|This ballet was made available in three different video formats; DVD, HD-DVD, and BluRay. My version was the HD-DVD version, but in all formats the ballet is the same. First of all Nureyev is not dancing in this ballet. I think the Ad is somewhat deceiving. The principle dancers are Agnes Letestu and Jose Martinez. They are excellent dancers, and as you will see from the extreme close-ups of the principles, they both \\"sweat blood\\" in their efforts to entertain us.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give this production a five star rating is because I did not like the ending. You may call me old-fashioned, but I want to see good triumph over evil, which does not happen in this story. Swan Lake is a story ballet, and is NOT just dancing to beautiful music. This is the second ballet in my considerable collection in which Nureyev came up with a terrible ending. In The Vienna State Opera Ballet.....[[ASIN:B0007P0LPC Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake]].....production with Dame Margot Fonteyn, he had Siegfried drown in the Lake of Tears as Odette swims away to remain a Swan-Maiden for all eternity. Plus, he had on more make-up than Margot Fonteyn. In this version, he has Rothbart flying off with the Swan-Maiden clutched in his talons as Siegfried writhes on the ground unable to help her. Again, she must remain a Swan-Maiden for all eternity. I HATE that, period.<br /><br />NOTE: I must make a correction here, because I misunderstood an important aspect of the meaning of this version of SWAN LAKE. This entire ballet is a dream by Prince Siegfried from beginning to end. The poor Swan Maidens are NOT doomed, because they never existed except in Siegfried's dream. This was brought to my attention by Mr. Robert Campbell for which I am grateful.<br /><br />This is an HD-DVD (also available in std def and Blu-Ray) and will NOT play on anything but an HD-DVD player. It has excellent resolution in HD. I wonder though, why the video producer thought we needed 12 to 14 close-ups of the ballerinas hands, and their feet? Letestu and her partner are wonderful dancers, though, I thought she lacked the sad expression Odette needs as the trapped Swan-Maiden. I thought at times her expression was rather bored. She was very good as Odile, and Siegfried warmed up to her portrayal of \\"Odette in disguise\\" gradually, and did not act like he knew her when she first appeared. Letestu gives a good account of herself in her mime role, both in the second and fourth acts. Color and lighting are well done in all four acts and the excellent music is stereo and surround. The running time to end of curtain calls is 140 minutes, and the screen format is 16:9<br /><br />The dark psychology thing of Rothbart being in all four acts hovering on every move of Siegfried was way overdone, in my opinion. Why do people think they need to psychoanalyze Tchaikovsky's mind forever? I think that is what Nureyev is trying to do here, using the freakish spectre of Rothbart haunting Siegfried's every thought.<br /><br />The corps members of the POB were superb, but messed up by an overzealous button pushing production manager. Why have a beautiful weaving line of ballerinas and then ruin the effect by shooting close-ups of them? That sort of thing was done all through this ballet. It's good that the theater patrons did not have to see all of the close-ups. The button pushers think they are being artistic, but they know nothing about the art of the ballet. The artistic director of the ballet company should put a stop to their enthusiasm. I spent thirteen years in a TV studio, so I know a little of what I speak.r feet?

0440178002|5.0|Clavell does an excellent job in providing the reader an idea of what  Japanese history and culture were like.  The book mirrors the warrior atmosphere in Japan while the Europeans searched for new lands to claim.      The honor of the Japanese, their strict traditions, and fierce battles are well depicted.  To mix all of these into a love story is magnificent.  This is a thriller, sad story, and historic novel all in one.
B00007KWHN|5.0|The Yes Album was the breakthrough third recording that established the band. The Yes album marks the introduction of the extended works that characterized the Yes sound through the seventies and eighties and also highlights the coming and going of key band members who contributed to that sound. The Yes Album marked the arrival of guitarist Steve Howe and the departure of keyboardist Tony Kaye (to be replaced by the more synthesiser oriented Rick Wakeman during their most successful period).     \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" kicks off the set with a classic chopping riff from Steve Howe and a stirring organ from Kaye, reminiscent of western movie soundtracks. Bass player Chris Squire and drummer Bill Bruford (later of King Crimson and others) add energy and pace to keep the piece moving through its interesting twists and turns allowing keyboards and guitar to interplay with vocals.     The lyric, sung by Jon Anderson, is most definitely a hang over from the sixties (\\"Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face. Caesars Palace, morning glory, silly human race. On a sailing ship to nowhere leaving any place. If the summer change to winter, yours is no disgrace.\\"). 40 years later, I still love that imagery, although to be honest, I have little idea what it is all about. You love or hate the ethereal, sometimes choirboy, quality of Jon Andersons voice, and if you love it, he could be singing a shopping list for all that matters.     A live version of \\"Clap\\" is a fun interlude. It is a ragtime like piece - popular in the UK folk circuit at the time - allowing Steve Howe to demonstrate his guitar virtuosity. Although this may seem to be a filler, it sets up the next track beautifully with a similar acoustic guitar section to bridge \\"Life seeker\\" and \\"Disillusion\\".     \\"Starship Trooper\\" is composed of three pieces. Andersons \\"Life Seeker\\" again features Kayes stirring organ, Squires \\"Disillusion\\", with aforementioned guitar, and Howes \\"Wurm\\" which is basically a riff building up to a crescendo which works wonderfully at full volume. Budding guitarists can work the \\"Wurm\\" riff out by sliding a C chord up and down the fretboard - you are on your own as far as the stratospheric guitar solo goes.     \\"I've seen all good people\\" opens up what was originally side two of the vinyl recording. Made up of separate parts by Anderson and Squire, the second part \\"All good People\\" works as an introduction to \\"Your Move\\". This will be my last dig at Yes lyrics, but \\"Your Move\\" appears to be a treatise on love and chess ... \\"don't surround your self with yourself, move on back two squares. Send an instant karma to me, initial it with loving care, yourself...\\" opines Anderson. A beautiful song nonetheless - with a recorder and organ adding depth to what would have otherwise been just pleasant. \\"All Good People\\" crashes in with the powerful rhythm section, augmented by the organ, driving the vocal and guitar lines.     \\"A Venture\\" once again provides an interlude between the longer tracks, this time allowing the bass and guitar to work together in what would become a signature sound of Yes - Chris Squires percussive bass snap and Steve Howes squealing guitar. A jazzy piano solo ends the track.     \\"Perpetual Change\\" again features the characteristic guitar bass sound in this Anderson/Squire composition, that partnership also to become a central feature of future recordings. As a single piece rather than an amalgam of separately composed tunes, \\"Perpetual Change\\" flows more smoothly, when it aught to do, and is a more satisfying piece - presaging the longer works of future recordings, not least \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\".     The standard length of a recording made for vinyl recording was about 45 minutes. This re-issue and remaster includes two singles (\\"Life Seeker\\" and \\"Your Move\\") excerpted from extended tracks and a studio version of \\"(The) Clap\\" so you are really not getting much more music than the original.
B001ED7C58|4.0|It took a few times through, but I do love this CD.  I'm not a kid (48), but I love \\"Super Massive Black Hole,\\" by Muse, \\"Full Moon\\" by The Black Ghosts and \\"Tremble\\" by Collective Soul.  The whole CD is great, even for an adult mom!

0517548232|5.0|This book has only one lesson to teach: economics consists of looking past the immediate to the potential. It teaches this lesson in the first five pages.      The remainder of the book is the lesson applied.  Through the use of many different scenarios, Hazlitt demonstrates that economics is never just a two party trade between a buyer and a seller, but a three party trade, between a buyer, a seller, and the potential buyer/seller.  The immediate obscures the potential. Hazlitt does an excellent job of uncovering the potential and showing the scenario played out in full.     He describes the economic consequences of things such as war, union labor, minimum wage laws, price fixing, and rent control.      The best thing about this book is that it is easy to read and comprehend.  Each topic is only three to ten pages long which makes it very manageable and retainable.     This is the first book I recommend to anyone wanting an understanding of economics.
B000I0QL82|5.0|First, an important disclaimer.  I am not a big fan of the classic Hollywood song and dance films of the 30s and 40s.  While I respect the great talent of the performers of this era, this genre is simply not my taste.  But because my wife enjoys great dancing, I will watch a film of this sort from time to time.    I was surprised at how much I enjoyed \\"Holiday Inn\\" given my natural interests.  I sometimes find the story line of these classic musicals to be a little on the thin side, but this plot, while still slight, held the musical numbers together well.  Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire portray two entertainers dueling for the same girl.  Crosby woos with his voice and Astaire courts them with his dancing.  I was pleasantly moved by Crosby's singing, especially of \\"White Christmas,\\" and was astonished, even as a non-dancer, by Astaire's marvelous moves.  The supporting actors and actresses are also classy and capable.    This film deserves its status as a classic and is a great choice for the Christmas season or for any time during the year.
B001C08RHA|3.0|Perhaps I heard too much praise for this movie from others before I watched it, but it did not live up to my expectations.     While the action scenes were great, the rest of the movie was often slow. The ending action sequence was disappointing. It was action for the sake of action and didn't quite work. My husband and I laughed, not in a good way, at the action scenes in the end and earlier when Pepper Potts helped Tony Stark change the device in his chest. Talk about cheesy.     Robert Downey Jr was awesome. Jeff Bridges, until the end, which I already mentioned was very good too.    Terrance Howard's and Gwyneth Paltrow's characters could have been played by just about anyone. They both have talent but were not used effectively. Gwyneth was treated more like a Bond girl but one with no charisma. Terrance's character was bland. Gwyneth's was too cold and unapproachable. All she seemed to do was to walk around in tight dresses with big high heels. Boring. There was a glimmer of a good actress in there but as played, they could have substituted any model for her role.
B000063V8T|4.0|Season 5 is a weird one.  It features some of the very best episodes in the series' entire run, but also quite a few really weak ones.  That's in contrast to the 3rd and 4th seasons, which weren't uniformly brilliant but had a fairly strong sense of quality control.    As far as the classics - \\"Inner Light\\" obviously tops the list as probably the best in the series' entire run, but it's closely followed by \\"Darmok\\", \\"I, Borg\\", \\"The Perfect Mate\\", \\"The First Duty\\", \\"Cause and Effect\\", and \\"Conundrum\\".    The clunkers list is unfortunately just as long, headlined by \\"Imaginary Friend\\" and \\"New Ground\\".  There are at least half a dozen episodes that are comfortably skippable on repeat viewings.  Not sure whether the writers got lazy, were pressed for time, or simply ran out of ideas.    Nevertheless, this package is worth getting for the great ones.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|A strong, water-tight follow-up to \\"Batman Begins\\" as only Christopher Nolan could deliver.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" reunites Nolan and Christian Bale, who once again dons the cape and cowl of Batman in his ongoing war against crime. Returning to the fold, as well, is Gary Oldman as Lt. Jim Gordon who enlists additional aid in the guise of Gotham's daring new District Attorney Harvey Dent. Dent, portrayed impeccably by the incomparable Aaron Eckhart, is hellbent on bringing down as many crime-lords as he possibly can. That campaign is quickly and boldly challenged by a rising criminal mastermind known only as \\"The Joker,\\" who aims to thrust Gotham City into ceaseless chaos and force its brooding Caped Crusader into crossing that fine line between praised hero and reviled vigilante.<br /><br />Make no mistake. This is every bit as gripping and character-driven as its immediate predecessor. You have Christopher Nolan's masterful storytelling coupled, once again, with the outstanding talents of a first-rate cast nobody could even remotely request any better of. The standout performance here, it should go without saying, is that of the late Heath Ledger. Forget everything you already know about Jack Nicholson's legendary Joker performance. Mr. Ledger takes the character to a brand new level of disturbing realism that no film in this franchise has ever previously explored. It's equal parts dramatic and, at some points, downright creepy. He really knocked it out of the park.<br /><br />The overall tone of this movie is what ultimately makes it so very satisfying. It's dark, it's moody, and as with \\"Batman Begins,\\" it never once delves into the realm of corny candy-coated kitsch. This is straight-ahead, pull-no-punches action from start to finish.<br /><br />And, if you're any type of fan, you shouldn't be disappointed in the slightest.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" hits the bullseye, squarely and decisively.
B001AQO3WY|3.0|Generation Kill gives great insight into the daily life of a Marine on the frontline in the early days of the Iraq War, but it falls shorts in almost every other way.     The series special effects made me cringe...for a series made in 2008, it is completely unacceptable. Helicopters and fighter planes look terrible, bullets and weapons effects are not believable(neither are the explosions), and even the blood and gore is clearly fake. Now I know special effects do not make a great film, but it does help immerse the viewer in the experience.     I guess the special effects really are not that big of a deal anyways, considering there are only a few scenes in the entire series that really show them off. As far as action goes, the series is just plain disappointing and borderline boring. The directors obviously did not try very hard on making the battles look authentic. The actors playing Marines do not move cohesively like Marines, the enemies actors are made out to look like static targets, and the firefights simply look fake...it almost made me feel like I was watching some Marines thrown into a shooting corral or some type of training course. It just simply did not seem believable to me.    Whether these problems with the special effects and action scenes are due to budget problems, or just plain laziness, is beyond me. All I know is that is seriously took away from the overall feel for me.     Now where the series does hit home is with the overall mood and reality of being a Grunt in the middle of a rather confusing conflict. The Marines of the 1st Recon company are constantly running into supply problems, intel mishaps, problems with their terrible Officers, and simply not knowing who to shoot at. It really shows the mind set that these young Marines have to be in when doing their mission, and how they execute it. The directors really did a amazing job in that sense.  ________________________  Pros:  +Decent acting.  +Realistic setting and theme.  +Great insightinto the mind set of a Marine during the early days of the Iraq War.  +Authentic gear and historically accurate.  Cons:  -Bad action scenes.  -Terrible special effects.  -Anti-War vibe(this is questionable, but most people will agree).  -Unrealistic and Unfair representation of PTSD in the field.    Overall \\"Generation Kill\\" is worth watching, but in no way comes close the glory of \\"Band of Brothers\\", and the similar series \\"Over There\\".
0439023483|5.0|Very much a \\"Running Man\\" or \\"Death Race\\" knock-off, but well done! I was surprised to find out that it's a supposed trilogy. Can't wait for the next one! Katniss is a bad you know what!
0375703764|5.0|It deserves more than five stars. For the sake of this review, pretend that a five-star rating on Amazon is some incredibly rare thing that almost never happens, except for the most deserving of all works.    \\"House of Leaves\\" is a very difficult book to describe. To take a stab at summarizing the plot in one go, it's about a hedonistic young man with a troubled past working in a tattoo parlor who discovers a blind man's life work: a lengthy academic criticism of a documentary that doesn't exist. The documentary is called \\"The Navidson Record,\\" and tells the story of a famed photographer who moves into a new home with his family, only to discover that the house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.    If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. This is an intricate, surreal monolith of a novel, told from the perspective of several unreliable and probably even insane narrators. Depending on your interpretation, some of them may or may not even exist. Maybe none of it does.    Much attention is paid by readers and critics to the unconventional structure of the book, both in terms of formatting and plot. The word \\"house\\" is constantly written in blue, in every use and in every language. Stories within stories within stories are told through footnotes, appendices, and asides. Every once in a while, a simple internal citation will devolve into pages upon pages of apparently meaningless lists of names, books, or films, some of them fictional, some of them real. It certainly is a unique approach to telling a story.    But of course, fancy visual tricks and impressive packaging aren't worth a thing if the story itself isn't. Fortunately for anyone who picks this book up, it is. It really, really is. Within the full-color, maddening pages of \\"House of Leaves,\\" Danielewski tells much simpler stories of isolation, depression, brotherly love, sibling rivalry, romantic love and the struggles of keeping a marriage together, bouts with drug abuse and meaningless,self-immolating sexual escapades. Though it might seem like an overly dark novel, it's interspersed with flashes of beauty reinforcing Danielewski's overarching message that love can hold strong in the face of that darkness. It's sentimental without being anything near sappy, and represents true human nature in all its strengths and weaknesses in a way that few artists can.    While it's certainly not for everyone, I would recommend \\"House of Leaves\\" to any open-minded, well-read individual, and certainly to anyone interested in surreal, genre-defying art. At the heart of it, though, it's a book about human struggles that everyone can relate to, presenting common themes without even dancing near cliché. It's certainly one of the most important novels of the 21st century, and one of the best I have ever read.

055357342X|4.0|This series was recommended to me by a friend and I fell in love with them. They're not always the happiest of books, but that keeps me guessing as Martin seems willing to part with some general fantasy norms.  Definitely a good read.
B00003CXIP|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A maudlin movie which coasts on a wave of pure nostalgia to its shattering anti-climax of a conclusion, Stand By Me is inexplicably beloved despite being a completely forgettable film: unless you happen to love the song Lollipop or want to see lots of boys crying and hugging, stay away.

B000FGGE68|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Slightly redeemed only by the fact that the director's tongue is in his cheek for most of the movie (I hope), Ultraviolet is a thoroughly unimpressive sci-fi action movie with an uninteresting performance by Jovovich in the lead and no real story to speak of: look elsewhere.

6304806418|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Though some of Evita's musical numbers have some flash, the movie feels overlong and oversimplified; there is definitely a movie to be made about the controversial Eva Peron, but this isn't it.

B000683VI4|4.0|The Bottom Line:    The Notebook is better in its \\"past\\" sequence than its \\"present,\\" but overall the movie is well-acted and succeeds in creating a likable couple and maybe bringing a tear or two to the eye.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|I was very excited to see this production only to be dissapointed by the bad choice of camera angles and too much \\"Shakey Cam\\".  I have yet to get pass the first three episodes.  I undrestand the effect they were going for, use of a steady cam to simulate actually \\"being there\\" but to use it when a couple is lying in bed having a conversation is ridiculous.  I found it annoying to watch.  The crooked camera angles are reminiscent of the old 60's Batman series.  I found it very distracting from the story being told that I just had to turn it off.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Expertly directed, painfully acted, and shot in a way that makes the 19th century London setting come alive, The Elephant Man would still not be such a great movie (which it is) if it wasn't for the humanity that pervades every minute of the film.

B00005JKED|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Though it's refreshing to see Denzel Washington play someone who isn't a saint, his character is evil just because the screenplay demands it, not because of any intrinsic reason; as a consequence, the movie never manages to be about anything but itself.
B001F290E4|5.0|This cd is so good. Before this purchase, I had never listened to any of his music but this music is wonderful. Seal has a very good voice and does this old school music much justice. If you love old fashioned soul music, this cd is must purchase. You will enjoy every song.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A thoroughly pedestrian biopic that retailors the real story so much that it should probably be called \\"Johnny Cash as Written by John and June\\" (case in point: the song Walk the Line was written for John's first wife, not June) Walk the Line fails on almost every level aside from its performances.
B001O6W9QC|2.0|I had high hopes after reading the reviews and hearing the hype.  However, for me, this movie fell flat.  I found it more stupid than humorous.  I came away disappointed.
B000NIVJHM|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Dirty Dancing, despite being considered a classic in some quarters, is a tepid romance whose screenplay connects the dots in such a way that every part of the movie is guessable from the very beginning; watch it if you're into this kind of movie, but otherwise stay far away.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album single-handedly made me want to rock out in a garage and form a band of my own. I think people will look back at this album and see it as better or at least just as good as Nevermind. There is just a sense after you listen to all the songs together that the album you just listened to meant something. I still can't pinpoint all the ways it affected me, but it holds a huge place inside my musical world. I think Weezer's strongest asset was their accessability. You might have heard them on the radio, the doctor's office, heck they even put the 'Buddy Holly' video on the Windows 95' sampler! They took all the great parts from all their influences; huge guitars from Nirvana and Boston, soulful solos from Queen, melodies from the Pixies, the synth rock of the Cars, vocal harmonies from the Beach Boys, and shred from Quiet Riot. What was unique was Rivers' personal introspective lyrics. He could be called the founder of emo rock, but I doubt he'd appreciate or acknowledge it. I would never in a world call Weezer emo, but it's funny how much their lyrics sound like some of the new stuff. This album has fantastic guitar work and musicianship. Moreover, if there was one album in the 90's that I could listen to tracks 1-10, no skipping, over and over....it was this one. The songs are all amazing; cleverly crafted pieces of ear candy that make you want to come back for more. But there's also a real depth, in songs like The World Has Turned And Left Me Here which appealed to me as a confused young teen at the time or the epic , and I mean epic, Only In Dreams. Those solos are like fireworks at the end of that song all the way to classic let the bassline finish out the song. Speaking of basslines, let me just say I respect Matt Sharpe for what he gave this band. His basslines are awesomely simple, but he throws fills in that are sometimes hard to hear and they are tasty. As many know, he left the band after the only album that compares to this one, Pinkerton. I think if Matt Sharpe was still in the band that they would have their edge still. He would jump around and just give off pure energy at the live shows, something Rivers REALLY needs to get back in the habit of doing. I think Say It Ain't So is the quintessential song from this album though. I still can't describe what is sounds like to me. I mean the chorus and solo are face melting, but then there's the tender, jazzy clean solos that Rivers pops in between the verses and the upstroke, almost reggae rhythm guitar with the slinky, slow bass line. Awesome song, INCREDIBLE album. Just take a look at this albums stats for christ's sake. There are barely any 1's, 2's or 3 stars for this. Out of 500 some reviews, 440 go for 5 stars. That truly has to say something. And I whole heartedly agree with those 440, count me as 441. Old school Weez forever! (flashing =w=)
0790742780|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Falling Down is an intelligent and often blackly comic drama with an impressive performance by Douglas in the lead; it's probably not as high-regarded today as it should be, and it's worth seeking out.

B00007BKVC|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A mediocre chicks-on-the-run film with inexplicably bizarre scenes (a passing biker blowing marijuana smoke into a car trunk which houses a captured cop?), Thelma and Louise may have an iconic last scene but it's not an interesting, enjoyable, or particularly-good film.
B001KVZ69I|4.0|Let me start by saying that I will probably never again be trusted with choosing the family after-Christmas movie again.  I knew there would be sad tones and sad themes given that it was a Holocaust movie.  But I thought that since it was from a child's point of view it would be more palatable.  And for the most part it was, and probably because it was from a child's point of view.  But the ending was anything but palatable.  It was dark and terrible even by Holocaust movie standards.    The story of a young son of a concentration camp commandant who befriends a Jewish boy his age on the other side of the wire may sound a bit implausible to die-hard history buffs, but it definitely makes for a fascinating premise.  And so the viewer (or reader, as it was based on a novel) is very interested in seeing how it all plays out.    What surprised me most about THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS was the light-hearted and sometimes even downright humorous moments.  The great paradox is to find oneself chuckling during a light scene only to be suddenly jolted out of one's humor a mere second or two later and brought back to the reality of what the film is about.    The acting by all cast members is superb, but especially by the two principal boy actors portraying Bruno, the 8-year-old son of the Nazi commandant and Shmuel (pronounced SHMOLL), the Jewish boy who is prisoner in Bruno's father's concentration camp.  Their on-screen chemistry far surpasses that of most adult movie stars in the industry today.    The primary problem I have with STRIPED PAJAMAS is I have no idea who this film's target audience is meant to be.  Perhaps adults, but most adults would be able to handle a more realistic (by \\"realistic\\" I simply mean in terms of graphic content) portrayal of the Holocaust.  This film is certainly violent, but virtually all of the violence occurs off-screen and is implied.  (The filmmakers did an excellent job of shocking the audience more by what is not seen than what is seen.  Especially at the end.)  The target audience may also be children, but I would not let a child of mine watch this unless they were at least 11 or 12 years of age and were able to handle this kind of subject matter.    Overall, STRIPED PAJAMAS is one of the best films I saw in 2008.  I don't recall hearing any profanity, and surprisingly there was no gratuitous violence.  If a Holocaust movie could possibly be a family movie as well, then this was one.  But take care, for this was also the most thought-provoking movie I saw in 2008.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|The Bottom Line:    A capable adaptation of the always-interesting, sometimes-brilliant Firefly, Serenity benefits from Chiwetel Ejiofor's exceptional villain and Whedon's wry humor; it's not a classic, but it's an effective movie.
B000UBMWG4|3.0|I am a long time fan of this movie. I have had a 42\\" wide format screen for movies only for five and a half years. I switched to a full Sony \\"Blu-ray\\" setup a year ago. I have three previous copies of this movie in various packages. I place this movie in my personal top ten list. This Blu-ray 5 disc collectors addition is a rather poor repackage that obviously had the minimum of effort put into it. Disc one is extremely poor rendition with very low quality color and green bands running through it on both the top and bottom. The \\"Directors Cut\\" is a copy of the standard definition print of a copy already in electronic archive. Color intensity in this copy is wanting but not as poor as the \\"Final Cut\\". I was hoping this would rise above but there was no effort to reproduce a high quality product. The standard def 5 disc set is much better quality. My guess is the Studio no longer has access to a high quality \\"master\\". It gets three stars only because I saw this movie in the theater and have followed it over the years along with the other Ridley Scott grand efforts in the cinematic experience.

B00004STDN|2.0|The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A preposterous movie about people in teeshirts climbing up and down snowy mountains with a cardboard-cutout performance by Stallone in the lead and a generic villain, Cliffhanger does not deserve to be watched, owned, or recommended.

0375826726|5.0|Although I was disappointed that this wasn't the last book, I thought it was well written and creative. I am looking forward to seeing how the last book wraps the story up. If you like dragons and fantasy I definitely recommend reading this series.
B00005K3OT|3.0|This movie follows an increasingly common theme.  Men are pretty much all pigs.  The only meaningful intimacies are between women.  The Johnny Depp character is very shallow and superfluous and provides only an unconvincing heterosexual love interest for Juliete Binoche.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it's an engaging film and worth watching.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I received this dvd for Christmas and knew I would like it since I am a Joss Whedon fan and was a huge fan of the \\"Firefly\\" series.  But I was surprised to find out how much I love it!     While the story is extra cheesy in Whedon style, the musical numbers are really first rate!  I never realized Neil Patrick Harris was such a wonderful musical performer.  Felicia's numbers were moving and memorable.  And Nathan's were perfect for him and his character: bigger than life and cheesier than Velveeta...    But what I was surprised about was the special feature \\"Commentary! The Musical.\\"  The songs on the commentary were almost better than the DVD's!  Some of the \\"jokes\\" are insider jokes that only the truest Whedon fans will enjoy, but I think most will find the songs overall funny.    I am soooo in love with Nathan Fillian's song \\"Better Than Neil\\".  It is so hilarious and the kind of song that is so catchy it should be on the radio.  I laughed and truly enjoyed all the rest of the songs!  The \\"groupies\\" definitely deserved their own solos as their voices are wonderful!  Neil Patrick Harris again blew me away... he has come a long, long way from Doogie Howser!      I have enjoyed this dvd much much more than I ever expected!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We received this as a gift from the same family that gave us [[ASIN:B0002TV2LU Ticket to Ride]] which we love. This game is even better for the ability to provide strategic thinking opportunities mixed with good old fashioned randomness. My youngest started playing at 9 years old and has actually won the game against adult strategists. The game plays differently with 5 or 6 players than 4 - not sure which I like better. But, both are fun, fascinating entertainment. We used to play cards - hearts, spades, pinochle but since these games came along as gifts the cards haven't been used much. We play this game at our lake house - which has no TV or computer, but I'm now purchasing one for the main house as we can't get enough of this game with just our time at the lake!
B00005JKHP|3.0|Star Trek the Motion Picture is fundamentally ok.  I don't regard it as the great reprisal of Star Trek.  There are a few areas where this film fails.  First, it is has a feeling of being overally romantic, and second, the lavish production was better than the storyline and characters.<br /><br />Just as an example for the overly romanticism here, The Ship, although redesigned effectively here, is shot too many times.  I agree that the Scotty and Kirk sequence around the ship was just entirely too long.  When you put this in perspective that the series had been off the air 10-11 years at this point, perhaps this was to serve as it's re-incarnation, but it was shot too long.  My Feeling on Roddenberry is that he was good with casting and with writing, but he was not a producer and never was.  He produced this movie and it feels he tried to reach for something but never made it there.<br /><br />Spock's character is something un-recognizable when he returns.  His familiarity seems gone.  Kirk and McCoy's dialog is weak as well.  I don't believe movie captured the relationship well betweek McCoy, Kirk and Spock at all.  (They later came back to it in the Wrath of Kahn, and by That Time, Roddenberry was not involved except for exec producer.  Harve Bennett saved the movie franchise from that point on along with direction from Nicholas Meyer and Leonard Nimoy).<br /><br />Star Trek the Motion Picture was lavish in production, short on storyline, but did re-introduce the crew back into the 80's so this movie is more historic than memorable.

B000P0J024|3.0|I know this set doesn't claim to be complete but why all the missing songs and videos?     I know of a Traveling Wilburys bootleg that is album length and full of demos and cover versions they could of taken from, perhaps on a fourth disc. Not to mention the B-Sides and extended songs.     But my real complaint is the cropped video. Why must they chop off everyones heads just to fill up your entire screen (1.78:1 new standard of course over the original 1.33:1). Anyone who knows anything about how a DVD's anamorphic widescreen works can tell you how it can better fill your widescreen tv, but in this case you're losing information on the top or bottom (or top AND bottom) of your screen. They do this to all the videos and the documentary. I'm shocked no one else has problem with this or has even noticed for that matter.     Back to what they 'left off': the Nobody's Child video. Hello!!?? What an oversight! But the most obvious piece they made that was left off this set is the original Wilbury Twist video. Presented here is the '2007 version', which is fine. But we catch a glimpse of John Candy and Eric Idle at the beginning of that version and wonder where they went. A quick visit to youtube and you can see the whole thing (while there you can see a bunch of other appearances the Wilbury members made around the 1988-1990 period and their inclusion is debateable as true Wilbury 'Canon' for inclusion here so I won't complain). Gone is Cheech Marin and Woody Harrelson as well as a bunch of other recognizable actors clowning around. What is then missing is a very valuable part of the spirit of this band, how much fun they are and how fun their music can be.     I ought to give this set only two stars for the glaring omissions and edited footage but the music itself is so good I can't give it less than three. In a world where people accept greatest hits albums over complete box sets (where your dollar spent on a particular band could be considered final) we allow these companies to make more and more of the same thing hoping that the next set will be just a little bit closer to being complete. So please when something is not 'complete' as it ought to be feel free to express it in places like this or even better to the record companies themselves or we'll never get what we want.
0694003611|2.0|I was looking for a large board book (the size of the book in the picture).  What came in the mail was a small board book!  This picture of the little girl holding the book (under the book for sale) is a trick.  It is nowhere near that size and this should be considered to be FALSE advertising! I was extremely disappointed!  I must emphasize that the book is great, I was just deceived by the size.
B001G7HKZ4|2.0|Movie was fine and I agree with the other reviewers.    Unfortunately, the movie continually stuttered and lagged on my 2.2 GHz, Core 2 Duo Macbook Pro connected via a university ethernet connection (about 20,000 kbps downstream, much faster than any cable connection).  I tried it in both Firefox and Safari with no other programs running.  It did not make a difference.  The inability to buffer the movie is a real problem with this service.  As I use a Mac, I was not able to download the movie first and then watch it.  I will not be using the service again until these issues are fixed.
B001GJOL22|5.0|[[ASIN:B001GJOL22 RUSH: Snakes and Arrows Live [Blu-ray]]]    It's incredible to see the picture quality on this Blu-ray. You can see the sweating on the guys and their wrinkles. The unreal quality of the colors is so impressive that with your own eyes you'll never be able to see that. The camera work is perfect with any kind of angle but for the most part, it offer some stunning close shots. The light show is captured also with some distant shots of the stage.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I haven't seen the Dark Night yet and in order to get what is happening in that movie I decided to watch Batman Begins.  I never really wanted to see this movie even though I have been a big Batman fan over the years.  However when I finally put the DVD in to watch it I was gripped from the first moment of the movie.      This movie is by far the best Batman I have ever seen.  Christian Bale gives an incredible performance.  Katie Holmes as usual is so-so but she was better in this movie than most others I have seen here in.  This movie is 2 hours and twenty minutes and my interest was kept the entire time.  The action shots can get a little rough and Batman's voice is weird but there is nothing else about this movie I would have wanted better.  I am so glad I finally watched this movie and hopefully you do too.
B001GN6WVQ|3.0|We paid $400 at Lego shop and free shipping.  Beware if you buy this, the directions are horrible to  follow and not only that we were missing 9 pages of instructions!  This is great for a months worth of buiding non-stop!  But my son was thrilled with the characters!
0312427646|5.0|I broke down and bought this after a couple of my friends gave it really good reviews.  When it arrived, however, I was pretty mad to see how short the book was.  Granted when I went back and looked at the product page, I could see it is called a novella, so it's not like they were falsely advertising it.  It was really my own fault for not noticing how short the book was.<br /><br />Once I started reading it though, I was hooked.  The premise is quite interesting: the Queen starts reading- first out of politeness, then because she enjoys it.  I found I could identify with her several times, especially since many of my family and friends also do not understand my obsession with reading and with books, like those who surrounded the Queen in Alan Bennett's novella.<br /><br />Not only did I find the Queen's journey in the story interesting and entertaining, it also inspired me to seek out some of the books mentioned that she reads.  Many of course were/are classics which I have read or heard of, while others were new to me and not titles I recognized.  Overall it's given me many books to add to a TBR list.<br /><br />Back to the story- I really would recommend it.  It's short enough for those who do not enjoy a long book, but long enough to hook the audience and make them compelled to finish it.  I also really enjoyed the ending, and was not expecting it at all, which made it even better.  Kudos to Alan Bennett, and I'll be searching out more of his work.
0307454894|2.0|I wanted to like this novel, but it was just ok. It was very superficial and dialogue driven. The perceptions were lots of words strung together to similate emotion, but it was false emotion. I didn't care for either character, Hanna or Michael, which is a mistake for this kind of novel. The main character is a statuatory rapist, for goodness sake. The later recollections are wordy and tortuous attempts at feeling that don't work, the twist, was not a twist at all (I figured it out earlier than the author wanted me to) and the ending was merciful.

B000W4D94I|1.0|Twister was one of my favorite movies until I bought on blu-ray.  Now it is hard to watch because of how fake the sound and picture are.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|this is quite possibly the most beautiful revenge film ever made. the script, which has been overlooked, hits very important topics regarding life and the decisions that you make during it. the acting is phenomenal and the violence is perfectly coreographed to be very visual but relates to the story. (ive read that is considered an ultra violent tarantino comparison....very untrue). bottom line this movie is a very entertaining movie but if you listen and pay attention to the words, it will strike a chord with you
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|A cold, gloomy, nasty afternoon in a hotel in Canada. Five hours until warm-up time in the orchestra pit. Take a walk? &iexcl;Ni modo, Quasimodo! Rent a flick? Why not!<br /><br />You'll have to believe me that I have no prior ABBA consciousness, despite the fact that I spent half my childhood in Sweden. I was in Mediterranean and Caribbean lands when they 'conquered' the Anglophone pop music world. I heard or read the name. Honestly, I thought they were another 'heavy metal' or Swedish vampyr band. I had no idea what they looked or sounded like. My wife tells me now that we danced to ABBA covers at innumerable family weddings over the past 25 years, but I never pay much attention when I'm trying to shake my booty without looking as dorky as I feel. Okay, do I suddenly love their music now, after seeing/hearing \\"Mamma Mia!\\"? Well... it's bouncy and sweet, but no way will it displace Dufay or Scarlatti on my iPod. ABBA is musically as corny as their costumes -- a 1970s period piece. Apologies to their fans, and to all Swedes everywhere. Hurray for IKEA! Hurray for ABBA! Sweden needs all the export credits it can get.<br /><br />And now the movie review! The most artful thing about Mamma Mia is the integration of the songs and chorus-line numbers into the melodrama. Reviewer JP, whose recommendation of this film was responsible for me picking it up, commented on the \\"Greek Chorus\\" of Greeks serving as a human and musical backdrop for the jet set cast of English speakers. She's right, and it was effective. I'm so far out of touch with Broadway that I thought JP's praise of the music/drama blend sounded just like Bollywood. I've seen a lot of Bollywood films. I urged JP to have a look at Lagaan, one of my favs. Bottom line? Mamma Mia is almost... almost... as artful at squeezing into and out of musical extravaganzas as Bollywood, though the ABBA songs are less appealing. Keep practicing, USA! You'll catch up with India some day.<br /><br />The story? Mildly amusing, absolutely predictable, jolly enough to keep me watching. Merle Streep looks remarkably like my sister, or vice versa. I get a kick out of the resemblance, and I was delighted to see my 'sister' having so much fun in a role. Streep's enjoyment of her own feeble singing was infectious. I was tickled to watch my usually dour countryman, Stellan Skarsgård, try to act zany. Zaniness is not intuitive for Swedes. Stellan and I look a lot alike, also, though I'm in better shape. I took a sardonic pleasure in watching him look hopelessly dorky when he danced. At the other extreme, the spark-plug friend of Mamma - I didn't catch her name, the tall one who can really sing and dance - is obviously a real Broadway-ite, and carried the film at times when others were looking vague about their blocking. The young'uns were cast for their looks, and look they did.

Hey, just like it says on the box: \\"a hilarious, rousing & joyous celebration!\\"nough to keep me watching. Merle Streep looks remarkably like my sister, or vice versa. I get a kick out of the resemblance, and I was delighted to see my 'sister' having so much fun in a role. Streep's enjoyment of her own feeble singing was infectious. I was tickled to watch my usually dour countryman, Stellan Skarsgård, try to act zany. Zaniness is not intuitive for Swedes. Stellan and I look a lot alike, also, though I'm in better shape. I took a sardonic pleasure in watching him look hopelessly dorky when he danced. At the other extreme, the spark-plug friend of Mamma - I didn't catch her name, the tall one who can really sing and dance - is obviously a real Broadway-ite, and carried the film at times when others were looking vague about their blocking. The young'uns were cast for their looks, and look they did.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I loved it!!!!!!!! I loved it!!!!!!!  I loved it!!!!!  Beautiful, outstanding and fantastic!!!!!! Eye Candy Divine!  Why? Oh, Why, is it ignored by the film industry for any awards???????  Cantinka should be nominated for an Oscar, the film should be nominated and win Best Picture, Sound, Costumes, Best Cinamatography, (Can't spell it, but you know what I mean!)   By Gosh, they got an Elephant, thats right an ELEPHANT to swim in the ocean and they filmed it from the bottom of the ocean bed.  The many countries and cultures are top notch filmed.  I wish I could make you understand what a WONDERFUL piece of imagination and filmmaking this is.  Get it!!!!!!! Rent it!!!!! See it!!! ENJOY it!!!! Indulge!!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Overall I believe this dvd set was very well done. It gives the viewer the chance to see the second President in a very well laid out manner. It shows him in the beginnings of his career right up to the end. I also especially like the extra the Facts are stubborn things, which showed historical facts during each video. For the price, this set is well worth it. Paul Giamatti also plays the part of John Adams very well.

B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is a brilliant and addictive game.  You place jewel-like variously shaped tiles on a silver colored plastic board.  The visual appearance is beautiful and soothing.  The turns tend to be leisurely, as each player thinks before placing a tile.  The action on the board, however, is fierce and warlike.  Like the ancient Japanese game 'Go', the action is all about taking possession of your enemy's territory along lines in grid.  Like 'Go', the power runs along the corners - which takes a little getting used to.  Unlike 'Go', the playing pieces in Blokus are all different and unique - which introduces a Tetris-like puzzle fitting aspect to the game play.  In order to win you'll need to visualize how the pieces will fit into available space and plan ahead.  You end up with a fabulous brew of tactical combat, and spacial puzzle solving with the visual appeal of a Mondrian-like mosaic.

B000002I97|5.0|After several years as a postman and a stint in the Army, John Prine emerged from the Chicago folk scene with the best debut album of 1971. It contained 13 all-original compositions that were unusually thoughtful and compassionate. Prine wrote with great empathy for such a young man (he was only 24 at the time).    Maybe it's because I've been handling the affairs of my ailing parents for a few years, but Prine's assertion that \\"old people just grow lonesome/waiting for someone to say 'hello in there'\\" - chokes me up whenever I hear it. I'm reminded of the Eno song \\"Some Of Them Are Old\\" from the art-rocker's \\"Here Come The Warm Jets\\" album, in which he writes: \\"help a few to smile/to add a quick assistance you'll walk many crooked miles\\". An odd comparison, but heartfelt songs about the elderly are few and far-between.     Other examples of his good heart and understanding nature are found in \\"Donald And Lydia\\" (about two emotionally withdrawn people), and the returning Vietnam vet saga of \\"Sam Stone\\". \\"Paradise\\" is thematically similar to Joni Mitchell's \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\", or Joe South's \\"Don't It Make You Want To Go Home\\" - career highs for all three artists. Prine's sense of humor is on display in several songs, most notably \\"Illegal Smile\\", \\"Spanish Pipedream\\", and \\"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven Anymore\\". Pointed humor that in later years would become more gentle and surreal on tracks like \\"Sabu Visits The Twin Cities Alone\\". \\"Sabu\\" is a good example of a type of song that only John Prine can write. While listening recently to Kris Kristofferson's excellent \\"A Moment Of Forever\\" CD, the only false note was the song \\"Slouching Toward The Millennium\\" - on which Kris tries to write like Prine and fails.    About Kris: he was an early supporter and cheerleader for Prine. He went to see him perform at the behest of Prine's buddy Steve Goodman, and afterward wrote the liner notes for this album. Kris himself had been the beneficiary of liner notes by Johnny Cash when he released his debut album \\"Kristofferson\\" in 1970 (re-issued a year later under the title \\"Me And Bobby McGee\\") - so I guess he was returning the favor. I've always liked the solidarity shown between country and folk artists, though it's not lost on me that Cash, Kristofferson and Prine were all ex-servicemen.    The \\"Kristofferson\\" album was a milestone that heralded the future of country music, and the \\"John Prine\\" album helped to cement that direction. Together, they were a one-two punch that changed the face of songwriting as we know it.    Both artists went on to further glory, and are still capable of pleasing and surprising. Prine has the wonderful \\"Bruised Orange\\" and \\"German Afternoons\\" to his credit, while Kristofferson has \\"The Silver Tongued Devil And I\\" and \\"A Moment Of Forever\\". But I don't think it's unfair to say that neither one has surpassed his earliest achievement. That would be too much to ask of anyone. Of the two, it's my opinion that Prine has been the most consistent. He doesn't actually have a bad album, and for various reasons they are all worth collecting. For many years he's been issuing his albums on his own OH BOY label, which has also helped keep alive the legacy of the great Steve Goodman, as well as further the careers of artists like Todd Snider.    If buying every Prine CD is beyond your means, you may want to consider at least purchasing this one and the compilation \\"Great Days: The John Prine Anthology\\". You won't regret it.
0439023483|4.0|In this book North America is now known as Panem which is made up of The Capital and 12 districts.  At one time there were 13 districts but when the 13 districts tried to over flow the Capital they were defeated and the 13th district was destroyed.  Now every year each district is forced to pick one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Games which is televised live.  These games are a fight to the death and the winner will receive a life of luxury and their district receives extra supplies from the Capital.  These games are a way for the Capital to remind the districts of the consequences of defying them and the power they hold over the districts.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is now 16 and ever since her father died has taken care of protecting her mother and sister and providing them with food.  When her 12 year old sister is chosen as their district's female contestant she volunteers in her place.  The male contestant, Peeta, is a son of a baker who once purposely took a beating in order to provide Katniss with two loaves of bread.  Katniss surprises everyone by becoming a serious contender to win the games.<br /><br />Stop here if you don't want any spoilers.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book although I hate that it looks like it is the first book in a series.  I hate reading series when the next book is not readily available.  Katniss and Peeta play up that they are two teens in love in order to gain more \\"sponsors\\" that can provide helpful items during the Hunger Games.  It's obvious that while Katniss is only playing a part, Peeta does really love Katniss.  To add an added complication is it sounds like Katniss's hunting partner back home, Gale, also has feelings for her.  So when the rules were changed and allowed both Peeta and Katniss to win the games and go home I wanted to see what would happen.  Would Katniss end up with Peeta or Gale or neither.  I really want to learn more about Gale.  Peeta seems like a nice guy but he seems more like the good boy who will always be there but will be kind of boring.  I'm wondering if Gale is going to be more of the forbidden love even though he and Katniss are from the same walk of life and Peeta is from a slightly richer life as a baker's son.<br /><br />The only part I didn't like in this book is when Rue is killed.  She sounded so adorable and can't help liking her even though she isn't in the book very long.  I guess that is what Collins was going for since she was played up as the contestant that people couldn't help but root for even though she was only 12 and very small.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book to come out and see how the romance plays out and what the Capital has in mind for Katniss for embarassing them into declaring two winners of the Hunger Games.e like the good boy who will always be there but will be kind of boring.

B000P0J0AG|5.0|It is not often that a movie will stay in print for over ten years.  The few that do are usually classics from Hollywood's golden age, blockbusters or multiple Oscar films.  Heat has none of these credentials.  No Oscars, while it did well at the box office it is not a top grosser and it is not from the golden age.  What can this film offer that keeps it in print?<br />First, this is a superior caper movie.  The screenplay and dialog are first rate with no false notes.<br />Second, the casting is wonderful!  This is the first pairing of De Niro & Pacino, two excellent actors that are always fun to watch.  One possible disappointment is how little time the two are together.  After that is an inspired supporting cast.  Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Natalie Portman & Amy Brenneman are uniformly excellent in their roles.  Each one is completely believable with no false notes.  Add to this a host of faces that you recognize at once and you have one of the most professional move cast ever.<br />Third, the action sequences are outstanding!  The armored car robbery is very well done.  The main shootout is one of the best on film.  It ranks with Bonnie & Clyde or The Wild Bunch.<br />Last, you get a lot of move for your money.  This is not one of those 88-minute quickies that rush from title to end credits.  They take the time to develop characters, make them real, tell the story and add a WOW factor.  The subplots work and add to the characters and the main story.  However, the movie never drags, your attention never falters as this excellent cast works with an excellent script.

It was definitely worth the money!  I enjoyed half the songs I heard and I think after a few more listens I'll appreciate some more of the songs.    I will say that I became a fan at the \\"black album\\" and have enjoyed some of their newer albums since then.  I know that those who have been Metallica fans from the beginning are not as thrilled with their new stuff, but I look at it this way it's better to enjoy them now then never at all!

B0019FOC5E|4.0|When the film version of \\"Mamma Mia!\\" was released in July 2008, many wondered how an all-star Hollywood cast, including Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, and relative newcomer Amanda Seyfried, would fare singing some of ABBA's timeless classics. Overall, the group did an excellent job, with some songs shining brightly in the pop stratosphere.    Without a doubt, the two singing stars from the film are Streep and Seyfried. The former has particularly touching vocals on 'The Winner Takes It All' and rocks on the title track, while the latter shines in 'Honey, Honey' and 'Lay All Your Love on Me'. Colin Firth puts in a decent effort with his cohorts on 'Our Last Summer', and co-stars Christine Baranski and Julie Walters make 'Dancing Queen', 'Super Trouper', and 'Take a Chance on Me' even more delectable.     Unfortunately, Pierce Brosnan's strained and often off-key attempts do detract from the soundtrack. While it was somewhat cute in the film, his butchering of 'When All is Said and Done' and 'SOS' keep the soundtrack from being a solid five stars. I do commend him for his efforts, but this is a musical, not a Bond film. I expected more.    Overall, the soundtrack to \\"Mamma Mia!\\" is sure to please anyone who enjoyed the movie, providing endless chances to sing along to one of the great musical films.
B0000025CP|5.0|I've owned a vinyl copy of this since I was in junior high school, in the early 80's, and it was always one of my quiet favorites, something I never really admitted liking so much to anyone really.  Not many people I know appreciate early Judas Priest, just the way it is.    Stained Class is a step into a bit of a 70's progressive rock direction, with complex songs that change tempo and vary a lot on odd beats, and aren't very radio friendly.  The Downing/Tipton guitar work is phenomenal, and this record for the first time really shows off their talents.    Every song on here is good, it's a complete album.  The songs that stuck in my head the most as a teenager were \\"Beyond The Realms Of The Dead,\\" \\"Heroes End,\\" \\"Savage\\" and \\"Better By You, Better Than Me.\\"    It's great to get into this music again, and is some of the more timeless metal out there.
0545128285|4.0|Always fun to re-visit the Harry Potter world, The Tales of the Beedle the Bard, take the reader back to the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling.<br /><br /> - Book Length -<br /><br />  Understanding that the stories are fairy tales (or in this case wizard tales), it's easy to see that the stories are somewhat short.  Somewhat of a disappointment, however, was the number of stories and overall length of the book.  There are only five stories, and the book is 111 pages long with large text.  Compared to the Harry Potter books, this reading is more for short bedtime stories (which is the idea).<br /><br /> - Content -<br /><br />  The stories are creative, each with a moral, and the commentary by Dumbledore is a nice touch.  Much like other tales, they're somewhat short, and often a little weird.  The crown of the five stories is \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\" which is featured in the last of the Harry Potter books.  It's insightful to read Dumbledore's \\"commentary\\" on this story since it played such a big role in the final Harry Potter novel.
B001GJ30S8|4.0|Vince Neil's embarrassingly, uh, \\"lacking\\" album cover shot is indicative of the naive and raw 1982 debut of the now-famous Motley Crue.    There are highlights and some amateurish low-lights on this album.  I own the original vinyl release and have not listened to any remasters or mixes on CD.    This album sounds like a quality basement recording of a band who've written some songs on the early 80's LA metal scene, with potential.     The songs are very consistent, all are of similar quality and aren't nearly as dark or sinister in nature as their next release, \\"Shout At The Devil,\\" (when they hit it big on MTV and the charts).    Motley Crue are a result of post-punk LA metal where image, attitude, stage presence and the ability to write good, catchy songs were the key to success, mastering your instrument and writing deep lyrics were not required.    The sound of TFFL is a bit more bubble gum and stripped down than anything else in their long career, making it a novelty and more of an indulgence if you grew up listening to early Motley Crue.     If I had to pick favorites it would be \\"Piece Of Your Action, \\"Starry Eyes,\\" the title track, and \\"Merry Go Round.\\"     It's a bit silly and funny at times, not purposely, but again it should be something you know if you're a fan of the Crue in any sense.  Personally I quit listening to them, outside of what Iwas bombarded with daily on the radio, after \\"Theater Of Pain.\\" So, take my words with a grain of salt.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|So like this weatherman who thinks he knows which way the wind blows but isn't particularly interested and doesn't appreciate a rodent doing any predicting around him must conform to (or \\"embrace\\")the reality of a single dreaded day that he only wishes to escape from from the very start. He doesn't want to be where he is at all and doesn't like the people he is with. This single day becomes a prison for him from which there is no escape. He trys everything including suicide but everyday begins the same with him waking up in bed in a Bed and Breakfast to the same awful Sonny and Cher song \\"I Got You Babe\\" on the radio. Perhaps he is dead and in hell. Eventually after who knows how many repeats of this of this seeming glitch in spacetime he comes to accept his fate. He seizes the day, learns new skills, undergoes a personality change, and becomes the most totally engaged, positive and plugged in person to a point that is beyond belief superhuman. All this effort centers around hooking up with a lovely lady who he traveled into town with (What else but romantic love with change a western man trapped in a Hollywood plot). She of course remembers not a single thing each new day (I wonder what twisted notions could have gone through his mind). He in the end wins her heart and finding love with her is what ultimately frees him and he finally is allowed to begin a new day, the day after Groundhog Day. But now he loves the town and wants to stay there forever. He has changed and found true happiness and the very same place and people that were his personal hell are now his heaven. In the real world time stops for no man and you don't get countless repeats to get it right but who doesn't feel like they've had their share of Groundhog Days--just in the sense of being trapped having to deal with the same stuff day after day after day?? That's why the movie strikes a cord. And he self-improves, becomes a super friendly overachiever and gets the babe and Tony Robinson couldn't have outdone this fable.<br /><br />GROUNDHOG DAY is a unique movie, well written and directed, well cast, and Bill Murray gave a pitch perfect performance.

B00139W3NE|3.0|Okay movie for a New-Age *fantasy* flick. What is interesting - the Freudian psychoanalytical theory, which is invoked in cinema again.  Apparently, the magic *dust* denotes the object-cause of desire and the reservoir of libido. Since it also could mean a surplus enjoyment, it is no wonder that the *Church* (or any church-like order), at least officially, would be against it.<br /><br />I have a problem with the *evil Russians* or *evil Tatars* who are portrayed running some kind of a nightmarish *kids-only* Gulag installation on Spitsbergen. You dress them all like Rasputin; let them speak a bit of broken Russian and voil&agrave; - ready-to-wear agents of evil. I mean, seriously enough already with stereotypes.

B0007TKNII|5.0|I loved Phantom of the Opera when I had a chance to see the play when I visited New York and when I heard the movie was coming out I had mixed feelings about it because sometimes the movies do not translate well.    I am happy to say my fears were unfounded, they did a tremendous job with this movie and I watch it over and over.  Each actor/actress is superb and the musical performances are just as good as seeing it on Broadway.  The effects on Broadway are carried through in well done cinema versions where movies have an advantage over Broadway.    The documentary is a definate plus for any Phantom Fan to learn more about the play itself.  A great movie musical and story.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|On the immediate surface \\"Apaloosa\\" occurs as an old school Western grounded in the battle of good against evil. For the most part first time director/ writer Ed Harris's \\"Apaloosa\\" is the traditional tale of gunslingers hired to protect the town against the malevolent rancher, who terrorizes the town of Apaloosa. This slithery and wily Rancher is Randall Bragg, well played by Academy Award Winner Jeremy Irons. Irons is amazing. In the opening Bragg (Irons) kills the town Marshall and his deputies in cold blood. So there is no question surrounding Bragg's character. Harris and Viggo Mortensen play Virgil Cole and Everett Hitch, who are lawmen for hire. The town of Apaloosa signs a contract with Virgil and Everett paying them to protect the town from Bragg. As part of the deal Apaloosa surrenders legal jurisdiction and autonomy to Cole and Hitch. This is pretty straight forward until femme fatale widow Allison French (Renee Zellwegger) arrives in town. Virgil takes a quick fancy to Allison, but her motives are vague and questionable at best. Will she threaten Virgil's partnership with Everett?<br /><br />First off, I ultimately liked \\"Apaloosa\\", because Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Everett. Despite the movie's quirky idiosyncrasies, Mortensen commands the heroic presence as the sensible man of honor. Mortensen is the Western hero in the tradition of Clint Eastwood. As Everett, we always know where Mortensen stands, and he is both charismatic and cool. In a great scene a rival asks Everett about Virgil's gun prowess. Everett says plainly, \\"I haven't seen anyone as good as Virgil.\\" Mortensen's Virgil salvages the movie's sense of honor.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, \\"Apaloosa\\" is not really all that traditional just below the surface. And this is not necessarily a good thing. This is not the anti-hero masterpiece of Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\". In one sense, I think Harris would like it to be. For one thing although Harris's Virgil is brave and noble, he is an apparent partial nut job. He goes nonlinear on some hoods in a saloon, among other weird out bursts. Harris's Virgil is not an educated man, and clumsily forces his diction and stumbles through Emerson. Instead of coming off as charmingly eccentric, his Virgil occurs as a little weird. Renee Zellwegger is an amazing actress, but here she struggles to carry off pretty. Her character Allison also has the propensity to have sex with virtually any man with a pulse. Straight and narrow Virgil in love with psycho whore Allison is not the most conventional love story, nor is it the story's most endearing plot line. Again, this may be more artifact of the screenplay by Harris and Robert Knot based on Robert B. Parker's best selling novel.<br /><br />In spite of its quirkiness and kind of nutty characters, Harris manages to reign in the movie as it concludes-- opting for the more heroic. There is a great scene before one the climatic showdowns where Allison asks Virgil and Everett, \\"Aren't either of you at all afraid?\\" Virgil says, \\"...I guess I don't think about that so much.\\" Also in \\"Apaloosa\\" the action is not leveraged for the utmost drama. Director Harris's action sequences lack crispness--the gun fight blocking is mostly single shot, without any interesting angles. Aside from the last gun fight, most of the action is diluted of high drama. The action is well done, just not spectacular.<br /><br />\\"Apaloosa\\" is an amalgamation of the traditional Western with the idiosyncratic melodrama of the new.

Joss Whedon actually improves upon the classic series with better special effects, deeper character development, great action scenes and a top notch science fiction plot. If you've never seen the series, I would recommend watching a few episodes before you view 'Serenity'.     The blu-ray transfer is fantastic! It looks every bit as good, if not better than it did on the big screen. I was pleased that this wasn't just a copy of the HD-DVD disc, and included features that were absent on the other format.

Steely Dan is classic blues / soft - up tempo rock (if you call it rock).  Alive in America is a very very good effort and it shows the band Alive and well.  Also if you notice the price, you can't beat it.  The tracks on the cd are really good.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I loved this movie... absolutely adored it. I am not a fan of animated films so I didn't have high expectations, but this movie took my breath away. It's so beautifully made, and the characters are so charming. Wall-e is a little star. I was captivated. One of my favourite films of 2008, if not my favourite.

B0017ANAZO|1.0|this sucked.  overracting and underacting and just plain bad acting.  insightful to this extent:  if art imitates reality it shows just how plain unbearable annoying and dysfunction  \\"people\\" (read women) become who worship aesthetic (fashion, \\"right\\" associations, trends, successful image etc) as if it were religion.
0375842209|5.0|Amazing stuff, I really loved this book!<br /><br />The characters are unforgettable, a profoundly moving story for anyone to read!<br /><br />This was the 1st novel of Markus Zusak that I have ever heard of or read, but it was well worth it.<br /><br />Liesel is one character that I will never forget from a book!<br /><br />Hans Hubermann, Max Vandenburg, Rudy Steiner all truly touching characters, brought to life vividly by Zusak.<br /><br />The writing is amazing, the message about the power of words is absolutely true...<br /><br />Highly recommended book!!
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush's eighth studio release from 1981 &#34;Moving Pictures&#34; is without question one of the greatest classic/progressive rock albums of all time, as well as the band's best and most popular album to date. I got this cd a couple years back, and it has become one of my favorite classic rock albums that I proudly own and listen to, and I've also have become a fan of Rush lately. Rush are simply one of the greatest bands not just in progressive rock, BUT in rock in general. With top-notch production courtesy of Terry Brown, &#34;Moving Pictures&#34; is a certain album that truly lives up to all the hype, and this album definitely deserves it. Every song on here is a true classic in their own rights, from legendary mainstream radio singles &#34;Tom Sawyer&#34; and &#34;Limelight&#34;, to the nearly 11 minute epic &#34;The Camera Eye&#34; and the futuristic &#34;Red Barchetta&#34;, to the ominous and menacing &#34;Witch Hunt&#34; and the godly, addicting instrumental &#34;YYZ&#34;, seriously I don't even recall finding one bad song on this album, they're all boss. Let's not also forget about the band's superb, stunning, and complexed musicianship which is absolutely flat out amazing in all aspects. Geddy Lee's vocals are unique, powerful, and awesome, and he's also known to be one of rock's most talented and best bassists ever. His bass lines are just thick, gritty, earthshaking, and downright incredible. I really like the bass tone on here, it's just awesome. Let's not also forget that Geddy knows how to manipulate the keyboards which are also top notch, and really add to Rush's sound on here as well. Alex Lifeson is an awesome guitarist, and he is really on fire here with his solid, hard rocking riffs, and awesome, dazzling solos that shred like a sharp razor blade. Neil Peart's drumming on here is absolutely death defying, perfectly timed, and off the hook. There's certainly no doubt that Neil is and always has been regarded as one of the greatest drummers in rock, and not to mention that he's also Rush's main lyricist, and a brilliant lyricist at that too.<br /><br />Now let's have a look at the songs.<br /><br />The first song &#34;Tom Sawyer&#34; is a catchy, majestic, anthemic opener, and of course one of Rush's all time greatest songs which lyrically is a look at a free thinking, modern day warrior, and features catchy, hard crunching guitar riffs including a wickedly shredding solo by Alex, as well as some catchy keyboard parts and great bass lines by Geddy, and of course some solid drum work by Neil including a nice drum solo around 2:32. The next song &#34;Red Barchetta&#34; is about a young man who enjoys joy riding in his uncle's sports car in a future time where gasoline powered sports cars are banned and prohibited by the &#34;Motor Law&#34;. This song also features great, subtle drumming by Neil along with more great guitar work by Alex, and nice bass and vocals from Geddy. Next, we have the godly and addictingly powerful instrumental &#34;YYZ&#34; which is the Toronto airport code, and is highlighted by more of Neil's dominating drum work especially with some nice crotales played at the beginning which is very cool. Geddy's bass really shines on this song with some wicked, creamy bass soloing, and not to mention that Alex also does some excellent riffage including another great solo around 2:23. This is definitely one of Rush's best instrumentals and I DO mean one of their best instrumentals ever.<br /><br />Up next we have track four &#34;Limelight&#34; which is another one of Rush's all time best songs ever, and my favorite Rush song of all time. This song lyrically deals with Neil's discomfort with fame and success. You just gotta love that opening riff from Alex, and the chorus is just excellent, and we also have another fantastic guitar solo around 2:40 mark. We continue the album with the epic prog rocker &#34;The Camera Eye&#34; which clocks in at almost 11 minutes. This song gives a snap shot look at theperspectives of both New York (first verse) and London (second verse). This is without question one of my favorite Rush songs, as well as one of the best songs on here, words just can't even describe how amazing this song is. The synth riffs are absolutely fantastic, the guitar work is excellent especially the solo around 9:21, and Neil's drumming once again dominates throughout. Up next we have the ominous and menacing &#34;Witch Hunt&#34; which is another classic song on here, and another one of my favorite Rush songs as well. I like the wind chimes that Neil plays at the beginning, and there's also some catchy, menacing guitar riffs, and ominous keyboard riffs that really add to the feel of this song. And last but certainly not least, seventh and final song &#34;Vital Signs&#34; is a strong reggae influenced closer which features a distinctive part made by Lee's OB-X synthesizer at the beginning which shows the distinct reggae flavor.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. Tom Sawyer (4:33) - 5/5<br />2. Red Barchetta (6:10) - 5/5<br />3. YYZ (4:26) - 5/5<br />4. Limelight (4:19) - 5/5<br />5. The Camera Eye (11:01) - 5/5<br />6. Witch Hunt (4:45) - 5/5<br />7. Vital Signs (4:46) - 5/5<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're looking for a great classic/progressive rock masterpiece, then you don't even have to look no further than Rush's &#34;Moving Pictures&#34; This album is indeed a classic, and like I mentioned before it lives up to all the hype, and rightfully deserves it. Overall, this is a must have for any Rush fan, classic rock fan, progressive rock fan, well you get the picture. This is a gem that should NOT be missed out on.

B001J4E1D8|4.0|That haunting song has been stuck in my head ever since I saw this four-part BBC miniseries. It was a stroke of genius to incorporate this folk tune into the soundtrack (composed by Rob Lane), which sums up the mood and aura of this tragic tale of a young woman wronged so unjustly by two men. Gemma Arterton is wonderful as Tess Durbeyfield, probably Thomas Hardy's most well-loved heroine, exploited by her ignorant parents into claiming noble heritage and discarded by 19th century society. Hans Matheson is Alec Stoke-d'Urberville, the wealthy cad who violates her, unknowingly impregnates her with a child who doesn't survive babyhood and later comes back into her life as a supposedly reformed preacher. Eddie Redmayne is Angel Clare, the seemingly kind-hearted and tolerant parson's son who wins Tess's love but proves to be just as hypocritical as his religious family and his actions bring Tess to despair. As in most Hardy tales, tragedy looms a large shadow over the lives of his characters.<br /><br />Arterton's Tess is matched perfectly by Matheson's Alec, who is given more depth than any of the earlier film adaptations. The dark and tormented essence gives you the sense how doomed these two characters really are - their actions and words toward each other leads to their downfall. Unfortunately, the same cannot be applied to Redmayne's Angel, who looks befuddled and lost more than half the time. There is a rushed directorial pace in the second installment that hurts the romantic appeal between Tess and Angel, and the love story element seems a bit forced as a result. Because of that, I didn't get the appeal of Angel in this one, or why Tess and her fellow dairymaids were in love with him, or why Tess takes the desperate course of action in order to get him back. Some of the modern dialogue used did take away from the affect of the story, and Redmayne seemed to have a hard time keeping up with Arterton performance-wise. Redmayne redeemed himself somewhat in the final episode but for the most part I was unimpressed with him. However, director David Blair must take some of the criticism, as the hurried scenes to establish the \\"romance\\" seemed to skim over the parts of the novel that gave the lovers the attachment to one another that eventually leads Angel to see the error of his ways and beg his wife's forgiveness. I was anticipating Alec's return so much that I found myself not really caring if Angel came back for Tess or not. In sharp contrast, the 1998 A&E/London Weekend Television production had me rooting for Tess and Angel's reunion even though I was aware of the outcome. I was so taken by Angel in that one, whereas here I found nothing in him to be slightly attractive or romantic. I sympathized with Tess completely and neither man deserved her, but at least in the other version and the novel I could see why she loved Angel and longed for him to return to her. I found myself almost rooting for Alec (I never thought I'd say that), because Matheson was so compelling and magnetic and he and Arterton generated such electricity, I couldn't take my eyes off them. Alec's fleeting conversion to Christianity and his sermon in the tent that Tess stumbles upon is foreshadowing of the path these two ill-fated characters will end up on. The moment he lays eyes on her again, his fatal attraction and twisted love for her resurfaces and consumes him, and Tess finds herself increasingly helpless to refuse his help after her father dies and her family is left destitute. Alec's wealth is the only way he can possess her and he is aware of that, but he is willing to get her the only way he can, only to discover that fate does indeed play a vengeful hand. It was also nice to see Tess revisiting her child's grave and placing fresh flowers upon it; her deeply felt sense of loss and rejection by both the church and her village is searingly devastating because it becomes all the more clear that she is victim of both society (in which women had few advantages) and fate. Having said that, Tess and Angel's reunion did not have the emotional impact it should have had, the sex scene was unnecessary, but the Stonehedge sequence was an emotional powerhouse for Arterton, as was the climax of her walking off to her fate with her signature tune heard wistfully in the background. The supporting cast was in top form, and while the cinematography was lovely, it could have emphasized far more considering how important landscape is in Hardy's work, as both the 1998 two part program and Roman Polanski's 1979 film have demonstrated. As a four-part miniseries, it had the opportunity to include more scenes from the novel and insight into character, particularly Angel, which would have helped the plot a great deal. However, it was good to see the mausoleum scene and the ending was heartbreaking and moving, although my tears were for Tess, her sister Liza-Lu, and, dare I say it, even Alec, but I felt nothing for Angel (although Redmayne's tearful breakdown was by far his best moment).<br /><br />On the whole, this was a very good presentation, my second favorite version and very much worth seeing. Arterton and Matheson give tour-de-force portrayals; it would be great if they would co-star again, some have suggested as Cathy and Heathcliff in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" - I could definitely see that. And that song will linger on in your memory long after the final credits have rolled, as will the rest of the score.and fate.

B000GCFO0I|1.0|Another one of those with lots of tortures and abuses on women and children without much horror, not scary just unpleasent.    Anyway if you think children being abused, tortured and burned crispy alive and a beautiful woman getting severely beaten up is scary or entertaining in anyway, this is your kind of film. Others, skip this one and get some horror films of the 80's or just stick to the game. I never played it before but this movie does have the atmosphere and systems(the monster time after siren for one) that may work very well in a video game.    The actress playing a female officer is the only one who can act, quite well(and I am not blinded by her beauty). Everyone else is so laughable. The girl is not one of those prodigies. when she said \\"Look I'm burning\\", I laughed and laughed. Her wooden faced mom is no scream queen. She is the last person who should be in a horror film. Bad acting all over the place.    What's the point of turning video games into films? The beauty of the video games is that you can be the hero, you can carry the story. Watching these films is like just watching someone else playing the game. Although that seems certainly more entertaining since this one is badly excuted. And the length. Don't those into video games need less than 2 hours to finish the video game version of this? Why do the rest of us want more time just \\"watching\\" it?     Just because it's a fine video game, it doesn't mean it can be a fine film. Three words, Super Mario Bros.

I got this for $22.99 new and that's quite a bargain(the shipping was even free to boot!)!!! Heck its' a hell of lot cheaper than a darn concert ticket!!! This is a great set of The Police in concert!!! The packaging could have been better,but that's a minor quibble,overall I'm very pleased w/ this release!!! Rock on Police!!! Recommended!!! A+
0590129279|5.0|I've Grown up reading this story.  It runs in our family and I buy copies for friends as presents. It looks like a fairy tale with  it's very simple picture book style but in fact it is a story and poetic prose of the deep philosophy.  While not heavy handed so it remains fresh and the prince loveable. I think it should be in every library.  I myself often refer bact to it to remind myself not to take myself too seriously but to take responciablty and to look at things from all angles.
6305882592|5.0|Upon its 1971 release, \\"Harold and Maude\\" died a quick commercial death & it didn't help its cause that most reviews were lousy at best; Variety wrote that it \\"has all the fun and gaiety of a burning orphanage.\\" Variety (in 1971) couldn't find fun & gaiety even if it had a map.    \\"Harold and Maude\\" is dark, funny, & great. I won't give anything away, but I will say that subject matter includes love, death, suicide & lives not lived. \\"You gotta go get it, it's yer life go live it\\" so....by all means, crash the hearse.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|\\"Stone Cold\\" is based upon the best selling novel by Robert B. Parker.  Tom Seleck plays Jesse Stone, a former L.A. Detective who has left L.A. and an ex-wife to become the Chief of Police for the fishing town of Paradise, Massachusetts.  As murders take place, he must come to grips with his two favorite things - scotch and women.<br /><br />\\"Stone Cold\\" was originally produced for CBS television and is one of five Jesse Stone movies available on DVD today.  Although \\"Stone Cold\\" was the first of the movies, it's actually the second in the series.  A prequel titled \\"Night Passage\\" was filmed secondly however I recommend viewing it first.  The third movie is titled \\"Death in Paradise\\" and the forth is \\"Sea Change\\".  The fifth \\"Thin Ice\\" was just released.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series of movies.  Without a doubt, this is Tom Seleck as his best!
0670020745|3.0|I would give the author herself 5 stars for her journey and her perseverance and being able to overcome severe deficits.    For the book, however, 3 stars is generous, in my opinion.  As the daughter of a recent stroke survivor, I found very useful information about how to deal with my mother and how to encourage her, and it also gave me great hope for her continued improvement and recovery.  BUT......way too much right-brain writing going on here.  \\"I love my cells\\" is an actual quote and perfectly illustrates how much of the last third of the book is written.  I am glad I read this book and will recommend it to my sisters, but with the suggestion to just to read the middle section.      The first third is tedious, the middle third is fascinating, and the final third is weird.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|PLOT<br />A gang of elite thieves are eventually overcome by elite detectives. Loved ones on both sides are affected by the process, as are various underworld figures and the Los Angeles public.<br /><br />REVIEW<br />John Walker, during his turn as sole contributor to Halliwell's Film Guide, docked this film several marks for creating an inappropriate allegory between the lives and minds of criminals and the lives and minds of police. Yet this allegory does not sufficiently taint Michael Mann's intricate, character-driven and highly developed crime thriller.<br /><br />An epic cast play rugged, cool-headed leading men; their smart, feisty, genuinely attractive women; and a chorus of sleazy, doom-destined underworld figures. In particular, Al Pacino's character displays some hilarious neuroses as the damaged lead detective; while the sleek, understated chemistry of the core criminal gang, played by Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Danny Trejo, is superior even to that of the Wild Bunch.<br /><br />Mann finds time to display his seasoned knowledge of police procedure and criminal code, while acknowledging the inescapable forces of love, retribution and chaos. Above all, however, the film is to be commended for several key action sequences that are guaranteed to greatly excite the vast majority of discerning viewers.<br /><br />SPECIAL MENTIONS<br />Michael Mann for writing.<br />Michael Mann for directing.
0545128285|4.0|For me, the stories themselves are not the highlight of this short volume.  Indeed, Rowling's wit and attention seem more focused on the commentaries than on the actual stories, which are a little too short, predictable, and simplistic to represent the artistry which Rowling is capable of.  Instead, it was the commentaries which made me miss the world of Harry Potter, as it was here where the humor, irony, and subtle complexity of that universe shines through.<br /><br />As Rowling makes fully clear in the introduction, these tales are about morality, just as \\"Muggle\\" fairy tales are.  As Rowling notes, the only major difference is that the balance between free will and fate is tilted more toward the former.  In these tales, she returns to themes familiar to readers of the Harry Potter series--generosity, self-reliance, love, and the irreversibility of death (and its corollary: the irreplaceable value of life).  This insight into the moral universe of the world of Harry Potter is nothing new, but ultimately it is this moral background that gives the Harry Potter series its appeal to readers of all ages.  For fans of the series, The Tales of Beedle the Bard will be a solid if not spectacular add to your bookshelf.
B00012FXAE|5.0|PLOT  The sequel to Alien (1979) sees the sole survivor of the Nostromo crew, Ellen Ripley, return to the nightmare planet with a platoon of gung-ho space marines and an array of incredible armoury. While the mission is sold to Ripley as a species extermination, there are ulterior motives at play. All intentions become irrelevant, however, once the extra-terrestrials arrive on the scene.    REVIEW  To date, the chief criticism of Aliens from most critics is its slow first half and its departure from its predecessor's elegance and claustrophobic style. Yet there is a wealth of exceptionally sharp dialogue maintained throughout the film, including during the first hour, and once the action begins in earnest, the claustrophobia returns with a vengeance and many spine-tingling moments ensue.    While the sequel's cast was largely inexperienced, talented newcomers such as Lance Henriksen (Bishop), Paul Reiser (Burke) and Bill Paxton (Hudson) utilised the marvellous script to leave lasting impressions on viewers and thus build illustrious careers as both character actors and leading men. Of course there's also the much-expanded alien cast, which includes the hideous alien monarch in her terrifying screen debut. And finally, there's Sigourney Weaver, in the performance of her career as Ellen Ripley.    Score, production design and special effects are solid, and arguably timeless. They should appeal to teenagers of both today and yesteryear. I say \\"teenagers\\" because it was when I was a teenager that my friends and I were entranced with this film: the high-tech weaponry; the gung-ho battles; the deadly and elegantly repulsive extra-terrestrials...and the even deadlier Ellen Ripley...    SPECIAL MENTIONS  James Cameron for writing.  Sigourney Weaver for acting.
B001GQACGO|5.0|Beyonce is something of a mystery to me. I was always a fan of Destiny's Child's singles, but with the exception of \\"Survivor,\\" I could never get into their whole albums, despite owning them all. The same thing goes for Beyonce. I have \\"Dangerously in Love\\" and \\"B'Day,\\" and though those albums garner some phenomenal hits, I just couldn't fall in love with the albums the way many others did. (In fact, \\"B'Day\\" has some of my favorite songs from Beyonce, yet also contains a good half dozen tracks that I find dreadful.)    I went into \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" not with hesitation, but not with any expectations of falling in love with it. \\"If I Were A Boy\\" is a great single, but so are most of her singles. \\"Single Ladies\\" is FANTASTIC, yet clearly up-tempo jams like \\"Get Me Bodied\\" didn't save my opinion about \\"B'Day\\" either, so I wasn't sure how I would take to this album. I am so happy that I have \\"Sasha Fierce\\" a chance -- this album is pitch-perfect; Beyonce really upped her game.    Yes, it was a marketing gimmick, and 16 songs is NOT enough for a double disc, but since I digitally purchased the album, that part didn't bother me.     I actually love that the slow songs and up tempos are split up. The \\"Sasha Fierce\\" half doesn't flow as well (even though it has great songs individually), but the \\"I Am\\" section moves so well from beginning to end. \\"Halo\\" is sure to be a hit; I'll eat my words if it isn't. \\"Disappear,\\" and \\"Broken Hearted Girl\\" are beautiful, and \\"Disappear\\" especially sounds like the first big departure for Beyonce. \\"Ave Maria\\" is pretty, though a tad pretentious, and generally the only track I skip constantly. Fortunately, next we have \\"Smash Into You,\\" which is most certainly the most beautiful song she ever has and ever will record. Perfect. I can't wait to hear her sing it live. The end of the album works well too, \\"Satellites\\" is really haunting, \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\" utilizes some grunge chords that are really exciting and new for B, and I love it. \\"Save the Hero\\" is also a great bonus track, if only a tad on the cheesy side.    Now we have \\"Sasha Fierce,\\" which is also a really fun listen. \\"Single Ladies\\" is \\"Get Me Bodied\\" Part II, but in my opinion, better. (And what a fierce video, right?) \\"Radio\\" sounds like it should have been off of Rihanna's latest project, and Beyonce's \\"over-ghettofication\\" of her words is slightly irksome, but the song is so fun that most is forgiven. \\"Diva\\" is one of the biggest \\"what's the point?\\" songs on the album, but because she sounds so great and the beat is so exciting, all is again forgiven. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is fun, and \\"Video Phone\\" is sexy and interesting. Still, Sasha Fierce saves her best material for her more R&B jams. \\"Hello\\" and \\"Ego\\" are perfect songs, this is down-low sexy Sasha, and I love every moment of it. Also, interestingly enough, Sasha at her fiercest is when she is still being vulnerable; \\"Scared of Lonely\\" is a brilliant uptempo track. Oh, and \\"Why Don't You Love Me?\\" is another great bonus track from the digital download.    If Beyonce continues to grow and develop as an artist, I will be a life long fan. I can only hope for future albums to be as remarkable as this.    Oh, and this album, in my opinion, is more of a 4 or 4.5 star rating, but due to the ridiculously high negative ratings (for really silly reasons), I thought the album deserved a 5.
1416562605|5.0|This book is simplistically written and takes a reader through the journey of Balram from being a 'servant' to a 'social entrepreneur'. It keeps the reader toying with the ideas of sympathizing with the narrator or be contemptuous of his acts. With a backgroud of the India that exists beyond the current Call Center culture and that I believe, few are aware of, internationally, it brings forth the country's long standing cultural schisms. Its an angry, dark and mad page-turner.
B000K7VHQE|1.0|A pathetic excuse for entertainment.  I was embarrassed for all of them as actors (the little girl was cute though, and it was not her fault that her parents let her work in a movie like that).  There was a lot of profanity for a family theme.  I thought it was going to be a good movie, but I was terribly wrong.
B001L51RQE|5.0|As a Police fan since the start of it all it was great to see them on tour again and this is a tremendous package Yes, some arrangements are different and so are some of the keys - they are 30 years older almost!    My only gripe is the almost entire lack of crowd noise - they are so low in the mix it is just unnatural and a little grating. On the clips in the documentary the fans are a little more present    But there's no pleasing some people as the opposite was the case on the even more excellent Rush in Rio DVD where many complained the crowd were so hyper they were perhaps too audible.  That crowd would have drowned out The Police - but of course with Rush this is a taller order.    Anyway, I am in the very happy position of owning both concerts and watch both regularly.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Dear Sirs, this a wonderfull movie, I want to buy it, I havent found it in english with subtitles in spanish or english, or totally spoken spanish.  Where I can find it this way ?  Best Regards,  Enrique
B001K98MFK|5.0|First off, I should state that I haven't yet bought this release but plan to the day its release based on Bandai's re-release track record. This review is actually a comment on why this release should trump the 2004 DreamWorks release. I bought the 2004 release on DVD back in 2004. It's a good movie but a horrible hack job from DreamWorks. Beyond having no English audio alternative and a so-so visual transfer, the subtitles in the DreamWorks 2004 version were screwed up. I generally prefer subs but like dubs for guests and loaners. The problem with the subs in the DreamWorks release is that they used the close captioning system. What does this mean? The subs are gigantic (2-3 times normal size) and higher on the screen. It's intrusive when you're trying to watch the beautiful visuals. So buy this release and don't support the previous release.
B00006AFF5|5.0|Reading the reviews, it seems like you need to watch this movie with an open mind without comparing it to the original. You either like it or you don't, seems like the general feeling. I personally think this is a wonderful movie that does great justice to the book. I personally recommend it.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I was actually looking forward to see this movie. The result was bottomless disappointment. My honest opinion is there is just no way to shorten a book so considerably and then expect it to be anything else than lacking! There is only one true Darcy: Colin Firth. I won't even get into Ms Bennett ... My advice, if you love Jane Austen: Buy the set with Colin Firth, do yourself a favour here!! I know it is very long but I'm not kidding, it is so worth it!!! Don't waste time and money on this poor remake! I would have given no stars at all but that was not possible ...
031606792X|1.0|No, no, no! This isn't the way the series should have ended. I wish I'd stopped with the third book, when I still felt included in Bella's human experience; I could have imagined my own final installment.  This fourth book made me feel like an outsider walking in on the middle of a bad sci-fi/zombie tale that spread itself too thin and took itself much too seriously. It actually required an index of characters at the end, a tip-off that the plot is confused with too many new names.<br /><br />The first three books stay true to Bella's audience of young adult readers (since that's her own age level).  This final book goes well outside that readership and blasts young fans into sudden, violent marital sex as well as a gory, horrific pregnancy and childbirth. As if that weren't enough of an eye-opener for a teen reader, how about a vicarious hunting thrill to quinch Bella's newfound thirst for blood?<br /><br />With as much innovation as Ms. Meyer revealed in the first three books, couldn't she have created a plot twist whereby Edward became more human rather than Bella going over to the dark side and, along with her child, slurping the life out of deer? Nevertheless, as her offspring might do, I now touch your face, dear consumer, and you must understand perfectly...BREAKING DAWN is, sadly, contrived and has shifted beyond our collective special powers to tolerate.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret book, for the most part, is identical to the DVD except there are a few extra \\"points\\" they don't say in the DVD.  Those extra \\"points\\" really hit home with me so I'm glad I read the book.  It's super easy reading, too!  It's well worth the few dollars!
B001D08SK0|4.0|Happily I got this set at a nice discount at a local retailer.  Therefore the outer case is in perfect condition. For musical content and historical importance this box set can't be beat - and yes, the original album deserves the lavish treatment presented here IMO, despite the few detractor's claims to the contrary. As said, the music is indispensable -- the extras and artifacts lend depth to the legend.  The interior items are rated as follows:    The 2 CDs and DVD:  Musically they satisfy.  The bonus cuts sound excellent.  Better than any bootleg versions I have heard.  The disc pockets integrated with the LP cover seemed a bit odd.  Although slick in presentation, the CDs/DVD should have been housed to better protect the discs, as they did arrive with surface marks generated from the disc pockets.     The LP:  The music sounds very good on my Sota turntable.  Deep and rich with greater dimension and detail than the reissue CD.  The blue vinyl is a nice touch.  The one critique:  the LP itself is slightly dished and warped and suffers from some non-fill issues at the outer edges of the record - a common problem with specialty colored vinyl releases, because the vinyl has a tendency to harden too quickly before flowing evenly in the stamper.  This would seem to account for the surface noise, although it's not overbearing.  By far not the worst high-end reissue I have purchased, but the not the best.  The music makes up for the production problems.    Not always sure if the \\"art house\\" creativity of these box sets are in the best interest of the music, but on the whole, this is a very nice collectable.  Clearly conceived to grab the attention of both the art community and jazz collector crowd.  I'd say I'm pretty happy with the one I got.
B00129H7VS|5.0|The program put you in the shoes of these heroic people that helped save our way of life. The series on blu-ray is gorgeous despited the digital treatments in the way it was shot. The 10 parts went by like an single hour. I would hightly recommend to anyone and should be required viewing for any citizen of the US and elsewhere.
031606792X|1.0|I am a huge fan of the twilight series but the concluding book was a waste of time and money. It was downright boring and I do not get bored easy but it took me three days to finish this book and I had to push myself to do so. I read the first book in the series, twilight, adn enjoyed it. New Moon was also boring but Eclipse was an improvement. But Brekaing Dawn was boring and I saw no point to it. The entire plot was Bella and Edward got married, went on a honeymoon, she got pregnant, turned into a vampire and that's it. The concluding book in a series should be the best and most exiciting like the conclusion for Harry Potter was. The ending was such a disapointment, just like the entire book. All of bella's feelings for Jacob just disappeared which bothered me also.  I'm ashamed to say that I read this book.

B00005OM4K|5.0|There are certain bands from rock's past where buying a box set of this size is the best thing to do in order to truly experience the band's greatness.  Just like buying \\"The Complete Studio Recordings\\" by either Led Zeppelin or The Doors, or \\"Those Were The Days\\" by Cream, you simply can't go wrong.  This six-CD set gives you EVERYTHING by CCR, and I do mean EVERYTHING!  The sound quality is fantastic (the 20-bit K2 coding system was created by none other than JVC, Victor Co. of Japan, the folks who KNOW what good sound is supposed to sound like, to semi-borrow a phrase from an old salsa commercial).  CCR's albums have been recently reissued individually with bonus tracks, but featuring the same remastering as this box set, so I recommend this set from 2001 more.  And it has dropped significantly in price since it's first release!  So what are you waiting for?  There's no need to go into how great each CCR album is, and even their last hodge-podge effort \\"Mardi Gras\\" is worth SOME merit.  What you might be wondering about is the first disc in this set that features tracks from the group's first two incarnations as Tommy Fogerty and The Blue Velvets and then The Golliwogs.  So let me review that disc seeing as though it will be the most \\"mysterious\\" of the entire set.    Disc one is hit and miss, plain and simple.  In all honesty, a lot of it is pretty dull stuff but THERE ARE some real gems amongst the haystack.  For the Tommy Fogerty and The Blue Velvets section, the band's second and final single \\"Have You Ever Been Lonely\\" b/w \\"Bonita\\" is fine for 1962 and the better of the two singles they released.  The former sounding not unlike a Ricky Nelson tune and the later sounding like Ritchie Valens.  They became The Golliwogs in 1964 as The British Invasion hit and like every other band of the time tried to imitate the sounds coming from across the pond.  The first track they released with their new moniker, \\"Don't Tell Me No Lies,\\" sounds like it came straight off of \\"Meet The Beatles.\\"  It's catchy and succeeds on it's own.  The band's Nov. 1965 single \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" is where John Fogerty's trademark voice finally comes into being.  And no, this is not the WELL KNOWN Van Morrison hit.  If that was the case that means that either John or Tom wrote it and they recorded it first as The Golliwogs and that's not the case here.  Pretty much all of the previously unissued songs (tracks 16-20) aren't worth a second listen in my opinion, with \\"Try Try Try\\" being the exception.  The band's best single was \\"Fight Fire\\" b/w \\"Fragile Child\\" in March of 1966!  Both songs are great, with the former being a maraca driven groovy rocker and the latter being much more poppy with a  12-string chime like The Byrds.  You won't be able to get either song out of your head and the band should have had a deserved national hit with this single.  From that point, The Golliwogs got better and better.  The pre-CCR version of \\"Walk On The Water\\" (titled \\"Walk-ING On The Water\\") is the band's first attempt at psychedelia released in the fall of 1966.  Very unique for it's time lyrically, it's nowhere near the epic closer it would become for CCR's debut album, but it's still very good.  It's flip side, \\"You Better Get It Before It Gets You,\\" starts out as a slow R&B number before it suddenly shifts into an uptempo rocker that saves it from utter mediocrity.  \\"Tell Me\\" is a catchy upbeat R&B infused number that, with it's flip side being a re-recorded version of their earlier \\"You Can't Be True,\\" was almost a June 1967 single that for some reason got canceled!  The Golliwogs last single in Oct. 1967 was half Golliwogs/half Creedence.  The single's A-side being \\"Porterville,\\" which would appear on CCR's first album, it's B-side being the even BETTER and CATCHIER R&B rocker \\"Call It Pretending.\\"  Thus ends John, Tom, Stu, and Doug's apprenticeship as The Golliwogs and the beginning of Creedence Clearwater Revival.    The first album is a killer debut and slightly removed from the trademark CCR sound as it is steeped more in a psychedelic/acid rock/ballroom jam vein (a promo film for \\"I Put A Spell On You,\\" filmed probably in late 1968, is about as psychedelic as you can get).  The band's sound finally gels on their second release, \\"Bayou Country,\\" in January of 1969 with the runaway hit single \\"Proud Mary\\" and the exhaustive jam of \\"Keep On Chooglin.\\"  From that point on, CCR had the King Midas touch and released their string of mighty classics that endure to this day, just like The Beatles had done throughout the 1960's.      You might find it annoying that their last album as a four-piece band, \\"Pendulum,\\" has it's last two tracks on disc five instead of disc four!  That problem can be remedied if you have a multi-disc CD player.  \\"45 Revolutions Per Minute\\" is a two sided promo single the band issued in Oct. of 1970 and is quite funny.  Very out of character for the band and something you might expect from Frank Zappa and The Mothers Of Invention but not CCR!  The single isn't a song but rather a fake interview/spoken word montage piece with layered sound effects and tape manipulations (sped up, slowed down, backwards, etc.).  It takes a swipe at the supposed hip DJs of the era who would try and interview artists about their music and act like they actually understood where the band members were coming from with their particular sound and style.  It's a fun piece and you might listen to it more than once.      As for the rest of this box set, \\"Mardi Gras,\\" \\"The Concert,\\" and \\"Live In Europe,\\" I have separate reviews for.  It's my personal opinion that \\"Live In Europe\\" could have been left off this set seeing as though it's even less inspired sounding than \\"The Concert.\\"  Only \\"Keep On Chooglin\\" is the real highlight of the European concert whereas the rest sounds muddy and unfocused.  But don't let that discourage you from getting this set, it's KILLER!  Just like it says on the back of the box, \\"THIS IS AMERICAN MUSIC 101!\\"
B000002UAX|5.0|Wonderful disk that opens with the jet scream of \\"Back In the USSR\\", with very few clunkers.  I still remember as a child getting this for Christmas, with the original poster and four photos of the Beatles. I believe that most of the two disks' material still survives the test, even 40 years later.  A must own.
B0000B1OGD|3.0|A step up from BEAST FROM HOLLOW MOUNTAIN ... a fun watch with kids who like dinosaurs.  Has the best line in a movie of ths genre --- When a mexican riding a horse is surprised by the beast,  he exclaims \\"Gwangi\\", turns and rides away.  Now I know what \\"Gwangi\\" means.
B000003TA4|5.0|One of the defining moments of the \\"Grunge Era\\", this disk exhibits the command of dynamics that Cobain mastered.  Songs go from racious to quiet, there are the obvious list of hits, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", etc., plus a bunch of ravers.  I really believe this is where Dave Grohl learned how to orchestrate and his command of dynamics that filters through to the current Foo Fighters releases.  A necessary addition to any collection.
031606792X|5.0|This book is great!  I love how it started out, mekes you so happy for them, and yet so worried all in one.  Love how this book truned for a while to look at life through Jacobs eyes, and helps give a new perspective to who he is and what he's fighting for.  I found myself so proud of all the characters and adored how far they've come from book one.  This was a fantastic book series!  I couldn't put it down, and finished all four books in over a week, working and all!  Loved these books very much!
B0000067L3|4.0|Two disk set, one studio/one live, that showcase one of the first \\"Supergroups\\".  Three virtuosos, Clapton, Bruce and Baker flaunt their respective talents on all songs. The selection opens with the  classic, \\"White Room\\", one of Cream penned hits. A brilliant cover of \\"Sitting On Top of the World\\" allows each member to demonstrate their chops. \\"Passing the Time\\" is a melodic tune with strings and light percussion during the verse, that segues into am uptempo chorus. \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" is a trippy Baker spoken tune. Bruce's ripping \\"Politician\\" with it's catchy riff is a wonderfully heavy classic. \\"Those Were the Days\\" is a brilliant song with unusual harmonies through out. The studio album was assisted (produced and various instruments) by Felix Pappalardi, of Mountain fame. I was a little disturbed to hear how the limitations of sound recording technology of the time were not well corrected on this release.  None the less, a series of hits that define this group appear on the studio disk, and the live disk showcases the chemistry and energy this band exhibited.
0307455874|4.0|Ok, he's not president ... yet. We still have 14 more days. However, I bought this book before the election, wanting to read more about the man's state of mind and his thoughts on the American dream. It has taken me this long to read it, not because the words are too hard (I read that somewhere that someone was daunted by the \\"big\\" words he used), but because it is very thought-provoking and it is not a book to rush through. I rarely if ever underline anything in my books but this book broke that rule of mine. I was underlining so many different thoughts in there to remind myself that it is what I agree with too. That doesn't necessarily mean that I agree with everything he has said, but he does provide fodder for thought.<br /><br />It is a very well-written book. It makes me wish that I could attend his classes on Constitutional Law, which is saying something since I find law boring. He provides examples after examples to back up his thoughts. He has obviously done his research especially in foreign policy (which is my least favorite chapter of all the chapters. It was also one that I disagreed with the most.) and he is passionate about his beliefs. He is passionate about the American people. I've seen it in his speeches and during the debates. He is passionate about the American Dream. And it's about time there is someone at the helm who is passionate about the Dream and how we can work together to bring it about.<br /><br />I don't expect Obama to bring about all the changes that he'd like to see because, let's be honest here, politicans in Congress will not agree and they will fight everything they can to push their own agenda through. Hopefully, Obama will be able to override that but that remains to be seen. However, he does have a good plan in mind and hopefully, he will be able to implement it.<br /><br />The one thing I got from this book is the strong sense of hope. The strong sense of hope and change that his presidency will bring about, hopefully. For the first time in 8 years, there is a feeling of hope among the people and among different readers. This book has generated a lot of talk among people. Hopefully, these talks will bring about the necessary change that is needed desperately for this country to thrive.<br /><br />It doesn't matter which side of the aisle you are on, this book is a much read. It is also a relief that for a change, there is an intelligent man at the helm of this country.<br /><br />1/4/09ars, there is a feeling of hope among the people and among different readers.

B000002OZY|5.0|Unbelievable concept album with one cover song that also kills, \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\".  Great songwriting, musicianship and beautiful harmonies make this an \\"Amazing Journey\\", cover to cover.  I remember wearing this out on vinyl, and waiting for a CD release.  The final cut, \\"We're Not Gonna Take It/See Me/Listening to You\\" still give me the warm and fuzzies, and make me wish there was more material on this disk.  Do not buy the movie soundtrack, other than for the balls out version of \\"I'm Free\\", which I feel is stronger than the release on the original because of Daltrey's voice.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is one of my favorite releases ever, with unbelievable songwriting, orchestration, engineering, etc.  Each of the Beatles contributes stunning pieces, \\"Come Together\\", \\"I Want You/She's So Heavy\\", \\"Because\\" (John), \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", \\"Oh, Darling\\", \\"Her Majesty\\" (Paul), \\"Octopus's Garden\\" (Ringo), and \\"Something\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" (George).  A must own!
6305949980|5.0|I loved this movie and when i was in Guam you couldn't find it anywhere but amazon delivered it made my christmas.
B000001FS3|4.0|I feel this is the definitive U2 release, that showcases their songwriting ability, their musicianship and the chemistry with Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno.  The orchestration and soaring quality of Bono's voice on \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" are the highlights for me.  There is the obvious list of hits, \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", \\"With or Without You\\", \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", \\"Running to Stand Still\\", and an obvious statement to America at the time.  I wish they could somehow come near the intensity of this with any of their current releases.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I saw this on HBO when it first aired and absolutely loved it. I put it on my wish list as a dvd set that I hope to own soon. I would highly recommend it, not only for it's fabulous acting, but for its historic value.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Very good release by a hot young band of brothers.  The obvious hit \\"Sex On Fire\\", is excellent, and the rest of the material stands the test.  I recommend this.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|\\"Funhouse\\" is the latest CD from pop superstar Pink. And as in past releases, this CD gives the singer a chance to express herself, and the latest emotions involved her recent divorce from bike racer Carey Hart.<br /><br />Like anyone facing divorce, she's obviously going through contradictory feelings, therefore, she alternatingly giving him a hard time on songs such as \\"So What,\\" \\"I Don't Believe You,\\" and \\"It's All Your Fault,\\" and pleading on other songs such as \\"Please Don't Leave Me.\\"<br /><br />As always, this CD features danceable tunes, songs with razor sharp edges, and songs that reveal a sensitive, tender soul underneath the tattoos and bombast. Overall, the record is pure Pink, balanced, melodic, and smart.
B0000062FL|4.0|Although I own most of the Santana catalog, I still feel this is his shining moment.  Greg Rollie's organ playing, percussion section and singing all mesh perfectly, and Santana and Neal Schon are great together.  Wonderful mood changes blend a complex tapestry of Latin, pop, and Afro influences into a joyous romp. They do a great job on \\"Black Magic Woman\\", to the point where few folks realize that this is a Peter Green composition from early Fleetwood Mac days.
1589269063|4.0|Knowing we were going to be spending a lot of time in the car on our vacation, I purchased Gary Chapman's classic work on marriage, The Five Love Languages, in audio book format, before we left. It was the first time I've purchased an audio book and, to be honest, I was not too sure what to expect. Though I've heard from several friends that audio books are a great substitute for the written word - I had my doubts. Among them were thoughts that listening to an author read a book would be boring. I also feared the format would make it difficult to follow the author's line of thought and reasoning.      Fortunately, these fears proved to be unfounded. Listening to Chapman read the book was easy and the many stories he offers as examples from his years of counseling kept both my wife and I interested and engaged in the material.      The premise of Chapman's book is quite simple. Chapman asserts there are five different ways of expressing love, or love languages: 1) words of affirmation; 2) quality time; 3) receiving gifts; 4) acts of service; and 5) physical touch. Chapman devotes a chapter to each of these love languages, offering numerous examples and practical tips on how to properly express these languages of love to your mate. At the end of each chapter on one of the love languages, Chapman offers ten tips for expressing that language to one's husband or wife. This is in keeping with the practical nature of the book; throughout Chapman keeps his audience of married couples living real lives in mind as true stories and practical advice make up the meat of the book.      Chapman also believes that each individual person will have these love languages ranked differently in order of importance. In other words, a husband might best feel loved by his wife's acts of service but the wife might feel most loved when her husband spends quality time with her. This can lead to confusion, Chapman says, within the marriage. Because the husband feels most loved when his wife does things for him (e.g. iron his shirts, clean the house, cook dinner, etc.) he naturally believes that she will also feel most loved when he does acts of service for her (e.g. mow the lawn, wash the car, etc.) when, in reality, she would much rather have him spend that time with her. Of course, she feels she can best express her love to him by spending time with him when he would rather have her help him with chores around the house. After a few years of this cycle, both the husband and wife begin to feel unloved and frustrated that their partner does not appreciate the ways they are trying to express their love to each other - all because they didn't understand that their spouse's primary love language is different than their own.        Chapman explains that this is why it is so important to understand which of the love languages are most important to you and your spouse. He also states it is important to realize that these love languages are not better or worse than each other; that they are more a matter of personal preference and that different individuals will respond differently to each of them. Because Chapman believes this to be so crucial, he devotes a chapter to helping couples discover their primary love language. As a bonus feature, the audio book Karen and I purchased included a questionnaire designed to help Chapman's readers (listeners?) recognize their own primary love language and that of their spouse.      One of the few problems I have with the book is Chapman's attempt to blame the vast majority of marital problems on simple errors in expressing the wrong love language to their marital partner, stating that most men and women have good intentions when it came to their interactions with their spouse. While it is undoubtedly true that many problems are caused by communication breakdowns, and I wholeheartedly believe an attitude of grace and forgiveness should permeate a marriage, it seems Chapman downplays the effect of mankind's sinful nature.Perhaps Chapman just wants to emphasize that every benefit of the doubt should be extended to our spouses (something I wholeheartedly agree with!) but listening to The Five Love Languages it was easy to get the impression that every marital spat, fight, argument and discord could be attributed to a simple misunderstanding; that a \\"good\\" and \\"well-meaning\\" husband or wife would never intentionally hurt the feelings or demean their significant other. This is simply not true and ignores the fundamental problem in any marriage - that it consists of two imperfect sinners!    My wife and I enjoyed listening to the book on our travels. The format and setting gave us the unique opportunity to discuss each chapter immediately after we were done listening to it. Chapman used humorous stories effectively, keeping us interested throughout.
B00197POXG|4.0|We just watched the pilot episode and enjoyed it thoroughly. BUT there is no close-captioning and no subtitles. We would have paid more to have that feature.
193413712X|4.0|A door to door sales man named Howard remembers his father's life and his descent into mental illness. After his father's death Howard begins to have epileptic fits which later leads his wife to attempt to institutionalize him. He gets wind of her plan and leaves her and their four children, marries again and starts a new life. Howard's son, George who himself tried to run away on the day his father disappeared lies dying in his living room with his family around him, remembering his father and his own life and his love for and relationship with his dad. I know this sounds like a book where not much happens and it is mostly a 'thought' book but Harding's use of language is very lush and satisfying. Toni Morrison fans will love this book. It's a book you'll want to re-read.
B000002UAC|4.0|With The Beatles ***1/2<br /><br />It is almost impossible to review Beatles albums without going track by track because their albums are always full of brilliant tracks. But what makes it even harder is you have to divide the albums into their sections, John's, Paul's, and George's.<br /><br />This being their second ACTUAL lp it was generously filled from front to back with tracks in a time where usual six to eight tracks were included on an album.<br /><br />The originals on the album are a mixed bag really. Lennons' 'It Wont Be Long' is among the groups all time greatest and forgotten tracks. His signature wail is chilling, while the next 'All Ive Got To Do' is decent at best, though Harrison does play a great country twanged solo, sure to have influence the Byrds. Admittedly I am not a great Paul McCartney fan as I find him more fit for Broadway than rock n' roll, his 'All My Loving' is easily the strongest track on the album. 'Don't Bother Me' being the token Harrison track is also among the strongest. 'I Wanna Be Your Man' is classic early Beatles with Ringo on vocals and doing a stellar job at that, while 'Little Child' is a poor attempt at a Chuck Berry number, and 'Not A Second Time' may have been nice in 1964 but runs boring today.<br /><br />As far as the covers, or 'personal selections' as they called them then they are all fantastic. 'Please Mister Postman' could rival that of 'Twist And Shout' as Lennons best vocal. 'Roll Over Beethoven' haunted Harrison and Lennon that they couldn't write something like it. 'You Really Got A Hold On Me' is almost better than the original Smokey Robinson version, and it sure is sung with more soul. 'Money' is decent however and could have been done better but is still pulled off thanks to Lennon.<br /><br />With The Beatles is an early Beatles classic. They still hadn't found their niche and become comfortable with themselves but still pulled of a great rock n' roll record none the less.

B001CD6FKI|3.0|There are plenty of good points about Speed Racer.  There are plenty of efforts made that -- taken on their own -- are very respectable for their attempts if not the execution. Unfortunately the Wachowskis seem to have forgotten some very basic elements of storytelling amidst all these attempts, and the results are a movie that's mediocre at best.     Speed Racer begins telling story of a young Speed Racer who's never had any interests other than racing from the time he was a grade school student.  With his big brother setting the example as a famous race car driver, he ends up following in his brother's footsteps despite him leaving both racing and his family under lousy conditions. Determined to be great - but also racing directly against the memory of his deceased brother - he dominates the competition and is eventually offered a chance to race for Royalton Industries, the top company in racing headed by the creepy announcer from `V for Vendetta'.  The smarmy sales pitch doesn't win over Speed, and his refusal to race upsets the owner, who then chooses to  try and kill him for his refusal.  As a side-plot, Racer X (played by Fox) is busy crusading against the criminals who have ruined the game he loves.    It's a pretty basic setup that presents an odd problem. While I often lament the lack of  patient storytelling in modern movies, I'm not sure this plot needed two hours and 15 minutes to execute.  It's especially notable when the main character is so drab. The performance by Emile Hirsch as speed racer, is, well:  Not campy  not convincingly serious  Sort of semi-brooding  Not really humorous  completely lacking in chemistry with his on-screen girlfriend.  Not menacing or intense at all when he tries.    Hirsch's Speed Racer exists in a strange, uninteresting, no-man's land that mirrors the cg background and human actors in the entire movie. You're never completely attached him, he's simply a protagonist, not a hero.  And like most video game the \\"talky parts\\"just feel like cut scenes in between boss fights (or in this case races in new locations). Part of the problem in this comes from the aforementioned visuals. While it's fine to dazzle with bright colors, there aren't moments of quiet that are convincing enough to provide a real build to the races. Everything feels to be going at the same speed. Normal conversations should not have existed in the same lane as the races. In fact they shouldn't have even been on a freeway.    There are some great visuals here, there's no doubt in that regard. Constant references to manga and anime storytelling devices are made, and most are successful.Characters make speeches while backed up by montages that illustrate their point.Speed lines, that old staple of manga and anime, is transformed into a very well done live version where backgrounds transform in live action and give an interesting escalation to the action. It works although I'm not sure if it holds much interest to those who aren't old-school anime fans. In this way it's reminiscent of Ang Lee's efforts to infuse comic book storytelling into his Hulk adaptation. It looked amazing to me, personally, but how many non-artists really cared?     In the end this doesn't work as well as it should have, but there's a certain level of respect deserved for a bold attempt and a nice integration of some very good cg. Essentially it IS a live-action anime, which is what a lot of us have wanted to see (imagining what Cameron's adaptation of Angel Alita is going to be like, etc.). Now the question is `should we ever have been anxious to see this?'    i originally wrote this review for my site at coalminds dot com
B00005JM02|5.0|Another Pixar film that all ages will enjoy, \\"Finding Nemo\\" delivers a simple story with some pretty heavy themes.  It's one of those rare gems that will entertain you when you're young, but get all the more relevant and meaningful when you see it again later down the road.  Contrary to some of the negative reviews, it is never too violent or too sad for the kids to see, giving only the fun scares that movies like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King had throughout.  It's about as universally enjoyable as a movie can get.    Aside from WALL-E, it's the most visually stunning Pixar movie I've ever had the pleasure of feasting my eyes upon.  The world of the ocean opens up in a beautiful array of colors with scenery as complex and detailed as the real thing.  So much work was put into making it look real, and the producers knew when to make certain creatures look just like their real life counter part (the jellyfish) and they knew when to stylize others (the seagulls).  From the true to life things to the more cartoony things, everything here is so exceptionally done, from the overall story arc, to the themes of dealing with loss and learning to let your kids experience life, to the characters, to the voice acting, to the exceptionally crafted DVD itself.    I wouldn't call \\"Finding Nemo\\" a masterpiece or a classic, but it aims high and comes very, very close.  What it is, though, is an astoundingly well done film that tells a story from the heart that will entertain, stun, and put smiles on the faces of the audience.    9/10
B000OCXFCO|2.0|another bad album from megadeth,the only good song is''sleepwalker''.<br />since the best lineup left the band: david ellefson-marty friedman-nick menza,they never did a good album again.the best megadeth albums are ''rust in peace and countdown to extintion,the rest are poor attempts to get near metallica,but always failed.<br />like mustaine said to larz ''everything you do turns to gold and all i do backfire''<br />besides that mustaine voice is horrible and when he sings live forget it.......<br />no one stands mustaine he changes the lineup in almost every record,and when he had the guys i talked about it was the best megadeth years,no one stands him and thats why he get kicked of metallica.....<br />20 million records in 25 years tells how weak megadeth act has been,compare to metallica 120 million,iron maiden 90 million or judas priest 85 million sold.<br />and it is true when people say metallica sold out.......<br />yes they sold out every gig...............<br />if you want to spend your money on a megadeth record try rust in p.-countdown to e.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|The only thing better than watching Sex in the City on tv is watching it commercial free as it's meant to be.  It is clear and enjoyable to watch a disk at a time rather than 30 minutes at a time.  The bonus disk is good, too.  Good deal!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I first loaned this movie to my brother who loved it; when I finally started watching it, I knew it was about love and the robot who found it.  Watching deeper in the movie one realizes why and how obesity has become such a major problem.  The lazier people get in their own lives (witness how all of the \\"supplemental\\" foods that they are now catering to children is to drink everything, rather that eat.  This is very much as message on the throwaway society -- if you don't care about yourself, why would you care about your world?  Very interesting the way the movie was put together, but it is already happening.  Look at the coupons that come in the Sunday paper and look at how many products are professed to the consumer to be a \\"miracle\\" cure in a bottle.  Pretty sad, but a very important message relevant today.  Also, the movie is packed in an environmentally made package.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This is an AMAZING set, but the best part is the DVD of the concert done in the Wiltern Theatre in New York. (Not to say that the accompanying CD is by any means bad;it's an excellent recording for being live, and it's got fantastic energy because of it.) The concert DVD (taped for Michael's first PBS special) is awesome!!! Michael's singing is, as always, great, and his charisma and humor are nothing short of mesmerizing. Some of my favorite parts are when you get to listen to him talk to the audience, because you don't get to hear him talk as much as sing, but the singing is fantastic! And it has bonus matreial (Backstage Pass and \\"Song For You\\" featuring Chris Botti) that give you a good look at what goes on  behind the scenes (with more hilarities from Mr. Buble that you're sure to enjoy). If you love listning (and watching!) this fantastic entertainer, you must get this!!!
B001GKJ2FM|1.0|I love cheesy movies and a fair number of musicals BUT this has to be a joke.  This movie is breaking records for 2008???  There are maybe two songs that faired an okay from me-the rest I was cringing every time the actors opened their mouths.  I love Meryl and I doubt that I'll ever be able to prop her back on the pedestal I had her on after this.  This is bad.  This is a very bad film and I couldn't dare recommend this to my worst enemy.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Henry Jaglom's 1987 film (also known as OUT OF ROSENHEIM) is just about perfect, and is one of the most affecting films ever made about the forging of a deep friendship. When the fat and overdressed German tourist Jasmin Münchgstettner (the great Marianne Sägebracht) is marooned in the California desert by her traveling companion she seems to be almost entirely without resources to the eyes of Brenda (the equally great CCH Pounder), the suspicious and short-tempered truck stop owner who temporarily takes her in. But Jasmin has resources no one at the truck stop suspects, and soon she's setting to rights the truck stop itself as well as the entire community of misfits gathered around it--including Brenda and her dysfunctional clan.     The film is as much as anything a tribute to trust and to hard work; the ending (which features a perfect little musical number) is one of the best of any independent films I can think of, and one of the most beautifully earned. The haunting Jevetta Steele song \\"Calling You,\\" featured prominently on the soundtrack, exactly captures the film's sense of windswept longing in the most trying of environments.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|Folie A Deux is amazing. Every song on it will have you singing in the shower. I've always liked Fall Out Boy since Grand Theft Autumn, but this album brings it to a whole new level.

B0018CWEYY|3.0|In all fairness, LOST managed to keep me watching it link after link after link (online), even when I had to study for finals or start excruciatingly long papers. While I found the first and second seasons to be fun and exciting, the show began losing me throughout the third season, and especially the fourth. It started by introducing an array of characters - most of which were so interesting to the point of being just a bit too interesting. Then random plot devices began showing up, and other annoying little things, and they never went away. A few of them really stood out: HOW MANY TIMES did you hear the phrases \\"Somebody get her/him some water!\\" \\"He/she needs water!\\" after someone was found injured or wounded or whatever..HOW MANY TIMES do we need to hear Locke say \\"don't tell me what I can't do.\\" HOW MANY TIMES did we need to hear someone say \\"you don't know me,\\" before getting treated to the wonderful facts about their lives from the others?? Every single sentence uttered by any of the characters is dripping with drama..everything overloaded with passion..too much for me to handle..nothing needs to be THAT dramatic to keep our attention nowadays does it?   and forget about the whole visions of dead people thing. I mean, what simpler way is there for a character to figure something out than by making them have a vision of someone or something just telling them what to do? It can't get any easier than that. and this is something they did way too many times throughout the show. Don't know which way to go next? Hey! No Worries! Just get some sleep and some dead person will tell you exactly what to do next! It's like having a drama set in a hospital; scene not dramatic enough? Just bring in someone bleeding to death and shock them and yell CLEAR..that'll have people glued to the screen..at least for the 10-seconds of attention span hollywood seems to think the average viewer now possesses.      SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!!!  not to mention this wonderful new adventure they started with time travel ugh. how much could these screenwriters possibly know about time travel theories, to feel comfortable enough to incorporate them into their script? But of course, the average viewer won't know much, because the average viewer is not a physicist! how convenient. My knowledge of physics is limited to action and reaction, but I found the whole idea to be a bit fishy. Constants to prevent massive hemorrhaging? Seems more like a literary metaphor than a sci-fi theme to me.     But, in the end, it did what a drama should do and entertained me, so kudos to the show for that. But if someone yells for water one more time in season 5, that's it.     SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    As for the multiple loose ends and questions that get answered 15 episodes later..well, I think that's already been covered. It's easy enough to maintain viewers' interest by posing questions that seem just one episode short of being answered. Would I ever watch LOST again? NO WAY. Each episode was only as good as how much closer it brought me to some bigger \\"explanation.\\" But do I care to sit through numerous episodes of LOST once again to re-visit how john got in his wheelchair, when I now know it's because of his father? nope.
0142410322|4.0|Some people don't seem to understand that Roald Dahl was first and formost a satirist.  FACTORY and PEACH are not happy or optimistic children's stories; they are PARODIES of same.  Practical jokes on the parents.  Think of the ecstatic eulogy at the beginning of FACTORY to the \\"nutritious\\" goodness of chocolate. And the fact that the happiest moment in PEACH is the grizzly double death of James' closest relatives and caregivers. You might as well say that MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is a great scriptural epic.  Or NORTH BY NORTHWEST a spy thriller.  ELEVATOR is one of Roald Dahl's funniest pieces.  The President's aide triumphantly \\"balancing the budget\\".  The General who loves to blow things up because it makes such a lovely noise.  \\"Woomph!  Woomph!  Woomph!\\"<br /><br />You want to see what kind of guy Roald Dahl was?  Read the short story \\"Bitch\\" first published in Playboy 1974 also available in collections of his work such as the popular SWITCH BITCH.  Or the short story \\"The Visitor\\" in the same book, about a rich womanizer who gets tricked into having sex with a leper.
0316666343|3.0|PROS:<br />- Gripping beginning.<br />- Unique perspective (that of a 14-year-old looking down from heaven).<br />- Good writing.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- There are several distracting side stories that are unnecessary. Few of the extra characters are developed much. We never really learn that much about the 14-year-old family or friends. We learn a little bit of each.<br />- The main plot, to discover the killer, has too many boring tangents.<br />- The end of the novel is disappointing. SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: The fate of the killer is not satisfying and the protagonist's re-appearance on Earth feels out of place.<br /><br />WHO WOULD LIKE IT: Anyone who has lost someone who is younger than them.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If the editors had chopped 100 pages off this novel, it probably would have been a 5 star novel. It feels like a short story that had a filler inserted to give it 300+ pages. A liked the novel (hence, 3 stars), but I didn't love it.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Where do I even start with this album?  There's so much going on with this band and they do it so well it's almost impossible to translate it into words.  They pummel you with Sabbath style riffs; they groove with the best of jam bands; they've got a vein of blues straight out of the Delta, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a sci-fi concept that comes right out of Rush's playbook, or even the Hawkwind missal.<br />The lyrics are humorous, intelligent, nonsensical, poetic and all sung with Neil Fallon's superb, bluesy bellow.<br />Clutch is one of those \\"best bands you probably haven't heard of\\", and if I didn't stumble across 10001110101 on the radio, I would still be in the dark, but thanks to that moment of mind-blowing serendipity I am hooked.  If you're looking for a unique, talented band, making music that runs completely counter to the homogenous dreck cluttering up the airwaves, you have just found it. Adjust your pants, and dance the good time dance. (But then again that's a different album.)
B000X5SPBI|5.0|If you haven't watched any of the Supernatural shows you are missing out on a great show! This show rocks! I really hope they don't end the show after 5 seasons like the creator keeps saying he's going to do. You can keep supernatural stuff going forever! I get the magazine which I highly recommend too. You learn a lot of stuff about the actors and what's going on with the show in the book. Also has some hot posters too. The music for the show is always awesome! I wish they could get a soundtrack out if they haven't already. I know there were some problems with that in reading the magazine. We can only hope. Once again..I highly recommend this show..you will not be disappointed!

0679422714|4.0|This book was a xmas gift. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. It persuades me that Mao was as sociopathic as Hitler and that his works were on balance as evil as Stalin's and that he used the same kind of terror and disinformation to advance and secure his ends. There are now hundreds of reader reviews of this book outstanding, so I haven't much to add.    First of all, the authors do not appear to be knee-jerk anticommunists. For example, they describe Lauchlin Curry as sympathetic toward communism, not a secret communist agent. I think they get that right.    The great strength of this book is its use of soviet sources/archives. Its weakness is that it is not sufficiently critical of them or of any of its other sources that support its authors' thesis. One reviewer has already mentioned their idiosyncratic interpretation/narration of the Quemoy/Matsu crisis -- i.e., it was all about Russia.    Another case, which is easy to check from publicly available sources, they claim that the Korean War caused US aircraft losses in excess of replacement rates, 3000 in the first year of the war. While this claim is relevant to their argument, it's not true. The US lost about 2,000 planes in the entire Korean War. Only 10 percent of these losses were in air-to-air combat. During the same period it produced about 20,000 military aircraft.    However, no book is perfect.
B000TEUSJK|1.0|The only thing worth seeing in this crappy ,booooooring! porn movie are the costumes designed by the great Danilo Donati. And even he was sleep walking thru this dreck as he had already done Fellini's \\"Satyricon\\" and just fell back on that concept.   So get \\"Satyricon\\" instead. It's really about the same thing (Is \\"Caligula\\" about anything really?), is more historically convincing (tho' hardly accurate), in Italian (a great help in creating a cultural reference), and just a better ride into the Ancient Western World. \\"Satyricon\\" too has no discernable plot, but then it comes from fragments of an ancient story....part of its charm.     Yep...forget this mess, and buy \\"Satyricon\\".
B000SZHCRQ|2.0|This album starts out weak and gets weaker as it goes. Paul's second attempt at a true \\"solo\\" album (where he plays all the instruments) falls flat. Some people think it was his attempt to do punk but it's more like his experimental stuff he does as \\"The Fireman\\".  But when Paul experiments stuff like melody and structure go out the window. He'd have been better off saving these songs, and interspersing the stronger ones in future albums and as B-sides rather than release them all together. AND it doesn't have the superior live version of \\"Coming Up\\" which came as a single with the original vinyl album.
B001ACH4DS|2.0|What's with the big gap of silence between tracks 12 & 13? First time I played the CD I thought it was my player--but it happens on all of them I try. C'mon, I didn't buy a CD to listen to quiet! In order to hear track 13 I have to advance it myself.     Anyone else have this problem??

Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, Pierce Bronsan, et.al.-- God Bless 'em, their joy in making this musical is transparent and infectious.  It's also a beautiful film -- the scenery is fantastic.  The saturated color from the opening on through is perfect for this genre.  \\"Mamma Mia\\" is a gift of fun and good cheer.  Enjoy!
1400063515|2.0|It's too bad Taleb's ego is louder than his thesis.   While he puts forth many interesting and insightful concepts and thoughts, the price one must pay to find them amongst the egocentric drivel that fills most of the pages makes this read hardly worth the effort.  I can't help but think that the basic arguments from such a pretentious elitist could only be hot air.  It's hard to take him seriously.
0307341550|4.0|This book would be an engrossing read from an author of stature so I was amazed to discover that it was a first effort for Ms. Flynn.  It definitely had three ingredients that make for a surefire good read - a page-turner, quality prose, and psychological suspense.<br /><br />In short the plot is about a young woman named Camille, who works for a non-major newspaper, who goes back to her hometown to investigate the murder of two children.  She does this reluctantly because of her distant and dysfunctional relationship with her mother and step-father.  She has a dead sibling who was lost during her youth, and a half-sister she hardly knows.  The book interweaves her relationship with her family and effort to find the murderer.<br /><br />What I loved most is that Ms. Flynn came up with some modern, intriguing, and less \\"worn out\\" ideas for her story.  For example, Camille is a cutter who actually cuts words all over her body.  We slowly learn that her mother has Munchausen by Proxy, a disease which is accurately depicted and explained.  Unlike many novels, the potential love object for Camille doesn't end up falling for her because he is bothered once he sees her body.  Most importantly, the killer of the children is unexpected and not revealed until the very end!

B001M5UDGS|5.0|For the first few minutes, I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting myself into.  Then the first song starts to play, and NPH follows through like a champ with his amazing vocals.  I remember seeing him do a song from RENT on Conan over a decade ago, and he's improved much since those days.  The laughs don't stop coming, and the performances from the entire cast is outstanding.  I even have a hard time trying to figure out which song I like the most!  Fans of Joss Whedon have probably already stepped on board.  Whedon's got a knack for not just interesting storytelling, but also has a spectacular grasp on changing the tone of a story from one mood to the next.  He does the same here.  Even if you aren't a fan of musicals, you would be sure to get TONS of laughs and garner respect for this imaginative musical adventure.
0061537934|5.0|Even though the concept of a dog writing a novel about his family is unbelievable, I found myself believing every word. Even if you are not a dog lover, the dog's point of view will give insight into human behavior. Afterall, Enzo the dog believes that he will become a human in his next lifetime - that's how advanced he is. Enzo is loyal to Denny, his master, throughout his life and even tries not to be in pain when Denny has to take him to the vet because Denny already is in huge debt. I love that Enzo calls Denny's inlaws the Twins, and sometimes the Evil Twins, because they dress and act alike. A very rewarding read!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I own about 25 concert dvd's- blues, historical, guitar players, rock and metal and this is by far the best dvd I have ever watched. The light show alone is worth the cost 2 times over. The song list is great and the quality of sound and video is exceptional. The only one close to this would be Rush in Rio. I practically had an out of body experience watching this, levitated, and was taken to infinity. Amazing!
1593082479|5.0|Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale. Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.     Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.     In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone.
0316035904|3.0|It is hard to pick one set of stars for a book that is full of different essays. I would give some of the essays 4 stars, others 3, and maybe even some 2s. If I look at the book as a whole, I liked it. There are a few stories that stick out -- like Santaland Diaries (about Sedaris' stint as an Elf at Macy's Santaland in NY) and Six to Eight Black Men (about how the Netherlands celebrates Christmas with \\"black peters\\"). All of the stories share Sedaris' wit, and some star people who probably belong on Santa's naughty list. I enjoyed the stories that were about Sedaris and his family more than the ones that were not.
B0018M6J90|4.0|Directed by Bharat Nalluri, known previously for actioners and thrillers, this 2008 trifle pleasantly surprised me as it is an assured throwback to the effortlessly breezy 1930's screwball farces with some added serious undertones capturing England at an uncertain time as the country was preparing for another world war. In look and manner, the film is reminiscent of Stephen Frears' 2005 [[ASIN:B000ETRCN0 Mrs. Henderson Presents]], but I find this a comparatively more entertaining concoction thanks to the sly performances of Frances McDormand and Amy Adams. The featherweight plot centers on Guinevere Pettigrew, a starchy governess turned out on the street with prospects for future employment looking dimmer by the moment.<br /><br />Suddenly homeless and penniless, she acts rashly in a moment of desperation behind the back of an unsympathetic employment agent by stealing a referral for a social secretary to a bubble-headed American actress fancifully named Delysia Lafosee. Instead of the nanny job she thought she pilfered, Miss Pettigrew finds her vocation to be juggling the three men in Delysia's life - surly nightclub owner Nick who owns Delysia's nicely furnished flat; young theatrical producer Phil who is considering Delysia for the lead in his latest West End production; and penniless accompanist Michael just released from prison and back to reclaim Delysia's heart. Complications stem from Delysia's uncompromising need to land the part in Phil's musical, but naturally she cannot control her heart. Miss Pettigrew faces complications of her own when she finds she has to help social climber Edythe Dubarry fix her relationship with lingerie designer boyfriend Joe despite the fact that Joe is falling for Miss Pettigrew.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that everything sorts itself out in the screwball-breezy screenplay by David Magee ([[ASIN:B0007CNXUK Finding Neverland]]) and Simon Beaufoy ([[ASIN:B000M341RI The Full Monty]], [[ASIN:B001KVZ6BG Slumdog Millionaire]]). What is surprising is how fluently Nalluri directs the proceedings without pulling out a sledgehammer for the encroaching wartime atmosphere. He is smart enough to realize this type of airy farce depends on the fleet tone by which his actors can carry the story. In this respect, casting is ideal as the chameleonic McDormand brings convincing British reserve and her smart comedy chops to the title role. Adams has a field day as Delysia providing measured balance to her innate sprightliness at key moments. Shirley Henderson makes the most of a scene-stealing part as manipulative, helium-voiced Edythe. Even the men fare well in this picture - Tom Payne as shallow Phil, Mark Strong as burly Nick (hardly recognizable as the same actor who sharply played the Jordanian head of intelligence in Ridley Scott's [[ASIN:B001C48EGK Body of Lies]]), and best of all, Lee Pace ([[ASIN:B000YAA2SQ Pushing Daisies]]) showing genuine matinee idol appeal as Michael and Ciar&aacute;n Hands bringing worldly charm to the erudite Joe.<br /><br />All the grand period detail is lush and impeccably presented from Sarah Greenwood's production design to Michael O'Connor's costumes to John de Dorman's cinematography. The extras on the two-sided 2008 DVD tend toward the predictable. Nalluri provides dry audio commentary where he belabors the technical details at the expense of any other aspect of the production that could have been more interesting. The widescreen version is on one side along with eight minutes of deleted scenes and an interesting eight-minute making-of featurette which focuses on the author of the original story, Winifred Watson, while the full screen version is on the other side with an expendable 18-minute promotional featurette heavy on film clips.surprising is how fluently Nalluri directs the proceedings without pulling out a sledgehammer for the encroaching wartime atmosphere.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|A story of a great friendship in multicultural suburbia. Think of Karate Kid. But then think of Dirty Harry in retirement. Clint is not done yet, here comes another masterpiece from the man with the least versatile acting talent to ever win an Oscar. He is a great director.<br /><br />Walt Kowalski is a mean old man, unable to like anything or anybody. Except his old dog Daisy and his Gran Torino. He does seem to have loved his wife though, who made the priest promise to look after him. The priest grows on you with his stubborn insistence on his useless promise. Walt will not confess, no man.<br /><br />Walt gets to know his Hmong neighbors and starts mellowing with the young crowd. He still has attacks of big man behaviour, threatening gangs of all colours with his guns and gaining Pyrrhic victories. When the worst happens, when his escalating do-gooding has led to disaster for his friend, he goes for the ultimate show-down. Slow in build-up, but expected throughout. And a brillant closure.<br /><br />Great film.
B00004RWQ9|4.0|its a great movie would highly reccomend it but the reason i give it 4 stars and not 5 is because the ending is very sad.
B0013TTK9E|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book, both for the content and the writing style.  Persuasion is my favorite Austen novel and I was looking forward to the story from Captain Wentworth's side.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what you get, a retelling of the bare facts without any insight into his thought processes.    The level of writing in this book was shockingly low-level.  I would rate it slightly above the 'chapter books' my 9 year old niece is reading.
0756404746|5.0|I thought I had already reviewed this book. Must be that the reviews are only good for the version you bought. This is an awesome book. I have read Jordan, Martin, MacMasters, and many others. I loved many of them. This book beat them hands down. Some of the paragraphs were so artistically worded I reread them over and over. I might be a bit obsessed with words. (example: \\"Treading Trodden Trails\\" in the Dave Matthews song to me is perfection. It says everything it needs to say and is poetry too!)  But I truely loved this book and so far everyone I have shared this book with has loved it as well. I see some negative reviews in here and personally I can't understand them. For the genre this is an awesome book. It isn't Harry Potter, it isn't King of Thrones. The first is light and fantastical, the other is dark and mid-evil. I loved both of them as well. This is is somewhere inbetween in a thoroughly fleshed out world of it's own. I am sure this review does not do it justice, but I did want to make sure I said what I thought about it.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I don't get all the hoopla about this director and his version of Batman .    The first major problem I have is the pacing and editing . The storyline here has been squished into a 2 hour movie whereas it should have been 2-3 movies .     Lot of the stuff with the Joker was very silly . I didn't buy the brand of cynical psychopath dished out .      The transformation of Harvey Dent from goody-two-shoe to deranged psychopath was not believable . There really was no good explanation for that .    That goes for a lot of the stuff in the film . All of the things that happened are just not explained fully or just don't make sense . Why was the Joker able to escape from jail ?     Another problem I have is the Batman himself . I would never choose this actor . There is no acting first of all . But he played a psycho in some other movie and this director is making some new horror flick so that explains something to me .     And this Batman is way too vulnerable . Always injured and almost got killed .    The batmobiles : ridiculous . A tank and an unmaneuverable motorcycle .     Can't wait until the media infatuation with this Batman series peters out . These two movies were a dud .
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|It's difficult to categorize a film that takes as many precariously driven dramatic turns as this 2008 picture directed by the versatile Danny Boyle. So why even bother since he manages to navigate fluidly between the feel-bad and feel-good extremes of Simon Beaufoy's ([[ASIN:B0018M6J90 Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day]]) emotionally dense script with aplomb? The apt title refers to someone who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, and in this case, is on the verge of becoming very wealthy due to a serendipitous situation that leads him to be a finalist on the Hindi version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\\" On the surface, the premise sounds rather silly, but the familiar game show, already a trivia footnote in this country, provides the catalyst for the vividly rendered events that unfold for one particular boy named Jamal Malik, a coffee carrier at a local telemarketing company. Contrivances aside, it is his life experiences that feed him the answers to the increasingly difficult questions, but the producers suspect a scam at work and have the police torture him in order to confess. What really emerges is Malik's undying devotion to his one true love, Latika, from whom he has long been estranged due to the desperate circumstances in her life.<br /><br />The movie's childhood flashbacks have a Dickens-level quality set against a cultural tableau unfamiliar to most of us. They focus on young Jamal and his older brother Salim, who are soon orphaned after their mother is killed for being a Muslim. They are joined by another abandoned orphan Latika, and together they dub themselves the Three Musketeers. They eventually find themselves indentured under the servitude of the deceptively kind Maman, who goes to extremes in keeping the children as street beggars. The brothers escape and eventually figure out how to scam tourists at the Taj Mahal, while Latika suffers the consequences of being left with Maman. The rest of the plot shows how the brothers diverge in values and how Latika becomes an unwilling mistress for a rival gang leader. Amazingly, Beaufoy's screenplay juxtaposes these spiraling events with the multiple-choice questions posed by Prem, the jocular \\"Millionaire\\" host, a popular figure who reveals his own sleazy underside in short order. There is such a swirl of activity with every episode in the film that there is little time to question the plausibility of the many plot turns because the resulting implausibility is what makes the movie so arresting.<br /><br />Boyle gives co-directing credit to Loveleen Tandan, previously a casting director specializing in India-themed films like Mira Nair's [[ASIN:B00006AW0I Monsoon Wedding]] and [[ASIN:B0006FO8E8 Vanity Fair]], and it's obvious that the combination of their talents gives us a greater intimacy into India than one would expect from Boyle by himself. Other than his charming fable, [[ASIN:B000AP04GK Millions]], there is little indication in Boyle's resume (the sci-fi shocker [[ASIN:B000Y7U98C Sunshine]], the post-apocalyptic thriller [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]], the drug-infested [[ASIN:B0001XALTG Trainspotting]]) that he would have been capable of telling such a fanciful tale so convincingly. At the same time, the visual flourishes (thanks primarily to the stunning cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantel) and fast-cut editing reflect his familiar touches. The no-frills performances befit the story with Dev Patel bringing emotional focus to the grown Jamal and Frieda Pinto appropriately fetching as the grown Latika. Smaller roles are filled with a few more familiar faces with Indian movie icon Anil Koopar playing Prem and character actor Irrfan Khan (the father in [[ASIN:B000U2U0E4 The Namesake]]) as the determined police inspector. There are times when the film feels overly manipulative, but the buoyant spirit keeps thing afloat just when you feel you've been left on sensory overload.comes an unwilling mistress for a rival gang leader.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Yes, the movie is available online, but the DVD offers so much more. The musical commentary is a stitch, as it explores various musical styles and doesn't take itself seriously in the least. You'll catch yourself humming the tunes, to both the show itself and the commentary.     The disc also includes other talented citizen applications to the Evil League of Evil. There's a lot of talent out there.     If you are new to Dr. Horrible, you need to keep in mind that it's the story of the birth of a super-villain. Some viewers have taken issue with the ending, but it is appropriate considering the whole story. After all, achieving what we desire comes at a price. The \\"greater\\" the dream, the greater the price.    Also, be sure to watch the credits for clues to the Easter eggs that the producers have tucked into the DVD. Watch the credits to the very end for something that doesn't look \\"normal.\\" I think we'll be playing with this DVD for a while to figure out just how many treasures wait inside.
B001KVZ6BG|4.0|Okay, I admit it: I hate Indian movies. Have always hated them, except a few old movies like Sangam or their non-musical/stupid movies from 70s. But this movie was great. To be honest, I wanted to stop watching it 15 mins into the movie. I thought to myself hey I have enough personal troubles to be watching this sad movie but I soldiered on and stayed to see the rest and it did not disappoint. I loved it once I was done with it. Great movie, great story line and good acting. It's a modern love story of the sort you can not see in Hollywood. It's a story about humanity and good vs evil. Still, you could have faith in good nature human beings like Jamal and Latika. Even Salim redeemed his soul by taking on his boss. I am happy seeing this movie and will recommend it to every one I kno. Hopefully it will win the Oscar too. Great movie!
0385340990|5.0|I heard an interview with one of the authors on NPR, which made the book sound so interesting that I bought it at my next opportunity. The book lived up to all my expectations. Told through the use of correspondence between characters, the story is fast-paced and gripping. The heroine comes to feel like a good friend.<br /><br />Set in time shortly after World War II, the book offers a view of post-War London that feels so real that I can almost smell the smoke. Buildings are still in rubble, and the people have lost any sense of safety. Safety has fled the island of Guernsey, as well. Or rather, it was chased away by the Nazis who occupied the island for years during the war. Juliet, an author, receives an intriguing letter from a resident of Guernsey and bit by bit, she (and the readers) come to know the seldom told tale of the occupation.<br /><br />The book is filled with lots of humor to keep things from being too heavy, but with an emotional realism that grips the heart. I  highly recommend it.
B001KWPU3E|4.0|I loved Dido's first album and somehow missed the second. Safe trip home is what I expected, beautiful vocals and introspective lyrics. She gives us much to enjoy this time around. There are stronger contenders like \\"Quiet Times\\" and \\"Never Want to Say It's Love,\\" and I even downloaded the bonus tracks. \\"Grafton Street\\" and \\"It Comes and It Goes\\" also stand out. There isn't much to dislike on this album.

BUY THIS NOW!!!   I have been watching for 4 hours now and Im still amazed...even my 5 year old is interested in it...and no I dont feel the \\"feeding\\" scenes are to violent...kids need to know how nature is as its a natural reality.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|Had this item since Christmas ,so far pictures look good, not ready to review picture detail yet. The carry case is good, made well and does the job. What would have been real handy is if there was a way to attach the case to a camera strap...there is nothing. The device is so small it would be nice if it could be attached to a strap and therefore always available . Simple feature would make it so convenient.
B001EO748M|5.0|I love this series. I really enjoyed the first season and the second just got better. As an avid reader of historical fiction, this movie was an eye-treat. I know it is not accurate but I didn't care because the story is gripping and the actors are first class. Not to mention the AMAZING setting and LUSH wardrobe. I can't rave enough about this series. It got me so intrigued by Tudor England that I found myself opening encyclopedias and reading about it to know more. I wish they made more movies like this.  I heartily recommend it and envy those who are about to enjoy it for the first time.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Ill leave it to the other fine reviewers to give you the plot summary & technical info as to why this is such a great film.   And they are all correct...    I found this movie by accident late in 2008 never having heard of it before.   I admit that I didnt know what the heck was going on during the greater part of it. The movie tends to go off in enough different directions that I found myself wondering, who is the bad guy here? Why is this 'thing' happening? What was that scene all about? Um...Huh!?  And even at the end, when I learned, 'Who Dunnit', I didnt know why exactly. I was still confused but I was extremely creeped out by the movie. It did what I like movies to do. It made me think for days afterward.   I was thinking so much about it that I finally watched it again & then still went to Wikipedia & read an interview with Caruso & Anderson before I finally \\"got it!\\"    If I have any complaints its with the youngest actor ( the nephew ) in the movie as he seemed a bit amaturish. I believe I could have played the part just as well & Im alot amaturish! But this is after all a low budget movie...    Overall, this was a very interesting & fun film to watch from the opening scene with the 'chair' to the credits.   If youre sick of the flesh eating zombies & the teenage slasher flicks & want to see a truly creepy, well made psychological thriller then you need to see 'Session 9'.
0143038419|5.0|I know everyone has thier opinion and story about this book, some loved it and some thought is was over sold - well, I think that depends on where you are and how open you are to experiencing growth.  My story is that this book moved me in ways unimaginable.  I absolutely loved the journey and the truths discovered along the way.  If you are still trying to figure it all out and would love some great insight, read this book.  It has become almost like a reference for me - I plan to read it many times throughout me life.  I am grateful to people like Elizabeth Gilbert who have the courage and foresight to put themselves out there and share thier stories with us - she has given all of us a gift.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbit Proof Fence tells the gripping and extremely painful story of three young \\"half-caste\\" girls who were forcibly taken from their mother in Australia in 1931. These girls joined other children of mixed race in a \\"settlement\\" camp where they were taught values and customs against their will with the goal of making them maids and servants for the white people living in Australia. It was also hoped that without any \\"inbreeding\\" between white people and the aboriginal people, the aborigines would be eventually snuffed out after two generations. This story is clearly not a Disney movie; it's extremely painful but because this is based on real events the story deserves to be told very loudly and clearly so the world knows the injustices done against aboriginal people.<br /><br />When the film starts, we see sisters Molly and Daisy (Everlyn Sampi and Tianna Sansbury, respectively), torn away from their mother along with their cousin Gracie (Laura Monaghan). The three children are moved to the Moore River \\"native settlement\\" camp where they must only speak English; and they must adhere only to Christian values while eschewing the values, customs and religious beliefs of their people. The girls are terrified; but when Molly, the eldest of the three, decides they need to walk back the 1,200 miles to their mother's village in Jigalong, Australia, the two younger children also choose to run away with her.<br /><br />As many reviewers note, this film keeps you on the edge of your seat every step of the way. Not only is the plot as realistic as possible, the acting of the three children and the cinematography is excellent. Look also for great performances by Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville, the \\"protector\\" of the aboriginal people and Ningali Lawford as Maud, the mother of Molly and Daisy and caretaker of Gracie.<br /><br />The symbolism of the \\"rabbit proof fence\\" is quite clear. It's not just a way to keep rabbits escaping into the native areas; the fence represents the white people's attempts to separate themselves from another race who they perceive to be inferior. The fence is also a way to keep the aboriginal people out of the white man's land. I am appalled that Australia continued to forcibly remove \\"half-caste\\" mixed race children from their parents until sometime in 1970.<br /><br />Watch this film and see how the three girls make their escape from Moore River camp and make the journey back to Jigalong. Will all three girls make it? Will they evade the hunt for them by A.O. Neville and his local assistant Moodoo (David Gulpilil)? No plot spoilers--watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />Rabbit Proof Fence is an outstanding movie that won many awards; and it received critical praise. I highly recommend this film so that people can know this true, heartbreaking story of how small minded prejudiced people can be so cruel to other human beings.to separate themselves from another race who they perceive to be inferior.

B000VBP38C|5.0|I am in the minority here and have not seen the Colin Firth version. (I suppose I will have to soon after reading several good reviews)  I am addicted to watching this movieand have seen it so many times that I cannot imagine anyone else but Matthew MacFadyen in the roll for Mr. Darcy and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth.  Matthew MacFadyen is very hot!! I could just feel and see the passion he had for Lizzie.  The scene when it was raining and Mr. Darcy was expressing his love and Elizabeth was rejecting him.  Mr. Darcy looked so hurt - yet you could tell he wanted to kiss her.  And also at the end of the film when they were kneeling and he kisses Lizzie several times calling her \\"Mrs. Darcy\\"....his voice is so deep, his kisses were so gentle, so sweet...I wish I could trade places with Lizzie!!
B0001K9IJ8|3.0|First recording that is. I heard her first in the beginning of that Clint Eastwood flick a while ago. This is good but I wasn't \\"impressed\\" like I was from that movie.  I have since bought the DTS Surround disc of her album \\"Love Scenes\\", A Much better release.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|I am not a country music person. The TV makes a big deal out of Taylor Swift and I really like Love Story. So, I buy the CD to give it a try. After listening the CD couple times, I still don't like country music.  Love Story is still very good.  And she still ain't Hannah Montana.  So, I don't know.  Maybe the songs are just not loud enough for me. or maybe the country music is how it is.  But Love Story is still a 5-star music. The rest of the songs are just ok I guess.    Forgot to mention that the package was very nice. It came with a colorful booklet with beautiful pictures and a small poster. 5 stars for the packaging.
B001H9MWW2|5.0|A great collection to add to your Coldplay collection.  There is a lot of heart and emotion that was put into each song which you can feel every time you listen to it.
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I don't know if it is with pride or morbidity that I have to point out that the very first shot of THE DARK KNIGHT shows two buildings.  One is in the context of the film Gotham National Bank.  In reality it is the closed U. S. Post Office of Chicago.  The other building is 300 South Riverside Plaza.  It is the black glass building that occupies the top half of the frame.  It is also the building in which I work.  A substantial portion of this movie was filmed within a couple of blocks of where I work with the old Post Office doubling for a variety of locations, depending on the angle of the cameras.  People I know served as extras in the film, including the wife of a coworker, who can be easily spotted in a bar scene.  I watched a few scenes get set up and possibly filmed (it is always hard to tell when they are actually filming and when they are just milling about).  Unfortunately, none of the scenes that I'm confident were actually shot ended up in the final cut of the movie.<br /><br />On a less personal note, this film is notable for its absolutely astonishing action sequences and for the astonishing performance of Heath Ledger as the Joker.  The rest of the film doesn't come up to the level of those two items, something that I'm not sure most people who see the film take note of.  The script, for instance, is a bit of a mess, comprising one of the most nihilistic stories seen in recent years.  The film is also plagued by a spectacularly weak ending.  Precisely why the clay-footed Harvey Dent had to be preserved as a symbol for Gotham escaped me.  Insisting that Harvey represented something above the ordinary seemed about as accurate to me as that sports heroes are role models.  I mean, thank God I never employed O. J. Simpson as a role model.  The sudden shift at the end, when Batman wanted to protect the image of the villainous Harvey Dent by (in Christ-like fashion) becoming the scapegoat for Dent's crimes struck me as incongruous and flat out bad writing.  The movie had already been marred by persistently weak writing, but had it not, it would have been marred by the ending.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the action sequences in this film and the special effects are so spectacular, as is Heath Ledger's final performance that most filmgoers didn't seem to notice that this wasn't an especially good film.  There were some extraordinary moments, but there were also some especially weak ones.  Still, the good definitely outweighs the bad.  My complaint is that too many people are ignoring the bat and insisting that the movie is Oscar material, which it most assuredly is not.  It is not, in fact, anywhere near the best superhero movie of the summer, let alone of all time.  Both IRON MAN and HELL BOY 2 surpass it in the genre, and even the flawed THE HULK comes close to matching it.<br /><br />Still, despite its flaws, this is an extremely easy movie to enjoy and an easy one to forgive for its sins.  As a Chicagoan I especially enjoyed it.  As I mentioned above, a healthy percentage of this film was made only a few blocks from where I work in the south Loop.  It is interesting that they used Chicago very differently in this film than in BATMAN BEGINS.  In that film the technique was to take shots of Chicago and then substantially alter it with CGI.  In that way a host of buildings in the Loop were augmented and enhanced and the EL became a striking two-tiered affair.  In THE DARK KNIGHT, however, there was very little alteration of the city by CGI.  Instead of Gotham being CGI-Chicago, it was pretty much just Chicago.  I'm not sure why they decided to take this very different approach.  Perhaps economics?  CGI has gotten less expensive but it is still not cheap.  But this doesn't come across like a movie on which many corners were cut.  Whatever the reason, the approach in THE DARK KNIGHT was very, very different.  It was a lot of fun seeing places like Lower Wacker employed in the film.  And despite the fact that a huge hunk of the film was shot within a block or two of the Sears Tower, you'd have no idea that it even existed, so careful were they to exclude it.<br /><br />The film is renowned for Heath Ledger's final performance and even had he lived a great deal longer it would have been the performance of a lifetime.  Just as his Joker lets everything go to become an anarchic presence so here he throws everything away in becoming a homicidal maniac.  The literary/mythic predecessor for his Joker is easy to locate, Loki of Norse mythology.  Ledger's Joker is pretty much the Norse God of chaos incarnate in Gotham.  He even displays Loki's sense of mischief and humor.  It is on every level an amazing performance and it is almost impossible to imagine that Ledger will not be rewarded with a posthumous Oscar.  He dominates the movie, as Christian Bale does not.  And that leads to one of the other problems in the film.  Although Bale was decent enough in the previous movie, he was largely lost in this one.  In fact, whether caped or in a tux Bale was simply not very memorable.  If you watch IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT back to back, see which lead character you remember more.  His story was simply not made very interesting and was hurt by the implausible ending.  In fact, apart from Ledger, no one really gives an especially memorable performance.  Gary Oldman is impressive for not being anything like his typical roles.  It definitely increases my respect for him as an actor to see him playing a nonpsychopath.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun film to see.  I do think that with time people will come to realize that this simply is not a great movie.  It is a superior summer blockbuster type film, depending heavily on striking special effects and startling stunts, and buoyed by an amazing supporting performance.  And trust me, if there was ever a movie that I hoped would be a masterpiece, it is this one.  I walked by so many of the sets and saw so many of the accoutrements of the film that it really did feel like my neighborhood film.  It contains many impressive moments, but unfortunately the central story is not as good as the stunts, sets, and special effects.

B000ETQR3Q|3.0|I thought I had purchased 2 of the Nerf Strike Longshot CS-6 guns for my nephews for Christmas. It turns out only one was ordered. Ok, BUT I paid $25.99 and free shipping on December 1. Now they are asking DOUBLE the original price. That is Robbery!! To add to that, the shipping is about $10.00. I am really very disappointed in what Amazon has become. I used to do all my shopping through them. This will not happen next year. Be very, very careful when you order.

0739465325|5.0|The author calls language an \\"uninvented invention\\". This highly engaging, witty book is an attempt to uncover at least some of the secrets of language and to dismantle the stated paradox. He explains the meaning of `structure', argues that the present is the key to the past & explains why languages do not remain static. By drawing on recent discoveries in linguistics, he explores the forces of destruction, creation and the innate structure of language. It is revealed that the source of grammatical elements like case markers, pre- & post-positions and tense markers is the mundane words like inter alia `hand' and `go'.<br /><br />Chapter One: Castles In The Air, takes a close look at the structure of language, whilst the following chapter: Perpetual Motion, demonstrates linguistic development and change with particular reference to English, German, French and the [[ASIN:0195144139 Indo-European]] language family as a whole. Chapter Three: Forces Of Destruction, is a further investigation of how and why changes in sound and meaning take place, with many examples from Indo-European.<br /><br />Chapter Four examines interesting verbs like \\"to have/to hold\\" and the concepts of space & time in linguistic expression. All languages use spatial terms to describe temporal relations, revealing that space-time is deeply entrenched in human cognition. A metaphor is a way of describing something by comparing it to something else, and is an indispensable element in thought-processing. The stream of metaphors flowing through language moves from the concrete to the abstract. Language consists of layer upon layer of metaphors that are as common in plain conversation as in sublime poetics.<br /><br />Chapter Five: Forces Of Creation, is a discussion of how new words and structures arise, how meanings change and the multiple ways in which languages are enriched by these developments. It was interesting to learn, for example that the conjunction `but' derives from Old English `be-utan' (\\"by the outside\\").<br /><br />Chapter Six looks at the need for order in languages and contains lots of interesting information on the intricate [[ASIN:0415412668 Semitic]] verbal system. In essence, the effects of erosion interact with the mind's craving for order. There is thus a constant search for regular patterns and spontaneous analogical innovations arise. This is based on erosion + expressiveness and erosion + analogy.<br /><br />The final chapter brings it all together and includes detailed discussions of the common sources out of which possessives, quantifiers, plural markers & articles may develop, the various interactions of verbs & nouns, and the nuances of action like tenses (past, present, future, continues & completed), and modality (should, ought, etc.). Adverbs and subordinate clauses are also discussed.<br /><br />In the Epilogue, Deutscher revisits the mind's desire for order and the fact that innovation is based on a principle of recycling. He also discusses the movement towards simplification in the word structure of the Indo-European languages over thousands of years in terms of cyclical & linear time. Proto Indo-European had eight cases for nouns in the singular, dual & plural while the modern daughter languages have few left and there is a marked decline in the fusion of words.<br /><br />This highly entertaining read is accessible to the non-linguist and explains many fascinating features of language and its structure. There are five appendices, copious notes, a bibliography and glossary of terms. The book concludes with an index. The text is enhanced by figures, illustrations and photographs, including an aerial view of the ruins of & an artist's impression of Hattusa in its heyday plus portraits of the Brothers Grimm and [[ASIN:0521025265 Sir William Jones]] who discovered the relationship of Sanskrit to Greek & Latin.<br /><br />Appendix A provides more info on the flipping of word categories with reference to the word `go' which functions both as a verb and an auxiliary marking the future tense. Appendix B revisits the role of laryngeal consonants in the Semitic languages that changed the vowels I and U in their vicinity into A and the consequences of the phenomenon.<br /><br />The next appendix elaborates on the complicated Semitic verbal templates with reference to how reflexives, intensives, causatives, passives & passive reflexive forms originated. Appendix D looks at how the ambiguity of pronouns as to referent may be solved; for example, by harnessing the emphatic `self' to function as a reflexive.<br /><br />The final appendix, The Turkish Mirror, deals with the convergence of all languages into two opposing word-order camps. [[ASIN:1556190999 Joseph Greenberg]] made this discovery in the 1960s. The word-order arrangement results from the positioning of one particular couple, the verb and the object. The early choice between VO or OV determines whether pre- or postpositions will be employed and ripples throughout the entire structure of a language to determine, amongst others, the possessive construction where the two nouns arrange themselves to correspond with pre- or post-positions.<br /><br />I also recommend [[ASIN:0804728054 On the Origin of Languages]] & [[ASIN:0804718946 A Guide to the World's Languages]] by Merritt Ruhlen, [[ASIN:0060935723 A Language History of the World]] by Nicholas Ostler and the work of that great pioneer of language classification, Professor Joseph Greenberg, especially [[ASIN:3110172844 Language Universals]] & [[ASIN:0804738122 Indo-European and Its Closest Relatives: The Eurasiatic Language Family]]..

B001JRB16U|5.0|Is there really much new to say about this classic Disney film that helped launch the movie career of Julie Andrews? Probably not, but for the handful of people who haven't seen this film, this DVD is a must-buy. Strangely enough, Disney is not releasing a Blu-ray version just yet, so this edition will have to tide over video buffs until that occurs. The 1964 classic is based on the books of P. L. Travers, with a few Disney liberties thrown in. Travers' nanny, Mary Poppins, is somewhat more harsh and unpleasant in the books than in the film version. However, it is obvious that she is hiding a heart of gold inside and that she truly does love the children she takes care. Two of the children did not make the transition from the book, but they are definitely not missed. Julie Andrews is able to bring out the many facets of Mary Poppins without compromising the character, and of course her voice is legendary. The Sherman Brothers whipped up some of their most memorable tunes including  \\"Jolly Holiday,\\" \\"Spoonful of Sugar,\\" and \\"Let's Go Fly a Kite.\\"<br /><br />In a nutshell, the story is about a magical nanny who swoops in to take care of the Banks children, Jane & Michael, and also help their father realize what he is missing by ignoring them the way that he does. Along the way she treats the children to adventures with a street performer/chimney sweep, Bert (Dick Van Dyke) as well as her Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) who loves to laugh. One of the most memorable and touching sequences is the \\"Feed the Birds\\" numbers, with veteran actress Jane Darwell making her final screen appearance. One of Walt Disney's favorite songs, it is sure to bring a tear to many eyes.<br /><br />For those that have [[ASIN:B0002VEPRQ Mary Poppins (40th Anniversary Edition)]], here's what's missing on this edition:<br /><br />* Deconstruction of a Scene: Jolly Holiday & Step in Time sequences are examined thoroughly.<br /><br />* \\"I Love to Laugh\\" Game (not a big deal for me!)<br /><br />Here are the extras that ARE included:<br /><br />Backstage Disney<br /><br />* Disney on Broadway (All New to DVD)<br /><br />- \\"Mary Poppins from Page to Stage\\": The story of Mary Poppins from book to Broadway as the creative team and cast prepare to take the long running show on tour. A very well-done documentary on the stage production of \\"Mary Poppins,\\" detailing almost every aspect of the production that began in London. Especially interesting is how P.L. Travers did not want any \\"Americans\\" involved in the stage production, as she was truly not happy with what Disney did with her books. This feature takes you all over the globe: interviews with the 2 leads are held in NYC at Sardi's restaurant; an interview with one of the Sherman Brothers is filmed in Beverly Hills; interviews with the stage productions composers George Stiles & Anthony Drewe are held in England (they did a fantastic job of blending their compositions seamlessly with the Sherman Brothers' songs from the film). You'll also hear from Bob Crowley, the scenic and costume designer, detailing how he came up with the sets (inspired by the book's illustrations) and changes he made for the touring production. All in all, a very fascinating extra!<br /><br />- \\"Step in Time\\": The Broadway cast of Mary Poppins performs the number \\"Step in Time\\" from the show. This is a nice glimpse into the stage production. Although it doesn't quite have the pizzazz of the filmed number (what a tough act to follow), the choreography, sets, and costumes work together to create a fantastic production. Especially effective is the use of costumes and make-up to create the illusion of the chimney sweeps are in black and white, making Mary Poppins in her red dress stand out even more.<br /><br />- Step in Time - Downloadable MP3 featuring the Broadway cast of Mary Poppins singing \\"Step in Time,\\" featuring Ashley Brown as Mary Poppins and Gavin Lee as Bert.<br /><br />- Video Intro By Scenic & Costume Designer, Bob Crowley<br /><br />-Bob Crowley's Design Galleries: Concept art, costume designs, set designs and set models for the Broadway musical<br /><br />* Audio Commentary: with stars Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Karen Dotrice and songwriter Richard Sherman. There are a few archival comments included from Walt Disney and others. Fantastic track that really adds to the enjoyment of the film. Especially interesting is the \\"Feed the Birds\\" number, where Sherman talks about Mary Poppins instilling social responsibility into the children by planting the idea of feeding the birds with tuppence, thus setting off the important string of events at the end of the film. It is refreshing to hear that so many years later, both Andrews & Van Dyke (as well as Dotrice) still have a fondness for this film and the experience of making it.<br /><br />* Poppins Pop-Up Fun Facts: View fun-filled facts about the creation of the movie during viewing. Mirrors some of the information from the commentary track, but still enjoyable to learn some of the behind-the-scenes info as you are watching the movie.<br /><br />* \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious: The Making of Mary Poppins\\": The definitive behind-the- scenes look at how this unique and beloved film came into being.<br /><br />* Movie Magic: A look at the special effect techniques used to bring the magical world of Mary Poppins to life. This one is interesting, but appears to be geared more towards the young ones and early teens. Doesn't really go very deep.<br /><br />* The Gala World Premiere: Footage from the Red Carpet. What a feast this is; a few different rolls of film (mixing bw and color) have been edited together to recreate as much as possible of this magical evening. See Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Wynn, Cesar Romero, and so many more classic stars. Even Walt & his wife are on hand (it even appears that Walt is gently chastising the costumed Mickey character at one point).<br /><br />* Dick Van Dyke Make-Up Test for his role of the elder Mr. Dawes. On the commentary track, Karen Dotrice (Jane Banks) admits that during filming, she was not told that Dick Van Dyke was playing the elder Mr. Dawes. She thought it was just some old smelly man who was close to death!<br /><br />* Trailers, Ads and More from the Original Release and Reissue of the Film<br /><br />* Mary Poppins Still Art Galleries<br /><br />Music & More<br /><br />* Disney's Song Selection: Sing along to \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\" and any of the film's other memorable songs as the lyrics pop up on screen. Each song can be selected separately or while watching the film.<br /><br />* Magical Musical Reunion: Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke and songwriter Richard Sherman reminisce about making Mary Poppins and the music that makes it so special.<br /><br />* A Musical Journey with Richard Sherman: A delightful magical journey through some of the film's locations with co-composer Richard Sherman, who reveals surprising secrets about the music of Mary Poppins along the way.<br /><br />* Bonus Short: \\"The Cat That Looked at a King\\": Live action and animation based on a chapter from P.L.

0345457692|4.0|Richard K. Morgan tells a great story full of new ideas that are well developed in Altered Carbon.  The societal laws and political descriptions help carry the unique technical ideas.  The story is a page turner with lots of action and suspense.  It gets a bit graphic with sex and violence; I would place it as a solid R rating if it had been a movie.  I am buying the next to books in the series tomorrow.
6305841861|4.0|This is actually one of my top 10 favourite horror movies of all time.<br />My top 10 horror movies are movies or even movie sequels i have selected which i consider to be better then the original's, evil dead 2 : dead by dawn is one of them. Not only is it better then the original 1981 film, but it uses a bigger budget more technology and special effects.<br /><br />1987's Evil dead 2: dead by dawn in my opinion is a remake/sequel, remake because it starts off by ash and linda driving up to the cabin. QUESTION \\"Where are the college freinds from part 1?\\" anyway linda gets killed off a second time and the sequel then starts when ash is thrown in the air by the forces of the forest. Displayed after that is a good continuation of a movie i have ever seen! (TIP: i normally watch evil dead part 1 - then go straight to the scene where ash is thrown around in the air, in evil dead part 2, and there you have an even greater evil dead movie experience, it avoids the confusion the begining of part 2 had when you dont see the college students. I don't want to give to much away with the story, but expect to be entertained in a surreal kind of way. This movie also has a tendency to make you laugh and blood and gore fans wont be dissapointed.<br /><br />I can't understand why they are making or have already made the remake to evil dead which will be out this year. Remakes tend to give viewer's a diiferent frame of mind towards the series. And remember there is only one \\"ash j. williams\\" who was played well by bruce campbell. \\"Groovy!......\\"
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|\\"3 and a half stars, are you kidding me?\\"    I know that's what's going through your mind, and probably rightfully so.  I mean, this movie has been lauded as one of the greatest of the decade.  And truthfully speaking, it is a good movie; better than some others I've been forced to endure.  But it's not \\"great\\".  That's what this review will tell you - why I say the movie isn't \\"Great\\".    Background - I did watch, and quite enjoyed, Batman Begins.  If you haven't seen that movie, you don't need to in order to understand the events of Dark Knight, though some experiences are made better if you did (such as the relationship between Wayne and Rachel).  But what Batman Begins did right is the backstory; how Batman got his training and expertise, as well as his morality and sense of justice.  Also, his basic understanding of the criminal mind is briefly explained here, and his development of the various tools of the trade that he now uses to dole out the justice.  Because of that, it's a good idea to watch Batman Begins first, even if not required, because it sets the stage nicely.  A friend of mine who is a DC comics fan couldn't stand Batman Begins, because, as he put it, \\"Batman isn't supposed to be that serious\\".  Maybe not from the comic book world, but the comic book world is designed to be lighthearted so it can be catered to kids.  When you translate that across to a more mature audience, you need to make the character that much more mature.  This is important, because the same methodology applies to Dark Knight, if not more so.    Without spoiling anything, the whole deal behind Dark Knight is that Batman encounters a character who is his exact polar opposite: He's serious, yet treats things such as killing very lightly.  He has no code, no morals, no ethics...only a means to an end.  This is expressed throughout the movie, as the Joker goes to any length to get what he wants.  During the movie this is believed to be a simple crime, but it eventually turns outto be a total twist - proving a point to Batman and in the doing, making Batman violate some of his moral code in order to stop him.  All of this is done very well; in fact, it's clear that the very happy-happy ending of Batman Begins was not appealing to someone in the writer's office, because this one never gets happy-happy.  Some of it is downright depressing, which I suppose is the intent of the movie.    What the movie does right: Christian Bale does a good job of playing Bruce Wayne and Batman respectively.  Bruce Wayne is not involved in this movie nearly as much as the first one and in fact, feels like an afterthought.  There's a lot more focus on Batman this time around, which is as it should be.  Heath Ledger, who I doubt you've not heard about, plays the Joker extremely well.  What some people claim is an inaccurate portrayal, again, is simply a rendition of the comic book character changed to a more mature setting, and it comes across well.  Joker knows exactly what he's doing, but just does not feel remorse for any of it.  He doesn't stick himself into a funnel with some moral code; he does what needs to be done, and understands that in order to stop him, everyone, even the most ethical, would do the same thing when pushed to that limit.  Aaron Eckhart, who some might recognize from \\"The Core\\", enters into the story as Harvey Dent, a prosecutor who relies on chance (evident by Dent's frequent flipping of a two-headed coin) to get through his profession.  All of the other actors play their parts decently well, but Ledger stands out above the rest, followed shortly by (in my opinion) Bale, and then Eckhart.  I know Christopher Nolan would have you believe that Eckhart is the shining star, but his performance was marred by a part that effectively was not done properly (more on that in the next section).    What the movie does WRONG: It's all subjective, but there was quite a bit I didn't care for.  First, Batman Begins did a great job at telling a story that was easy to follow along with.  Dark Knight attempted to continue this story by introducing a darker side of Gotham, but in the process did way too much in too short a time.  I don't like when movies attempt to rush what they're doing, or throw too much into the 2 hour slot, and that's exactly what Dark Knight did.  In effect, it was two different movies overlapping one another.      First, there was the Joker storyline - the center of the movie.  This was done well for the most part.  Then, you had the Two-Face substory, which they treated as an offshoot of the Joker storyline.  In the end it seemed like a good idea, but was horribly implemented - the Two-Face substory should have been a separate movie altogether, because that's how intricate the real story between Wayne and Dent really is.  They had significantly more history than Wayne and Joker.  It ended up being about 20 minutes total of Two-Face action, which I found unacceptable, seeing the reason Two-Face even came into existence according to the movie.  The ending wasn't too great either.    My next complaint had to do with Scarecrow, played again by Cillian Murphy.  There was some association with Joker which was never fully explained, but what really bothered me was the fact that it felt like he was just thrown in without any rhyme or reason.  First it seems like he's trying to help Batman, then it seems like he's trying to help Joker.  On top of all of this it's never explained how he got out of Arkham Asylum in the first place.  Then he's just dismissed without a second glance.  Made no sense to have him in the movie.    Finally, there were a lot of things going on that also were not fully explained or justified.  I can't say anything without spoiling, but suffice it to say, some characters died who didn't really die, some characters got arrested who weren't really arrested, some people get shot but not hurt, some people got stabbed but not hurt, some people just disappeared without a trace.  At theend of the day, some of the things just didn't make any sense.  Like I said, it felt like they were trying to do too much at once instead of just breaking this apart into two movies - which I can tell they could have done and ended up with two pretty good movies instead of one good one.    I still recommend the movie; but it's not for everyone.  Those who were fans of the more story driven Batman Begins might be a little disappointed.  Action and CGI junkies will fall over themselves on this movie; there's a lot going on at almost all times.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|After I fell in love with 2004's Funeral, I snagged this album as soon as it was released. Initially I was bored and very disappointed, so I ignored it for awhile. Eventually I picked it up again, gave it another chance, and now it's one of my favorite albums; I guess it's an acquired taste? I believe Antichrist Television Blues, in particular, is about Jessica Simpson's father, although it could apply to many others in this age. Other good tracks: Neon Bible, The Well and the Lighthouse.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This film is touching, beautiful and original. Please watch this lovely movie about a robot who just wanted to loved. It really is an amazing movie.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|I'm a fan of Gladwell's work, but this book did not grab me with the same intellectual hook as his prior two efforts.  The concept that it is a surprise that \\"self-made\\" people are a product of their times and the opportunities that were available to them is a bit silly.  Yes, Bill Gates had access to a powerful computer when he was 13, and yes, others mentioned are a product of their times and family background. Just doesn't seem that shocking to me.  The most interesting point the book made for me was one of birth timing and its impact on success in sports (and other things where a cutoff occurs).     Overall some good points and a quick and enjoyable read, but slightly disappointing if you're expecting something on the same level as prior books.
0316067601|5.0|I have always been a fan of our military, our soldiers, our intelligence and our President George W Bush.  But after reading Marcus's book, I am an absolute devotee of the US Navy SEALs. It instills an education as to the training and the dedication these men have to serve and protect our country, our freedoms and our future.  Any liberal idiot who thinks that we have no reason to protect ourselves , especially against afghanie and pakastani and Syrian and Iraqi muslim radicalism , needs to read this book over and over and over again.  George W Bush is a man , a fighter , a protector and will be seen as a much better President of the United States than the liberal media has awarded him in the present.  I am proud and grateful that he was our leader, and to these men, I thank you for my life, my family's life and our future.  Your fight is not in vain. Please know that. Thank you Marcus.
B001FSDOZO|2.0|Simply put, I don't like this album..  Unfortunately the band peaked with their last album and Dark Horse is more of the same..  You can hear elements of \\"Photograph\\" in many of the songs on this CD.. It's obvious the record company has, like many before, pushed this band into producing mainstream rifts and what sells records over producing the band's native sound.  Alot of folks seem to like this album based on the reviews and that's good however I just can't see it..    I think the band has peaked with their last album and this one has more mainstream, over-produced tracks than the last one..  It happens to almost every band eventually and is due primarily to the record companies who push the artist to produce more content which causes the content to suffer in quality. Nickelback is no exception.  They would do themselves a great deed to find another record company ASAP, or form their own company and sell tracks online.   As a huge Nickelback fan, I'm very disappointed in this CD and wish I hadn't paid full price for it.
B0012GMYRS|5.0|This is a brilliant album.  I never though about Celine before.  Now I want to learn French.
B001CDLATE|5.0|\\"Baraka\\" was the first disk I put in my new Samsung Blu-ray player.  I didn't know what to expect, but I was rivited to my seat by the stunningly clear images.  I thought I was at a theater instead of my living room!  When I viewed the complete \\"Making Of\\" extra material I found out one reason: \\"Baraka\\" was made from a 65mm print and digitally restored. I have since viewed it a few more times, always seeing something different in this spiritually moving documentary.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to see the full range of the Blu-ray disk's capabilities.
B0002MG9SI|5.0|This movie is just fantastic. But I have a problem with this DVD. To change SUBTITLES you absolutly have to go to the menu, you can't change them on the go with the remote. But the biggest problem I have is that I can't remove the SUBTITLES at all. I speak french so I don't need to have them on my screen. Has someone figure out how to remove them...I watched it on a XBOX 360.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a must watch movie. Video quality is good on this release unlike the poor Blu-RAY version (kinda weird). And audio is fabulous, specialy with it's fantastic soundtrack.
0375836675|5.0|Having already read Markus Zusak's book, \\"The Book Thief\\", I knew what to expect of \\"I Am The Messenger\\". An outstanding and ingenious piece of work.    In \\"I Am The Messenger\\", Zusak takes what the general public sees as a loser and throws him into a world that forces him to become more. Not long after Ed Kennedy stops a bank robbery, playing cards with addresses and names on them begin appearing in the mail. The sender is unknown, but the purpose is clear: to help. With each task Ed not only helps those in need, but helps himself reach his full potential. The story is humorous, suspenseful, and kind-hearted throughout. Zusak's style of writing adds a rawness and realness to the novel.    Overall, \\"I Am The Messenger\\" leaves the reader motivated and encouraged. It proves that if someone like Ed Kennedy can stand up and take control of his life, then maybe everyone can. Maybe everyone can live beyond what is expected of them.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Miami forensics analyst and moonlighting serial killer Dexter Morgan survived in part through the first two seasons of Showtime's groundbreaking drama by mastering mimicry.  In order to avoid suspicion as the \\"quiet loner\\", Dexter pretended to be an Average Joe and forced himself to maintain a girlfriend, take an interest in the lives of his co-workers and join a bowling league.  His fans have known, however, he'd rather be home researching his next project.    That aspect of Dexter's life changes in Season Three of television`s greatest drama.  In addition to deepening feelings for Rita and circumstances that lead him to thoughts of being a husband to her and a father to her children, Dexter develops his first true friendship with Assistant District Attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits in the kind of role he was born to play).  Through their connections to a case, Dexter and Miguel slowly begin to see the darkness common in each other, leading Dexter to thoughts of adding a sidekick for his Dark Avenger alter ego.      Fans of the sociopath on display in the early episodes of the series may find faults with the humanizing of Dexter in Season Three.  Topics can arise in discussions about the show as to whether the sociopath Dexter is slowly being cured (something that is supposed to be impossible) or whether he has never truly been a sociopath at all, just someone who thinks he is and thus behaves as such.    Season Three is a worthy addition to the Dexter library, a series that explores new aspects of his personality, while remembering to address the core concerns of his relationship with his sister, his memories of his father and his nocturnal practice of cleaning up the streets of Miami.  With the new truths of Dexter reveled in Season Three, you may start to question whether Dexter targets criminals because of the Code and because they are easy prey or whether Dexter does indeed have feelings and believes he is bringing justice and order to the world with his noble deeds.
0385338724|5.0|Kudos to Sophie Kinsella for taking a soap-operatic topic like memory loss and turning it into a fully non-cliched book!  Not only that, she takes the usually flat genre of chick-lit and brings in a massive dose of suspense, leaving the reader positively on their toes trying to find out what happens next.  While many chick-lit books may have interesting plots and plot twists, none of them really brings in an element of mystery, from what I've read so far, at least.  It was slightly difficult, although necessary to the plot, to read about the snobbery of life as a high-upper, but again, that was the entire point of the book, to make the reader feel as uncomfortable as Lexi must have been.  The ending was great--I'm sure everyone expected, particularly by the misleading summary on the book cover, Lexi to regain her memory.  Kinsella brings her memory back, but only a flash, and the subject of the tiny flash is what makes it so poignant.  The novel would have been destroyed had Kinsella brought her entire memory back, it would nullify the point of the whole book--Lexi finding herself.  The most notable aspect of the book to me was the abundance of amazing references that, for once, I actually understood.  I think this contained the most amazing HP reference ever, as well as good ones to The West Wing, Coldplay, and 'Bad Day' (it really truly WAS the song everyone was singing back then!)<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
B000EWBKKI|1.0|I purchased this Blu-ray recently and found it to be a waste of money.  YES, TERMINATOR 2 is unspeakably awesome; YES, TERMINATOR 2 on Blu-ray is a good thing...BUT NOT THIS VERSION.    For one, it's THEATRICAL CUT ONLY!    Second, this version is EXTREMELY BARE BONES: it's just the movie and 2 commentary tracks (one from 1993, the other from 2003) and THAT'S IT.  For a movie with so much technical precision and BTS material found on previous releases, this is a GRIEVOUS oversight.    Third (and final), the transfer is TERRIBLE.  The original film is a bit grainy to begin with, but in previous VHS and DVD transfers it was never enough to be distracting.  Here, in 1080 resolution, the grain is so bothersome that it strikes me more as digital noise--even STATIC at worst--than actual celluloid texture.  I get the feeling they went through the HD transfer process as fast as possible to cash in on the HD market.  It looks little better than what the old DVD version would on upconvert.    Interestingly, I recently bought THE ROAD WARRIOR on Blu-ray and noticed the difference.  Both ROAD WARRIOR and TERMINATOR 2 have roughly the same amount of grain in their image (and the VHS and DVD transfers were comparable), but the Blu-ray transfer of THE ROAD WARRIOR is GLORIOUS, and the grain actually accentuates the image (worth every penny); logically, the TERMINATOR 2 image should be on par at LEAST, but instead it underperforms.    So don't buy this Blu-ray release of it yet, because if history is any teacher, TERMINATOR 2 is going to receive the same double and triple-dipping treatment it did on DVD, and the next release is likely to have a better transfer and bonus features...the same thing already happened with THE FIFTH ELEMENT.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|K, so I've heard many a Slipknot song and album over the years as most of my friends like them. But I never liked them enough to own any. Well, I heard Sulfer on the radio and really liked it so I snagged this Special Edition disk. Boy was I impressed!!! One of the greatest Metal CDs released this year. A couple of spots of rabid, directionless metal, but over all a well focused and implimented CD. If only all their stuff could be this great.    Keep in mind I am not an old fan, so hardcore fans of the band can ignore my review. But to anyone who loves Metal but don't really know of or care for Slipknot, this is a great CD to add to anyone's collection.
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|i saw this when it first came out in theaters. i loved the fact that they picked up from where CASINO ROYALE ended. in my opinion it's about f**king time we got to see how James Bond a British Secret Service rookie gets his revenge on those who double crossed him and also the fact that M still doesn't trust him yet. i can't wait to see the next James Bond movie. maybe John Cleese will return as Q the 2nd. (Desmond Lewellen was the only Q before he passed away). i would love to see how Q branch got started and the origin of how Q always got pissed off at Bond. should be rated R though because it deals with vengeance and extortion.

B001ILHY2C|3.0|What is modern filmmakers' penchant for bleached-out sepia-tinted color that looks like moldy black and white?  It does not seduce me.  To be frank, it looks just plain ugly.  I suppose, in the case of this movie, it signifies the ugliness of the future that awaits us.<br /><br />Despite its ugly-duckling appearance, \\"Death Race\\" is a serviceable action flick starring the charismatic and appealingly imperturbable Jason Statham (of \\"The Bank Job\\" fame).  Short on plot, \\"Death Race\\" is long on action, the explosive action of racing between souped-up, armor-plated, rocket-mounted, grotesque-looking vehicles.<br /><br />There's one catch to these races:  They're not about winning, they're about killing the other competitors.  The more racers that are killed, the higher the ratings of the televised matches.  It's an interesting theme, but it seems to lack the necessary acerbic wit to pull it off to complete satisfaction.<br /><br />--Bryan Cassiday, author of \\"Fete of Death\\"
0440236304|5.0|Reading this book led me to read all of the books written by him. His details are so amazing! I tell everyone about these books and tell them to read them. His details about training camp all the way to the Battle of the Bluge are unforgetable! If your looking for an FIRST PERSON account like I do then these books are for you! I felt like i was there when he told about the battle of the bulge. Some of his stories about not taking prisoners or fighting in the snow....I dont believe making a movie and making it super-bloody would even come close to what really happen. If you like to read about FIRST PERSON account in WW II and anyone who fought along side the BAND OF BROTHERS MOVIE SERIES then this is it for you! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED....I PROMISE!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I found the Swivel Sweeper a bit disappointing.  For years, I had been using a similar product (Shark cordless sweeper, Europro cordless sweeper) which I liked very much.  When the battery on the other one died, I decided to try this one. By comparison I find this one seriously lacking.    Price: With a current retail price around $35, the price is excellent. In full disclosure, the product I liked much better was quite a bit higher, but I would still recommend the other one.    Effectiveness: Marginal. This product simply does not pick up everything in one or even multiple passes. I've tried it on both sealed hardwood and ceramic tile. In both cases it picked up most but not all of the dirt and debris, leaving little bits behind here and there. I'm not talking about large or heavy or unusual items here. I mean it picked up some dirt and skipped right over other bits of dirt. It seemed no matter how many times I ran it back and forth in all kinds of directions, I never got a totally clean floor.  While it is picking up some debris, it seems to push or blow other debris out of its path making it next to impossible to get everything.  By comparison the more expensive product has edge cleaning brushes which reach out and grab debris in front of and beside the unit. This one does not have that feature.    Ergonomics and Design: Serious design problems.       1. The dirt cup is very shallow and quite small. It does not hold very much. You will need to dump this frequently to keep the unit working, especially if you are picking up things like pet hair, dust bunnies, the occasional autumn leaf tracked in, etc.       2. The design makes it difficult to remove and dump the dirt cup without spilling it. Picture this. You've got this 6ft or so handle that will readily 'fall' down if you hold the sweeper base w/o supporting the handle. To release the dirt cup you need to use your thumb and forefinger of one hand to pinch the release mechanism on the sweeper base while simultaneously supporting the dirt cup with the other hand; otherwise, the dirt cup will drop to the floor. Because you cannot possibly support the handle while doing so, it will 'fall' clumsily downward.  Now you are still holding the sweeper base by the release mechanism between thumb and forefinger on one hand while the handle dangles awkwardly behind you. In the other hand you have the dirt cup which needs to be emptied. If it is at all full, with dust bunnies and such, a bit of dirt and debris will likely spill over the sides while you are trying to get it to the trash can to dump it.  Then you have to start over.       3. It is equally difficult to put the dirt cup back after dumping it. The dirt cup fits under the bottom. It has to be lined up properly to snap into place, but you cannot see what you are doing under there unless you turn the cleaner and dirt cup upside down - which will likely result in more dust and debris on the floor. You can put the dirt cup back while holding the unit upright and without seeing what you are doing, but it is a bit awkward until you get the hand of it. The cup will only fit in one direction. While holding things upright you cannot see which way it needs to go or how things are lining up. In my opinion, not the best design.  My other unit had a cup that slid in from the side, a much better design.       4. The handle will not stand upright without support. This makes the unit very awkward to work with. You can't just leave the unit standing while you walk away for something, and if you try to lean it agains the wall it will likely slide/fall down.If you buy this, expect to spend a lot of time bending down to pick the handle up off the floor. You will get a great workout.       5. I did not find the sliders to be an asset. My other unit had traditional wheels and worked great. Not only did the sliders not enhance the efficiency of the product, but I was inclined to worry that they might contribute to scratching the hardwood floors bypushing sand, dirt, debris across the floor.       6. Does not work at all well on carpet, not even low pile, indoor/outdoor types. In all fairness the item is not advertised for use on carpet; however, my other unit worked very well on carpet. This one 'sticks' or hangs up on the carpet, and with the easily bendable handle it can be impossible to push across the carpet. Since I have a mix of hardwood, tile, ceramic tile, carpet, and wool rugs, I find it cumbersome to have to use another method for the carpet and rugs.    Summary:  I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend it to anyone unless they just couldn't afford anything else.  If you are looking for a cordless sweeper I would recommend something similar to the Shark Cordless Sweeper. There may well be other brands that work as well or better. The Shark (and Europro) is the only other one I have tried. By comparison, I would definitely recommend the Shark over this product.    Pros: Excellent price. You can afford to try it. Even if you don't like it you haven't lost a lot of money.  Cons: Poor pickup, must be emptied often, awkward to work with, doesn't work on carpet, sliders add little value and are primarily hype.
B00129H7VS|5.0|After waiting many months for this series to come out on Blu-Ray, it came out in time for me to purchase it for my father for Christmas. Needless to say, he spent the next 5 days after Christmas watching straight through all 10 episodes. He confided in me that it was one of the best gifts he had ever received. The gripping plot, excellent sound, amazing picture all added up to a worthwhile gift. Highly recommended to just about any history/action buff.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I bought this for a gift.I read some of the bad reviews,but was hoping id get a good version.Season One was fine,but the Second Season had a few episodes that dont work in 4 different players.Then Season 3 is scratched up.Im in the process of sending this back.
0321544080|5.0|I was very interested in purchasing this book several months ago until I read some of the reviews.  People slammed the book because Joe talked about the expensive equipment he used, which was out of their price range, and he didn't provide much technical detail about the photos.  Therefore, the book was not very helpful.    I've only read the first 32 pages.  However, as I read some of the stories, it clicked to me what Joe was actually trying to convey and I wanted to write about it.    I believe those who gave the book a low rating totally missed the point of this book.  Joe teaches you about photography but not from the technical perspective.    I've read Bryan Peterson, John Shaw and others who provided a lot of technical detail and their books are great.    Joe is explaining photography from a mental perspective.  He is focusing on having us in the proper mindset before we begin shooting.  The \\"story behind the story\\" regarding his photos are the real educational jewels in this book.  It is no coincidence that he doesn't provide aperture or shutter speed or many of the other image properties we're accustomed to seeing.  The lighting equipment and technical details he does provide is more of an afterthought.    He discusses a shoot where he was done taking pictures.  However, he didn't pack up his camera.  At that moment, a photographic opportunity was realized and he captured a great shot.  Something as mundane as not packing your camera until the end was the point of the story.  It wasn't about light or aperture of shutter speed.  This story tells me to always be ready to photograph a moment even when you think your work is done.  Now many people may read this and think, \\"Well, duh!\\"  However, I've packed up my camera many times when I thought I was done to only scramble to pull it out again.      He has reinforced things I already new and gave me new things to consider.  Many similar examples are throughout the book.  When you put all these tips together, during your next shoot you will be better prepared.    Lastly, he has a photograph of a man changing a light bulb on top of the Empire State Building.  When I first skimmed through the book, I thought it was an okay photo.  However, I read the story where he wanted to take a bland subject (changing a light bulb) and make it more dramatic.  After reading the story, I had a greater appreciation of the photo.    This is not your conventional photography book--Lou Jones took a similar and equally effective approach with his book, Travel Photography Off the Charts.  It is a daring approach because photographers, who are supposed to be out-of-the-box thinkers, look for the same thing from different books.  Therefore, I give Joe credit for taking an unconventional yet effective approach towards teaching photography.    If you're looking for a \\"How-To\\" book, this is not for you.  However, if you're confident in your lighting fundamentals and you want to hear some \\"war stories\\" from someone who's been everywhere and done everything, this book will be a good read.  I haven't been to any of his classes or photo shoots so this is the next best thing!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|As a student of history I am aware that movies are often vague representations of the facts.  This series is one of the exceptions.  Obviously, even in a 6 hour mini-series, justice cannot be done to the life nor to the book that the movie is based upon.  I felt that emphases was placed where it should have been.  The romance between Abigail and John; the deep friendship and intense political rivalry between Adams and Jefferson; the family trials and tribulations; and the remarkable coincidence that Adams and Jefferson both died on the same day.  That was not just any day but July 4, 1826 ... the 50th anniversary of our nations birth.  Watching this movie was indeed time well spent.
B000IOBAYI|5.0|The book was in excellent condition for an older book.  Was very pleased with this transaction, thank you.
1400082773|5.0|I finally finished Dreams From My Father last night. And while I confess I rarely leave reviews. I realized this morning how important these reviews are at helping me make decisions to buy a book or not... With that being said, I must whole-heartedly recommend this book. If you are at all interested in the nature and character of our 44th President - it is a must read!<br /><br />I AM AN OBAMA FAN! I fully acknowledge that, but I think this book will even help the skeptics among us. By all indications we have done well America. We have elected a man, not a god certainly, but someone who is willing to be transparent, with real substance and a passion for people based on a very diverse background. All the way through the book that's what I kept thinking. He was the right choice for president.<br /><br />Chicago seemed a real microcosm of the problems the President is now facing in the US. Somehow you gain a since that it was his practice run. The other thing I like about the book is that it takes a lot of the media sound bites we've heard over the past couple of years and puts them in perspective of the life of a real person, struggling to come to terms with identity and self - as we all are - if we are honest about it.<br /><br />The surprising thing for me was that President Obama is also a gifted writer at that. I could hardly put the book down. I am no literary giant but I found it engaging, well paced and easy to read. My only regret is that I did not buy a hardcover copy. Because for me it's definitely a keeper, a book I want to add to my permanent library. So if I had to sum it up I would use words like: inspiring, informative, honest, a journey -that even caused me to do a little soul searching myself...
B001BGTWXI|4.0|I have been slow to warm to Slipknot. I have to admit I bought Iowa when it was released, gave it a listen and then gave it to my younger cousin. However, I liked their last album, Vol.3 The Subliminal Verses, and have since come to really like Stone Sour. Not surprisingly, I like the slower stuff on this album that Corey does, much like on Stone Sour. For my money, \\"Dead Memories\\" is the best song on the album. I also like \\"Til We Die\\", \\"The Child of Burning Time\\" and \\"Sulfur\\".
0385340540|2.0|What a disappointment! Sadly it feels as if Mr Grisham went to Italy on holiday and kept a diary which loosely has the novel based around it. Perhaps he got some kind of tax break but one feels it from about one third into it. The story hangs on some long credulity stretches which feel terribly forced. Not recommended unless you are a Grisham and Italy fan.
0440178002|4.0|I find it very difficult to find books that I really enjoy.  One of the genres I like is the well-researched historical novel about 1700 and before - the earlier the better.  Shogun starts in 1600.  I enjoyed the picture of sailing at that time and the picture of Japan at that time.  Mention of the Spanish Armada, Sir Francis Drake, the Jesuits, ninjas, the development of geishas from the courtesans there, the silk trade, plus many other things allowed me to get some feeling of what it was like living at that time and place.  Of course the characters of Blackthorne, Mariko, and Toranaga were very well drawn, so that now that I have finished the book I find that I miss them. Some events in the book stretched the imagination somewhat, but they did not detract greatly from my enjoyment.  I found the book easy to read, enjoyable, and educational - my 3 criteria for a good book.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you're already a fan of Dr. Horrible, you'll want this. Which is probably why you are here - in which case, you need to know what is on the DVD besides the movie (aside from the subtitles in Wiccan). Commentary: The Musical! is a good reason to buy it, as is the wonderful \\"Making of.\\"  But most importantly, you should buy this DVD to prove that Dr. Horrible and webseries are here to stay!  Also so that you can watch Nathan Fillion OVER AND OVER AND OVER again.  Wups, that was supposed to be in my inside voice....
B000063DFQ|5.0|At this point in there career,after three excellent albums,Iron Maiden began to fully form there sound.  Melding a mixture of punk and progressive with the duel guitar ethic of Judas Priest,Maiden became the third band in Metal's Holy Trinity,following Black Sabbath and Priest.    The band had already progressed quite a bit with the arrival of vocalist Bruce Dickinson on previous milestone,1982's Number of the Beast,but now with Dickinson part of the writing team and a new drummer in the form of Nikko Macbrain,Maiden just got heavier.    Piece of Mind is the culmination of everything that had been great on Maiden's earlier records,working out the kinks to make this one of the ten greatest Metal albums ever.    To review this album proper,we'll review song by song:    Where Eagles Dare-Hell of a way to start the album.  This World War 2 spectacle is an homage to the 1969 action film that the band was a big fan of and is a showcase for the amazing drum skills of Nikko,who creates a machine gun strafe sound that fits the epic sounding chaos.  A classic.    Revelations-Bruce's first fully written song for the band,and  a foretelling of things to come for there next record,Powerslave,is another epic with one of Dickinson's best vocal performances.    Flight of Icarus-One of Maiden's greatest songs,thsi tells the story made famous in mythology.  Terrific riff and another classic vocal performance by dickinson,with alot of emotion that ranks it among the greats.  Note:NOT a favorite of Maiden founder,Steve Harris.    Die With Your Boots On-Awesome,apocalyptic tale of the futility of violence and war is one of the most,underlooked and anthemic of Maiden songs.  A favorite of fans,yet almost always,dropped from the live set.  A terrific riff and chorus highlights this catchy headbang.    The Trooper-Murray and Smith's most recognizeable and iconic riff in one of the greatest metal anthems ever written.  Telling the story of a soldier going into the Charge of the Light Brigade,this masterpiece does the impossible of fitting an epic into just four minutes!  (If only they could do that nowadays....)    Still Life-Underrated metal song,is also the most atmospheric track on the album and one of the creepiest,with interesting sound effects and a bizarre vocal performance by Dickinson.  Made the top 500 greatest metal songs list by Martin Popoff,two years back.    Quest For Fire-Sort of a filler track with Maiden telling the story of cavemen from the (then) recent film,Quest For Fire.  Not bad,but more of the equivalent to this album's Gangland.    Sun and Steel-Good fistpumper,not mentioned too often with a good riff and a short enough length to not add lethargy.    To Tame A Land-Good Maiden track,that takes us down the road to war again with one of the band's better solos and good lyrics(where are the fans of this one?)    The production on this album is the most raw and metallic,the band would ever have(and Harris'bass is actually recorded properly!) combining with good writing and classic riffs to make for one of the great Metal albums of all time,and arguably this band's best all around work.    A must have in ANY Hard Rock and Metal library.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|My husband (who usually avoids any movie I describe as \\"sweet\\") and I rank this as one of our favorite movies.  It's become a new Christmas classic in our house.  Most of the British accents aren't difficult for our American ears to understand, as is often the case.  It's also fun to see how many of the actors we can recognize from other films (there are a lot of people in this film).
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is by far the best movie I have ever seen. Not just the best Batman movie ever, but the best movie ever. I have been a Batman fan since I was old enough to read and I read my first Batman comic. I have been a major comic book geek since and have made it my goal to know everything there is to know about Batman. As a huge fan I was happy to see that this movie stayed as close to the comics as a movie can. The story was great and the action even better. There are a few discrepancies between how Two Face was born between comic mythos and the movie but it still was a great story. The casting is perfect and Christopher Nolan is the best director the Batman franchise has had.   I am not a fan of Heath Ledger but in this movie he out did himself. He was the perfect Joker and It is heart breaking to see him pass. The joker is supposed to be dark and homicidal. Heath Ledger made the Joker I have grown up fearing in comics come to life on the big screen.     Now the Blu-Ray release, this is a must have. The picture and sound quality on the right tv is 100 times better than the theater experience. The sound is incredible and makes you feel like you are in the middle of the action. The Blu-Ray also has special features not found on the DVD version. One of which is the hour long special from the history channel called Batman Tech. It is how Batman's gadgets could really be made with today's tech. It is well worth it to get this movie because of the great Blu-Ray features, and because the movie is worth it a million times over. I recommend this to anyone who loves a great action film. You don't have to be a comic book fan or a Batman fan to enjoy this movie.
B000I0QL82|4.0|I didn't knock off one star because of the blackface number...  but mostly because of the sort of coldness of both Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire...  I turned in late and couldn't figure out what the 15 days were supposed to be--the 15 days a year Jim is willing to work.  We had a bit of a tiff about that, and one of us said that the fifteen days included one day on either side of the major holidays--one day to rehearse, one day to perform, another day to take down those lavish sets.  So that really there were only 5 holidays worth worrying about...  And that for 2 of them. Lincoln's birthday and Valentine's Day, only one day separated them, so that it would be a rehearsal day and a take-down day all at once.  And that would throw the calculations off seriously.  Neither could we figure out if New Years Eve and New Years Day were both holidays in the movie or not.  You know that big calendar they keep showing--the one in which the turkey jumps back and both between the 20th and the 27th of November?<br /><br />How many holidays are there in Holiday Inn?  Christmas, New Years, Lincoln's Birthday, Valentines (\\"Be Careful, It's My Heart), Washington's Birthday (\\"I'd tell you you were ugly, but I cannot tell a lie\\"), Easter Parade, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Christmas again, and New Years Eve.  Somebody said that as the Fourth of July got two songs, \\"Let's Say it with Firecrackers\\" and \\"The Song of Freedom,\\" maybe the latter was really for Memorial Day or some other holiday like Veterans Day.  And what about the \\"Happy Holidays\\" song?  Was that just for Christmas or did Bing and Marjorie Reynolds sing it anytime anybody came to the Inn?<br /><br />I wish there was a true special edition in which the special features included the long lost deleted scenes like when they celebrate Halloween (\\"Spooky\\"), Arbor Day (\\"Green Leaves\\"), April Fools Day (a solo for Marjorie Reynolds perhaps, called \\"Fooled Me Once, Shame on You, Fooled Me Twice, Shame on Me.\\")  And there could be some Jewish holidays in there too (or maybe that's what \\"Happy Holidays\\" is for).  I do like Marjorie Reynolds: what's her story anyhow?  People say she's \\"serviceable\\" but she's much more than that.  She's instantly likeable and her acting is so sincere she puts the boys to shame, like they're just playing with her.  And the one scene where she drives a certain party into the lake is both hilarious and chilling.idays in there too (or maybe that's what \\"Happy Holidays\\" is for).

B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Metallica but was let down by there last album Saint Anger. It was not Metallica and made me wonder what was happening to one of my favorite bands. Death Magnetic has since restored my faith. This album rocks!!! I feel like there are not enough words to describe how great they sounded on this album. I had heard \\"the Day That Never Comes\\" on the radio and at first I was a little let down. But after hearing it a few times it quickly grew on me so when the album came out I made sure to buy it the day it came out, and quickly put it in my car. Death Magnetic only left my car stereo long enough to be moved to my ipod and then right back in. Death Magnetic was played non stop for a month and I still love every minute of it. My wife is not a fan of heavy metal and only likes Enter Sandman by them. But I made her listen to it when we were in the car and she loves it as well. Metallica has gone back to basics and given Long time fans like myself something to be excited about. If they decided to make another album down the road I will wait excitedly because they have found what works and still make music that tops anything else.
B000002U88|5.0|Growing up in the Midwest, one state south of Seger's own, I was blessed to come of age and then enter adulthood during his best period as a rocker.  I was 13 when NIGHT MOVES came out, 15 for STRANGER IN TOWN, 17 for AGAINST THE WIND, a high school graduate for NINE TONIGHT and a college student for THE DISTANCE.<br /><br />I could reach back for LIVE BULLET and \\"Ramblin Gamblin Man\\" and there would be later flashes of greatness with \\"Like a Rock\\" (all those truck commercials couldn't kill that song for me) and \\"Wreck This Heart\\" from his latest album but I was in the perfect era to experience his music during his best years.<br /><br />THE DISTANCE will always be the last great album to me.  Maybe it was because of where I was and how far off the road I went that I couldn't appreciate his later stuff (I wondered why he was singing about Cuban refugees in \\"Miami\\" off of 1986's LIKE A ROCK)...but he nailed the Midwestern experience for us while we were living it in the 70's and early 80's.<br /><br />Thank you, Bob.
B00026WUAU|5.0|I was leafing through Dylan albums and for a lark bought the only album they had that I hadn't heard a song off of. Got in the car, talked my poor Dylan hating passenger into listening, and what do I hear but...gasp, backup singers!  I blushed, she looked at me and laughed. \\"I can't believe you listen to this\\". Well I couldn't either. Skip ahead to New Pony. Wow. To make a long story short, I came to love SL. And I am proud to say it is probably my favorite, only occasionally being outran by Blonde, JWH, or Desire, depending on my state of mind.  Its got everything, rocking guitar riffs and allegorical western sagas.  Detail your old ride, get off Highway 61, and get Street Legal!
B00004TDTO|1.0|I can't understand why JAWS continously pops up on 'Greatest Horror Movie'  lists and critiques...it is NOT great, NOT a horror (more like horrible),  and while it IS a movie, it's just not all that good to me. I guess most people like it because it has a lot of names involved with it. Maybe I'm biased because I am not a swimmer and have never been into water sports, but I just find it extremely boring after the first attack or two. There are far better movies as far as I am concerned...JAWS is one of my least favorite films, never liked it even as a kid.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Pet Sounds Being the number one on just about every critics list and influencing the Beatles(which to me seemed preposterous) was more than enough to make me curious. I bought the album listened to it a couple of times.  And I must admit I skipped around a bit.  It sounded syrupy sweet and invoked all my preconceived notions of what the Beach Boys were.  Years come and go, and I kept hearing Pet Sounds everywhere.  I decided I Had to get this suntanned, huarache wearing monkey off my back.  So I made it a weekeend's goal.  Get to know the \\"great\\" pet sounds, and then bid it adieu.  That didn't happen.  I must have listened to 100 times and I have to admit, Pet Sounds is great.  Don't let the acclaim plug your ears or the accolades sway your mind.  Get past that and revel in \\"The Sound\\".

B00028U6B8|5.0|This is my first JA album, but definitely not the last. Improves with every listen.  As a fan of album oriented rock, I skip the bonus tracks though as they seem to break the cohesive feel of the original, but I almost always do this. The line, \\"either go away or go all the way in\\" pretty much sums it up.  Finally, im a volunteer!
B000W1V5OC|5.0|This dvd/cd set is a first rate production. I'm still perplexed that Nightwish sounds so good live. I think their live versions of many of their songs sound significantly better on this live set than on the studio version. Tarja's voice is stunning. All I can say is WOW!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I first heard Sun Green while riding through Knoxville Tenn. on the fm.  I was hooked and immediately ordered the album.  I was blown away and still am!  I originally thought of the songs as one story, just broken into chapters.  But now I see the songs for what they are.  Great ones that stand on their own.  Devil's Sidewalk's riff is forever branded on my brain, and Leave The Driving's intro is pure simplistic genius!  Carmichael must be kin to Cortez, and Bandit is stripped down confession.  And if you make it through Sun Green and her screaming megaphone (turn it up!) and get a chance to Be the Rain, you're a permanent resident of Greendale.
B001D08SK0|2.0|As others have said - This is an incredible box set, but the method of packaging the DVD and CDs is horrible.  All of my CD's and the DVD are scratched and my Disc 1 won't play track 6 due to the scratches.    I do hope Sony will provide replacement discs.

B001JL2UYI|4.0|Craftsman extraordaniere, perhaps his best work, understated control. I'm not up on all these nuances in sound, CD's MP3's hey we listened to a lot of this stuff on AM Radio. Certainly not Jimi but many others. Maybe my hearing is not as atuned and critical as others. The understated guitar lines of Jimi is so simple with layers of complexity and interplay are truly enjoyable. Listen to Long Hot Summer Night. The band again plays a big role, bass and drums give Jimi the the skill set that allow him to display his abilities. Listen to Gypsy Eyes. So many great songs perhaps one of his greatest is Rainy Day, Dream Away. Love this album. Wish I could've seen him live.
B001M5UDGS|4.0|Yes, I was sceptical. About the commentary musical that sounded like a cool but gimmicky thing, essentially something where the idea is better than the actual result. Most people said the music in the commentary is at least as good or even better. Couldn't really believe that. Fine, so I was wrong. Except for two or three songs that didn't do much for me, most of them are surprisingly good and catchy.    (For simplicities sake I stick with their role names)  Moist gets to sing and Groupie #2 gets a solo (so does #3 in the end). Actually the first surprise of the commentary track. That voice was so good I forgot to finish thinking \\"What? Who cares about groupie #2?\\"    Just as amazing as hearing Felicia Day singing in her own voice. Penny always had a hint of thinness while Felicia herself has a great voice.    The regular commentary and features isn't bad either. It has the usual behind the scenes info. Nothing extraordinary here, but still worth watching.    The DVD itself is where the scepticism should have went. Lucky me seems to have received a pressed DVD and yet I wasn't happy with it until I tried all three drives. After putting it in my PS3 my neighbour starting drilling a hole in some wall at low speed. Wait. I think that sound is coming from.. uhm.. is a DVD supposed to sound like that? Tried the DVD drive/CD burner in my PC with the same result. When the disc is spinning it's causing a very disturbing and loud noise. Not the whining kind of spinning at high speed, but the low and humming kind that makes you wonder if you will have to fiddle out bits and pieces out of the player any moment now. The third drive (DVD burner) finally played it quietly.    Closer look at the disc. While all may other DVDs have a perfectly smooth edge (the silver layer, not the plastic) this one is looking like a mountain ridge. A really jagged one. In fact, it even seems to be slightly bent (more than my comparison DVD). Somewhat disappointing that it makes your average magazine DVD look like high quality and it could explain the annoying sound.    The content easily gets 5 stars and would get more, but there seem to be a lot of minor and not so minor issues with the DVD itself. So maybe one should consider burning a copy of the DVD and using that. Though these days it's more likely someone will rip the image to their media server.    Should you be getting this? Well, obviously not if you don't care about all the extras and just want to see what everybody is talking about. It's out there for free in more places than I can count and it's even perfectly legal on top of it. Get this if you either want to own it, hear the coolest commentary track or simply want to thank/support the extended Whedon bunch.

B001MYIQK4|5.0|The BBC never does anything half-way, and so goes CRANFORD, the story of a mid-19th century British town created by Elizabeth Gaskell and brought to life by screenwriter Heidi Thomas. Already nominated for ten BAFTA awards, eight Emmys, and three Golden Globes, this five episode miniseries is masterfully done in all aspects, including content, design and acting.<br /><br />Taking place over one year -- from the summer of 1842 to the summer of 1843 -- the miniseries chronicles the struggles of one township and its unflagging residents as they battle rumors, financial ruin, educational boundaries, medical plights, and the threat of change brought by an unwelcome railroad line.<br /><br />With a stunning 25 member prime cast, the BBC pulled out all the stops to make this a star-studded affair. They include Dame Judi Dench ([[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale]]), Simon Woods ([[ASIN:B000E1ZBGS Pride & Prejudice]]), Imelda Staunton ([[ASIN:B000OONQ8U Freedom Writers]]), Jim Carter ([[ASIN:B00139XZF4 The Golden Compass]]), Alex Jenkins ([[ASIN:B000NTPDK0 The Queen]]), and Francesca Annis ([[ASIN:B000F7CECK The Libertine]]) ...just to name a few.<br /><br />Funny, compassionate, and often heart-wrenching, Cranford is a town the audience dives into and submerges themselves. We become intimate witnesses to everything, and most of this is accomplished through the eyes of Mary Smith played by Lisa Dillon (whom I gave top billing to rather than Dame Judi Dench). Upon Mary's arrival in Cranford at the very beginning of the first episode we witness the trials, successes and failures of just about everyone within Cranford's fold. Overseeing most of Cranford's wealth is Lady Ludlow (Francesca Annis) who often delivers swift and hard decisions on the town but softens as time goes by. Helping her (and in her employ) is Mr. Carter (Philip Glenister, [[ASIN:B000AARKOO Kingdom of Heaven]]) who helps oversee her business and tries to keep Ms. Ludlow from destroying her wealth. Helping Mr. Carter is Harry (Alex Etel, [[ASIN:B0012IWRDM The Water Horse]]), the child of squatters and battling a life of education versus hard labor.<br /><br />But I would be seriously remiss if I didn't mention the main ladies of Cranford for whom everything encircles. Mainly this is Matty Jenkyns (Dench) and -- initially -- her sister Deborah (Eileen Atkins), whom Mary Smith comes to live with during the first episode. Deborah (Atkins) is the somewhat overbearing but incredibly hospitable sister who fears change more than anything but grudgingly accepts it (this is shown during an early funeral scene when she walks behind the carriage). Matty (Dench) is the more accepting sister who learns that love never really dies, it sometimes just takes a lot longer to blossom (via friendship, old romances, or a simple child).<br /><br />The other two women that I MUST mention are the comedic relief within the series (and the heaviest gossipers), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton) and Mrs. Forrester (Julia McKenzie). These two trouble-making but vitally important characters were the glue that helped hold Cranford together ...and sometimes threatened to tear it apart (for instance, when the new doctor was thought to have been engaged to three different women, much of the blame could be placed on these two women's shoulders for the misunderstanding).<br /><br />There is, of course, much more going on in this series than I would want to write about (mainly for fear of boring you or causing cramps from typing too much ...or both).

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I have seen most of Bill Murray's films and I generally love most of them. With all of those great films, I consider Groundhog Day his best and it is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. Bill Murray is at his greatest in this movie because herein he channels all of his talent into the role of Phil the jaded and bitter weather man from a Pittsburgh tv station.<br />The story is a simple one of redemption and changing the path one's life is on and Murray takes this relatively simple and perhaps predictable plot line and delivers a charming and engaging performance that is never maudlin, never exaggerated and never phony. As the repetition of the day continues, Murray's Phil transforms from frightened non-believer, to scheming opportunist, to crazed suicidal maniac, and finally to a man who finally understands why this bizarre circumstance is happening to him. The movie is never heavy-handed or preachy. It is subtle, introspective, and genuine. This is a perfect vehicle for both the earlier Stripes version of Bill Murray as well as the latter day one that did so well in Lost in Translation. This gem is truly one of those eternal movies that can be watched for generations to come as you do with the really great ones. Like the crazed reality of Phil's situation, Groundhog Day can be experienced over and over and over again and always satisfy.<br />Groundhog Day is a movie that touches your soul as well as your funny bone, and makes you feel alive and inspired. How many movies do that and are this heartwarming and fun?<br />As for special features, I buy dvds because I want to see the movie, not because I want to watch a bunch of interviews, play games with my dvd remote control, or listen to commentaries. If they are there and they are worthwhile, so much the better, but if they are not, I still am glad I own the movie and the lack of special features would never alter my decision to buy a movie. Groundhog Day is worth owning in whatever format you can find it. Just thought I'd throw that out there....t thought I'd throw that out there....

B0000507R0|5.0|The review that talks about the lousy engineering does not belong in a review post for this item.  That person's own comment acknowledges that they were talking about a CD release - back in 1998.  It should not be here regarding the DVD-Audio release of this album.  I have this album in DVD-Audio format and it is stunning - drums, bass, and all.  I highly recommend listening to it on a DVD-Audio capable player, as you will be able to take advantage of the higher resolution material.  However, even on a standard home theatre system - give it a listen in 5.1 or 6.1 Surround - you will be blown away.  This album was a rarity back in the 1970's, as it was of a few that was released in Quadrophonic (Quad) sound.  ELP were just very progressive that way.  They also played their complete set in Quad at their headlining appearance at the 1st. California Jam music festival back in 1976.  This DVD-Audio, listened to on a good surround system, will let you hear the brilliance of the original Quad sound engineering.
B000I0QKDS|5.0|Released in 1968, \\"Truth\\" set the stage for what was to come in Rock music, setting a plethora of musical precedents that many tried to imitate. Following his glory days with the Yardbirds, this was Becks first solo album release.  Jeff's: screaming Les Paul/Marshall, rude guitar playing, tone to die for, innovative use of feedback and effects, as well as melodic lines foretold what British Rock would soon become. However, no other player could create the 'Beckisms' that set his playing apart from the rest of the pack.  \\"Truth\\" features some of the naughtiest guitar licks ever recorded in Rock; the accent is on HEAVY, nothing lightweight about this set. Furthermore, Jeff's Blusy and soulful playing has never been topped. Released later the same year-Led Zeppelin's copycat album \\"Led Zeppelin I\\" only captured a wee bit of Jeff's magic, nice try, but no see-gar.  This musicality and taste cannot be taught nor copied - sheer brilliance! Jeff's guitar tone is just awesome, this is what a good Les Paul plugged into a Marshall Major is capable of sounding like in the right hands.  While still keeping a sense of melody, Jeff's schizo bends, tasteful licks, killer slide guitar, and twisted imagination is showcased here.  \\"Truth\\" has inspired several generations of Rock Guitar players.  What Monet and Van Gogh did for painting, Jeff single-handedly did for Rock  guitar: created something totally new and refreshing that inspired countless thousands of guitarist and bands and forever changed the face of Rock music.<br /><br />This album is the epitome of the London Blues/Rock era of the late 60's.  Featuring a phenomenal and talented supporting cast: Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood, Micky Waller, Jimmy Page, Nicky Hopkins, Keith Moon, and  John Paul Jones, \\"Truth\\" blazed a new path that left most of the other guitar hero's and bands in it's wake. It doesn't get any better than this: Rod Stewart singing his heart out (before he turned into a disco/pop star), the late Micky Waller's inspirational and original drumming (have you ever heard a better shuffle?), and Ronnie Wood's raw bass playing are what British Rock was all about.  This set is incredible; amazingly creative and spontaneous, highlighting the versatile styles and abilities of the musicians. Recorded in just a few days with the primitive recording gear of the time, and mixed in one week; it still amazes. \\"Truth\\" covers: Blues Shuffles, slow Blues, instrumentals, classic songs, Heavy Rock, progressive pop, and even an acoustic Renaissance piece; nevertheless, \\"Truth\\" delivers the goods. Moreover, Heavy Metal was invented during these sessions and Jeff was the 'mad scientist' who created this new genre in Rock.  Back in the day when artistic music ruled the roost, or even today, what more could you ask for in a Rock album? Beck covers all genres with total command, his original and tasteful guitar playing on \\"Truth\\" is legendary,<br /><br />The release of the remastered British version is welcome and long over due. With added tracks and far better audio, it's a must have for fans of Classic Rock or any Rock guitarist who is seeking the \\"Holy Grail\\" of Rock guitar.  This was the 'Shape of Things' (pun intended) in 1968. Even if they did not know it, later generations of guitar players and Rock bands were following Jeff, he drew the blueprint for a new beginning in Rock. Even today, \\"Jeff Beck's Truth\\" is still a valid musical statement and well worth the price of admission.

B00003CX9E|4.0|This review is for the Turner Home Ent version of Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition).  The reason I emphasize that fact, is the reason I recommend it.  As everyone knows, Citizen Kane appears every year near the top of the list of the greatest films ever made.  In my opinion, if that were objectively true, then you could show it to anyone and they would agree, but they don't.  I have shown the film to many friends over the years and most seem puzzled by its status as the greatest.  Why?     In art, there are works that stand alone.  There is no question why they were created.  Alongside these are works that are incomplete although the art dealers and art critics would never admit it.  These works have a hidden secret interpretation.  The best example is minimalism.  To the uninitiated, a solid-colored canvas seems like someone forgot to paint a picture into it, but once the concept of color fields as art is revealed, you may realize that the works connect to that idea.  So then and now, the art question hinges on whether or not an art work that needs THE BIG EXPLANATION in order to connect to the audience is a great or even good work of art.      On the second disk is a fascinating documentary film called, `The Battle Over Citizen Kane.'  It is THE BIG EXPLANATION and I have found that not only do people tend to agree that Citizen Kane deserves is status as The Greatest after they view it, but often they want to see Citizen Kane again to see what they missed.  Since the documentary is somewhat required viewing for \\"the greatest movie ever made,\\" I have a hard time giving Citizen Kane my vote for the greatest, but I recommend anyone to watch the documentary first unless they were there in 1941.
6305428298|4.0|Just rented this from Netflix. You can read many of the other reviews for a plot summary.    Three stars -- \\"it's OK\\", Four Stars -- \\"I like it\\". Well I didn't like *all* of it, so three and a half but round up to four because of a couple of things.    The first is obvious. Jane Horrock's singing was a wonder to behold.    The second is Michael Caine's performance. He has been a favorite of mine for a long time ([[ASIN:B000055ZF8 Alfie]], [[ASIN:B001DOM03C Ipcress File]]) and I am still amazed by his abilities. From comedy (see [[ASIN:B00005PJ6O Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]) to drama (most of his work) to a mix (see [[ASIN:630469864X The Man Who Would Be King]]) he really puts life into a character. In Little Voice he once again does a fine job, but the highlight for me was his rendition of Roy Orbison's \\"[[ASIN:B00005A1CG It's Over]]\\". Although from a technical perspective not  as skillful as Horrock's singing it was equally, or more, effective in expressing his character's emotions. It was this performance that prompted me to go to the trouble of writing this review.    In a review of The Man Who Would Be King, someone said of Caine (and also of Sean Connery) \\"movie stars who are also great actors -- of which there ain't many.\\" (And then there is George Hamilton who, when asked how it felt to be a famous actor, replied in a huff \\"I'm not an actor -- I'm a movie star!\\" But I digress.)    Michael Caine trivia: A quote from IMDB: \\"First of all, I choose the great roles, and if none of these come, I choose the mediocre ones, and if they don't come, I choose the ones that pay the rent.\\" I had a glimpse of this in 1978 on the Johnny Carson show. Caine was on to push his latest movie, [[ASIN:B000067FP4 The Swarm]] (a lousy 3.8 on IMDB's \\"User Rating\\"). When Carson threw Caine a softball question to allow him to start hyping the movie, Caine's response was that no one should bother seeing it; it was a terrible movie and he only did it because he needed the money for a down payment on a house. (I always wondered what Warner Brothers reaction was to this.) Maybe that honesty helps make him a great actor suitable for the great roles. At the least, it shows respect for his fans.
0316017922|3.0|Yes, he did it again.  Finally, Malcolm Gladwell says something that is somewhat valid.  However, his method is as in his prior books, anecdotes, anecdotes and anecdotes.  I haven't seen anything remotely resembling good research and thinking through the proposition and its counterarguments.  It's just steamrolling on with assertions and assertions.  Read the summary and you get the gist of the whole book.  Not worth a purchase.

A hundred stories does not a coherent theory make.

Good for killing time on a beach, but why would I pay for this advice?
0553381695|4.0|In the second volume of this series, four men have declared themselves King of all or part of the Seven Kingdoms and they are all going to war to defend their claims. Meanwhile in the lands to the east, Daenerys Targaryen seeks to use her newly-born dragons as leverage to build up enough power to take back the throne for her dynasty. Another threat comes from the north, where an army is gathering beyond the walls to attack the Kingdoms as the long winter approaches.    The book is better than the A Game of Thrones. The characters and situations have already been established and this book is just able to tell a great story. It does a good job of showing a multi-sided conflict where no side is really evil or totally in the right.The major characters have to face a lot of trials, and a lot of them do not survive. So far, the fantasy elements of the series are minimal, but there seem to be more coming, so future volumes should have something new to them. The main problem is the book is the same as with any series like this. It is not complete in itself and leaves lots hanging, although the storylines are moved along enough to have satisfying progress in this book.

It just keeps going and going and things seem to stay the same until the very end.  It is essentially a single thought played out with almost no variations until the very end.  It was an enjoyable read until maybe one third of the book.  The author probably should've ended it there.  Three stars.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I'm not a great movie review writer, but like everyone out there, I was left satisfied!
B000R4SMCW|5.0|I'm writing this after just watching this movie twice.  It is difficult to figure out parts of it the first time around.  I like for things to be subtle, but I think the director needed a little bit heavier hand in some spots.  (I don't want to spoil it, so I won't go into this).    I rarely, rarely see a film I would recommend and I liked this one.  It's intelligent in its content and really, really well filmed and well directed.  I was afraid it would be too gruesome and I was reluctant to watch it, but it's not.
B00009YOQW|5.0|I purchased this for my nephew for Christmas and he LOVES it! The sound is very nice, not annoying at all.  The only draw back is he likes to chew on the stick, but he has figured out how to play the drum without.  I'm now the best Aunt ever!
B000001ED1|5.0|Joan Osborne delves into different styles which I find very musically  interesting and upbeat. Sure \\"One Of Us\\" had a very fresh sound when it  first hit the radio and became a megahit, but the rest of the album is  simply enthralling.

Then in a shock, the Reader looks into that he never saw.  The writing is heavy in the first section and quick and shocking as the Reader takes off the rose colored glasses.  We are all human and some of us more human than others.

031606792X|4.0|Harry did it. Now Bella does too. The final book of each respective series is the best of the lot.<br /><br />A few reasons exist for this book being the best. First, the book delivers great concepts which mix what we learned in books 1-3, and twists and turns the concepts to make the extraordinary exception to the rule become the focus of the book's peak performance.  Second, the book's finishing rumble is like none other previously delivered, and like Harry, it all comes down to the finale rumble of each respective book (In these rumbles, kids are pitted against the supernatural, where the kids always triumph - despite all odds.).  And lastly, this book is less melodramatic, less cutesy, less . . . schmaltz.<br /><br />The last strength is a creation which deviates from the first three and is something to which the editors and author must have devoted hours of discussion. Bella not only goes beyond the occasional kiss experienced in the first three novels, but has rough and ready sex. And, what happens when teenagers (even those who are really a century old like beloved Edward) have unprotected sex? You guessed it.<br /><br />And, so the book involves 18-year old Bella's first born -- a daughter -- who becomes an anomaly of her own.  Her character is definitely worthy of a new series.  But, after reading over 2400 pages of this series, my declaration to the author and publisher is this: enough already, this older reader cannot go on.  If another book about these characters or concepts arises, I will pass - this is not what I said when finishing Harry.<br /><br />But, Bella has a character worthy of note. In one sentence, Meyer has Bella describe herself in appropriate fashion: \\"It was sort of a pattern in my life - I'd never been strong enough to deal with the things outside my control, to attack the enemies or outrun them.\\" And that self portrait of self bothers me somewhat more than anything else in these novels. Bella's self deprecatory description of herself and obvious lack of self esteem contrasted to her emfatuation for the two men of her life - Edward and Jacob - can be viewed as anything but someone depictive of the 21st century woman. Little girls of America may think she epitomizes the good girl - but not in the world affected and molded by  Gloria Steinem and others. Bella and modern women are not in tune with one another.<br /><br />Now that I have finished, there are a few paradoxes which I must begrudge. First, why does Bella have a better ability to deliver vampires to reconciliation and progress than her multi-century old peers as well as the incredibly knowledgeable and powerful Venturi coven? Why does Bella like (love) Jacob whose IQ hovers around negligible and whose temperament is like a member of the WWF, and simultaneously similarly adore Edward whose is the antithesis of Jacob? Why does level-headed and good samaritan Carlisle not receive all commendation from the vampire world and deliver Obama's message of  \\"Change\\" to the elderly and wise vampires, and in turn make the Venturi leave their mistaken choice of remaining in a static state of impertinence and inconsideration to the majority of the living beings on earth - humans?<br /><br />But, the majority of the remainder is good fun. And, the method of tying Jacob into the clan is cute and clever. Meyer's finale is the best.  This is the one book which I would recommend to all - but note that one cannot read this until they have read at least the first two novels.ontrasted to her emfatuation for the two men of her life - Edward and Jacob - can be viewed as anything but someone depictive of the 21st century woman.

B00158K0S8|5.0|PATTON is simply a great,great motion picture for reasons that have been discussed and written about for nearly 40 years--having purchased all the other video versions,I felt a bit irresponsible placing an order for yet another edition:BLURAY.We ARE duped a little, in that disc 2 is simply the normal DVD from the previous 2-disc set added to the BLURAY package--kinda a ripoff...no,definatly a ripoff. But the BLURAY transfer is stunning, and if you love this film alot, as I do, you will eventually forget how pathetic it is to own 3 or 4 versions and be happy you have it on BLURAY!
B001O6W9QC|5.0|This was a big year for movies. You had your Iron Man's and Dark Knight's but when you just want to sit back with your friends and laugh out loud, this is a great experience. This movie stars a great cast with people such as Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. and they all do their job. I love how the movie gave some background on the characters in the beginning. The story is pretty much how they were trying to bring the book \\"Tropic Thunder\\" to the big screen and trying to do so, they get lost in the jungle and try to survive. The thing was a huge turn on for me, was that this movie was very controversial. The more it gets people pissed off, the happier I get. That's just my personal opinion. Anyways if you're familiar with any of Jack Black's movies then definitely check this on out.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|Move over MARY POPPINS...CHITTY is a marvelously entertaining musical...one of the highlights being the outstanding performance of Dick Van Dyke. Watch it LETTERBOXED or don't watch it at all. The ME OL' BAMBOO segment has got to be one of the greatest musical numbers ever. Van Dyke deserved more recognition for this performance. The rest of the production as well, is stellar. An under-appreciated 60's era musical classic.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie because I love James McAvoy and haven't disappointed with his recent movies. However, I just couldn't do it. The plot was reminiscent of Fight Club and The Matrix. It was like Fight Club because the main character (Wesley) is working at a hum-drum job he hates and is just going through the motions, much like Ed Norton's character in Fight Club. Then this organization wants Wesley to join them and he's \\"set free\\", sort of like Brad Pitt's character did for Ed Norton in Fight Club. There were many scenes that defied the laws of physics to a ridiculous degree and there was no \\"but it's in the Matrix\\" explanation for how these characters could even do these things. I'm all for a good action movie, but give me something somewhat believable. The end left me greatly disappointed. The part where Wesley gets his revenge is great, but then at the very end there's just this big death fest and some information that leaves your eyebrows doing an Irish jig. I really wanted to like this, but I was disappointed and would not want to own it.

WHY are so many people obsessed with filling their wide screen TV's by cropping image area off of composed motion picture frames? Enough! This entices studios to fu&k with presentation when released to home video. The BLACK BARS mean you get the ENTIRE image (i.e, MORE) that the director intended... \\"technology\\" has it's disadvantages
0141439610|5.0|As an English professor who finds excellent vocabulary usage a thing of the past, this book provides the ultimate language high.  The words, strung together like lights on a Christmas tree, give exuberance and thought to a novel that reads exquisitely.  Reading many of the sentences over and over again to give myself the pleasures not often able to be achieved in this time period, I became lost in London, then at Blackwater Park, and everywhere in between.  A true Anglophile and bibliophile's dream.<br /><br />Because the book is written from the various persons involved in the drama, the reader is able to gain insight into each's personality, and oftentimes I found myself a little too sympathetic to characters who I felt may not deserve such recognition.  (Count Fosco, for one...so revolting yet at the same time his enamor of Marian and his obvious detail to the care of his \\"pets\\" gave the reader a sense of humanity in an otherwise disgusting and subhuman man).<br /><br />It took me a long, long time to read this book.  However, I relished it like the final bits of cake... slowly and methodically, savoring every moment.  On the one hand, the ending of the book would provide me with the answers I so emphatically desired, yet that would also determine the finality of the enjoyment of each word and sentence I came to treasure throughout the hours I spent curled in my bed, late into the early hours of the morning, drifting off to the picture of a dark lake surrounded by trees and a boathouse, with the whispering voices of the ghosts of all who live in the book.<br /><br />A tremendous, tremendous joy to read.  All hail Wilkie Collins.
B0000542D2|1.0|I saw the 1982 re-issue of this film at CARNEGIE HALL's cinema in NYC--the sound on that presentation was HORRENDOUS--screechy and tinny--like a bad DRIVE-IN theatre speaker! This DVD is just a shambles too--similar poor dynamic range,flat,compressed,lifeless sound. THE BEATLES sounding like THIS? I'll take other reviewers words regarding chopped-off cropping of the picture as well (I don't own the previous AHDN video editions to do my own A/B comparison). I'm shocked this was allowed to happen on such a high profile project.
B001BIL2H0|5.0|This is the total youth angst album of 1970.  It truly catches the moment.  With Paul Kanter and members of Jefferson Airplane (Grace Slick, Jack Casady, Joey Covington), The Grateful Dead (Jerry Garcia, Bill Kreutzmann, Mickey Hart), Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young (David Crosby, Graham Nash), David Freiberg of Quicksilver Messenger Service and Harvey Brooks of Electric Flag how can you lose.  This is a must have for 60s ~ 70s music collectors.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|Dude, come on, I have spent 20+ years reading excellent Batman stories, then this director and his brother write a mediocre story and the guy playing the Joker overdoses before the film comes out and suddenly it's the greatest filmic achievement in the history of cinema. Please.    This is an okay Batman story, at best. The hubris of the director and his bro writing a new story when there are so many great Batman stories waiting to be filmed is unbelievable.    So far I haven't liked any of the Batman movies except the 1989 one and I was 13. This one is not so special and I suspect the hype is coming from 14 year old girls obsessed with Heath Ledger's lip-licking annoyance of a performance and early demise.    Nobody would be pooping purple Twinkies over this so-so flick if Ledger hadn't croaked out. I mean really. Read Dark Knight Returns or Year One or Long Halloween or Killing Joke or about 1,000 other incredible Batman tales and then get back to me on this one.    If you think this is five star material, you're not that into Batman, and you've got a lot of great reading ahead of you.
B000CNFC76|1.0|So bad I thought for sure that Ron Howard directed it.  If you cut out all of the sickening scenes of \\"eyes staring into eyes,\\" the length of this movie would have been cut in half... a good start to the editing of this gooey, boring, seamingly unending film.  It should have been titled \\"The Longest Film Ever Played.\\"  If only it had had a competent director, it could have been an interesting, worthwhile achievement. It never seizes to amaze me how many people actually like this mush!
031606792X|5.0|I don't understand all the bad reviews.  I thought it was perfect, <sigh>.  Perfect endings.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|Do not believe the reviews that are flattering about this movie. As a Science Fiction fan and a movie fan I still cannot give it more than one star. It is poorly conceived, disjointed, boring, and has those kind of camera shots that flash rapidly because they did not have the money to make decent special effects; so instead they use flashing camera gimmickery such that you cannot even tell what is going on. The writing is worse than the cinematography...all in all it does not get much worse than this. I wasted my money on this film...I hope you will not do the same.
0743298039|2.0|The constant allusions to literary classics is irritating--it's almost as if the author thinks that mentioning these will elevate her work to the status of a classic as well. Not even half way through I felt like giving up. Her meandering, flowery prose becomes obnoxious at a certain point (Why should it take so long to get to some substance!). I gave this book two stars because I feel it's clear that the author can craft a sentence with some eloquence. However, the story is long-winded and over-the-top. The character of Margaret is so bogged down by self-pity that I started to find her annoyingly trite.  As another reviewer noted, most of the characters in this book are one-dimensional. I suppose the grief each one of them feels is supposed to connect us to them, but in many ways it alienates the reader (it becomes such a ubiquitous theme that it suffocates the story). I found myself wishing someone would slap the characters out of their self-absorbed revelries so that I might discover if there was anything in their lives that made them worth living. In the end, it's still not clear to me if there was.
B001IWUZYK|5.0|This version of Oliver is not as dark as the others.  I have watched many different versions of Oliver and this is the one I love the best.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|Tropic Thunder is not for the politically correct and this movie will offend those who are sensitive to jokes about the mentally challenged or handicapped. If this does not bother you then you are going to enjoy Tropic Thunder which is a parody of action movies and the movie industry. If you play along with the premise of the movie, that a Director would be allowed to send Actors in to a real life battle situation, risking their lives then you will enjoy this movie. Tom Cruise, Jack Black, Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey, Ben Stiller and Robert Downey JR. are in top form and there are plenty of laughs. Performances by Robert Downey JR and Tom Cruise are reasons alone for seeing this movie. Both actors are over the top and Cruise is like you've never seen him. The quality of the BluRay transfer is fine as it should be but if you are on a tight DVD budget you don't need to see this move in BluRay,
B000R8YC1I|5.0|I bought this for the kid's and I to watch over the holidays, overall we all enjoyed it, however, my youngest (8 yrs) thought it was a little to scary and went in the other room.  Overall, good lap through memory lane and good addition to my growing movie collection of classics from the late 70's through early 90's.  It's the classic good against evil genre with the creative ingenuity of Jim Henson to boot.  Thumbs up!
B001DPHDCY|4.0|This is a good movie, and a pretty good adaptation of a Seuss classic.  I definitely prefer it to the live-action Grinch of a few years back.  Jim Carrey seems to have restrained himself a bit, which was a definite plus in my book - I could watch this movie without being so aware that Hey, Jim Carrey's doing Horton's voice.      However, the one thing I wish I'd known before receiving this is that the Single-Disc Edition is also a double-sided disc.  I'm not sure why it had to be a double-sided disc, since the movie's not that long.  But double-sided discs are a peeve of mine - they're easier to damage, easier to fingerprint, and no matter what I do, I seem to always get the wrong side down on the first try.
B0001I55SS|4.0|As with the other reviews, the ship takes the cake, however I guess my memory of this movie was better than what I saw recently.  It is a classic disney film with all of the quirks and foibles associated with it.  I got this for the kids over the holidays and watched it with them, they were a little confused at the end but liked it overall.  We had recently watched bedknobs and broomsticks and it has that same overall feel.....it's hard to explain other than to say \\"Classic Disney\\".  I would recommend for anyone looking to round out their movie collection, especially if you thought this was a good flick as a kid (and have some of your own now...).
159562015X|2.0|...there should be a way to purchase additional assessments online without buying another copy of the book.  My wife and I don't need two copies.  Better yet...all of the information from the book could be better organized online for a fee.  In an age where most people are trying to become more \\"green\\", I am surprised that the exclusive online format did not get more consideration from Gallup or the author...    It is also worth pointing out that the book is worthless on the secondary market and there is no use checking this type of book out of the library.

B00168OINK|4.0|Kung Fu Panda is right up there with THE INCREDIBLES and WALL-E for my favorite animated film ever. Not just a hilarious send up of martial arts flicks, nor another opportunity for Jack Black to assert his comic genius, Kung Fu Panda is an awesome piece of story telling that will appeal to adults just as much as its target audience.<br /><br />The animation is beautiful. I've always preferred 3D animation to hand drawn, and this movie is a good example of why. There is no clipping or jaggedness to the animation; each scene is smooth and looks incredible.<br /><br />The story is classic martial arts fare, with a few twists. Po the Panda, against all odds, is chosen to be the fabled Dragon Warrior, despite the fact that he knows nothing about martial arts except what he has read in pulp serials. He is out of shape and untrained, and his only real asset is his unshakable hopefulness and charm. Without getting into too much of a plot summary, the story is good-enough. The real reason to watch this one isn't the plot anyway. The visuals, the humor, and the voice acting are all perfect, and make even an average plot shine.<br /><br />As Po the panda says, there is \\"no charge for awesomness,\\" except maybe the cost of the DVD or Blue Ray.<br /><br />4.5/5 stars. An instant classic animated film. Buy yourself a copy and another one for someone you love.
0446693804|2.0|A Walk to Remember Book Review             By: Carly Tappan      Landon Carter Is a 57 year old man who lives in Beaufort North Carolina. In this book he reflects on his past; his childhood, school, and his first love. Landon is the son of a congressman. His father wants him to be successful and attend a good college, so he wants Landon to run for student body president. Landon wins student body president. He was to attend the school dance, but unfortunately he doesn't have a date. Landon looks around and decides on  Jamie Sullivan, the strange daughter of a minister. Jamie is not like any other girl, she carries a bible with her, and acts strange. They spend more and more time together, since they are both starting in the school play. When Jamie and Landon are, together Landon realizes that  he is becoming a better person, and he is falling in love. Through the twists and turns, Landon stays with Jamie. But Jamie is hiding a big secret from Landon. What is it? Will it turn everything around?      I liked A walk to Remember because I like love stories. This book really had a point to it. Jamie was making Landon a better person. I liked the change that Landon went through. He went from being a big jock, to a loving and caring person. I also like the part when Landon is looking for someone to go to the dance with. He took a chance and asked Jamie. He didn't care what other people thought about him asking her.       There wasn't very much in this book that I didn't like. I don't like how long Jamie waited to tell Landon about her having cancer. She waited to long, and she kind of just led him on. They got closer and closer and then she just dies. But other than that I think the book was great.!
B001KOFH2G|4.0|I watched this movie before seeing the television series Firefly, which despite being a huge sci-fi fan I somehow missed. I expected an average sci-fi epic with less than average visuals. What I got was probably my favorite science fiction film in a number of years. What makes this such an enjoyable film is that it doesn't take itself overly seriously. It has the same sort of unbridled enthusiasm for its subject matter that the original STAR WARS trilogy did back in their day. The plot is good, the acting good to great, and the visuals are remarkable for a film with the budget size of this one.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the crew of the cargo/smuggler ship Serenity and their adventures while protecting a renegade girl psychic and her older brother. Fleeing the totalitarian government known as The Alliance who had been experimenting on River, the crew of the Serenity take on a new level of risk, and are forced to decide between continuing to assist River, or turning her over to the authorities. Intermixed with the main plot are encounters with Reevers, space faring cannibals that terrorize human colonies. Eventually it is revealed that the Reevers, River, and the Alliance's interest in River are interrelated. As River is able to remember more and more of her past and the experiments she was subjected to, the truth emerges and sends the crew of the Serenity to the strangely empty colony world of Miranda which holds the key to the Alliance's undoing.<br /><br />The acting is very well done, beginning with Serenity's captain, a loose-cannon, military veteran named Mal Reynolds, immediately likable in the same sort of way as Han Solo. Played by the TV staple Nathan Fillion (LOST, DR. HORRIBLE'S SING ALONG BLOG), he is a very well crafted character who is at times honorable, others ruthless, and always entertaining.<br /><br />River, the psychic girl, is also very well cast. Played by Summer Glau, a relative unknown at the time (now starring in THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES), she is equal parts coolly efficient assassin, teenager haunted by frightening memories, and world-wise cynic. She is believable as all three, and captivating to watch whether wielding ad-hock weaponry ala Jason Bourne, or throwing out cleverly cryptic insults like the pregnant girl from Juno. There is an animal intensity to the way she plays River that is thrilling to watch.<br /><br />The other major rolls are filled admirably with another interesting performance turned in by the film's main antagonist who goes simply by The Operative. He is clever and intelligent, defying stereotypical enforcers from totalitarian regimes. \\"This is a good death,\\" he tells the man responsible for River's escape as he takes his last few breaths impaled on a sword. \\"There is no shame in this.\\" He is able to convey a sort of moral depth that gives his character a level of gravitas few cinema villains ever achieve.<br /><br />While clich&eacute; is present in the film, it is kept at a minimum through two very interesting methods. The first is the use of Americanized western-style dialogue that is free from the more painful bits of sci-fi jargon. This provides the film with a 'culture' that is distinct as well as entertaining. It's a joy listening to the dialogue, and makes the movie worth watching more than a few times since you pick up on new things you might have missed the first time through. The other thing that helps Serenity stay fresh throughout is the remarkable level of detail in the art direction. The sets in the film are just believable, be they the interior of the ship, the colony worlds where Serenity lands, or the surface of the mysterious world Miranda. There is a grittiness to the ship, the weapons, and even the hand tools that shatters any disbelief.<br /><br />As in just about any film, there are the inevitable plot holes and mistakes. However these are largely irrelevant to the main story which moves along briskly, with the exception of a possibly unnecessary love interest complication for Serenity's captain. While not the most original plot line ever conceived, it is more than adequate to let the best elements of the film shine: interesting, multifaceted characters, terrifically good writing, and beautiful art design.<br /><br />A fantastic sci-fi film well worth owning. 4/5 stars.tain.

0307269752|5.0|I don't do many reviews but I felt compelled to write a review of this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it overall, and give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Interesting to get exposed a bit to swedish culture.<br />* Great characters. Lisbeth Salandar particularly interesting.<br />* Great multi-threaded storylines.<br />* Good blend of mystery and thriller<br />* Exciting ending<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Started slow for me. First chapter or two discusses a corporate corruption story the main character (a reporter) is writing. Didn't grab me right away.<br />* minor nit-picking: The author tended to swap referring to the characters by their first name or their last name. Not a big deal, but there are several character with the last name of Vanger. Henrik Vanger, the rich patriarch of a family that owns a corporation, and his relatives Harriet, Martin, and Cecilia, among others. So a sentence might go like this: \\"Martin and Cecilia discussed it with Vanger\\". That took a little getting used to. Vanger in most cases referred to Henrik, although all three in that sentence had the same last name.<br />* another minor nit: there was a subplot in the book around Lisbeth and an adversarial relationship with another character. It was loosely resolved halfway through the book, but I expected a bit of follow-up at the end. Perhaps it will be dealt with in the sequel.<br /><br />Again, overall, one of my favorite reads this year. Can't wait for the sequel.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner and being amazed I had to read Khaled Hosseini's second novel.  This was even better!  I found it to be a very easy read, easy to follow through the stories of each character.  I am truly emotional during each chapter of this book.  I could not put it down.  I am so grateful that the author has shared his experiences with the reader.  This is a great book for all high school age people for educational and informational purposes.  A MUST READ  Andrea
1416562605|4.0|Indian society and it's contrast between rich and poor is well documented in fiction.  Books such as Midnight's Children and A Fine Balance portray it well.    Adiga refers to the contrast as the darkness and the light.  He outlines the progression from the darkness to respectability of Balram.  Where Adiga differs from others is that he balances humor and tragedy well.    Balram's perspective is both simple and profound.  He tries to be a good man but is not above wickedness as he sees this behaviour from the elite.  He portays the elite in a very clownish way.    I enjoyed the novel and especially enjoyed it's direct approach and humor.  This is a very good first effort by Adiga.      This is definitely more accessible than most Booker fare and some have hypothesized that it won the Booker as a compromise choice.  That may be so but I definitely recommend The White Tiger.

I enjoyed a fair amount of prog-rock in its day (and still do) and will readily concede that a lot of prog-rock wasn't particularly accessible to the broadest audience, nor was that its intention. But \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Fragile\\" were crafted in such a way as to enjoy broad appeal without compromising the integrity of the music.<br /><br />If you listen to the samples you'll probably recognize a couple of the songs. Several of them are also included in live albums like [[ASIN:B006U7SPTK Yessongs]] that offer a 'greatest hits' type of appeal but I'd cast my vote for the clarity and production values of the original album.
B000005Z0G|4.0|2Pac is the best rapper ever. Hands down. No 1 can compare 2 his lyrical talent. I wish he was still alive 2day 2 show people that. Even though he has put out so many awsome records since his death, some people still dont respect him. Like this loser P. Myers who wrote that this album is garbage. U like ZZ Top man! That's garbage! Don't ever disrespect a legend. I can't believe u said that. If u don't like rap, don't review it.  This may not be the best cd 2Pac put out, but nothing he has done has been bad.
B00005O5CM|5.0|this is a great movie. it has a good message too. elle is dumped by her boyfriend because he wants someone better and to try to win him back, she decides to go to law school. she has a hard time fitting in and struggles at first, but she gets the hang of it, proving she is not a dumb blonde. she almost gives up, but she decides to keep going. i love that scene in the court room where she wins the murder case. warren realizes that she is good enough for him, but he is not good enough for her! karma is a pain in the butt, isn't warren?  the acting was great in this film, reese witherspoon was funny in this movie and proves again what a talented actor she is. her character is  likable through out the entire movie and you find yourself rooting for her character. and one of the things i like about this movie is that it helps show you that you can do anything if you believe in yourself.
1401201911|4.0|What if the Krypton starship landed in Soviet territory instead of the US heartland? Superman being brought up with Marxist/communist ideals? The world would certainly be a different place. For the better or the worse?<br /><br />Superman: Red Son attempts to answer these questions in such an adaptation. And a heck of an adaptation it is. Superman is still the virtuous Boy Scout he's always been, but this time he's on Stalin's side. But with such an upbringing, there are plenty of people trying to bring him down. The first people from his own country, then later his confrontation with the West, instigated by none other than Lex Luthor.<br /><br />This graphic nov was quite a treat to read, with grand morals to ponder as the plot thickened. The beginning of the story illustrated the constant power struggles between Party officials in the USSR that Superman eventually had to quell in the name of stability. The tale also encompasses aspects of the Cold War, but instead of a nuclear arms race, a superhero race erupts as Luthor develops an Americanized clone of Superman. Though he is American, the clone is also as moral as Superman and sacrifices himself when a nuclear warhead threatens innocent civilians.<br /><br />The story progresses with an array of familiar characters that live in an unfamiliar world. Lois Lane is married to Lex Luthor, despite brief tensions with Superman. Batman leads an anarchist's campaign against Superman, but fails to destroy the man of steel. Eventually Luthor and Brainiac join forces to shrink the Soviet capital, but actually minimize Stalingrad instead. Superman captures both Brainiac and Stalingrad, but is unable to restore the city to its former size. Thus it is kept in a glass jar until he can figure out a way to save the miniature city. This becomes Superman's greatest failure as a man who strives for perfection.<br /><br />Still, the world seems to fall under his command quite quickly. Instead of an American economic victory over the Soviet Union that led to communist collapse, it is the US that can no longer hold states in the Union. The world prospers under a communist rule that only Superman can lead properly. But Luthor, with his mass of capital and pure genius, takes over the US presidency and raises the American economy out of poverty. Eventually he provokes Superman into a third world war of which Superman is humbled by a few simple words, \\"Why don't you just put the whole WORLD in a BOTTLE, Superman?\\" This leads the Super Commissar to call off the invasion of the United States, which triggers a nuclear fail safe in Brainiac's ship. Superman sacrifices himself to destroy this ship and the world is left in the hands of Luthor. Eventually the entirety of mankind is transformed into beings just like Superman when the sun inflates red billions of years into the future. In fact, it turns out that Superman is the descendant of Lex Luthor. His family sends Superman not only through space but also through time to escape the dying world.<br /><br />Recapping on the story, it portrays a great deal of perfectionist attitudes that never live up to the standards, much instigated by communist nations. These strives for perfection on a national scale brought only oppression to the world. It shows that chaos is not something to be perfected. Greed and envy will always exist, and no Soviet deity could stop such things. If he wanted end suffering, Superman would need to imprison the entire world into a glass jar, like that of Stalingrad. And even though war and defeat have littered the comrade of steel, Superman is still a descent being, willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of others. Sort of shows that no matter how wrong one may be there is always room for amending and healing a world gone mad. But oppression and violent persuasion is never the answer.nist collapse, it is the US that can no longer hold states in the Union.

1878424505|1.0|I was initially interested in this book for the personal growth factor and knew there would be some spiritism that doesn't agree with my beliefs, I was able to \\"chew the meat and spit out the bones\\" for some of it but there was a lot language that I felt wasn't necessary that was against my own beliefs.  I think the points could have been made and gotten across without some of the offensive language, such as  the generalism of how people are brought up and taught.  I disagreed with much of what was said.<br /><br />The \\"Four Agreements\\" itself were good and true and could see how they would only benefit anyone, but there really were no instructions on practicing them.  It is as if someone were to tell a depressed person to stop being a depressed or an overweight person to stop eating so much.<br /><br />We all probably know not to take things personally, but how do you go about doing this?  This (#2) is my biggest challenge in life, and although I also had the workbook to refer to, it was riddled with spiritism and toltec language that I don't want to implement in my life or my beliefs.<br /><br />Fortunately I borrowed this book so no monetary loss was experienced.
B001HAQB9G|5.0|[[ASIN:B001HAQB9G The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science]]<br />\\"The Brain That Changes Itself\\" by Norman Doidge<br />This book is a rare combination of art and science. It gives a tremendous intellectual pleasure and inspires the reader by dramatic examples of human spirit. It is introduced at the Amazon site by a short story of a patient who lost her vestibular function. The example may leave an impression that the book is a collection of patient stories. It is far more than that.<br />First, it introduces the reader to the new paradigm of brain plasticity.<br />It is very clearly described. No special knowledge required. The concept is important to be familiarized with because it has a global significance for understanding human nature.<br />Second, besides the intellectual beauty the theory of brain plasticity has strong practical implications. Using very vivid examples, author illustrates how knowledge of brain plasticity facilitates learning, helps injured people to recover. He explains why actively learning people stay young and why older people have more trouble adjusting to new cultural surroundings.<br />Several more interesting examples:  Distress or depression can trigger a  temporary plastic change in the brain associated with decrease in ability for long term memory.  Rewiring the brain helps to survive pain and turns suffering into pleasure in some acute cases. Rethinking life and mental exercise may help to correct serious psychological illness.<br />Finally and maybe most important of all, this book brings many uplifting examples of human spirit. If you are interested how people find energy to fight a dreadful disease or how they break the existing powerful paradigm sometimes raising against entire society this is a book you will definitely enjoy.
B001L63O1E|5.0|Classicrockitis is the condition some classic rock albums get when a good percentage of that album has hit singles are classic rock radio staples. Casual fans might feel like they have heard Yours is No Disgrace or All Good People or Starship Trooper enough for one lifetime. Anyone who bought a greatest hits package at any point probably has at least half of the album already, so why bother buying it again for just a few extra songs? Plenty of albums, from Pink Floyd's The Wall to Billy Joel's The Stranger to damn near any Beatles' album, suffers from classicrockitis.    And that's a shame, because much like those albums, The Yes Album is a joyous thing to listen to in its entirety (OK, the Wall might not be joyous, per se, leave me alone). It's trippy, it's proggy, and it's great.

1401219268|2.0|Okay, I realize that w/out Alan Moore, the road for a genius such as Neil Gaiman would have been more difficult.  No doubt Moore helped pave the way for those who would take comic books to greater heights, exploring the medium's potential to its fullest.<br /><br />I'm not sure TIME MAGAZINE put THE best \\"graphic novel\\" on its list of Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century.  Without a doubt, the collected volumes of Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN would be more worthy of inclusion...same for Art Spiegelman's MAUS.<br /><br />I've read all three (WATCHMEN, entire SANDMAN series & MAUS) an equal number of times.  With SANDMAN and MAUS, I always discover something newly unknown and magical with each repeated reading.  With WATCHMEN I tend to see more of its warts & flaws with each reading.<br /><br />Gaiman and Spiegelman have an ear for poetic prose and dialogue.  By comparison, though dense and laden with many words, Moore's style of writing is often so verbose, as though a lack of brevity will equal a profound statement.  It doesn't.  Often less is more...and this is a lesson that Moore, even after all these years, has yet to master.<br /><br />Finally, when dealing with writers such as Neil Gaiman or Art Spiegleman (and there are dozens of others whom I could mention, but felt it simpler to limit comparisons to these two accomplished writers in comics), one feels that they often bring out the nightmarish and horrific in order to shine a light on what is, essentially, the better angels within humanity.<br />And both writers DO enter into dark & disturbing terrain.<br /><br />By contrast, one gets the feeling that Moore sometimes pontificates on the importance of humanity as a cheap vehicle to go full guns into his disturbing mind and world.  Acts of grace...when they occur in Moore's work...seem to exist only to remind his readers that the world is not entirely one of no god, no hope, no future.  However, if given his way, I get the feeling that Moore would happily skip the better angels of humanity and would dwell entirely in the abyss.<br /><br />After having lived with WATCHMEN for over twenty years, it is a flawed, bloated and pompous work...more an exercise in histrionics rather than a work that sheds anything new on humans (be they costumed, with super-powers, or otherwise).  It does not hold up nearly as well as the works of Gaiman or Spiegleman.  TIME magazine picked the wrong token graphic novel to include in its 100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.<br /><br />When I read MAUS, I wish that I had Spiegleman's knack for pathos and natural dialogue.  When I read Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN (or just about any of Gaiman's work), I wish that I had Gaiman's extensive knowledge of myth, archtypes, religions, symbols and literature (as well as his eloquence in both narrative and dialogue).  When I read Alan Moore (whether it's WATCHMEN or V FOR VENDETTA or LOST GIRLS)...I pretty much find myself forever grateful that I'm not Alan Moore.<br /><br />I don't mind that Moore tackles disturbing topics.  More than anything, I resent when Moore...with all the people skills of a misanthrope...exploits tender human situations (which, in Moore's hands, feel completely void of any sincerity/empathy) for the sole purpose of making his bleak, nihilsitic vision all the more potent.<br /><br />We get it, Alan...the world is a place where there be dragons.  It's why you seldom leaves you small town in England (and will do your research through books rather than ever visit the settings with which he writes with the false authority of a self-appointed expert).  Fine, Alan.  Just leave the goodness and grace of humans out of your tomes.  Humanity and grace serve a higher purpose than the way you exploit them...as a vessel to merely offer a dichotomy/diversion to the demons that drive you.<br /><br />What's written above would also apply to Frank Miller...<br /><br />Gaiman/Spiegleman and Moore/Miller...one may as well say \\"the sacred and the profane.\\"
B001ED7C58|1.0|[...]    The link is a review of the film.  The music in the film was good but not intrinsic to the value of the film.  The songs featured in the film could have just as easily been replaced by any moderate rock tunes.  So, I think it is a pretty generic production.
B00008973A|3.0|The Bottom Line:    A Chorus Line is a classic example of something working on stage but not on screen--the musical was a revolutionary piece of musical theater, but the movie just feels uninspired and ordinary; the film may be of interest to those who like musicals, but it's not very accomplished.
031606792X|2.0|First I would like to note that this review will contain spoilers so, reader beware!          I had never heard of the twilight series until the summer when Breaking Dawn was released, and I never actually read the books until the beginning of November. I didn't want to go into the movie theater not having read the books. I am not a die-hard twilight fan, but I loved the story and read all of the books within the course of two weeks. I thought Stephanie Meyers needed to improve on her writing, seeing as there was very little character development and moments in the book where I felt she was just writing for the sake of making the book longer.    Although I had a few problems, I fell in love with the story, but was extremely disappointed in this final chapter. I have been reading reviews and agree with others on the point that Edward just becomes a shell of what he used to be, no longer the love of all of our lives. Jacob's imprinting on Renesme, while nice for him to still be able to be in Bella's life, is very creepy and unsettling. Also, Belle's character, who I have never been particularly fond of, still maintains that very annoying edge, but none of these points are what completely turned me away from this book.    The main plot of the story is Bella and Edward's daughter, who is a mutant mix between human and vampire. The Volturi discover this child and a huge controversy arises where the Cullens have to bring together a large group of vampires from all around the world as witnesses so the Volturi don't kill the baby. This story could have had a fabulous ending because there was so much build-up and tension surrounding the confrontation. Instead Meyer provides a very simple ending, leaving the reader disappointed and wondering why there was so much build-up. It could be compared to a movie where two sides spend the entire movie preparing for battle (buying weapons, training) but when brought together spend a few minutes glaring, then shake hands an part ways.There were also alot of unanswered questions at the end of the series. As a HUGE Harry Potter Fan, I was spoiled with JK Rowlings tidy ending, wrapping up the loose ends. I'm not saying that she wrapped everything up cause there may have been a few tiny loose strings, but Breaking Dawn had so many unanswered questions at the end of the book. Why, for example, did Charlie and Billy hate each other? I felt as though there were so many things that could have been resolved which weren't.     For me, the ending of a movie can make or break a book and Stephanie Meyer had a really let down with this one for me.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Even after multiple viewings I cannot deny that V for Vendetta has serious flaws--the scenes with Natalie Portman and V don't really click--but the film has scenes of such power and skill that it lingers in the memory far more than more accomplished but less ambitious movies.

B001AX9DT0|4.0|How good is Ray Lamontagne? Think Cat Stevens... think Van Morrison. I do not make such comparisons lightly. Certainly the most exciting new talent to come along since Tori Amos, and that has been a few years now. After one pass, this album sounds like it is at least the equal of the stunning \\"Till the Sun Turns Black\\". Highly Recommended.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|We just finishe watching the movie and I really wasn't anticipating enjoying this movie as much as I did.  When Heath Ledger passed away, the hype immediately started regarding the movie and how it would be his best.  Usually when this happens, I am greatly disappointed; but not this time.  It was exciting, clever and fun to watch with the family.  It is really unfortunate that Ledger died because his acting in this was outstanding--he was so evil in this role that I actually forgot who the actor was.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|I approached this CD the wrong way round, so to speak - seeing that the band was to play at the new O2 Stadium in Prague in the Czech Republic on 31st October 2008, I decided that the whole family should go in my continuing campaign to get my kids to see as many great musicians as possible before it's too late, as well as people they like. So far this has included B B King, Paul McCartney, Stevie Winwood, Eric Clapton, Cream,Procol Harum, Genesis, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, Andy Sheppard, Tommy Smith, Joe Lovano, Meat Loaf (great band - voice vanished sadly), Eric Bell, Buddy Guy, Bryan Adams and even Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky Mick and Tich who were fab. In turn I have seen McFly, Fall Out Boy,  Bowling for Soup, Kelly Clarkson (really really good)and many many other newer bands and performers. Kids, eh?    Having met a really nice guy from the Tourist Office in a previous visit, I asked him to let me know if any good shows were coming up. So he kindly e-mailed me in April to say that Queen and Paul Rodgers were on their way so I bought tickets then and there. They were sold out a few minutes later but at £39 each they seemed pretty good value. Then I booked flights from Bristol to Prague on EasyJet at £30 each return, and a hotel near the Stadium for about £50 each. A great weekend promised.    Arriving in Prague with its fantastic public transport and underground system, I was really surprised to see no posters, no advertising, no anything. So off I went to the tourist office and asked Marek if they were still playing. \\"Why should they not be?\\" he replied, \\"The tickets sold out in a few hours and everybody knows about it. We do not need to further promote a sell-out concert.\\" Well, that put me in my place.    We arrived at this fantastic new stadium and after a short wait the band appeared, and the first sound of Paul Rodgers' brilliant voice, one of my favourite of all time, took me back to seeing Free in the old days. Brian May, Paul Rodgers and Roger Taylor were on fire, as were their superlative back-up players Spike Edney, Danny Mirando and Jamie Moses. Starting with a boiling \\"Tie your mother Down\\", they trawled through a huge selection of Queen numbers old and new, and, of course, The Cosmos Rocks. Sometimes it's hard to appreciate new songs on first hearing, but such was the musicianship, the good humour and the vast amount of styles they tackled that it was impossible not to be involved. This is not \\"the New Queen\\" in any way. The adorable Freddie M was a completely different front man, sparkling with brilliance but often in a very staccato way.  Rodgers, from the blues tradition, is a much more relaxed and rhythmic performer, able to sing around the beat and to put his own stamp on everything. Honestly, it was a brilliant show, the acoustics were impeccable and Paul Rodgers a revelation. The respect and good humour with which they treated their material was a joy to behold. The Tears In The Eye bit came with We are the Champions, which PR sung perfectly and hit all the notes in his husky burred voice, and a rendition of All Right Now, with Dr May having the good taste to play Paul Kossoff's immaculate solo note perfectly.    Anyway, I bought myself the CD for Christmas and it's a great little artefact, weearing its background and influences quite openly on its sleeve. Cosmos Rockin', the opener, roars along at a heck of a pace with Brian retreading his Chuck Berry/Now I'm here riffing to great effect. To pick out some highlights, Call Me is a great little almost rockabilly track with an offset rhythmn and the tune from \\"Au Claire De La Lune, Mon Ami Pierrot..\\", incredbly like Cheryl Crow's last single. A great little four-tracked solo has Paul pleading \\"Have Mercy,\\" a great touch and really funny. \\"We Believe\\", which is a charter for tolerance and understanding, is just lovely, with great harmonies and Paul's tuneful blues voice just out of this world - and it has more than a touch of \\"You're The Voice\\" by John Farnham.On Voodoo and on Through the Night (especially), Brian pays a lovely and touching tribute to Rory Gallagher, as he does elsewhere on the CD. This song is a near lift from \\"Fly off the Handle\\" from Top Priority, and the guitar tone here and elsewhere is that of Rory on Irish Tour 74 (especially \\"A Million Miles Away\\") and Calling Card, especially the tone on \\"Do you Read Me?\\" and \\"Calling Card\\" itself. Brian even does the liitle bit on the guitar where Rory sings \\"my cat don't scratch\\" on \\"Fly off the Handle\\". Brian is very public about his respect for Rory and attributes his guitar tone to him. This is a very respectful and touching way of saying thanks.    Say It's not True, not unlike Say it ain't So Joe (The Gary Brooker Version) shows Rodgers in top voice, getting high notes that Freddie would have been proud of while not resorting to falsetto. Some Things that Glitter is just a lovely song and it would have been sung by anybody - but Paul's timing is great and it's a touching tribute, I would guess, to Mrs Rodgers. Surf's Up is just plain funny and a great little rocker. For me the weakest track is C-lebrity, not much in there at all, with a chorus lifted from a million psychdelic songs.    All in all, a smashing little disc, full of  good humour and great playing and singing. Even Roger Taylor, who can be a bit plodding, really comes to life and shows who had the technically best voice in Queen, as he did on stage in Prague.    A very worthy four stars from a great new band. See them live too - just brilliant and captivating. By the way, the children were blown away, as was I.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This concise and effective workout grows with you as you improve your fitness level!  This one disk contains three workouts of increasing intensity.  All three are based on her 3-2-1 system.  Three minutes of strength, two minutes of cardio, and one minute of abs.  The exercises she uses are simple and occasionally remind me of elementary school PE, but she keeps the variety up among the three workouts.<br /><br />The only thing you need is hand weights (and a mat if you are working out on a hard surface).  No expensive equipment required!<br /><br />Personally, I love the simplicity of the moves (although I hate jumping jacks - they work!).  This is definitely not for anyone who may have trouble with high-impact cardio.  The cardio is almost all jumping based - jumping jacks, [...] kicks, jumping rope, etc.  But it's only two minutes at a time!<br /><br />Jillian's coaching style is not for everyone.  I would recommend previewing her personality on the Biggest Loser or one of her other DVDs available on Comcast (sometimes) or Netflix instant viewing.<br /><br />Her style is no-nonsense.  She jumps right into the moves, so definitely watch each routine once through before attempting the workout.  I wouldn't recommend just watching - get up and mimic her form and make sure you understand the moves.  They aren't complicated but she does give tips throughout for avoiding injury and making sure you catch those by actually doing the exercise will help you ensure you safely get the maximum results.<br /><br />Keep in mind that it is unlikely you will lose the advertised 20 lbs in 30 days unless you are completely inactive starting the program.  That being said, even the most dedicated of athletes could use these routines for variety and to challenge themselves.

B001ED7C58|5.0|I just ADORE all the music on this soundtrack (except Rob's, haha) It's exactly what I like....techno-ish Rock. I've loved paramore way before this and they are so talented! Don't even get me started on Rob Pattinson's song...it, to be honest, was VERY pathetic. I mean...it was--everyone knows what I'm talking it about. It's like the most boring song in the history of the earth.     I kinda see what everyone's talking about how it didn't really match the feel of the book but I think that Bella would like those songs. And Edward (don't get me wrong i love him) I think his taste  in music is weird. Who wouldn't like the songs from the 70s?     I thought Bella's lullaby was beautiful. I thought it captured everything edward would've put into it. Simple yet touching and beautiful. And that piece of crap \\"River Flows In You\\" is the most repetitive music ever. It gets ANNOYING after the first verse because it's that same tuneless chord over and over again. I am so glad that they didn't pick it. Anyways I think that this soundtrack reflects Stephenie's taste in music probably more than Edward's and Bella's but it's good.    Team Cullen 4ever!
B001KMB6VE|3.0|Wow - cannot go anywhere without reading all of the negativity about the production of this film. I'm going to skip reviewing the history here and talk about the BD quality since that is really the saving grace here.<br /><br />The length of the film is 101 minutes, with the 50 or 60 changes to content (from theatrical to \\"uncut\\") listed on tons of sites out there; Most changes revolve around sound editing, narration changes, slightly different ending and edits throughout - but nothing in the range of what will hopefully exist someday (the rumored 3 to 4 hour cut would be preferable).<br /><br />The sound and picture are worthwhile and test worthy for a BD system. Listening to Quiet Riot (later in the film) and the opening urban music sequence sounded outstanding in DTS. The channel usage through the entire film was mixed so well that even when the film had been edited horribly by Fox - it still managed to blend believably. The visual fx and panoramic shots looked great in 1080 and only showed a few shortcomings - but nothing that detracts from the overall shots. The amount of dark/night shots were actually filmed in such a way that the hidef clarity kept the film believable instead of being muddled. Vin Diesel's pores and the numerous bleak landscapes make for a solid BD presentation, and all of the sound channels were utilized/tested by the end of the film (even small details like the sound mixing of the kids in the slums, used all 3 three left channels separately).<br /><br />I know this film was butchered and people are hating it EVERYWHERE - but I say give the BD a chance just for the view, and yes - the film has been horribly chopped up and there are gaping sequences of dialogue and story missing. But I can't think of anyone else whose eyes I would want to see (in BD) get that wide while cage fighting a 250 pound muscle man, way to go Vin. Last time I mentioned someone's pitted facial texture in BD I got slammed here on Amazon, but Gerard's facial shots in the movie both scared and scarred me, I hope no other film does his face like that again...egh.<br /><br />The supplements are not particularly worth much, as I obviously would have liked to see the \\"truth\\" exposed in a tell-all docu, but oh well. There are plenty of production clips to give you an idea of how the filming went. The menu sounds/rotating pics play nicely in the store and quite a few people ask about the film because of it. Hope you enjoy a semi-decent scifi as much as is allowed.scarred me, I hope no other film does his face like that again...egh.    The supplements are not particularly worth much, as I obviously would have liked to see the \\"truth\\" exposed in a tell-all docu, but oh well. There are plenty of production clips to give you an idea of how the filming went. The menu sounds/rotating pics play nicely in the store and quite a few people ask about the film because of it. Hope you enjoy a semi-decent scifi as much as is allowed.
B0009S2T0M|3.0|I won't give away too much of this film's plot, as part of the enjoyment is the anticipation of what happens next from very early on (and I would encourage avoiding other reviews that give too much away and just watch it!)   This being said, early on the film's protagonist is kidnapped and locked away in a room for reasons which are unknown to him.   Beyond being fed, cleaned, and treated medically, his captors completely refuse to communicate with him who they are or why he is being held (however, his \\"cell\\" does come furnished with a TV - his only means of receiving communication from the outside world!).       Generally this Korean-made suspense/thriller (with English subtitles) was received well by critics.   Part of the enjoyment unquestionably is the twists and turns of the plot throughout.   Overall, very fine acting and a plot that (near as I can tell) holds up; whether one truly buys the bizarre storyline may depend on the particular viewer.      I give it a thumbs up - it's definitely memorable, stylistic, and entertaining, though it seems to fall under the trend of thrillers world-wide that seem to be competing for \\"one-ups-manship\\" in the areas of extreme plot, violence, mutilation, and perversity.    I would give it around 7 out of a scale of ten.   I would add that it is one that seems worth a second viewing based on a lot of subtle plot details the viewer may not pick up on the first time around.       Though it's not considered a horror, in outrageousness, some aspects it seem to rival the Japanese made horror movie, \\"Audition.\\"
B001KZVQJI|5.0|As another individual correctly noted this Blue Ray version does in fact contain both the theatrical and extended version of the film.  The NBC Universal Store web site verifies it.  Amazon simply failed to clarify this and they should do so because several others are disappointed that it doesn't appear to be here.  Peter Jackson's version of this classic film is simply visually stunning and it should be a reference quality Blue Ray film to show off a good video setup.  This is so much better than the cheap 1976 remake with Jeff Bridges.<br /><br />Mr. Jackson took the time to actually develop the characters and the story which indeed adds to the film just as he did in Lord of the Rings which depended on character development.  Far too many films today fail to deliver a full story and rely only on cheap special effects.  This is a rich and full story.  Some were critical of this fact and they apparently merely wanted to see a large ape captured, climb a large building and then fall off and die with little more than special effects to wow them for an hour.  This is not a film for those with such a short attention span or those interested only in computer graphic magic.  This is the full story of Kong and those who encountered him . . . and it's an incredibly good one and superbly stunning in cinematography.
0515141429|5.0|I've been a big Lee Child fan, but if you're like me, following a few recent outings ranging from the mediocre (\\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\") to the abysmal (\\"Nothing to Lose\\"), you may be asking: \\"Is Child losing his edge, or have my standards changed that much?\\"  So to find out, I went back and re-read Child's first Jack Reacher carnival of violence, \\"Killing Floor\\", originally published in 1997.  My conclusion: it is Child who has changed: \\"Killing Floor\\", even when read the second time, is an adrenaline-charged escapist romp of mayhem balanced with suspense and mystery, a larger-than-life drama that while wholly unbelievable is nonetheless addictive and enjoyable.<br /><br />With homage due to David Morrell's contemporary classic \\"First Blood\\", Jack Reacher, former Army MP Major and current drifter, is arrested over a cup of coffee while passing through backwater Margrave, Georgia.  Triggering unavoidable images of Stallone's Rambo, Reacher is accused of murder, and hauled in by the local sheriff's deputies on way to the state penitentiary's holding cells for the weekend.  His incarceration is brief but hardly uneventful, and soon Reacher finds real motivation to stick around and help solve the murder for which he was originally charged.<br /><br />Reacher's stoic loaner is the classic American icon - conjuring images from the Marlborough Man to Batman to the adventurous nomads who rode the rails without strings or responsibilities.  With Rambo's command of martial arts and weaponry of all kinds and Sherlock Holmes-class power of deductive reasoning, Reacher thinks and slugs and gouges and shoots his way to resolution and redemption.  Child sets his story and his hero well above the fray with lean and crisp prose, embellished but not unencumbered by liberal doses on fact and trivia on wide ranges of topics, Child's research adding authenticity and credibility to a tale of greed and corruption the would otherwise be tired fare.<br /><br />In short, if you don't think too hard about coincidence and implausibility, \\"Killing Floor\\" is the literary equivalent of eye candy - a boisterous, no-holds-barred thriller that stands alone in pop crime fiction.  Leads one to wonder if Lee Child shouldn't go back and get reacquainted with the original Jack Reacher as well.ence and implausibility, \\"Killing Floor\\" is the literary equivalent of eye candy - a boisterous, no-holds-barred thriller that stands alone in pop crime fiction.

0439023483|5.0|I'm not one to write book reviews on Amazon, but WOW! this was a great read!  Honestly, some of the best books I've ever read have been teen/young adult novels, and this one ranks way up at the top.  I could not put this down, and the story stayed with me for days, weeks really.  I'm just now finding out this is book one in a trilogy, and I cannot wait for book 2!  Katniss is a well-developed character whom I care about and want to know what happens next to this spunky girl!
B001IZFXMQ|4.0|I admit it: I typically like an unabridged audiobook read by the author, e.g. Stephen King reading his book \\"On Writing.\\"  For such reason, I'm rather picky about the book on tape/CD.<br /><br />\\"World War Z\\" was great because it's got an array of actors reading the various anecdotes.  I didn't read the book, so I don't know what's missing in this abridged audio version, but the Mark Hamill performances are great.  The Henry Rollins' bit, however, is not as good as I expected (i.e., I expected that his \\"fame\\" would make him a better actor than some of the lesser known people, but I was wrong about that).  Also, the downed woman pilot is read by a mediocre actress at best . . . rather annoying.  For some reason, there's an inclusion of some blind Asian guy beating off zombies with a club or something.  It goes on a bit too long.  Nevertheless, very entertaining and varied.  Worth the dough I paid for it.  Can't wait for the movie (and to see how they make it into one).<br /><br />My biggest issue with the storyline on the CD is that it's never explained exactly where the Z germ came from, how people became infected with it and why people weren't afraid of contagion.  (In one scene, someone recently infected gets in a car with a girl and her family, but no one contracts the zombie virus).  I need more explanation (but I don't think the book will be worth reading, frankly).  The five CDs were enough, thanks.
0525478183|5.0|Paper Towns was a quick read and a lot of fun. It made me laugh out loud and reminded me of my own teenage years. It's great to see band geeks in the spotlight. :-) I thought it was a great book!
031606792X|1.0|I finally decided to read Twightlight and was entranced.  So I went out and got the other books and did enjoy New Moon and Eclipse.  However, what a disappointment Breaking Dawn was.  I totally agree with all of the negative reviews.  It is like the characters are not themselves in this book.  I can't even picture Edward and Bella, they seem to be strangers.  Also, the baby story line is very strange.
B0017VG66I|5.0|Two of my favorite westerns of all time.  Entertaining throughout, and star acting.  Lee marvin, one of the greatest actors in my opinion of all time was brilliant in, \\"The man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\".  He plays a villian like none other.  Alan Ladd's character in, \\"Shane\\", was so mild mannered and helpful to those in need. He was also brave, tough, and would not back down from a fight if you tried to bully him or those he was helping.  The story lines were great. These movies are classics and will never be replaced by today's modern westerns.  The great western movies and western movie actor's are gone forever.

Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book. Open you mind and have fun!
0446579939|5.0|It has been a long while since I enjoyed a book as much as this. I love the way the men in Sparks' novels love so deeply. I found it hard not to flip to the end of the book, I wanted to know how it ended. I of course did not (a lesson I learned long ago) and was left with warm fuzzes at the end. I have now moved on to \\"The Rescue\\", as I said in the title... I'm in love :)
B001C46P2A|1.0|Watching Hugh Jackman single-handedly embarrass himself and ruin his so-far mediocre career is the best reason to watch this monumental disaster. Nicole Kidman is past 40 but still insists on playing these babe-out-of-the-woods roles that should go to women 15 years younger than her.<br /><br />I don't know what was worse - watching the absolutely irritating Aborigine boy do his `magic' (I was wishing he'd be trampled to death by cattle during these disgusting scenes), or his equally boring grandfather practice his desert-dancing (a hideous spectacle no matter how drunk you are). Add to this the semi-interesting storylines about the racial tension and `half-breeds' (which could have been addressed instead of this line-toeing), and \\"Australia\\" is just too ugly and ridiculous to take seriously.<br /><br />While watching this, it was evident that Baz has lost all spark. The CGI is especially weak, and the directors' obsession with cattle is disturbing (at least 30 minutes of this film focus lovingly on cattle running, cattle grazing, cattle standing and thinking, etc). And watching Nicole Kidman serve people tea out of bone china is mind-numbingly boring, no matter which way you cut it. So, I guess to add to the `sparks', we have Hugh Jackman take his shirt off every now and then, and there is this one scene where he shaves off his beard and emerges looking like a 1930s drag queen, complete with violet eye-shadow (I kid you not). Just plain queasy.<br /><br />In the middle of this nonsense, we've got Nicole and Hugh falling in love (or `lust', though obviously they have zero chemistry), and their scenes together are more time-consuming that idly watching paint dry. The one-liners are unintentionally funny, as both lead actors are given some senseless monologues every now and then just to break the tepid goings-on. My personal favorite is when Hugh says \\"Just because something should be, doesn't mean that it IS\\", or something like that. Or was it \\"Just because something IS, doesn't mean that it should be\\". Either way, the line doesn't work at ALL. What it does do however, is to make you intensely dislike both lead actors (not that the idiotic child actor was any better), but the sad news is that all the characters live and no one dies.<br /><br />At the end of the film, we have a shoot-out, with the boring kid trapped in the middle. Instead of giving us a useful ending and finishing him off, they let him live, and this means a happy threesome at the end with a `tear-jerking' shot of Nicole, Hugh and the boy clasping each other to their bosoms like nobodys' business. If this sort of revolting idiocy is your bag, then by all means, indulge!<br /><br />\\"Australia\\" is the perfect example of a film that should never have been made. A bad storyline, horrible acting, sick script, and poor effects, but more than that, it has absolutely NO soul whatsoever. Which of course, doesn't work. I would recommend that the director retire, alongwith his two tired leads. This was one movie that had one bad shot after the other, and certainly one of the worst films I have ever watched in my life.<br /><br />Zero Stars. A monstrous abomination.

B001GAPC1K|4.0|For general entertainment this is a very good choice. It has none of the edge of say, Dark Knight, but it has humor, and strikes a good balance between fantasy and taking itself (too) seriously. The planned sequels are probably 3 deep, but there always room for this kind of fun.
B001DHXT20|3.0|I have to say I enjoyed this Hulk movie up until the last fight sequence - which seemed to drag on and on and made me hit the fast forward button through sections of it without feeling I lost anything by it.  I had to smile at the homage references to the Hulk TV series.  The opening section of the movie in the Brazilian slums was a nice touch - it was certainly a different setting for a movie like this.      For me in many ways it was the final scenes of this movie that were the most interesting, and if you enjoyed Iron Man you should pick up this movie for that alone.  I've given this review three stars because of the over-extended fight sequence at the end of it (shades of Spider Man 3!) and the cgi which disappointed me a little as they seem to have relied on it to make up for the lack of character relationships (one of the highlights of the TV series), but if there is a sequel to this movie I'll watch it on DVD if nothing else.
B000MV90IU|4.0|Its no secret that the plot of this movie is sketchy. The satisfaction of Bullitt comes partly from the realistic and gritty treatment of the hospital scenes, and partly the general no nonsense atmosphere throughout. And the blu ray transfer is very impressive. The car chase speaks for itself. Overall, a nice statement for its time, but mainly for the atmosphere and vibe.
0007240198|4.0|Bit of a rant by the author... But if you can step back from his ranting about the inadequecies of the British media in reporting medical news, what he he says is a very sobering analysis of media reporting of  science in general. His comments about the media desire to 'dumb things down' particularly struck a chord with me - as Goldacre mentions, business news is not 'dumbed down' economic news is not 'dumbed down' art news is not 'dumbed down' so why does science have to be 'dumbed down?'    I do recommend the book because if nothing else, Goldacre knocks you out of contemplacy and acceptance and makes you want to double check what the media is saying before you believe it, and as he rightly says, we all need to be doing that. Goldacre focused on British media reporting of medical untruths, but his message is equally applicable to the many other areas of science reporting in the press today, especially the science of global warming and the potential it has to inflict uncalculable and unnecessary hardship on the world - just as poor reporting by the British media has inflicted draconian medicine on the accepting British public with their desire for a story over the truth.    Everyone with half a brain and an ounce of curiosity should read this book. More people like Goldacre are needed out there to question and follow up on science and stop accepting the non-scientific journalists selling us dud information in the name of making money for publishers. The world will be richer for knowing the truth. Read Goldacre and start hte journey to finding out the truth in science.
B001EOQWEY|5.0|This is the best animated movie ever! It contains all, a great story, excellent video and audio design, and the message cannot be more close to reality! Great for anyone, kids or adults, you end up loving it!    The spanish version that I bought has both the english and the spanish video, as well as both audios and subtitles. It comes with nice extras, the Presto short movie, a cool Burn-E little short and some very interesting extras.  A must have in your collection.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|*****WARNING!****** There maybe spoilers in this review for those who haven't seen the movie yet!*******        Beauty And The Beast happens to be my all time favorite Disney animated movie. I saw it in the theater at least 4 times when it was first released in 1991 and I must have watched it a dozen or so times since then. There are several reasons why Beauty And The Beast is my favorite Disney movie. For one, Belle is a heroine that many young women today can definitely relate to. Her love of reading, the fact that a man being handsome alone doesn't impress her (Gaston) and her curiousity about things makes her personality very realistic and endearing.       Another reason why Beauty And The Beast is my favorite is the music. I've never enjoyed the music in a Disney movie as much as I have this one. The clever and sometimes touching lyrics draw you in and make one caught up in the story. Songs such as \\"Belle\\", \\"Gaston\\", \\"Something There\\"  \\"Be Our Guest\\" and of course the title track add so much to the overall story and give the viewer a deeper understanding of the characters.         Yet another reason is the animation. True, there are many Disney movies where the animation is dazzling, however, I'm just so drawn to (no pun intended) the animation in this movie. The scene that impresses me the most is the one where Belle and The Beast dance while Mrs. Potts sings the title song. The combination of tradiditional and computer animation has the end result being such a stunning and beautiful scene. Probably from an artistic point of view (not to mention an emotional point of view), my favorite scene from the movie.        Finally, lets not forget the story itself. I think the meaning of it is beautiful. It's about looking at the person's inside and finding the true beauty of someone's soul, which is Belle's POV.  I think we all forget sometimes about that, and this movie is a lovely reminder of that. Another lesson is how people can change, can learn and grow, which is the Beast's POV. It also demonstrates how love conquers all things, even when you think all hope is lost (the last petal of the rose falling after Belle tells the Beast that she loves him). That is a profound message.

0307454894|5.0|Read the book in '98 and liked it enough to keep it on the shelf to read again.  Yesterday I saw the movie and felt there were too many unanswered questions and some important portrayals completely left out. It seems that the movie deals more with child abuse and the inability to feel.  The boy was from an emotionless family and he was attracted to an emotionless older woman.  Don't the psychology books tell us that we are attracted to the people who are most like our mothers and/or fathers who have impressed upon us for the majority our youth.    My feeling about the book is we as a society in the present or in the past choose to overlook the morality of government whether it be Germany or the US. The government is there for control, to make people rich, to control our beliefs and keep us dependent on the government. They want to be mother and father and for us believe in them to make the right decisions. Then we don't have to take responsibility or think or make the decisions which requires time and energy.  When people disagree with government decisions, they can easily be outcasts or called \\"un-American\\" as we saw happen 7 years ago. People who didn't believe that the Iraqi war was morally right were labeled anti American. Have we forgotten that???? Many Right-winged Republican have forgotten and the only excuses they seem to come up with are\\" Bush was advised poorly and Hillary voted for the war\\"....not that Bush lied along with his leadership to have the war they had prepared for and yes, Hillary did vote for the war in fear that she would be labeled anti-American.  So back to the book.... many soldiers who are sent to war probably to do not have good reading skills nor reading comprehension skills, does this excuse them from killing? Do we honor our soldiers who kill? Do our churches ask us to honor the soldiers who kill and send letters that they are doing a good job and we support them? So are we not as quilty of supporting killing?  Was Hanna part of the wheel of the government that asks no questions but just does the job??   Do our own young men and women end up with tortured lives from the wheel of government which sends them to war to kill?  I thought the book to be thought provoking!  I thought the movie missed the mark!    This is a book to be read more than once to produce thought and questions.    The first time I read the book, it did not produce the questions it does now.  Isn't this good literature when it provokes thought, reaction, emotions and discussion???    What is Right?   Is it what our government leaders tell us or what we feel inside? Are we able to feel inside if we only accept what the government tells us?     If this book were not about the Holocaust, how would it be evaluated?   Would it be evaluated the same for the sexual abuse of a 15 year old boy in Iraq or Afghanistan?      THE READER is a wonderful book to read and think about!
0312330537|4.0|I was a little hesitant when I first picked up this book because of its thickness, but I'm glad I did. Gregory David Roberts has this amazing way of describing things through words. He made me fall in love with Mumbai, India; which is where this book was set.<br /><br />This book is about his life in India. Most of it is based on actual events, however some of it was fabricated for entertainment purposes. The story is about his life in India, and his life in the organised crime business.<br /><br />The most intriguing part of this book for me was the love story that developed between him and a particular woman. Roberts has a lot of quirky remarks about life, love, and relationships that I loved.
0743270754|5.0|Lincoln is probably the most significant figure in American History not because of his political acumen though it is legend and not because he was a great general though he led us through our greatest historical trial - the Civil War. His greatness lies in the fact that he was big enough to see the American experiment for what is was - an experiment for the whole world and small enough to be able to communicate complex thought in language the average man could understand. Through these characteristics he engendered trust and admiration and yes - even loyalty not only from his supporters from his skeptics and enemies as well. If we are limited to a word to describe this historical giant it must be - Magnanimity. He was truly a leader for all the ages.     Ms Goodwin weaves what could have been a dry recounting of the facts of history into an incredible page turning tapestry revealing the chemistry of the events and historical opportunities of the day as they were catalyzed by personalities of Lincoln and his cabinet, the Team of Rivals.    Whatever you think about Mr Obama, he is our President elect and this book has influenced his political trajectory. He has asked for the Lincoln Bible to be the Bible used when he takes the oath of office. To know his mind this is required reading.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|This Christmas me and my two younger brothers were presented with quite a treat! each of us received a CS-6 Longshot. The first thing you realize when you get this gun is it is not your old \\"open up and start shooting\\" nerf gun, this gun requires some assembly, nothing that really requires a manual but assembly none the less. Even shooting darts requires that you first open the clip, put in a 6 dart magazine and then close the loading chamber, which I find utterly amazing. the little features in this gun astound me, when you pull back on the loading/spring mechanism you're able to look into the loading chamber just like a real gun. This serves a practical purpose however as you'll need to get to this area when it jams... which it will if you're foolish enough to try to use a different type of ammo then what Nerf recommends.  the gun is actually two separate nerf guns in one, there is the large gun itself which can grow several inches if you want by moving the shoulder butt back using an orange switch and a smaller pump action gun on the front which needs to be manually loaded with a new dart each shot. when the two guns are attached together this rifle is gratifyingly long. and when you don't want something that is as long as some reasonably sized dogs you can always separate the guns and shorten the stock of the gun for a much more manageable toy.   It also is really neat having a full second clip of ammunition in the stock of the gun and the Bi-pod is really fun to use, it also makes the gun look very sniper-like  out of the 3 guns we received ALL work amazingly well, we can shoot the guns well over 30 feet and the entertainment value has been great, there's nothing like randomly launching a barrage of nerf bullets at one of your siblings *memories*  there has been one troubling side effect of how powerful these guns are, I've been noticing that the gun is actually starting to tear up small pieces of the nerf dart with continued use, hopefully this will only continue to a point but regardless I'd recommend picking up one of the nerf value dart packs from Hasbro.  this is the most powerful nerf gun I've ever owned or seen, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good solid nerf toy.  -Demonpack
B000E41MRC|5.0|Leni Riefenstahl's masterpiece, Triumph of the Will is a cinematic milestone.  Set aside your preconceptions, notions of political correctness, kick back with some nachos and enjoy the spectacle, pageantry, patriotism and just plain ole unmitigated evil of a bygone era. Yes, this is THE \\"documentary\\" of the events of the Sixth Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in 1934, featuring a cast of thousands, mind blowing special effects, and show stopping musical numbers, as well as (of course) Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Hess, Goering and assorted other Nazi superstars of the day.     Get caught up in the wackiness as Hitler and Goebbels lead the German people around like neutered sheep on Thorazine.  The brilliant camera work and editing, ratchet up the tension incrementally from the opening marches and speeches to the closing ones, creating a yearning and semi-religious awe for the realization of the full spectrum dominance of Nazi ideology.     The legendary cinematic genius Leni Riefenstahl creates in the viewer an irresistible excitement over the images of mindless obedience to patently psychotic leaders and vulgar nationalistic narcissism. But politics aside, one can't help but admire the energy and skill that went into this classic; the sweeping vision and the insight that are meant to lead the audience to an epiphany.  Triumph of the Will pays off in sheer entertainment value despite the cliff-hanger ending.

I first read The Death and Life of Bobby Z a few months ago and thought it was quite a good book, not great but had potential.<br /><br />That potential was nearly realised in The Power of The Dog.<br /><br />Think of the James Ellroy books of about 10 years ago and you get The Power of the Dog except that Winslow is a touch graphic in the violence and the sex scenes and maybe a bit melodramatic but he is getting better with each book.<br /><br />A good read, long book with a tonne of events to keep track of, but worth the time.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I'm curious. You say that the \\"two track stereo tapes for Love Me Do and She Loves You are no longer in existence\\" when the original versions of these tracks were in Mono to begin with. What happened to them and why can't they just separate the channels of these tracks like they did when they released these tracks in Mono?  It wasn't real stereo to begin with since they were working with Mono Masters.

B001BEK8E2|1.0|If you are interested in film history, you might find this movie interesting since it is directed by Legendary director Kurosawa.  If, however, you want to watch a good movie, then you should skip this, because this is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever seen.    The movie starts out with 3 bums seeking shelter from a downpour in a ruined temple.  One of the bums tells the story of a murder victim he found and the resulting inquest.  In his story, he tells of the 3 people involved in the crime: the bandit who is suspected of the murder; the woman the bandit rapes; and her husband, the murder victim.  Each person tells their own version of events, including the murder victim who tells the story through a medium.  Each version differs greatly.    The problem with this movie is that it is boring, the plot is completely not interesting in the least, the acting is absolutely over-the-top atrocious, and none of the characters is even remotely likeable.    And the fight scenes!  Oh my.  It's like watching mentally disabled people trying to whack each other with sticks after drinking a fifth of whiskey.  Falling, tripping, clumsily grappling and missing, and flailing around in the dirt like spastic monkeys.    And while Kurosawa may indeed be a legend, I have to wonder why in the world he chose to do some of the things he did in this film.  For example, when the bum begins to tell his tale, he says he was walking through the forest to cut some wood.  The scene then cuts to a backflash of the bum walking through the woods.  This walking-through-the-woods scene goes on FOREVER.  It's just the bum ... walking through the woods ... from 1000 different angles ... while incredibly annoying drum music is playing in the background.  And that's all there is: bum, woods, walking, and drums, and it lasts a ridiculously long time.  If that is an example of what good directing is, I'd hate to see what qualifies as bad directing.    To sum up: I've seen Star Trek movies that aremore artistic and more skillfully executed than this abysmal waste of 2 hours.  You've been warned.
B000EHQTZO|4.0|King Kong starring Fay Wray is a classic film, I haven't seen this film in a few years but I like how scary this giant ape really is. This film is black and white and very old school when it comes to special effects but the story is great and how can you not love this love-sick gorilla? Check this monster-hit out soon, I also recommend this 2005 remake starring Naomi Watts. Enjoy!

B00004Y6NX|5.0|Dire Straits' third album entitled Making Movies was released in October of 1980 on Vertigo/Phonogram in Europe and on Warner Bros here in the United States.<br />By the time Dire Straits recorded its third album, Dire Straits had two back-to-back Gold selling albums and were getting better as a band. However, Dire Straits suffered its first personnel change as lead singer/lead guitarist/songwriter Mark Knopfler's rhythm guitarist brother David left Dire Straits. For Making Movies, Knopfler plus bass player John Illsley and drummer Pick Withers would record as a three piece. Plus Knopfler took over as producer with famed engineer/producer (and later chairman of Interscope Records) Jimmy Iovine plus Roy Bittan from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band playing keyboards. I was in for a treat whenI first acquired the album in January of 1998 (although was familiar with the first three tracks and \\"Solid Rock\\" as US radio played those songs often).<br />We begin the album with the eight minute plus epic \\"Tunnel of Love\\" which starts with Bittan's organ and piano rendition of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"The Carousel Waltz\\" before the band comes in for an epic which is of the ages featuring Knopfler's phenomenal guitar work. Next Mark breaks out the National Steel acoustic guitar for the six minute \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" which is a modern telling of the famed book. The first side ended with the track \\"Skateaway\\" which starts with drums fading in before keyboards, guitar, vocals and bass guitar come to life and speaks of a woman who roller skates her way through life.<br />The album's second side started with the rocker \\"Expresso Love\\" which is a great rocker. I know some complained that Dire Straits were trying to go the Springsteen route but a great song. Next is the song \\"Hand in Hand\\" which was a great song. Next is another hard rocker out of the US rock radio staple and longtime concert staple \\"Solid Rock\\" which has great playing all around. We close the album with the countryish sounding \\"Les Boys\\" which showed the band's humor somewhat about German boys who \\"do their thing\\".<br />Making Movies peaked at #14 on the Billboard chart and went Platinum here in the US with a million copies sold upon its release.

B00004Y6NP|5.0|Dire Straits' fifth album entitled Brothers in Arms was released in May of 1985 on Vertigo/Phonogram in Europe and on Warner Bros here in the United States.<br />By the time Dire Straits recorded its fifth studio album, Dire Straits now consisted of lead singer/lead guitarist/songwriter Mark Knopfler, bass player John Illsley, keyboard player Alan Clark. Plus drummers Terry Williams (then the band's permanent drummer and formerly of Rockpile) and Omar Hakim (who appears on some of the tracks as co-producer Neil Dorfsman didn't like Terry's more powerhouse rock drumming), new second keyboard player Guy Fletcher (ex-Roxy Music) and guitarist Jack Sonni (replacing Hal Lindes). Mark Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman co-produced the album. I was in for a treat whenI first acquired the album in July of 1985 on cassette tape after hearing \\"Money For Nothing\\" (I also bought Styx's Pieces of Eight album on cassette tape simultaneously with Brothers in Arms thanks to my mother and both albums were the soundtrack to my summer of 1985).<br />We begin the album with the one of the band's biggest hits \\"So Far Away\\" which is a great piece. Excellent music and lyrics. Next is the biggest hit \\"Money For Nothing\\" in all of its eight and half minute glory. Famed ex-Police leader Sting guest appears on backing vocals and sings the famed \\"I want my MTV\\" refrain. Who can forget the video as this track sent many to buy this album. Next is the country-ish rocker \\"Walk of Life\\" which was the first single in Europe and a great piece. This track had two videos (one of a busker in the UK the other sports bloopers in the US) but a great song and was a huge hit. Next is the jazzy \\"Your Latest Trick\\" which started with some jazzy trumpet before it picks up some sax comes in for a nice jazzy piece. The first side ended with the epic track \\"Why Worry\\" which is a great song both lyrically and musically.<br />The album's second side started with the experimental number \\"Ride Across the River\\" which saw the abnd experiment with African and Carribean sounds with Knopfler's tasty guitar work. Next is the folkish \\"The Man's Too Strong\\" which was a great song with tasty acoustic work and dobro from Knopfler. Next was the rocker and one of many US rock radio staples from the album \\"One World\\" which is a great number. We close the album with the album's epic length title cut which is arguably one of the best pieces the band ever did. The track would close shows on the last two tours Dire Straits did. The best live version was from Wembley 1985 where Terry Williams added some powerful drumming to the track.<br />Brothers in Arms proved to be Dire Straits' commercial triumph as it peaked at #1 on the Billboard album chart and immediately went Platinum here in the US and eventually sold six million copies sold upon its release in the US alone (to date near 10 million in US sales).

B00004Y6NT|5.0|Dire Straits' second album entitled Communique was released in June of 1979 on Vertigo/Phonogram in Europe and on Warner Bros here in the United States.<br />By the time Dire Straits recorded Communique in the Bahamas in late 1978 with Warner Bros A&R man Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett producing this go around, their self-titled debut which had a great blend of rock, blues, folk, jazz and even some Country to great effect caught on in many countries (with their native England being the last to catch on to what Holland, Germany, Australia and the US saw as rock's great new band).<br />Like its predecessor, Dire Straits consisted of lead singer/lead guitarist/songwriter Mark Knopfler, his rhythm guitarist brother David (who would leave in 1980), bass player John Illsley and drummer Pick Withers plus session keyboard player B Bear. Those who put this sophomore effort were in for a treat (as I found out one day when I finally acquired the album in January of 1998 (although was familiar with \\"Lady Writer\\" as US radio played it alot).<br />We begin the album with the epic \\"Once Upon a Time In the West\\" which starts with Mark's stellar guitar work which gives way into a great mid-tempo rocking number. \\"News\\" is next and another great mid-tempo track with excellent electric guitar work. Next is \\"Where Do You Think You're Going\\" which is a great number with some piano work and starts out in a slow tempo before it ends in a faster tempo with some fiery guitar work. The first side ended with the album's title cut which was a great mid-tempo rocker with a catchy chorus and a great riff.<br />The album's second side started with the hit single \\"Lady Writer\\" which is a great rocker. This was the put Dire Straits on the map and made the band huge here in the US. Next is the shuffling \\"Angel of Mercy\\" which was another great song with a great riff and superb chorus. We follow with \\"Portobello Belle\\" which was another great song. \\"Single Handed Sailor\\" follows and is another great number. We close the album with another five plus minute piece called \\"Follow Me Home\\" which was another phenomenal track.<br />Communique peaked at #11 on the Billboard chart and went Gold here in the US with 500,000 copies sold upon its release. Sales aside, Communique proved Dire Straits were to be no one-hit wonder.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ose the album with another five plus minute piece called \\"Follow Me Home\\" which was another phenomenal track.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I have the Samsung BD-P2550 with current firmware.    First off, having no menu before the movies is ok, but disconcerting.  Problem is that the disc defaults to Dolby DTS no matter what.  They have True-HD tracks as well, but selecting it is totally NOT user friendly.  On my Samsung, for the first movie, I had to press the \\"Audio\\" button on the remote.  When I did, a small selection menu appeared at the top of the screen where I could select language and coding tracks.  BUT, on Animatrix, the \\"Audio\\" button would bring up that top menu and I was not allowed to change the track!  I had to press the \\"Popup Menu\\" button, which showed a small menu at the bottom of the screen.  The only selection that made any sense was \\"Languages\\".  When I explored that, I found I could select the different tracks.  So how friggin stooopid is this?  Imagine if my parents, or even just an average Joe had to figure this out?  How great would it be to have the designers subject to interesting punishments based on how easily (or not) an average user could view the movie at optimal settings?  :)    So this alone makes me annoyed enough to give it 4 stars rather than 5.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Dire Straits' fourth album entitled Love Over Gold was released in September of 1982 on Vertigo/Phonogram in Europe and on Warner Bros here in the United States.<br />By the time Dire Straits recorded their fourth album, Dire Straits became a five piece spearheaded by lead singer/lead guitarist/songwriter Mark Knopfler plus bass player John Illsley, drummer Pick Withers (who would leave the band at the end of 1982), guitarist Hal Lindes and keyboard player Alan Clark (who would stay with the band until their unexpected 1995 retirement). Once again, Mark Knopfler produced the album with Bruce Springsteen engineer Neil Dorfsman engineering at The Power Station in New York City. I was in for a treat when I first acquired the album on CD in January of 1998 (although I was familiar with \\"Industrial Disease\\" as US radio played that song a bit).<br />We begin the album with the fourteen and a half minute plus epic \\"Telegraph Road\\" which starts with synthesizers, National Steel acoustic guitar and piano before the band comes in for an epic which is arguably one of the best songs ever made. Whoever said progressive rock was dead in 1982 must have forgotten to tell Mark Knopfler as this epic had musical changes which go from slow to mid-tempo back to slow to a fast shuffle at the end. Also Knopfler's guitar solos here is probably the best he ever did with Dire Straits. The first side ended with the British hit single \\"Private Investigations\\" which starts with synthesizers and piano and featured some of Mark's best acoustic guitar work. There's few vocals on this track but the music is phenomenal, especially when Illsley's bass thumps signal the second half.<br />The album's second side started with the rocker and the big rock radio single here in the US \\"Industrial Disease\\" which is a great rocker and was a huge rock radio hit here in the US. The track would foreshadow the direction that its next album would take but a great rocker nevertheless. Next is the album's title cut which is a nice ballad with a great piece of music (Knopfler's acoustic and electric guitar here are superb), especially the ending with some great marimba work from Mike Manieri. We close the album with the near eight minute rocker \\"It Never Rains\\" which was the heaviest album closer the band ever did although the song starts quiet and ends with a bang.<br />Love Over Gold peaked at #18 on the Billboard chart in 1982 and eventually went Gold here in the US although it tanked upon its initial release. Sales aside, Love Over Gold was Dire Straits' finest hour.<br />In 1996, a remastered CD was released in Europe. Then the same remaster (done by Bob Ludwig) was released in the US in 2000 but with all of the original vinyl LP artwork restored (which it was not with the European Universal issues of the album).<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!a nice ballad with a great piece of music (Knopfler's acoustic and electric guitar here are superb), especially the ending with some great marimba work from Mike Manieri.

031606792X|1.0|I am an avid and, for the most part, uncritical, reader.  I enjoy books for what they are.  I decided to read Twilight knowing that it was a teen vampire romance novel.  (I am a high school history teacher and I kept confiscating so many of the books during class that I figured they must be pretty good.)  So although I found Bella rather whiney and annoying (I'm personally not much of a romantic either, so that factored in), some of the other characters extremely flat - I mean, yes, I get it that Charlie is a small-town sheriff who can't possibly understand Bella's angst, but does he really just watch \\"the game\\" every night? - and the writing sophomoric, the story itself was compelling and I was really interested in what happened next.      Then came New Moon.  OH MY LORD!  I don't know how many times I had to restrain myself from throwing the book across the room!  Just shut up about the \\"pain\\" - if I never see that word in print again it will be too soon!  I managed to plow through it and get to Eclipse.  By that time I was almost completely disgusted with the anti-feminist nature of the book and virtually every, single female character.  I read it the way people drive by car wrecks - I didn't want to but I couldn't help it.  And then I got to Breaking Dawn.......    During a screening of Gone With the Wind - my all time favorite book and movie - a Civil War historian said that Scarlett's costumes were so awful that the Paris designers should retire to a cave for prayer and fasting. That is exactly what poor, poor J.K. Rowling should do until people stop comparing the utter drivel that makes up these four books to her Harry Potter series.  I won't bother to restate all the awful things that other reviews have discussed here - breaking her own canon, the awful writing, the insane plot that where nothing really happens anyway (which is so bizarre).  It is just so frustrating to me that a series which started with such a compelling story - and could have been fascinating - turned into a a vampire version of the Stepford wives.  I have three real problems with the books.    1. Every single female character in this book is completely defined by her relationships with men and/or her children.  Not one of them has any other motivating factor for anything they do.  (Maybe Alice and Bella's friendship - but that's it)  Esme commits suicide because her baby dies, Rosealie's desire in life is to be the perfect hostess and mother in her perfect McMansion, Alice is placed in an institution (hers could have been the most interesting story but we never hear why), Bella moved to Forks so her mom can run off to be with her ball playing husband, Jessica wants to date Mike, even Victoria is motivated by revenge for the killing of her mate James.  Good Lord!  And don't even let me get started on the \\"wolf girls\\" and the whole imprinting concept.  Or the fact that Bella's dad all but congratulates Jacob for forcing her to kiss him.  Ick!! Ick!! Ick!!  Don't any of these women have any kind of outside interests at all?  What are they interested in?  What do they do all day?  I overlooked Bella's lack of interests or interesting qualities in the first book because I assumed (wrongly, obviously) that she would develop more as the series progressed.    2. Ms. Meyer never truly shows us just WHY Edward and Bella love each other so deeply.  Yes, we all know that he is BEAUTIFUL and that she is adorably klutzy and smells amazing.  So..., um, is that it?  I mean, really?  What do they like about each other?  The only thing they ever talk about is their undying, everlasting, immortal love.  Damn!  You all are IMMORTAL - I'd find another topic of conversation or it's going to be a looooong millineum.    3. The writing is really not very good.  In fact, it's trite and melodramatic.  Again, I overlooked it in the first book - especially as this was a story of \\"no one understands us and our love\\" teen angst - assuming that it would improve as the series wenton.  IT GOT WORSE!  Seriously - someone should create a drinking game based on these books.  Every time someone growls, groans, cringes, makes a noise in the back of their throats, glares, dazzles, sparkles, everyone has to take a shot.  Everyone at the party will be passed out in the floor before the end of the first chapter.  Double shots everytime Bella falls down, mentions Edward's eyes, or how cold and smooth (but always BEAUTIFUL) his skin is.      This whole series is a waste of a great opening story/idea. I wish Ms. Meyer would give the whole thing to an author who can really write and see what happens then!!      Edited to add:  Ms. Meyers - I am disgusted with both the fake, 4 sentence reviews of the Twilight novels that immediately appear if one of the books threatens to fall below 3 or 4 stars.  I also consider it cowardly that there is no way to contact you on your website or otherwise and that your brother \\"protects\\" you from \\"hurtful\\" criticism.  At least you practice what you preach when it comes to big, strong men taking care of weak, wilting females.  Real authors let their work speak for itself and don't assume that everyone who criticizes it is somehow personally attacking them.  Your attitude is as immature as your writing.
006135323X|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Easy to relate to whether you're a marketing professional, or just the average consumer. The patterns are true and the book does a great job illustrating the research and coming up with lots of great real world examples.    I pulled off the expectations stunt with a friend right after reading the book. He came over and wanted some scotch on the rocks. I poured it, handed to him, and he asked what it was. Told him it was 21-year Glenlivet (does that even exist?). He drank nearly the whole thing commenting on it's smoothness, taste, etc. Then I went into talking to him about this book, especially the expectations chapter. Tee'd it up perfectly when I told him he had actually just been drinking J&B Scotch from the 1.5 liter bottle. All of a sudden he wasn't so thrilled with the taste. Made some comments about how it was off a litte. Sure!     Anyhow, great book. I plan on reading again and mapping out how it plays out in my life. at the very least I will use it to convince my wife that the entry level Porsche Cayenne is perfectly fine for us and she doesn't need to get the Cayenne S or GTS.    Shalom!

0316017922|2.0|I'd give this a single star, but the creativity of the subject is enough to warrant at least two stars. Plus everyone seems to discount one-stars as vendetta reviews.     In fact, I should have listened to the 9 page one-star review that I read before buying this book for my Kindle. It is NOT worth it.    90% fluff, and the ideas themselves are weak at best.    The best chapter is the aircraft accident dissection, but even that is not related to the topic of the book, it is a \\"distributed cognition\\" subject - something better left for another book altogether. Oh wait, that has already been written, Professor Ed Hutchins' \\"Cognition in the Wild\\"    Save your time and money (I'm even going to get my $10 back from Amazon).
0545128285|4.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a great addition to the Harry Potter family. On the same level as Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages adds in a bit more background information to the world of Harry Potter. Of the three books, I found this one the most interesting. I went into this hoping for some fables and fairy tales and that's exactly what I got. I only wish that there had been more, a nice chunky volume of tales! Now that would have been perfect!<br /><br />Of the 5 stories, my favorite was The Fountain of Fair Fortune, thought they were all interesting. Enhancing the stories are Rowling's own drawings and Dumbledore's commentary. I think this is definitely a fun book for anyone that loves Harry Potter and a great introduction to the world of Harry Potter for a new reader!

Just the same old bromides and banalities without any real analysis or opinions; cookie-cutter platitudes designed to gratify the masses. Am unsure how this new president-elect has stirred up such enthusiasm from reading this book.
B001ER4CSO|4.0|Today is my 19th Birthday and I received this as a Birthday present! I thought it was really good and just as good as the first! This time, Hellboy and his crew has to stop a Prince from raising the Golden Army and taking over the world. Abe falls in love with the Price's sister. I highly recommend HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY!!!

1580176941|5.0|My husband gave me this book for Christmas because I was venturing into making decorated holiday cookies for the first time ever.  I haven't been able to put it down.  It's very informative, full of many pictures of cookies for great inspiration, and delves into much more than just the decorated cookie.  Detailed advice on how to pack and ship your creations too.  #1 so far, as I've purchased two other cookie decorating books.
0446402389|5.0|Yes, it should be compared with Martin Cruz Smith's novels of inspector Arkady Renko in a good way.  Child 44, like Gorky Park, is more thriller as literature and blows away the typical bestseller thrillers (the ones you typically see in the airport gift shop) with their clumsy writing and carboard characters.  It also occupies its own space apart from the Renko books in its backdrop and the big questions it poses its protagonist.  I read this eagerly and well into the morning.  Highly recommended.
0446581348|3.0|I'm a long-time Bobbi Brown fan, I wear her make-up daily, and have given her other books as gifts.  Sadly, this book is a disappointing hodge-podge of material.  The photography of the individual techniques doesn't show methods clearly, and nearly every model looks like she's wearing fuchsia blush!  There are endless displays of BB products, but very little that will help the individual reader develop an attractive and polished look.    However, if you are starting out as a make-up artist, the book includes a huge section for this, and you might find it quite helpful.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|(If you have not seen Season 3 of Veronica Mars and despise spoilers don't read this review.)    Veronica Mars Season Three begins with a new title sequence and a remixed title song.  One of the things that has stayed true with Veronica Mars this season like season 1 and season 2 is the first episode they establish the characters and the big mystery of the season.  However, unlike Lily Kane's murder in season 1 and the bus explosion in season 2 there is more then one big mystery.  There are three in fact.  The first involving a series of rapes and buzz hair cuts to drugged women.  The second the murder of the Dean of Hearst University Dean O'Dell and a minor big mystery of who captured on DV Tape Veronica screwing her boyfriend.  One of the things I liked about this season is how much Kristen Bell grew as an actress and how much Veronica grew as a character.  Veronica soon realizes thanks to the Lilith House a group of feminists of greek house haters that the greeks might be all the things she totally opposes; that doesn't give the women of Lilith house the right to witch hunt an entire group.  One thing I find interesting is the almost lack of mention of The Kane family.  Neither Duncan nor Lily are hardly mentioned in season 3 although in the series' finale (which to me didn't seem like much of a series finale because Rob Thomas the creator of the series didn't know if ThE CW dump was going to cancel his series or not.) we see a robe wearing Jake Kane who  truly looks like Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs complete with facial hair; who I can only assume has broken up with his harlet wife Chelste and lives alone with his man servant Kane Software head sercurity guard Clarence Wiedman.  Jake looks like a man who has lost everything and has a reason to think that.  With the murder of his daughter and not knowing where his son Duncan is after the events of his disappering in season two with his daughter.  The season had some strong episodes even if a lot of them werefiller episodes.  The one thing I had a problem I had with this season is like I said the last episode.  You get the feeling Veronica will be all right and where she and her father stand and her relationship with Logan Echolls and that she'll be all right.  However story lines are wide open and the audience doesn't know  what will happen with Veronica and her friends and family.  I guess that is up for fan fiction websites and disccussion groups online to hash out.  I still think with the promotion and timing Veronica Mars would have been as heralded as Buffy The Vampire Slayer not just by critics but by more people.  I still think Kristen Bell would not have gotten the slot on [[ASIN:B001HL06H8 Amazon.com Exclusive: Heroes Blu-ray Franchise Collection (Season 1   Season 2) [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B001C0JCBK Forgetting Sarah Marshall [Blu-ray]]] if Veronica Mars didn't open the doors for her.  Shame Veronica Mars addicting good dramatic television.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr Horrible, played by Neil Patric Harris, is a bad guy that you instantly feel for.  The hero, played by Nathon Fillon, is someone you want to slap.  Felicia Day's character is the girl they both want. It's touching, hilarious, and has Whedon's great music as a score.  Even male fans of Angel, Buffy or other Whedon classic characters will love this one.
0743289692|5.0|If ever there has been a rousing testimonial to the indomitability of the human spirit, the incomparable Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book is precisely that.  This should be required reading for all those politically correct dopes who go about saying that Islam is a religion of peace, that the Quran doesn't really \\"mean\\" all those genocidal things it says, and that women really aren't treated so badly in the Islamic world.  This valiant woman proves them dreadfully wrong, and does so with an equanimity of spirit that is a marvel to behold.  The chapter \\"Leaving God\\" is itself worth many times the price of the book, for it showcases what is possible, for the human mind, even under the most trying of circumstances--to leave behind the stranglehold of religion and live a rational life, even when one has been raised in the stultifying oppression of a religious state and culture.  The author correctly argues that, unlike what goes on in Islamic countries, in the West we have had the wisdom to leave religion out of public life and policy and government for the most part, and have moved on to the sorts of accomplished social organization only possible in a secular world, and she chronicles her own liberation not only from the seventh-century barbarism of Islam but from the \\"mind-forged manacles\\" of religion generally, as she realized soon after the religion-inspired horrors of 9-11 that she had long been an atheist at heart.  Bravo to Ayaan Hirsi Ali for forging a monument (much at her own peril, for she lives under a perpetual death-sentence from radical Muslims) not only to the cause of the freedom and dignity and human worth of women everywhere, but to the potential freedom of the human mind from religious caprice and superstition.  A must-read!
B001I82RVS|5.0|Well, it's finally here. After watching the 5-minute trailer (quite possibly the best trailer ever made, IMO) in early spring of this year, \\"Tokyo Gore Police\\" (\\"TGP\\") became one of the most highly anticipated films of 2008 for me personally. This anticipation was accentuated even more after these same filmmakers treated us to the wildly entertaining piece of bloody insanity known as \\"The Machine Girl\\" (2008), which convincingly showed that these guys give the viewer exactly what they want.    In TGP, Eihi Shiina (of \\"Audition\\" fame) is a special division of a privatized Tokyo police force who is called into action when her comrades run into \\"engineers\\" - genetically modified supercriminals who can transform open wounds into flesh-metal weaponry. Needless to say, there's much here that mirrors Shinya Tsukamoto's \\"Tetsuo: The Iron Man\\" (1989) and the weaving of flesh and metal has been cited as prominent in David Cronenberg's earlier works (of which I am not personally familiar). There are also references to \\"Robocop\\" (1987) by way of blackly comic commercial advertisements that are peppered into the film at various times.    Comparisons with \\"The Machine Girl\\" are inescapable. We get a similarly impressive opening fight scene in TGP, as well as an ocean full of blood and gore, but what impressed me the most about TGP is the pacing, which is no less than fantastic from start to finish. This is no doubt attributable to the greater presence of horror in this entry. The events in between the action are nearly as engaging as the action itself, with boatloads of cool gore effects all over the place. The character designs of the engineers is so delightfully over-the-top and perverted that it's a joy to simply watch them exist. Despite a 110 minute running time, this feels like an 80 minute film, which is a good thing.    Neither the characters nor the storyline are particularly well developed, but the goodies are more than enough to compensate. As I've mentioned in my previous user comments on movies like \\"Tom Yum Goong\\" (2005), applying formulaic \\"standards\\" to a film such as this would prove detrimental in that they would undoubtedly smother the inventive visuals that could only exist when the scriptwriter says to himself, \\"Okay, let's pack as many wild, weird, grotesque combinations of flesh and weaponry as humanly possible into one feature length film.\\" The makers of TGP do exact that. Much of the film follows the lead antagonist as he assimilates various individuals into engineers and unleashes them against the police force. More character/storyline development in TGP would have demanded a cut in the quantity of visual insanity. Trust me when I say that such orthodox methods would prove disadvantageous indeed.    The action is directed by Tak Sakaguchi - made famous by his leading role in \\"Versus\\" (2000) - and he does an admirable job. The choreography isn't as good as a Hong Kong martial arts flick, but it piggybacks off of the character designs to provide fights that have never been seen before. It's difficult to get into the specifics without spoiling the fun, so I'll just point out that the good stuff appears *after* someone has been dismembered.    This is quite simply a very cool film that should be seen by anyone who likes mutant-style insanity and ultra stylish film-making. I find that gore films are so much more fun when they're mixed with over-the-top action. I simply cannot wait to see what these guys come up with next. A resounding success.
0446693804|5.0|Well I have read 8 out of the 13 books that Sparks has out and I own all of them and I just finished this one and this is Sparks at his best. It has the Sparks trademarks with its love, drama, and tragedy. This is a true survivor story and it is one of my favorite. It really takes you into both of the characters life and it brings you to love both of them. It is a real tear jerker when it nears the end, although I would have liked to know more on the end I overall loved the book. It is one of his shorter books but alot happens in the few pages that it has and it will keep you hooked from the beginning. I as always must recommend you pick this book up if you are a Sparks fan or if you like love stories with alot of drama.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|My title may seem like over the top drama - and you may just get a little of that in this movie, but I swear, If you haven't seen this film or you've heard its childish or silly, I implore you. Give it a chance. Form your OWN opinion. Whether your 7 or 37, it will move you, make you smile, and wish Christmas could last for weeks rather than a day. From the team that brought you Superman this film had a lot of love put into it. 50 million bucks to be exact! They could have copped out and used 1980s trick photography or what was availble for CGI (not much) but the spent the good money and time to train REAL deer from (Norway?) I think?<br />PLEASE - give this a chance. I know you will love it as much as I do. Its a christmas story that's warm and charming. Best way to sum it up. Warm and charming. You wont find a man here or on any other planet who portrays the childhood myth and stories about Santa Claus like David Huddleston. His smile and charisma, look and style are perfect. This guy is a Santa a child would trust and run to sit on unlike those \\"mall santas\\" - we all know them. Dudley Moore and John Lithgow's performances enhance the film. Just a heart warming tale about Christmas. No sex, no BS - just a good family Christmas film. Now if you'll excuse me I have to go order the widescreen version...WATCH IT - I promise you and the fam will love it year after year. I sure do
0316017922|4.0|Everyone is interested in the recipe for success.  So it's no wonder that the public is so enthralled by a book claiming that anyone with an IQ of 120 can become a nobel prize winner or industry titan as long as he is born at the right time and place and is willing to devote 10,000 hours of practice to refine his skills. Genius, it seems, is vastly overated, as evidenced by the inability of the world's smartest man to succeed in a material sense.<br /><br />Gladwell selects some interesting anecdotes to support his thesis, including the Bill Gates story and the similar background of many founding partners in New York law firms, but some of his anecdotal evidence (like the relationship between ancestors working in rice paddies and success in mathematics) seems stretched beyond the plausible, falling prey to the very confirmation bias that he cautions against.  Still, this book's ringing endorsement of the value of hard work and persistence is a much-needed clarion call for a country like ours, whose citizens often have an unrealistic sense of entitlement  without the requisite sacrifice and hard work.
B001EVPBY4|5.0|I received this DVD from Amazon France this morning; and I had the most delightful 2 hours watching it. If \\"Le bourgeois gentilhomme\\" was stunning, this piece is oppulent, ravishing, elegant.<br /><br />The metteur en scene has outdone himself with the stage, the theatre machinery. the radiant costumes. And the music and singing are without flaw. The previous reviewer has said it all.<br /><br />Although this opera is called a \\"tragedie lyrique\\", the story is gripping, but not really tragic. Noble Cadmus has his comic sidekicks (his three somewhat inept companions); and Pallas Athene and Amour see to it that there is a splendid happy end.<br /><br />There are some shortcomings, not of the piece, but of the DVD (European release) - not sufficient, however, to deduct any points.<br /><br />Although the DVD comes with a small booklet on the background of the opera, there is no track list<br /><br />There is no bonus material at all. Everything you want to learn about Le Poeme Harmonique and French baroque staging, you will have to get from Le bourgeois gentilhomme<br /><br />During the curtain call, the ensemble is obscured by those tiresome scrolling credits. I would have liked to learn the names of the singers individually and also shared in the enthusiasm of the audience. Surely, there was space on the disc for 2 more minutes.<br /><br />That said, the production is a marvel. Incidentally, if you have a multi-region player, check out this DVD on amazon.fr for considerable savings.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|When I heard that Amazing Grace was being made, I was so anxious to see it.  However, when the film finally was released, I couldn't bring myself to see it, out of fear that a story of this magnitude would be trivialized, grossly misrepresented or factually twisted to infuse some bazaar and irrelevant agenda of modern political correctness.<br /><br />Amazing Grace demonstrates a reach for perfection beyond anything that could be expected in a commercial film -- brilliant and not to be missed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If considering purchasing this game, you must do it. It is fun over and over again. Game strategy changes with each game so it never gets old.
B001GQACGO|4.0|After taking a year to mature and grow into herself, Beyonce has come back full force showing two new sides of herself, with no accompanying artists or covers in tow (not even hubby Jay-Z!). Beyonce has also found a neat way to satisfy her fetish for separating the up-tempos from the slow songs--a double disk release.     Together the two discs are a collection of Beyonce's highs and lows, honest acoustic accounts of love rapidly transformed into the speaker thumping club hits that make up SASHA FIERCE.     SASHA FIERCE gives the average listener a wave of different sounds to enjoy: from the infectiously complex dance rhythms found in declaration joints such as Single Ladies & Ego, to the Euro pop influenced Radio (my personal favorite) & Sweet Dreams. Moving on to the unapologetically sincere Scared to Be Lonely in which Ms. Fierce bares her heart over a fast paced Darkchild beat to reveal that her innermost fears are not that much different from that of her listeners.     I AM... is basically the polar opposite of SASHA, and introduces the \\"real\\" Beyonce to listeners in a set of gorgeous balladry. However, each song has Beyonce crossing boundaries that have previously boxed her in as an R&B soul diva in the past. On one such track, That's Why You're Beautiful, Beyonce sings a highly meaningful adult alternative ballad with much ease, and puts her own soulful edge on the rock-tinged If I Were A Boy, a song which envisions Beyonce as the unfaithful member in her relationship so as to put her cheating man in her shoes.      The acoustic Satellites is a song dripping with depth and pure emotion as Beyonce sings about her life in the limelight. Smash Into U is a truly sweet love song I absolutely adore, and has obvious country influences, however Beyonce makes it her own by embellishing it with her own superior vocal dexterity. Beyonce takes cue from Leona Lewis by singing a charming ballad about the perfect man over a hard beat in the easily likable Halo.     One track that failed desperately was the annoying Broken Hearted Girl; I usually enjoy pieces written by Babyface; however this one is an exception as I mostly just got confused with the lyrics and bored by the melody. Another track that should have been left of the album was the ridiculously trashy nonsense called Video Phone. It makes me sad to think that such trash was left on the disc, when it could have been just as easily replaced by the unreleased gem Why Don't You Love Me, with its mind-numbingly passionate vocals layered over a pulsating drum beat, and lyrics written by Beyonce's younger sister Solange, who also penned the tongue-in cheek lyrics found on Beyonce's urban smash hit Upgrade U.     Other than the two songs mentioned above, I truly love the entire album. I found that a lot of people seem to enjoy the music found on the album, but simply dislike the sequence of songs. I suggest that such people should buy the album and then create their own order for the songs in a personal playlist on their ipods--which is personally what I do for almost every album I buy.     The overall rating for this product would have been five stars, since this is indeed a very solid effort catering to a whole spectrum of listeners, but I think the decision to release an unnecessary \\"standard\\" edition of this very same album was a very greedy ploy to pry more money out of the hands of unsuspecting customers...hence my ultimate rating is 4 stars.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|The extras on this are so amazingly bad it kept me awake all night with my rage (oh how my rage keeps me warm) so you got interviews with the actors sure you cant get them all. I see that but they babble on with such self importance and there oh so intimate knowledge of youth culture cause they where in a teen movie.  Now could they get any crew to talk about the movie maybe john Hughes? There only one lame attempt to explain the process of the production is the costume designer. Now I am sure she is great at her job but there is only so much you can here about the look of the characters.  So to make up for such large holes such as no molly, no Emilio, no john Hughes and one crew member they bring out the big guns people who have directed other teen movies. Diablo I plagiarized a South Korean movie Cody who wrote the film Juno. She just fumbles about with phrases like \\"I heard they did this.\\" All here say on her part except for her own experience of when she saw the film, which I have no interest in at all.  Others extras include them denying that there wherever brats in the brat pack in which they try to make themselves look squeaky clean and change history.  Please if your extras are this bad just don't release them.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|It sounds like Phil Spector/Motown music a bit, even the recording quality and it's all good.
0375842209|5.0|I normally wouldn't grab a book from the young adult section (or even the historical fiction section) for myself, but I am SO GLAD I did! This is a wonderful, but sad story told by Death. The setting is in Germany during WWII and it follows a young girl's journey to try to lead a normal life during the holocaust. Not being an avid history buff, it really gave me a better perspective into the history of that time. After I bought the book, I found myself unable to put it down...even into the wee hours of the morning. I finished the book in 2 days and then purchased a copy for each of my sisters. Don't be discouraged by the book's targeted audience or that it is \\"historical\\" fiction. I highly recommend this book - but beware: you may need to make the time to read it cover to cover, it is THAT good!
1595141715|4.0|This was a really great book. It is about how Clay finds these tapes about a girl he loved. It was a good book but was really sad. If you are looking for a really happy, romance book; this book is not it. I was really depressed afterwards because I really connected with the characters. Hannah is easy to relate to and knowing that nothing can save her is really sad. And the story she tells you, will break your heart.
0553260111|5.0|You should read the book (more so if you enjoyed the movie)  I actually read the book quite awhile ago and had forgotten the details, but when I saw the movie the book instantly returned in my mind and the wonderful writing in the book where we first meet Jason Bourne.    And from then on Ludlum brings you along in the great mystery as Jason Bourne tries to discover himself and who he is.  Based on his background as someone involved in extreme operations, with an obvious ability to injure and kill, he is hunted as he is also the hunter for himself.    Each page makes you want to continue reading as you want to come to a resolution as to who Jason Bourne is and what is the next step and obstacle that will come up.  A great series of books and the movies were done fairly well also.
B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|I've seen this movie a thousand times on DVD. It is a geniusly orchestrated and well directed movie, full of action, romance and aesthetic beauty.    But I will tell you I bought the Blu-Ray expecting it to be an even more breathtaking experience but was HORRIFIED from the result.  The contrast was so high I could see the pixels blinking (more like dancing) in the cloudy backgrounds and on the actors skin. It was SO distracting, I could not concentrate on the movie's content.  I tried messing around with color and contrast settings but to no avail.  Watching the same movie from my roommate's DVD seemed to have the same, if not better quality.    At first, I was immediately terrified that my TV was not compatible to my Blu-Ray player (just bought the Blu-Ray player and 300 happened to be the first BD I popped in). Then I speculated that I had bought a crap HDMI cable (it was only 5 bucks. though I had done the research to confirm which HDMI cables are good and this one was) and would have to wait another 2 weeks to buy one that was 12 times more expensive just to see if it that was the case.  Just when I had almost convinced myself that my TV's processor was too slow, logic crept in.  I popped in my Batman Begins Blu-Ray.  Crystal clear and absolutely breathtakingly crisp picture.  No contrast horrors to be seen.  I found myself watching 30 minutes of the movie (that I've seen a million times) because I was amazed by the picture quality.  Then came the deal sinker, popped in my WALL-E Blu-Ray.  The picture quality was sooooo amazing that I watched the movie three times in a row (that, and the movie itself was insanely cute and entertaining).    So alas, 300's horrible demise as a Blu-Ray was NOT an incompatible/slow TV, NOT a busted Blu-Ray player, NOT a crap HDMI cable.    It was the Blu-Ray itself.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it may have just been a bad burn but I would return this Blu-Ray in a heartbeat and just buy a widescreen DVD for my collection. A movie as good as 300 deserves better than that.
0606192166|5.0|This story of a single young woman beset with ambition, beauty, questionable judgment, and an impecunious past is crafted with imagination and attention to detail.  In a big city, Holly Golightly bounces through the very short (~110 small pages) novel among a surprisingly realistic cast of larger-than-life supporting characters.<br /><br />There's no excuse for not reading this classic.<br /><br />Three short stories round out the volume.  The first two short stories weren't anything special, but the third was very good, a touching tale of an orphaned 7-year-old living with only his elderly handicapped-since-childhood aunt as a friend.
