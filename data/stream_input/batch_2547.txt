B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I really enjoy this CD.  Great songs  I think this is one of his best.<br />Keep it coming Blake. Very enjoyable.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Before I picked up my copy of EWY last night I saw on facebook that Sylvia planned to release 2 more books. I was VERY dissapointed already. I finished the 3rd book in one day and have mixed feelings. I was glad so many of the questions from the first 2 books were answered and that Gideon and Eva seemed to really trust each other. I also love the great lengths he takes to be with her, even when he has to be quiet about it. But at the end of the day Eva puts up a fight over everything! Gideon has obviously accomplished way more than you in his life and knows how to protect himself and you, so let him! It seemed like the only time she cooperated was when they had sex for 4 hours (and really Sylvia, who the hell has that much sex? Let's keep it real).<br /><br />I felt like the book had a ton of slow moments where not much was happening, or the drama was a real stretch. Like Deanna - who cares? Why put her into the book SO much when nothing is being solved. Or Megumi (which btw is a weird name) - Eva is so bent out of shape at the end because she's sick. I'm sure there will be an answer in book 4 but no one cares about all these supporting characters. We want more G
B004J4WNL2|5.0|As an introvert, this book helped me understand a bit more about myself and others beyond the Meyers Briggs definitions (psychological and physiological!)<br /><br />The insight I gained on how society has and continues to move toward valuing extroverted behaviors was fascinating.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|It has all the best songs from all the vinyl LPs, 8 tracks, and cassettes that I have owned or still own: with no needle noise.
030758836X|2.0|Seriously? The absolute worst ending to such a suspenseful book that I thought maybe there was some mistake.  Maybe the kindle edition was somehow flawed and the end wasn't there. I kept reading past the end into the Acknowledgement section because I really thought it was continuing. Finally, I realized it really had ended. Just like that...bam! I've never had an ending to such a thrilling story be so uneventful. I can understand the good reviews for this book UNTIL the ending. You didn't know who to root for in the beginning and you were in the dark about just enough of the plot to keep you guessing and forcing you to keep on reading to find out what happens next. Finally, you're reaching the end of the book. You know the story has to be wrapped up soon because your kindle tells you that you're nearing 100% completion! Then, BAM...nothing. It just ends. =(<br /><br />Still gave it two stars for the great read until the end. Did I mention I really did not like the end, at all?!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I am a guitar player, Money for nothing is like an anthem. I bought the tape when it originally came out and played it until it broke, then spliced it and played it until all it does is squeal. Now I have the CD and it uploaded to I-tunes, Amazon Cloud, and Google Play: Life is good.
193700788X|4.0|so, no spoilers here - it seems the author has done that by now, as she's known this was coming, so did we. i think this was my favorite cover art, as Sookie finally looks conventionally pretty, in an outfit described in the book - and the artwork outside and inside is a spoiler in itself.<br /><br />that said, while I've been in the ranks of the increasingly-less-than-excited-by-each-new-Sookie-story fans, the books remain light years ahead of the TV series, certainly in terms of character consistency. and this is so true that people i meet who were initially fans of True Blood but are increasingly put off by the radical character changes - hello, Bill as ruthless King - are intrigued when i describe the books.<br /><br />so, if you haven't read the series yet, my advice is don't start here - go back to the beginning and follow Sookie's journey. she is fully the star of the books, rather than just one of the major characters of the TV show, and remains a strong protagonist to the end.
B008602KQI|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because it was different, kind of weird, but it was filled with action and a nice love story. I disliked the fact that there were children being sent to fight to their death and that only one person could win. I would like to see a part 2 though. I told my family and friends they should watch this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sooo excited bout this book and was waiting for the great wrap up. Didn't get that.  Really?  Ms. Day, you had a legion of fans that would and did follow ur books but why didn't this end up as a trilogy?  At $10 a pop, it was a great first two books but this last one was all over the place.  You made Eva soo strong in the first two and this one she is wishy washy- doesn't know if she wants Gideon??????  Really???  Upset that there are maybe two more books to get to the end of this , when where else can this go ???  You would have been better off starting a new series than stretching this out.  not a happy follower.
0307949486|4.0|I have to say that when I picked up this novel I had no idea what it was about. (I didn't even know it was a mystery). I knew it was one of THE most talked about books so of course I knew I had to see what the hype was about. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo did not disappoint. If anything I recommend this book based on the character Lisbeth Salander alone. There is no other character like her, that pierced, tattooed antisocial girl is utterly rare with a voice that is unforgettable. It was a smart move when I purchased this book and it will be a smart move for you too. Don't miss the chance to discover this character, she will teach you much.<br /><br />For a full review check out my blog: The Day Dreaming, Candy Eating, Red Haired Book Worm
B00COGXX7A|5.0|The movie has a litte bit of romance, some action, suspense and an unexpected twist at the end. I'll watch it again.
B0073TBYTC|4.0|Without a doubt, I am so thankful I picked up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and loved it so much to continue with The Girl who Played with Fire. I will be purchasing the third and final novel soon (soon as in already bought) to finish Lisbeth Salander's story.<br /><br />In spite of the novel suffering from Larsson's writing style and making it slow in parts, Larsson has written an incredible piece of work or rather- character; Lisbeth Salander. You must read this book just to come to know this character for she is a character that will sit among the greats. You should also read this novel for the social commentary element. Larsson brushes on sex trafficking and the way women are viewed in society. His voice comes alive with clarity only adding to the unfortunate fact that he has passed away.<br /><br />So if I have not already made myself clear, I recommend this book (if only for Lisbeth Salander).<br /><br />For a full review, check out my blog: The Day Dreaming, Candy Eating, Red Haired Book Worm

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Great game, solid graphics great puzzles. Only complaint is that it is very short for the price. Would love to see more puzzle games of this quality!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Gave it five stars because it has all the elements to keep me and my husband entertained for hours! We love alien shows and this one is very believable. At first I didn't like the mechanical aliens, then after the first few episodes, realized there was a lot more to that. Wow, what a twist! We also love all the different actors and how well they play their parts. I have even cried with them at times. I compare this show to Walking Dead due to the great use of suspense, story lines and fantastic use of visual effects.  Excellent!!! Can't wait for the next season to start!!!
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|Never had bought a Blake Shelton album before, now I know what I have bben missing.  Could listen to this all day then do it again. Chew tobacco chew tobacco chew tobacco SPIT!!!

Subway surfers is awesome and cool because you can get points and daily challenges. All you challengers would love this game. Hope you will find this game useful to you.  And will make you keep on playing.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|Cannot believe I have been waiting and waiting for the final book only to find out noooo it is not, so I stopped reading at around 30% and got my money back - have never been so disappointed EVER?? shame on you Sylvia Day :(  My god how can you drag it out for another two books??? not like it is a series about the different charactors - just plain crazy.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game because it keeps me from being bored and it is simple even my two year old brother can play.

B008GJV4F2|5.0|Entertaining parable about growing up and choosing to be open or closed to life. Outstanding performance by Alfred Molino as the count.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|i actually thought it was going to be campy and &#34;B&#34; butes,  it was non-stop fun.  the witches were the best bad guys.
B007REV4YI|4.0|This iteration of Bond is great.  They were passed by with the Jason Bourne series, but have incorporated a touch of Bourne with Bond to make a strong effort.

B0083Z614S|4.0|Outstanding classic read, It took me back to my younger years as a child growing up. I would recommend this read to everyone who wants to enjoy a look back over their shoulder of life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must admit, I'm not much of a reader. I'm trying to make myself do better but I find it hard to keep interested long enough to finish a book of any length. I  am not exaggerating when I say that this book held my attention from the minute I started it, till I finished it. When I was not reading it, I thought about it, excited to see what happens next. It is a great, great book. It immediately grabs you and holds on till the end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a crazy game but it is amazing absolutely amazing. I need it to get even better then the x-box 360 version.
B004L8BL64|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie. It contains humor, romance, drama. I've seen it before on TV but not in its entireity. We purchased the video download and ejoyed it a few evenings ago. The characters in the film get what they deserve in all ways...
B0056BU3I2|4.0|This review is not about the movie, which I enjoyed enough to purchase the disc.<br /><br />I purchased this version specifically for the Digital Copy that came with it.  I was looking forward to watching it on my 30\\" Apple Cinema Display, only when I got it downloaded, I found out that it is only compatible with HDCP compliant monitors, which the cinema display is not.  No where on the packaging did it mention this restriction, nor did it warn me when I downloaded the movie either.  Very disappointed.  This kind of BS is what makes people pirate the movies.<br /><br />FOLLOWUP: 7/7/13 - I contacted Universal and complained about the inability to do this.  The got back to me very quickly with an answer on how to download a SD copy of the movie.  Apparently in iTunes, it defaults to download the HD version, and for some companies, they enable the HDCP-only protection.  But the SD version isn't protected.  Apple doesn't let you know that there is an alternate SD version you can get that you can view instead.  So kudos to Universal for providing an easy mechanism for downloading their movies, but it would have been nice to have known I needed to make sure I got the SD version also.
B000SP1SH6|4.0|This movie is funny as Bill Murray is. It also teaches that we tend to repeat lessons until we learn and get them right. I've watched it before on TV and we also saw it in school in Philosophy class. It is good one.

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Love it what more can I say! I enjoy how they solve the crimes and it is not always easy or straight forth. They have to work at it and hard!
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Love reading the news items when we are away from home in the US.  The topics are interesting and can pick and choose from the different columns of articles.  Love it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|best book ever<br />Very good for life and a vampire slayer to build the wall of China with turtles hi
0679805273|5.0|Have purchased this book for kindergarten, high school and college grads.  Dr. Seuss' philosphy is a great guide for our journey through this life.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Acting, scenery, costumes, dialogue all superb.  Received first two seasons from friend and became enchanted with this series.  Also have both books.  The series is witty and also heart-wrenching.  You either love or dislike certain actors/actresses....the casting is perfect.  Interesting historical facts about the relation between the aristocracy and their staff are gleaned from the series and books.  Recommend to anyone interested in English history.
B006T5GTK0|4.0|I thought this was a very good version of the film, but I also have the VHS with Helen Morse and Bryan Brown which is great  - still an impressive story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Nice graphics, but was able to solve it way too quickly. Then I had to wait for the system to update with a new one
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series has absolutely blown me away!  I have watched the DVD several times, I will probably wear it out.  Thank you for offering it so early and delivering promptly.
B003WQT2YY|5.0|This is a very intesting movie.  I watched it about 20 years ago and wanted to watch it again.  i am glad i did.  It was very well made and the actors are exceptional.  Actually funny in parts.  Would definitely recommend it.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|Received this the day promised.  it was very good, but I prefer the version that I purchased in the late 90's.  which was titled Les Miserables, the musical that swept the world in  concert
B002A9THA8|2.0|I didn't see this in te 80's so I thought it would be fun to watch.  I can't believe this movie was so popular.  It was short and disappointing.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This is an eye-opening book!  As a 'foodie', I thought I was pretty knowledgeable about food, chemistry and the food industry...but I realize just how little I really know.  The book is absorbing and really easy to read, even while it works its way through complex scientific concepts and data, and leavened throughout with Pollan's wicked humor!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 was very good but I honestly liked season 2 better!!! This season is pretty sad but a lot happened!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Ordered this from USA as Disney completely messed up the Blu-ray release in the UK.<br /><br />I loved the film at the cinema and thought it was a great 'conclusion' to the Marvel series of films.  The Blu-ray is excellent with great picture and audio.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I loved this series!!!! I was kept on my toes the whole time!! I can not wait for the next season!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|i'm done...waited and waited for this book only to find out there is a fourth book...this is above and beyond..and now don't give a crap what happens.....authors need to STOP...draggggging out the stories just to make more bucks cause in the end you loose customers...I'm one of them....
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this as much as The Key to Rebecca, bt it's better! Kept me on my seat the whole book. I'm a big fan of WWII stories, and this is a good one!
0679805273|5.0|Purchased this book to have all of my daughters teachers to sign. Will give it to her when she graduates high school in 2021.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|A cute and addictive little game that ia challenging enough to keep you coming back to it again and again.
B00C9U9YOW|2.0|Have you ever wanted to hear a QotSA album with mostly mid-tempo or slow songs?  No, me neither. There are some okay bits on here but the tempos are just sooo slow and the whole thing just drags to me.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A touching glimpse of how humor and optimism can enrich life!  A tribute to movie making at its finest! Bravo!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this is very nice it actually wakes me up all my other alarm clocks don't wake me up and no other apps do either
B001NA6096|1.0|had great expectations for this movie after my wife talked enthusiastically about the third movie of the trilogy.<br />Haven't been able to finish it. super boring...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We enjoy the mixture of novel, romance, intrigue, and actual history. However, at the time of this writing we have not yet completely finished season two. We are looking forward to see how the authors will manage the generational progression.
0425263924|2.0|Are you kidding me?  The Amazon \\"review\\" states this is the third book in the trilogy and here I get to the last few<br />pages and don't see any possible ending coming.  At the end, there is a page by the author stating that there is more<br />coming in the story of Gideon and Eva.  I won't be buying any more of these books by an author who just seems to want<br />to keep stretching out the story to make more money.  Way too drawn out!!!  I thought trilogy meant three.
1451627297|5.0|I thought this was a great story that kept me thinking and pulled me into Jake's life.  It was fun to go back to the 50's and experience this story.  The end was a bit odd, but so goes Stephen King. Great red, best I've read in quite a while.  Original idea.
B00BLSJI80|2.0|Nothing special about this album--there seem to be just two types of songs: either the slow \\"whoa is me\\" sad ones or the upbeat \\"I'm mad at the boy\\" loud ones. Demi is using the album as therapy and it's not very creative or original. It's actually kind of depressing. It's certainly not something for pre-teens that liked her on Disney Channel. To be honest, she sounds a lot like the girl on Boy Meets World that went from singing sweet dandelion songs to singing gritty, broken-hearted \\"Shallow Boy.\\"
B005JABSB6|5.0|Purchased theses glasses to go with a new TV purchase. WOW!!! In home 3-D with these glasses, the kids love it.
B003QSJVTY|5.0|I love this movie, The cars are awesome and so are the characters. I would recommend this movie for everyone.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have the Kindle App on not only my Android tablet, my phone, I also have it on my two computers.  One is a PC; one is an Apple.  It doesn't matter where I am or what I am doing.  At any time I can switch to my &#34;kindle book&#34; and pick up right where I left off regardless of whatever device I was using and just continue on.  My favorite to read from is my 7 &#34; Samsung Galaxy Tablet.  It is just the right size to hold and turn the pages.  Any of the Kindle Readers are perfect to read from.  Now you have the choice as to what kind of device you need from just a plain Jane reader to one that can access the internet. So Kindle for Android I give it a 5 stars plus.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|The Eagles history is both informational and entertaining as it walks the fan through the evolution of the group.  It's a good value!
B00340LM8C|5.0|Carry Grant at his most charming screen self. Grace Kelly purrs her way into your very soul. The setting is grand: the French Riviera. The writing and plot is brilliant. This is one of many Hitchcock directed films that are worth seeing time and time again. Look for the subtleties in this film. The cat reveals its character from beginning to end of this delightful film. I even like the double entendre in the name of the movie: \\"To Catch A Thief.\\" Who is catching whom? Are the police catching the real Cat? Is Grant stalking and working to catch a new breed of cat? Is Grace Kelly catching Grant's character, John Robie, a self confessed jewel thief? Watch and find out the answers to these questions and more.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very good season. Definitely worth watching- plot keeps you interested the whole time! Worth the price to purchase the whole season.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe surpassed any expectations that I had.  He is such a class act, and honestly the best album by far.  He is in your face, raw, sensual,exciting, lifting you higher and higher with the prowess that he is able to invent and re-invent his own sound...remarkable CD.  Totally takes me away and for that moment in time I'm somewhere else.  That is what I think a great artist is able to accomplish.  Joe is an amazing guitar master.  I enjoyed a taste of his acoustic guitar in December in Biloxi, Ms, and then again in Jacksonville at the Florida Theater, needless to say he was awesome, powerful, & exciting as he thrilled us all with the new music.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|In Blood Song, Anthony Ryan writes of Vaelin's growth from a child left by his father to be raised by an order of fighting monks into a man upon whom world events turn.<br /><br />Why to buy this book: After I got past the prologue, most of this book was incredibly good.  As in the writing ranked up there with my favorite fantasy series of all time.  The author does a fantastic job of throwing you inside the head of the character.  I found it agonizing each time life intruded in such a way that it forced me to put the book down.<br /><br />Why not to buy the book: The prologue sets up the ending of the book from the POV of one of the protagonist's enemies.  From that character's perspective, what the protagonist does at the end was a terrible tragedy of epic proportion.  When we get to the event from the protagonist's POV, the epic event was just a small part of the battle, making the entire thing seem anticlimactic.  Overall, in fact, the ending of the book feels rushed and unsatisfying considering the awesomeness of the buildup.  Additionally, some idiot made the decision that the prologue and each interlude between parts should be printed in all italics.  To be fair, maybe the interludes added something to the story that I missed because, quite frankly, if you're going to write page after page in italics, I assume you have no desire for me to actually read it.  I ended up skipping all the interludes.  That brings me back to the really crappy prologue: besides being seemingly endless and written is a visually offensive font, it's boring and slow, and I didn't find the POV character relatable in any way.  Despite spending my hard-earned money on the novel, I almost gave up reading it when I looked ahead to find I was only halfway through the atrocious beginning.  I think that, overall, I would have enjoyed the book much better had I simply skipped reading the prologue.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I went off on the book a bit in the previous section, and, judging from all the 5 star reviews the book has received, I think a lot of people will disagree with my nitpicking.  To those people, please try to understand my disappointment.  With the well-noted exception of the prologue, two thirds through this book, I thought, \\"I've found a new book to add to my favorites of all time!\\"  Instead, I'm left with, \\"I strongly recommend it, but...\\"  4 stars.
B00992CF6W|4.0|don't get me wrong it is a great app. But it use to flicker on creative mode but now on my survival it makes random creeper and zombie sounds even though their is none around. Otherwise it is a great app
B009NY43NY|1.0|This was a horrible book. It's hard for me to say the things I have to say about this book as I have never had to give such a bad review to one of Charlaine Harris' books before now. I have to agree with many others who stated that it seemed as if it was written by someone else other than Charlaine - this was on the level and quality of fanfiction. None of the characters were written as we have come to know and love them. If Sookie had been like this in the first book, I would never have continued reading the series. And what a way to neuter Eric by turning him into a cowardly p***y who runs off with his tail between his legs to enter into what is nothing more than sex slavery. He's never been depicted this weak before, why was he now? Was it simply a lazy way to write him out of the story? And while I could have bought into the attraction between Sookie and Sam (she has always said she fantasized about him), but the way it was written - there were NO sparks evident between them in this book for this reader. I can't help but come away feeling that Sam was her fourth choice - Alcide or Quinn made much more sense. But Sookie and Sam's &#34;romance,&#34; if you can call it that, was too clinical - about as sexy as having your blood pressure taken. HO....HUM! I'm glad this was the last book, because I sure wouldn't have bought the next one.
B009NP6ID6|3.0|&#34;Babylon AD&#34; is mostly well-paced, mostly low-tech science fiction film that, unfortunately covers what has become too familiar territory.  Vin Diesel (always watchable) plays a mercenary hired to transport a young women (Mélanie Thierry) and a nun (Michelle Yeoh) across Eastern Europe and Russia and smuggle her into the United States within six days.  Soon into the journey, it becomes clear to Diesel that neither the young woman nor the mission is what it seems.<br /><br />The movie cribs plot devices from &#34;Blade Runner,&#34; the TV series &#34;Heroes&#34; and &#34;Children of Men,&#34; suffering, unfortunately, by comparison.  Eastern Europe and Russia and portrayed grim and violent.  Fortunately, the films photography is gorgeous, mitigating some of the depressing atmosphere.  All of the characters are underwritten.  Fortunately, all the performances are excellent.<br /><br />The writers really missed an opportunity to profit from the natural chemistry between Diesel and Yeoh, which certainly trumps the sexual chemistry, briefly displayed, between Diesel and Thierry.  The ending is unsatisfying, relying too much on the &#34;last man standing&#34; cliche that also marred &#34;The Chronicles of Riddick&#34; and, to some extent, &#34;Pitch Black&#34;.<br /><br />Nothing new or really profound here, which is a shame, because their could have been.

B008YI91HS|5.0|A classic movie and a must have for any movie collector. Always good to watch. Price, quality was all there.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I am impressed with how closely the show follows the book so far.<br />I'm not particularly impressed with how this book is written but most of the dialogue is awesome with it the story is very good. As someone who grew up around horses I have to cringe every time the author gets something equine entirely wrong but I managed to get around that as well haha.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I see why others have had an issue with his book. It Does seem like crap keeps falling on them like they can't catch a break. BUT! and this is big for me, I loved that actually. I loved books one and two. But in those books you had fighting and no trust and then you had separation. In this book it broke away from that theme. You get to read about how they are WORKING TOGETHER! yes there are more questions now, but isn't that was has been happening all along? *spoiler- yes the mob was a bit of a read* But still it added to the book I think. I liked hearing about Cary and his new issue, I like the friendship issues because I think it made it look as though Eva was not the only one going through issues. They only perfect Pair in the book was the gay boss. Sylvia Day wrote form the heart on this book. ON all of her books in fact. As a read what else can you ask for. I was scared this would be the last book. Since I could not find anything on that fact. At the end of this book Day says there is more to come in this series. I for am glad. Most books stop at 3 and I have to hunt down more. I am over the moon she is going on because that means her heart is still in it and she has more to say for them. I believe in her writing and so far she has given her readers what they want. We have the Drama, heart break, Love, and even in this tale the Happy ending.    Reading others post I was scared s***less to read it because everybody made it sound like this was going to suck balls! I agree books 1&2 well less drama but still how good can a book be if you don't have the hook. If she simply wrote they got back together, they kissed made up, got married and rode off into the sunset and had babies: (people said in other reviews it has 50 shades of grey fee DUH! its why we liked it): but if she wrote it that was it would 50 shades of Grey.    This is her own work and I loved it. I will keep buying this series because It was great and I hope she does not listen to all the reviews and hears those too of good praises because if she cut it off now on the cliff, for me that would suck.    It was nice to see Cross in the raw form. We only scraped the surface in the last book. in this one we really see him open up. Eva is a bit slower to see the light but that's what I loved. Because through all of these books shes been the open one. Also too willing at times. The only one putting it out there and in this book we see different roles a bit. It only adds for me. I think others didn't like seeing her as more unwilling. I do agree on the ex factor with Eva. Her sexual appeal to him is dangerous. We don't want her having doubt but in the end of the book those who have read it we know she is a strong woman to the core ( for crying out loud she takes on cross everyday) and I think she will take care of the ex rocker.    But what people are forgetting is that her attraction to the ex is real. In real life some people are happily married and would not cheat or give up on the one they want to marry. But they still have eyes and are attracted to others or ex's. Married woman reading this series right now are \\"in love\\" with Cross. I wont Bash anybody on their views because that's how they feel about the book. I also see some of their sides. But I will not say this is a worthless book. It still has merit. I will read the next one too. She may over all to others had a flop with this one but on the next one she could pick it back up. You just never know!

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy the app. It has a variety of sounds and my whole family uses it to either just relax or to help fall asleep.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Reading for me is simple not complicated. A spelling error, a missed comma or dialog tag, well let's just say I'm just not one who cares about those kind of things. I read for the story not the grammar and if the story grabs me and has me turning pages then there is no way I am going to even pause one second for that missed comma or typo. Ms Sanders YOU GRABBED ME & PULLED ME IN!!!!<br /><br />I loved the flawed characters and the complexity in the relationships Megan shared especially with her brother. It was a great story involving personal tragedy and overcoming abuse. I love the idea of starting over and getting second chances in life and I will definitely be reading the next book.<br /><br />Great job and I would definitely recommend reading \\"Finding Pride!\\"
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I had never played before and my 6 year old granddaughter showed me how...I love it.  There are so many different levels and different games, that it really makes it fun.  If you get tired of one, just go to another one.  I would recommend this to anyone.

B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I have been considering getting an iPad simply bcos I thought I couldn't take down notes with my kindle. This app is truly a life saver plus the fact that I can store the notes on evernote. I haven't figured how to use the stylus yet but even at that, am happy with typing cos am fast at it.  It's indeed a money saver plus makes my kindle more valuable
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I had been really enjoying Eva and Gideon's romance with the first 2 books and I was eagerly awaiting the release of Entwined with you.<br />I was so happy when I saw it in my kindle yesterday as I had a day off and could spend all day reading it in Central Park but sadly I didn't find it as intriguing and captivating as the first 2 books. I feel like it lacks the suspense and passion the first 2 books had and it ends suddenly when it was starting to get really interesting. I still think you should read the book if you enjoy this romance story but I definitely hope Sylvia Day has some explosive revelations for book 4.<br />I will be waiting for it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I find this app extremely useful for taking down my church notes instead of carrying books or several android tabs around.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Technically, this book doesnt need yet another 5 star review, but it deserves every one that it's gotten. Usually I dont write 5 star reviews. While there are certainly books that deserve them, when Im reading reviews, I look at the negative ones first to find out what people disliked and try to decide if that's something that would bother me. 5 star reviews all too often follow the lines of \\"OMG this was awesome awesome awesome\\" with little to no _why_. If Im writing a review, it's because I want other readers like myself to understand what I liked and why I felt that way.<br /><br />Im breaking all of my rules at once here. There are already a ton of reviews detailing how and why (and 5 star'ers at that, swoon), I just wanted to add my thanks (\\"OMG this was so awesome\\") to the growing list of raves. If this was the last PsyChangeling book (I havent looked, but many loose ends were tied and statuses changed), it's a stunning finale to one of my favorite series. Thank you, Ms Singh, for gifting us this.<br /><br />PS - I cant believe all you other reviewers who fought against liking Kaleb! :) Ive had a soft spot for him ever since he helped Max and Sophia, when he really started to show as more than a two-dimensional character. Judd and Brenna's book had been my previous favorite but... sorry Judd. You'll always be in my heart.. just not the top spot anymore.

B000NY12CI|5.0|A landmark autobiography that helps the reader understand the tribal system in Middle Eastern countries.  Further, it provides a first hand account of what it is like to live in a Muslim family, why Muslim schools teach children NOTHING about the modern world and why Muslims who relocate to Western democracies are frequently unable to adapt to the Western culture.  Highly recommended as a primer for Americans and Europeans seeking to understand Islam and why Western Democracies MUST REQUIRE Muslim immigrants to accept the rule of law in their new country.  Western Democracies MUST NOT AGREE TO THE ADOPTION OF SHARIA LAW UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!

Great, steamy &#34;Gideon&#34; sex, lots of &#34;little&#34; and &#34;big&#34; surprises to keep the story interesting. I loved the story. My only complaint was it ended abruptly.  I appreciated not  being left with a life or death cliff hanger.<br /><br />Second-  I can't wait to read more about them!  I love them.  I am thrilled it will continue. I still miss another high profile couple that was part of a trilogy and would love to read more about them.  So, the way I see it is our lovely Ms  Day is just giving us more of what we love.<br /><br />Third- I don't get all of the complaining!  It's not like she only wrote 100 pages and then left us hanging. She wrote a FULL NOVEL and luckily, she's going to write another one. So hush it!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I didn't think the game sounded very entertaining after reading the product info, but after I bought it I realized how fun and addicting the game was.

0792839749|4.0|I bought this as a gift,but apparently it was enjoyed by the recipient. I had seen it before and can recommend it as a somewhat dated family film, although nowhere near as good as the book it was based on.

B008JJM88Q|4.0|This is a fun &quot;mind reading&quot; game that will keep you entertained as you try to stump the computer. I would have given 5 stars, but the game refuses to acknowledge any time you DO win, and it's irritating. So far I have stumped Akinator twice, with characters from Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter book series (Sasha the wolfwere and Remi Peltier the werebear; two of my favorite albeit minor characters), and after it gives up I am asked to enter the character's name so he can research it, but there is no enter or submit button, just a Home button which takes you back to the menu and doesn't record your win. Boo. But still a worthy time waster. :)
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I finished this book some time ago and am on book 2. And I must say that the show did a great job in adapting the first season. I like the interesting twists in the book in comparison to the show. A very good read.
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|Overall,  I enjoy this album. It's not quite as high energy as &#34;This is War&#34; but it still has great sound and uniqueness to it. I do recommend purchasing if you are a Thirty Seconds to Mars fan.
B00B671VYU|4.0|First off, I'm extremely happy that Lordi was able to release another album. After the troubles they've had with their drummer, plus the departure of Awa from the band, I thought they were done. I'm glad to see they were able to recruit and get another album released.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm really not a huge fan of this one. The group is obviously still trying to find their niche, their slice of the metal market that'll help them stand out, and I can appreciate it. I just feel that this one didn't quite get it. I fell in love with the sound from their old albums - Monsterican Dream is by far my favourite - so I'm a bit bummed to see them leave that style. On top of that, I feel that this album marks that point in every band's life where they realize they can use curse words, and they abuse the heck out of it, which I'm not a fan of. \\"Sincerely With Love\\" is extremely guilty of this. Some people won't really have an issue with it, I'm sure. That's just sort of a peeve of mine.<br /><br />As for the music itself; as mentioned in other reviews, it's very keyboard heavy this time around. Sort of like Deadache and, to a lesser extent, Babez For Breakfast. They play some peculiar guitar riffs that sounded iffy at first, but started to grow on me after listening to em a few times. Mr. Lordi himself sounds great, as always. He delivers a strong performance throughout the entire album. Lyrically, some of the songs are pretty solid, despite my above complaint.<br /><br />Would I buy this album again, knowing what's on it? As a huge Lordi fan, yeah, I would. It's...very different. Some will love it, some will hate it, but it's worth listening to all the way through at least once, even if you end up disliking it compared to the older albums.<br /><br />August 9th edit: I've listened to this album a few more times, clear through, and it's starting to grow on me. There are still a few songs that I don't care for, but some I'm starting to outright enjoy. I say again, Lordi fans, you should make sure you get this one. You may fall in love with it.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|One of the funniest ever.  It moves at a brisk pace and you have to listen to what is being said.  Classic expressions and family dynamics that everyone could possibly relate to.  Bradley Cooper should have one the award, but it will be a while before Daniel Day Lewis will be upstaged. Jennifer Lawrence was just simply the best!!!!  I wonder if she was basically having a ball just making that movie. And, Robert Di Nero doesn't let you down either.  His character was fabulous.  And, all the other people in that movie pulled it off. Everyone was nutts.

B00CRW2066|3.0|\\"Trouble Will Find Me\\", the eighth studio album from the Brooklyn based The National, is beautiful and melancholy. Fans of the band will love the trademark sounds of Matt Berninger's baritone vocals over the somber sounds of the Dessner and Devendorf brothers. The flip side is that \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" isn't going to win over any skeptical listeners.<br /><br />Matt Berninger knows how to portray universal emotions, primarily through his poetic lyrics. \\"Sea of Love\\" the first single off of \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" feels personal and true as Berninger sings, \\"I see you rushing now/Tell me how to reach you/I see you rushing now/What'd Harvard teach you?\\". The theme that you have to live life, rather than read about it, is present throughout the album especially on the bitter track \\"Graceless\\" and the timeless \\"Fireproof\\". \\"Don't Swallow the Cap\\", the album's most memorable track, offers an upbeat and defiant tone, as Berninger proclaims \\"If you want to see me cry/play \\"Let It Be\\" or \\"Nevermind\\".<br /><br />The difference between \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" and an album like Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" is range. \\"Nevermind\\" has range of emotion, range of tone and most importantly musical range. The National strike one chord and they stick to it. This would be a great album if you have just ended a relationship or someone close to you has died, but for listeners who are getting ready for sunshine and summertime, it feels long and exhausting.<br /><br />The National are good at what they do, writing sorrowful songs that can bring emotion out of the coldest of hearts. \\"Trouble Will Find Me\\" is skillful and stylish making it perfect for a raining day but it's the sunny, happier times where you might want put it away and to listen to some Daft Punk instead. http://veggiefansmusic.blogspot.com/

B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age are back and darker than ever with their sixth studio album. \\"...Like Clockwork\\" is whiskey soaked, sex filled rock & roll. In other words, it is a breath of fresh air in a time when most \\"rock\\" bands are focusing on fashion and celebrity while they sell us watered down crap. Josh Homme is better than ever and this time he brought some friends along for the ride. Dave Grohl, who has previously worked with QOTSA on \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" and with Homme and John Paul Jones in the supergroup, Them Crooked Vultures, provides the drumming on the bulk of the album with Trent Reznor, Elton John and many more lending a hand on various tracks.<br /><br />\\"...Like Clockwork\\" explores the idea that humans are animalistic, with dark instincts that lead to chaos, darkness, and a dangerous variety of fun. In the heavy hitting, relentless track \\"My God is the Sun\\", Homme howls, \\"I don't know what time it was/I don't wear a watch/So good to be an ant who crawls /Atop a spinning rock\\". \\"If I Had a Tail\\" is dark and menacing with a sexy shuffle beat reminicent of the \\"Era Vulgaris\\" track \\"Make It Wit Chu\\", while Homme ponders all of the deeds he would do if only he had a tail.<br /><br />The relationship between highs and lows are explored throughout the entire album. Beautiful piano pieces like \\"The Vampyre of Time and Memory\\" and \\"...Like Clockwork\\", a track that could easily fit in on a Radiohead album, are intertwined with gritty, loud guitar heavy tracks like \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\" and \\"Kalapsia\\". Elton John and Trent Reznor collaborated with QOTSA on the track \\"Fairweather Friends\\" and they are able to enhance the song without stealing the show.<br /><br />The video for Kalapsia, animated by British artist Boneface, begins with the text \\" Kalopsia is a condition wherein things appear more beautiful than they are\\". Most of us seem to have this condition when it comes to our view of the world. We look through rose colored glasses rather than actually takingaction. On \\"...Like Clockwork\\" Queens of the Stone Age remind us that we can change the negative entrapments of society, by removing ourselves from the unspoken rules that we all follow. Maybe I'm over thinking it and the overall message is that being bad feels so good. Either way, \\"...Like Clockwork\\", is the best rock album that has come out in years.  http://veggiefansmusic.blogspot.com/
B0090KZDSK|2.0|Sigh, I miss the day when a book had more then just endless sex scenes. Over and over and over and over.... I got to the end and I scratched my head and had to ponder wtf actually happened in this book.<br /><br />It feels to me like she is writing for the masses rather than writing for herself and her characters journey. Maybe it's just me, but it felt almost over kill and written for the sex hungry, and not the thought provoked.<br /><br />Nothing worse then when characters that are strong, sassy and sexy turn into blubbering lovey dovey mushy crap. This whole crying all the time and blubbering, it's just not the type of thing I want to read.<br /><br />Have a moment of vulnerability and rawness between two characters, but to have them so often almost destroys the sentimentality behind it.<br /><br />To me it felt like a filler book. It also felt like SD needs a really tough editor.<br /><br />I'm honestly surprised it was so terrible. I had high hopes and was actually really really looking forward to it. Don't know what happened, but it failed a great author and a great story. Sad really.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First off, Yes I too was dissapointed witht the release day being so far ahead and It sucks that I have to wait another 7 months for the next book.  Buy hey I guess that is my fault for reading this one in 1 day.  I love crossfire novels!!!! The drama is what sets it aside from all the others.  I am glad it didn't end with a quick wedding and baby, she is exploing getting to know these characters more and for them to come from where they were in the 2nd book and then bam a happily ever after would be a sham.  Sylvia is leading us through their journey and bringing them together by working together instead of running from each other.  It is amazing. I was never one for books but these types I love.  What can I say I need a litte drama in my life.  And this book also I loved getting to see the stronger side of Eva and her taking care of her man! Also understanding the other characters and having them put in their place is great.

Get over it already and start letting Gideon show you off. As for Brett she needs to stop any communication with him at all he is just causing unnecessary problems. This book seriously should have been the end but since it isn't it could have had a better ending. She could have atleast ended it letting us know what to expect from the next one. Just reading this ending gave me no desire to read the next book as much as I love their story I am happy just knowing they are married. Chances are that I will not be spending another 9.99 to read anymore of this story make it 2.99 and I might.

0307950689|3.0|The Lost Symbol is by no means a bad book by itself, but it doesn't really compare to the Robert Langdon stories that preceded it IMHO. To me it seems this book is trying to compete with other 'historical' stories, such as the National Treasure movies, and that's unfortunate considering Dan Brown made a name for himself within the historical/religious mysteries. The story for TLS is a genuinely interesting one, it's just the execution of it and anticlimactic ending that could've used some editing. Although this book is about five years old now I still feel the need to give a SPOILER warning:<br /><br />There was a significant amount of unnecessary information here that could've easily been omitted. If the dreck were removed the book probably could've been cut almost in half and the story would've been twice as captivating. Furthermore, most of the characters behaved either very stereotypically or quite ineptly; like they were just going through the motions. Even Langdon, who is supposed to be a brilliant professor and has been in more tense situations than those presented in this book, acted like a caricature much of the time. His reluctance to simply react to what's going on throughout most of the book slowed the pacing to the point where it became difficult to continue at times.<br /><br />While there were a number of questionable plot threads in TLS two things in particular stood out to me as just plain unimaginitive; which was the involvement of the CIA and the motivation of the antagonist. The villain records some public officials in some contextually embarrassing circumstances and black-mails the CIA into helping him. The problems this creates are manifold: First of all the CIA is neither law-enforcement nor military. Sure they participate in such matters on occasion, but they have no real investigative authority or jurisdiction beyond their primary duty of collecting and analyzing foreign intelligence. Secondly, no government agency is responsible for protecting the reputation of their officials, least of all the CIA. The information the villain threatened to release is also in no way a national security concern, and could be easily rationalized, so if Brown felt compelled to add another angle of suspense how about actually doing something useful out of the noetic science stuff he introduced and did nothing with?<br /><br />Then we come to the main antagonist of the story; whose identity was so obvious I stopped reading his chosen name about a quarter of the way through. The issue I had with him was that his whole vendetta could've been avoided had the events during his 18th birthday and inside the Turkish prison been written logically. Apparently, when a Solomon turns 18 he/she is given their portion of the family's inheritance, so he/she can choose their own path. However, the Freemasons' most valued artifact should have NOTHING to do with a family's inheritance, especially for someone who is both uninitiated and immature, no matter who the father is. Without knowing about the pyramid, Zach would've stayed 'dead'. I also doubt that his inheritance would be large enough for a couple years of debauchery in Europe before getting arrested, living very well in Greece for six years, and ten years forming his plan without a source of income. Then there's the extreme implausibility of him reaching the highest level of the Freemasons in just a few years, as well as having a prison cell within ear's shot of warden's office or even guard's desk.<br /><br />Despite all these criticisms, and many others I'll leave to my fellow commenters, this book was still an entertaining read, and it goes by very quickly once you get past the VERY slow start and are prepared for the dry, overlong ending following the climax of the story. If you enjoyed the first two Langdon adventures, or Dan Brown's novels in general, then chances are you'll like this one as well, but I recommend getting the book used or from the library.ing the reputation of their officials, least of all the CIA.

B004UID2LC|1.0|Pros: Free<br /><br />Cons: Flat doesn't work.  I installed this on my Google Nexus 10 but was unable to get it to do anything.  I should have read the reviews first but I figured it was worth a shot, considering the price.  Unfortunately I was wrong as it's just a waste of time.<br /><br />Nothing worth seeing here.  Move along.  Move along.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love this album and bought it because Lady Antebellum is one of my favorite groups, such harmony. I have all of their previous albums and this one is the same high quality as the others. Has great songs throughout.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|As others have noted, many features from other platform-specific versions are missing.  I suppose I should have expected this since there haven't been any updates to the PC version I've been playing for about 3 years now.<br />This was the first \\"mobile\\" app I ever purchased, which just made the disappointment that much deeper.<br />That being said, what can you really expect for $0.99?
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I like Blake Shelton. He sings such great songs and most of them have your toes tapping from beginning to end. I like all the songs on this album.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Every song is wonderful - the price was great! I would highly recommend this CD to anyone.  Listen to it everyday!
B00CFA222M|5.0|I couldn't believe how clean this movie was. There was no naked faeries, or girl taking off her clothes to get ratings. My 15 year old daughter, husband and I loved this movie and will be buying it for the rest of my kids to watch. Maybe not the two younger since it does have some gross giant stuff. There is some violence and people do die in violent ways. Eaten by giants, falling from the beanstalk or crushed. But overall I really liked this retelling and LOVED Jack and the princess. It's funny that I normally like movies critics don't. So give it a chance!

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I really like this game, I really do, but it's so glitchy it can be hard to play at times. Would have gotten a 5 star rating if it wasn't for it.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I came across this show on accident and love it.  The lead actress plays many roles and they are all so different.  The story line can be predictable at times, but then some twist will be thrown in that keeps it fresh.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|4.5 Stars<br />~Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />Best book in the Crossfire series yet!\\" ~Under the Covers<br /><br />Where should I start with this one?  Was it hot?  Absolutely!  Was I surprised about the turns of this story?  At one point, yes.  How does it compare to the previous two?  Best book in the Crossfire series yet!<br /><br />This story sort of picks up where REFLECTED IN YOU left off.  Gideon killed a man for Eva.  He removed the threat against her life in that efficient way of his.  Cool and mechanical.  But at the same time full of passion.  Eva, though, seems to be ok with most of that and has no problem getting back together with Gideon.  Even though this time their relationship can't be public to avoid suspicion to fall back on him.<br /><br />Their sexual chemistry does not miss a beat.  If anything, their need for each other has grown into something deep and intense (yes, even more so) because of the fact that they are both now comfortable with each other enough to express themselves.<br /><br />Eva, for one, had a change from the previous book.  Where in REFLECTED she was more the quiet mouse who needed Gideon's approval for everything (almost), in this one she took charge.  She pushed Gideon's buttons, she didn't question herself as much.  She asked, or demanded more like it, for what she wanted.  She wasn't afraid to confront Gideon or to experience her life however she wanted.<br /><br />Gideon, on the other hand, was a total romantic.  Still a bit of a control freak and dominant as well, but also willing to give an inch.  It was a nice change on both of them and it was perfect to see them complimenting each other much better in this book.  The one thing that stood out the most to be was the playfulness of their relationship.  Their easy joking around while just being together.<br /><br />As usual, there's plenty of turmoil in their world and lots of things (and drama) happening from all sides.  Friends, family, fame and enemies.  All these threads collided perfectly in this book to give the story a lot of depth.  It wasn't a one dimensional storyline where there's one main conflict the couple has to get through.  This book had so much more which made it real.<br /><br />Even though this could've been written as the end of Gideon and Eva's story, there is obviously still more to come and loose ends to tie.  It'll be interesting to see them facing things at this new stage of their relationship., family, fame and enemies.

It's enthralling, all consuming, and mind blowing.  Yes, I was thoroughly blown away! \\" ~Under the Covers<br /><br />Highly anticipated books like this always scare me.  What happens if the author can't take the pressure of writing such an anticipated story and it falls flat?  What if it doesn't go the way I WANT it to go?  There are no guarantees and I was both extremely excited and extremely scared to start reading.<br /><br />Another fear of mine was the fact that knowing this book had the big Ghost reveal, this story would be centered around the Psy.  In the past, the psy-only books have not been my favorites.  They lack some of the intensity that the changelings bring to the world.<br /><br />I shouldn't have worried.  I was hooked from the very first line.  I wrote my review with names in it and then have changed them to HERO and HEROINE in case people don't want to know.<br /><br />There are some series that always have a tough leader, a guy that makes those sometimes ruthless decisions that go against most morals.  He may seem heartless but there is always a purpose to his actions.  The last one I remember that caught my interest as much was Jonas from the Breeds series by Lora Leigh.  But after that, it's been the HERO.  The HERO, who should be psy and Silent, but has so much bottled up passion he could melt you at his feet.  The HERO, who is ruthless in the pursuit of what he wants and won't leave anything or anyone who gets in his path standing.<br /><br />Then focus all that intensity on the woman he loves.  OMG!!!!!  Ms. Singh, I am in awe of what you've done with this story.  From all the layers to the HERO we get to unfold, to the story of his one true love.  This is a second chance at love story.  The girl he fell in love with as a kid and was taken from him.  Brutally.  The one he's been searching for since.  For such a hard shell on the exterior, I couldn't help but melt at the softness inside of him.<br /><br />The HERO is, in one word, INTENSE.  There's so much he has learned to keep bottled up and as that shell cracks and all that intensity spills out..... Be prepared to fall in love.  Changelings have nothing on the HERO.<br /><br />The HEROINE was also perfect for him.  The perfect balance to his intensity.  Nurturing, soft, but strong at the core.  Able to stand on her own.  Able to fight for her man.  Able to heal him.<br /><br />Then there's the Ghost.  On this subject, I'm keeping my mouth shut.  However, I will say that I found the big reveal a bit....anticlimactic.  After waiting to find out who the Ghost is for so long, I was expecting bombs going off, cities collapsing and the Ghost riding in on some white horse to save the race.  I don't know.  I wanted something epic.  Instead, we find out as almost an afterthought.  And that's all I'm going to say.  No more.<br /><br />Nalini Singh's writing has the ability to paint a picture in my mind.  Beautifully crafted words that flow and let the imagination run wild.  And for the span of time it took me to read this book, I was living it.<br /><br />I wish I could give this book 10 Stars!  Every single page of this book is packed with intensity.  It's enthralling, all consuming, and mind blowing.  Yes, I was thoroughly blown away!  This will be one I want to re-read and hold dear.<br /><br />*ARC provided by publishere's been searching for since.

B000K8EQ5W|5.0|We had seen parts of it several times and could not figure out what was going on. Now we know. We really enjoyed it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book failed to live up to the hype, however it was not a total waste of time like some reviewers are writing. UnLike many other readers I was not suprised that this book did not end in a trilogy, because Ms. Day did state on her website there could be possibly a fourth book. This being that the book is turning into a T.V. series ( True -blood- Charlaine Harris).<br /><br />The book did feel a bit repetitive as if a reader did not remember details from the past 2 books. The Sex was steamy but there is one where I was starting to questions Gideon's real sexuality.<br /><br />The \\"Ace\\" nickname has got to go. To me it just feels ill place within the reading. I've put up with \\"Angel\\" and that is as far as I am willing to go.<br /><br />Overall, it is still a series I am willing to stick with, the ending did not bother me at all( though it was abrupt). I am looking foward to book 4. Buy the book Gideon and Evas journey is still worth exploring.

B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was great, but the quality of the sound was not good. There was a constant buzzing as the movie played and because the movie was being streamed it continued to stop and restart.
B000IFQLBE|4.0|I bought that album on itunes because I didnt want to wait for it to be shipped to my house and I have no regrets. What an amazing album this is! I've listened to most of the songs and enjoy that live atmosphere because John is so entertaining. I do wish he played \\"Joy of my life\\" as it is my favorite Fogerty song (and apparently his too), but the song choices are very good. One person said that he was in a hurry to go home. Although I sort of see where you are coming from, you have to look at the number of songs that he sings in the amount of time he has. These performers cant go on all night....the stage people wont let them. he was trying to give you your moneys worth of songs...and only a few seem like they are in a hurry...if that.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have been trying to access a textbook that I received and it keeps telling me to update the software... which I have done about 5 times now and still having issues.  I tried re-installing the app too.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|This album made me a Rod Stewart fan. Im only 15 so i havent been exposed to all of Rod's music (he has quite the collection), but that album is one that I find myself continually listening to. I've read a lot of reviews of people saying that some of the lyrics are bad or cliche, but I dont find that problem anywhere. Even the lyrics that aren't great are still pretty awesome. I especially like Brighton Beach, It's Over, Sexual Religion (reminds me of the 80s), and Make Love to Me Tonight.
B0017HEX76|3.0|they don't tell you that... i guess you are able to change the language, but this was a misleading purchase.  Amazon should be aware.

B009NY43NY|5.0|Another great book from Charlain Harris.  This novel answers quite a few of the questions that have been nagging me throughout the whole series.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book by Mira Lyn Kelly.  It was a  tale of a drunken celebration ending with a morning after married to a stranger. This story moved at a fast pace, it was never boring.<br />I guess it has been awhile since I read a Harlequin, because this wad much stranger than I remember!<br />A well written story with the required HEA. I would recommend it to lovers of contemporary romance.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great novel with a great story amazing characters and a fabulous ending and I would have  to say it's a must read book
B000SJ5XF0|1.0|The record was filthy when I received it. The static pops drown out most of the lyrics and backing music.
147674355X|5.0|I can't think of the perfect word(s) to describe this novel.<br /><br />The moment I read the novel from the first page, I couldn't stop reading. I just had to keep on turning the page over and over and over until the very last page of the book. I am speechless and breathless and my mind is still exploding after reading this. No book has ever brought me to laugh and cry at the same time, except this book.<br /><br />The chemistry between Sky and Holder were just perfection. Most romantic novels I have read so far have such weak characters, but not this one. The protagonists Sky and Holder were strong characters. Even Sky (the girl) even though she had moments in the novel, she was witty and sarcastic and independent as a person, that no boy would make her weak. And Holder was just one of those hopeless romantic kind of boy, who has a little bit of a bad boy side and has a reputation, but he was smart, caring and he knew the perfect words to spit out of his mouth.<br /><br />Their Romance was just EPIC, that it actually kept me guessing for quite a while on what really happened.<br /><br />I really thank Colleen Hoover for writing this epic novel and that I just hope she keeps on writing more.<br /><br />And btw, I read a \\"Christmas Present\\" from Colleen Hoover about their FIRST KISS scene that is in HOLDER'S POV. And let me tell y'all that it will be EPIC as this novel. There was a lot of emotions from that scene in Holder's POV and I can't wait to get my hands on that novel!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its a wonderful the graphics are good to . The only thing though is i wish u did nt<br /> heave to pay for anything
B00BEXB18M|1.0|The sycophants would lead you to believe that if you don't like this cd then you aren't a true fan or you are stuck in the past waiting for part two of (insert name of past masterpiece) --- I have been a fan of Megadeth for a very long time and appreciate the twists and turns that Dave has thrown at us fans. However, what separates this cd from other albums that were not received as well, such as Cryptic Writings, Risk, TWNAH and TSHF, is that those albums had memorable riffs and solos, along with well thought out lyrics. In my opinion, these are characteristics that are completely absent on this release. Unfortunately, the standard that Megadeth had set for themselves has disappeared entirely.<br /><br />Maybe the record company put the pressure on Dave to get this out quickly or maybe the last bit of creativity is gone? Either way, this should be avoided at all costs.

B0054VVRBQ|1.0|This card is not supported on any thing remotely new. if you have an older mac, maybe, but it will not work on osx 10.7.4 or above, the drivers stop being updated it looks like in 2011.<br />That vendors are still selling this and not noting the obsolescence of the drivers is pretty shoddy.<br />There, did I get in the 20 words?<br /><br />UPDATE: updated OSX to 10.8.4 and installed the transcend drivers and it now works. I don't know how well, i just copied 1.5GB to it and then deleted, but it didn't error during the copy. Previous info throughout the internet indicated that it would crash the system. I have left the card and driver active overnight and it is still up... the thing that is nice about this card is that it is fully recessed as well as the SD card being fully recessed when it is inserted.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|While Hossein's writing style may not appeal to everyone, his stories weave a tapestry of the complexity that is Afghanistan.  I think it is healing for western people to read his works to understand that not all people in Afghanistan hate and want to kill Americans.  Their history of the past  100 years is one of sorrow, destruction, families ripped apart, yes, corruption and evil among their own people.  But it is a history filed with family love, unimaginable heartbreak, survival and my guess is a rare reconciliation and a passion for moments of tiny sparks of joy. One day I hope the people of Afghanistan may have peace in their land so that families can share the simple gift of love and safety in their own shelter.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|Did a great job weaving in the songs with the story line. Bono and Joe Cocker made great contributions to the film.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|For shame Sylvia Day.  As if paying $30 for one character's story isn't bad enough-- it isn't even finished! Never mind it was originally billed as a trilogy.  Never mind that you have pushed the release date back...  Unprofessional.<br /><br />I love Eva. I think she deserves a great story that, in the end, is tied up in the perfect bow. This book had absolutely no plot to it.  It could have been a novella if the editors took out every time Gideon and Eva said ' I love you ' to one another. The drawn out emotional conversations that led nowhere were trying and tiring. In addition, there is no further character development than the last book..  Eva is still hopelessly dependent on this relationship; Gideon is still trying to prove himself to her; Eva's mom is still controlling; Cary is still trying to have his cake and eat it too; Brett is still thinking he has a shot with her; Corinne is still on my nerves etc.<br /><br />I'm a little glad this book is getting bad reviews, because I'm so disappointed that I can't in good conscience purchase another of Sylvia Day's books.  As a consumer I feel used and taken advantage of-- and I hate that I looked forward to this book so much...
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I was really looking forward to the new Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Tour CD and was more than happy when I received it in the mail. Although many songs were excluded (Please Let Me Wonder, Do You Wanna Dance, Dance Dance Dance, etc.), the setlist was above par. I was glad to discover Pet Sounds included in the second disc! The vocals overall, are excellent, but maybe too good to be true. I seems all band members are on some sort of reverb and auto tune. Mike Love never sounded any better than this. And his voice SUCKS without auto tune. But I can't really complain, I really like how they sound. My only complaint is how they really limited Brian's vocal parts. He sing lead only on a few songs (Marcella, Sloop John B, Add Some Music, etc). Mike Love pretty much sings the rest with some songs sung lead by Al and David. But, overall, I loved the CD. I give it a full 5 stars! Long live The Beach Boys!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This seemed more of a building book. Setting up for a bigger event not as much action as the other books with several loose ends. Still good story but a little disappointed that more story lines from previous books weren't wrapped up.  Love the chemistry of the characters and am excited to see where it goes with Carey. Hoping next book won't take forever to come out and that it brings some good action and some conclusion to the complex story brewing.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I have read the book but not seen the Broadway musical. While the story is complex and the book is a comment on the political and social issues of the day, this movie choose to concentrate on the emotional impact on people's lives. The well-crafted scenes build the story and reveal the characters very well.  Hugh Jackman captured the soul of Valjean, the soul of the story, and the hearts of the viewers. I recommend that viewers sit back and let themselves be drawn into the lives of the characters and the power of the story.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really wish it would have wrapped up more story ends. But since she is putting out another book that does that I am fine! Great read.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This Crossfire Series has turned into my favorite series of books ever. I have found them all brilliantly written and well thought out.  I found myself both relived and saddened with the ending of this book, relieved to know that Gideon and Eva's story is not yet at and end and I can expect more to come but at the same time it was very saddened to be left hanging like this.  My biggest wish at this moment is that Sylvia Day does not leave me hanging for too long and that the last book will be available sooner rather than later.  I don't think that I can wait another 7 months for the next book.  The Crossfire Series is by far way better than Fifty Shades of Grey and the Stark Trilogy put together.  Simply because for me there is way more of a story than the other two series. Again this book as with the other two are brilliant and amazing and I can't wait for the next.  So do yourself a bigger favor and read them now, do not wait, do not hesitate, just read and read again and again and again.  That's what I will be doing.
B005544TRQ|3.0|Suits is entertaining, but ultimately yet another show using the USA Network standard formula of savant who pretends to be something he's not and is in danger of being found out but somehow always stays a step ahead of the game, while finding time to solve the case of the week with some loophole. The show has a much more serious tone, however, and the actors portray their roles with an unexpected depth for such a show. Some of the legal stuff is ludicrous, though, which diminishes the serious approach a bit. All-in-all, it's a thoroughly watchable, though ultimately forgettable, show.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited so long with such anticipation for this book, thinking that this love story would finally reach it's conclusion.  Bamboozled again by another greedy author and publisher.  When will authors return to writing stories in one book with an actual beginning and end.  I'm sick of being led on and bled dry and I know many readers including my book club are sick of this trend.
B004G7FFF8|5.0|I waited a long time before purchasing this item.Finally bought it and glad I did as I am now through the 7th disc and can't wait for the next. Great performance and wonderful recording...just buy it!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A fiction book about DevOps? Come on, really? Yes, and a most excellent book it is. I really enjoyed reading this tome and, at times, was not able to put it down. The characters also somehow real, you feel like you met some of them at a conference the other day. And, of course, the book does follow the classic winning model: the hero's journey. But unlike ancient myths and Star Wars saga, the heroes don't have to defeat evil, but largely defeat the evil of IT inefficiencies in their own company and themselves.<br /><br />In any case, this is a must-read for any IT professional, IT manager as well as for a business manager.

B00CL68BK2|4.0|A great story with some unexpected twists.  I would describe it as both &#34;edgy&#34; and &#34;touching&#34;  Definitely worth the rental..
B009OYSFDM|3.0|The dialogue is improving but still at times too stilted and formulaic. It would nice also if the night club seen does not dominate the storyline in the future. Where you go from the end of season one will demand creativity and wisdom with the main character.
B005BV0A44|4.0|Not my favorite Maiden album but has some classics on here. I always felt this was one of their weaker albums and never quite understood why it had such a big reputation only due to 3 songs really, Aces, Mariner, and 2M2M. Needs to be in your collection but overrated album.
B005938CS0|5.0|The first album and an absolute classic. It's great. Paul DiAnno, the original singer, has a different more punkish style than Bruce and it worked well. Some of these original songs I actually prefer Paul on over Bruce. Don't me wrong I love Bruce too but these are two different guys with two different styles and strengths of what works for them. Running Free is a good example.
B005BW0MUK|4.0|I have always felt this album was much better than it's reputation or other reviewers have said. There are quite a few very catchy memorable tracks and a definite worthy addition to the collection. I had it on replay for weeks before I even listened to anything else.
B005BW0T9E|4.0|I've seen people write negative reviews of this album and I have never understood why. Classic riffs, Bruce, memorable lyrics. It's a dang good album and should be in your collection. If you love Maiden you are going to love this album.
B0018RDP7O|5.0|This is as good as the old Maiden stuff. Right up there with Somewhere in Time and 7th Son. This is their best modern album in my opinion.
B0093F3Q4K|3.0|The audio was average at best.  Actually sounds a little fuzzy. A big minus on my system.  Enjoyed the performance though.
B00CC3KBAW|5.0|I thought this was a great cd start to finish. Such a great cast of vocalists, great music, couldn't have been better.
1452000247|5.0|Peter lives in England and is just hoping for something interesting to do.  Then one day Mrs. Kipple gives him a surprise.  He soon finds himself stepping through a broom cupboard and into another world of magic, mystical creatures, adventure, and evil.  Soon Peter meets all sorts of strange creatures--some friendly and some not--and learns about an evil witch named Cirinian.  As he continues in his adventure, Peter finds himself looking for a magic scroll and on a quest to destroy the evil Cirinian.<br /><br />I found this book to very enjoyable.  It reminded me some of Alice in Wonderland, but is different in its own light.  As a juvenile fiction book, I think kids will find it<br />interesting and thoroughly enjoy it.  Many of the characters were developed and each had their own quirks.  Though my favorite was the mouse, Mr. Twindle Twoondle.  I got lost in the story and didn't even notice the time spent reading.<br /><br />I do recommend this book for anyone who wants a light-hearted, fun read.
B002W1UEW4|5.0|The movie was action packed and very enjoyable. The story line was fresh and overall the entire movie moved along smoothly and never had a dragging moment.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved the characters, story and the history. Have already recommended it to my friends. It was a fast read and one of those kind of books you don't want to end.
B000K8EQ5W|4.0|If you like a sappy love story that makes you feel good this one is it.  It also plays with time which adds another level to it.
B004Q3UL2O|2.0|I didn't really like the storyline.  I thought it was going to be different.  It was not a feel good movie.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I'm in love with this album. I heard Lana's single &#34;Video Games&#34; back in 2011, but totally lost touch with her releases since then. I finally got around to downloading this album, and I can't believe what I've been missing out on all this time!<br /><br />Lana's voice is sultry and sexy, the complex orchestrations cater to the film score lover in me, and the beats are extremely catchy.<br /><br />&#34;Off to the Races&#34; is absolutely addicting, but it's in close competition with &#34;This Is What Makes Us Girls&#34; for my favorite on the album. As much as I adored &#34;Video Games&#34; when it released, the other songs on the album completely outshine it. It's turned out to be my least favorite track of the group, which I never expected. That's not to say I don't still love it; that's just how GOOD the rest of the album turned out!<br /><br />I've heard there are a lot of mixed opinions on Lana Del Rey, and that you either love her or hate her. I definitely fall into the former camp, and I'm not sure how anyone can hear her voice and not fall head-over-heels.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was very much looking forward to this book. I really enjoyed. I felt it was a little rushed at the end and the the story just stops. The ending for me wasn't satisfying but I'm glad there will be a 4th book. I really hope we don't have to wait too long for the conclusion of Eva and Gideon' s story.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Played it until i got 4-5 stars on every level.  Good challenges and fun game overall.  Got it as the freebie of the day
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I am a fan of Lincoln as far as history is concerned. But it was just too slow to keep my attention, and I fell asleep before halfway through.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|For a guy that's getting along in his years he is still an awesome force to not be taken lightly and those sound bites are vintage Arnold.  Bravo!
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Season one of NCIS: Los Angeles was a great introduction to the cast and characters of a great series.  If you want fun and action, this is the series.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|I could SO relate to this movie! LOVED it!!<br />Well written and well acted! It exceeded my expectations. Fun movie!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of those books that allows you to peak into the minds of that one kid that's been staring out of the window all day. It made me laugh. It made me cry. But most of all it made me think. I'm so much more aware of the people around me, and why they do the things they do. I recommend this book to EVERYONE. Absolutely my favourite book. Didn't wanna put it down. About to watch the movie. Hope it does it justice!
B004RJMUJO|4.0|downloaded as part of a promotion, good game no lag (nexus 4), so annoying banners do pop up(not adds but other crap) overall classic game
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was really quite disappointed that I had to wait nearly six months for Entwined with you.... (I live in New Zealand) so I'm not sure if this is the same for everyone else....???<br />And then I couldn't really be bothered to read the third book - because time had somewhat 'elapsed' since the second book.... but my Daughter bought me the book yesterday and I will read it because she bought it for me.... but otherwise i wouldn't have bothered.... sometimes the time in between the next book can ''drag'' on soooooo long that you loose interest.... maybe this is down to the Publisher as apose to the Author....<br /><br />But come on.... as we read one book we wont to get onto the next and so on.... if it's dragged out then i personally become 'BORED' and move on to another Author and simply forget about the ''second/third or fourth book'' from an Author.....<br /><br />I'll get back with a review on the THIRD Book in this Serious....
B005544TRQ|5.0|Much better than any lawyer show that I've seen.  The characters are great, especially Lewis, the lawyer you love to hate.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Super book.  It proves John Grisham is still hot.  I need to knnow more about the young Mr. Theodore Boone..
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I live near Southport and am enjoying the area as seen through his eyes.  &#34;Ivans&#34; is a great place and yes the people are friendly and you know everyone.  I have read and enjoyed several of his books.  Hope to read all of them.
B0009VSB06|5.0|I ordered this metal detector to keep the kids busy this summer.  I however found that the ease of use simple operation has even keep me busy this summer at the park.  I unit is a complete package with a video instruction DVD that makes hunting an enjoyable past time for kids of all ages.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It seems most of the reviewers so far are upset that this isn't the last book, so I guess that puts me in the minority.  Two of my other favorite series (Outlander and Game of Thrones) have more than three books, so I guess I just don't see the issue.<br /><br />I love this series, I love Gideon and Eva and I'm glad we got to see some more of the supporting characters in this book.  G and E really seem to be putting the effort in to their relationship and it shows.  Eva is becoming less insecure and Gideon is opening up to her.  There is a lot of unresolved mystery surrounding Nathan, I can't wait to see how that unfolds.<br /><br />I disagree with some of the reviewers that this ends on a cliffhanger.  It doesn't!  It's not the end of their story, but it ends on a somewhat happy note.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It has been a long time that I watched a movie that I found visually breathtaking but that also found me discovering and rediscovering meanings w/in meanings.  I cannot recall the last time I watched a movie twice, but I was so taken by this movie, I had to watch it again two weeks later.  An absolutely extraordinary movie...
B00005JO9J|3.0|It's ok. I bought the first season and it is a good season overall but not my type of series.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I don't get all of the angry bird hype.  It is a GAME.  It isn't even close to some of the more fabulous games I have played.<br />I really wonder how all of the attention came to be in the first place.  Stuffed flying angry birds, t-shirts, bedding.  Seriously people?<br />I haven't played it for months after I got it.  Must be a facebook thing.  I don't get that attraction either!  Please don't send me hate reviews for saying that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that mojang had really good idea because of him I build a 70story tower. That is super awesome.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I was so enraptured that I watched the first season over 2 days!<br /><br />It is like 'Weeds' with a little more umpf. I like it for some of the same reasons that I liked 'Falling Down';  You can relate to why Mr White snaps, and what he is going through.  It is dark,  but with a nice amount of teacher humor, science humor and life humor.  Mr White has a conscience, but less tolerance for the injustices of the world & less regard for the law, now that he sees that his days are numbered.  He has the motivation to do whatever he needs to to leave his family with financial security and the kind of courage you get when you have almost nothing left to lose.  Mr White is my kind of Hero!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I  love this game. My grandchildren play it all the time.  This is a good game to keep them busy.

B00C7DGRL4|3.0|Not as bad as I thought it would be.  I was actually entertained which is a little embarrassing considering the ridiculous plot.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|A little entertaining - not much more.  The father son thing was awkward at best but it was ok to Bruce in a familiar role.
B004US4K2C|5.0|I use this on my Samsung Galaxy Proclaim and it is a great theme manager. Lots of great themes and great apps and widgets.

B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Lawless was definitely worth watching - a lot of action, decent plot, somewhat reflective of prohibition era bootlegging, and even a mostly satisfying ending. It does get a little bloody though, so kids beware.
030759565X|5.0|Within 5 minutes of reviewing this book, my mom and I identified about a dozen recipes we were interested in trying. I was able to get it for $14.68 on amazon so wait for the price to go down.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|The story is eternal, Blu-Ray makes the movie that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend you upgrade to the Blu-Ray edition

0312611692|3.0|This is a long winded, hard read.<br /><br />Morris is an archaeologist who takes the broader view that his field encourages, in trying to explain why it is that the west is more economically developed than the East in the early 21st century, but he also rambles a bit too much. With his archaeological background, he emphasises the role of geography in human development, something that might seem natural and obvious when one tries to determine why and where an old lost settlement sprang up, and what nearby trade and resources it might have had, and why it declined, etc etc. Highlighting the importance of geography in human history and development I think is the right angle, as in many historical analyses people's cultural ego makes them generally under-play and disregard something so seemingly unimportant as where you are and the shape of your landmass and how this affects who you are and how the history of your country develops. However, there are also some glaring weaknesses in Morris's general discussion.<br /><br />Here is one. In describing the origins of the Industrial Revolution in the 17th-19th centuries occurring in western Europe rather than the East(a key factor in the development of the modern world) he emphases geography and states that NW Europe, and in particular the UK, was better placed geographically to develop steam and coal, and kickstart the benefits of replacing human power with much more powerful steam and coal power. They were closest to the large and innovative market of the USA, and coal was local and plentiful (But then why didn't coal-rich USA develop steam power first?-no mention of this). Wages were high and labour was relatively scarce, so there was incentive to make machines to boost productivity, rather than just pay more low paid workers to work more. But Morris fails to really mention or highlight a major and key ingredient between western Europe and the East- a culture that rewarded innovation and incentive existed in the west, but not so much in the east. The east during the times of the 17th-19th centuries generally lacked such a culture of innovation (they still do, to a point). The reasons for this are many, but include:<br /><br />The cultural environment in the east has long fostered and enforced an existing, rigid social hierarchy, and this generally discourages lower and middle class innovation. In line with this is the general lack of/weak property and copyright laws. Any lower or middle class innovation was either stolen, or at best actively discouraged, by the elite because they generally don't want to reward the lower and middle classes, as this would under-mine their social power and control ('creative destruction'). They may even want to keep locals poor, despite rhetoric to the contrary. (Foreigners are also often restricted for the same reasons, the elite don't want them making too much money from the locals, and in particular, depriving the local elite of making this same money from them. That is why in Adam Smith's day, there were only 2 ports open for foreign ships in China, and even these were restrictive). Anything that is made, discovered, or found by locals, is generally supposed to be reserved for the elite under the existing strict social hierarchy, but the elite themselves generally won't invent something, because they already have large numbers of low paid workers to do all the work required for them, within a very stable social system.<br /><br />So what point is there to for anyone to innovate and develop a steam engine? If you do actually make something useful, the elite will either confiscate it or steal it, because it will either upset the existing social system, or much worse, if it is patented and marketed by the lower and middle classes, will give the lower and middle classes money and reward, rather than the elite themselves, which is an affront to their sense of pride and honour. So there is also weak copyright and property laws. So generally, nobody invents anything, or at best, such processes are much slower and weaker. So no steam engines invented in China, despite plentiful coal. So no industrial revolution.<br /><br />(Oh, and there is another thing Morris doesn't mention at all, particularly about Chinese coal. Chinese coal was generally a long way from ports, down rivers which were sometimes wild and unnavigable, unlike the situation in Britain. Coal is a bulk commodity and as such is very sensitive to transport costs. Transporting it economically in China from where it was, to ports and people was much more difficult and expensive. This is why there is STILL so much coal in Mongolia for example, more even than in Britain before the Industrial Revolution, but which has never been mined, because it was simply too far away from anything, but that is now gradually changing, with modern communication, transport and technology. )<br /><br />In other words, Britain had lots of cheap coal, that was also nearby, AND a market system that encouraged and rewarded innovation and development, without just stealing such for the benefit of the elite or the state. The East generally didn't have these things, so no Industrial revolution. He doesn't talk much about this major second part of the equation, but having lived and worked in Asian business for several years (within the realm of natural resources), it is a key factor STILL. There is still a sense in many places that the elite should have the rights to things they don't generally do anything to make, invent, or attain, which both discourages innovation amongst the lower and middle classes, as well as keep things under-developed, but this is slowly changing. In many places those who have the most money get to say how the law operates, or they simply buy-out smaller companies to keep them from developing too much, or they transfer ownership by nefarious methods so as to steal their hard earned assets for themselves (a 'takeover', but often without accompanying compensation to investors). As said, things are slowly changing, and of course it varies from place to place and business type, but the general business environment is in some places still a long way off what is generally considered 'standard' practice in the west.<br /><br />This may all sound culturally racist and patronising, and there is of course a balance to what foreigners, for example, should be allowed to do, but getting this balance right is complicated and difficult, and locals themselves may often feel the same way. Weak property and foreign investment laws are now better, but still echo what they were in Adam Smith's day, when he stated that a culture which only allows ships in only two of its many ports is not going to get the same amount of business (and social development) when compared to a culture that allows much freer and wider trade, in all of its' ports. It's simple mathematics and geography. I know of local business people in the east, for example, who say they one can't invest in local natural resource projects, for example, unless one is connected to government (the modern 'elite'), because otherwise the government will simply steal anything you find, with the government also believing that there is essentially little wrong with this. (An echo of the old cultural/ social mentality, that everything of value should be exclusively reserved for the 'elite'). I also know of local elites, who won't allow or strongly discourage development, research, or change of any kind, in areas they control, because it would undermine their considerable social authority. In other cases, development is allowed, but the only ones allowed to develop anything are the elite themselves, however they might not have the technology or assets to develop the things in question, so nothing eventuates. All this is hardly a recipe to encourage and reward the lower and middle classes, and encourage innovation, and the key factor is more often than not an existing, rigid social hierarchy, with the associated belief that the local elites are also the only ones allowed to do anything, including no-one in the lower or middle classes, the key drivers of social change and development. So it was at the time of the Industrial Revolution, no steam engines in China were the result, despite all their coal.n to investors). As said, things are slowly changing, and of course it varies from place to place and business type, but the general business environment is in some places still a long way off what is generally considered 'standard' practice in the west.<br /><br />This may all sound culturally racist and patronising, and there is of course a balance to what foreigners, for example, should be allowed to do, but getting this balance right is complicated and difficult, and locals themselves may often feel the same way.

B007DIQC90|3.0|I ordered the CD because I heard and saw the Icelandic ban perform on the Graham Norton show and loved &#34;Little Talks&#34;.<br /><br />The CD is good value although I found I could sing along just looking at lyrics - same chords just had to wait a few beats but that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />Makes for something you can move to and enjoy lyrics your can clearly hear.
B004LROUNG|5.0|What else can a true reader say?  This was a John Grisham novel, and it was very entertaining, as usual.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|I very much liked the music in the film of Gatsby as it was for me edited appropriately.<br />The CD for me doesn't  stand alone as Bazs'<br />other film CDs have.<br />I still associate Rap with crap  - it's not poetry or music and I know the monotone is poetry for some but not for me.<br />I've bought the damn thing but doubt I'll listen to it again.<br />I'll say again - as edited for the film - all was good.

B006M4F67A|5.0|Great puzzles for everyone.  Specially like the shapes. I would recommend this for all ages. This is all I have to say about this game. I have had many problems with amazon downloads.

0345803485|5.0|I heard about these books on The Today Show.  They caught my attention so I bought the three books.  They were interesting, I felt they were a little overboard but I guess to each his own.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is just a simple good product. I updated for the 99 cents and it is worth the money to pay the developers for their work.
1781162646|5.0|Win win - everything he writes is always great.  I saw Stephen King yesterday on The Today Show.  He sold me and I just recv'd it by mail as we speak.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was captivating.  After reading it I was trying to figure out why I enjoyed it so much, and it finally dawned on me that this is the exact book I have been looking for after all the other series have faded.  This story is written for adults. Excellent start, considering I wanted something in between the very plot driven Game of Thrones / Lord of the Rings sagas, while being less morally (dark versus light) based like Harry Potter or heaven-help-me sappy (enter Twilight and Fifty Shades).<br /><br />I understand it is probably the worst form of blasphemy to throw all of these genres/authors/styles together, but I love them all, so in turn this is why I love this book.  It has an excellent plot coupled with sub plots and characters that are amazingly interesting ( my favorite from this book may be Marcus ). The lines between good and evil are blurred, which keeps me wanting more.  The romance is fine..  It sets up the reason one complete half of the reason Diana is hunted, so it's good enough for me-- and it isn't overbearing or sappy. On top of it all, it can be difficult for me to buy into witchcraft without some brouhaha or snickering when it seems ridiculous, but here it kept me satisfied.<br /><br />If the author had decided to end here, while I would have been sad to see it end, I enjoyed this book without needing the second or third.  Well done.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|OK, I'm not going to be part of the collective hate, but there were some things that bothered  me, I don't care if now there are going to be 5 books instead of 3, but the thing is when you read a series of books you know that is one long story divided in several parts, BUT still each book needs a development and each book needs to bring something important to the story and THAT is the problem here, You could  easily erased 80% of the book and then don't miss those parts at all, there is a bunch of the second characters and Eva telling about them, guess what? We don't really care! We want to know about Eva and Gideon not the others, and the parts about them are good, like always a lot of HOT sex scenes, but (I can't believe I'm going to say this) the sex scenes are HOT but except for a few you could erased them along with the 80%. I get why all the people is mad we were left at the end of book 2 wanting more and this book didn't resolved the issues that needed to be resolved. Is not that Bad I mean the author knows what she's doing and yes it is well written and you could read it in one sitting, but there is NO way that this was the book she originally had in mind when she finished writing book 2.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? If you are a fan of the series MAYBE, if you are like me, a person that prefers to know than to be told, then read it, I was warned so I didn't expected much.<br /><br />Would I read the next two? Probably not, yes I love Gideon and that IS the plus in this one you will love him more, but some of the other characters really annoyed me (even Eva) and maybe in the future if I google the story someone will tell me all the answers that I needed from this one, but the part that makes me sad is that now I really don't care anymore I love book 1 and 2 so I'm sad that this one is not even half as good, and made me feel that I had enough of them.<br /><br />I hate to write bad reviews but really I'm so disappointed, not of the author because again she is good, but of the story, is like is not worth it anymore, even when you read an erotic book you need a story line otherwise you will get tired and that happen to me with this one.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game but ill play it once and than get out than when I get bord again and try to go in it wont let me it will send me back to my home page and it will only ever let me play it once than I uninstal it and reinstal it but it only ever plays it once :(

B000VXLHWG|5.0|I recently ordered (in the US) and received this amazing Mahler set, Blu-ray edition.<br />All discs work beautifully, with great picture and sound.  Even with my modest stereo system<br />(no surround sound) the climaxes at the end of the 2nd symphony were beyond anything on<br />CD (one of the great performances of the set, by the way).<br />There is a warmth and dedication to Mahler throughout these performances that is quite special and makes<br />the set a must for all Mahler enthusiasts.  The Concertgebouw also has a special meaning for me,<br />having heard a concert there some time ago, I can only say it is one of the most amazing acoustical<br />spaces in the world and I urge anyone who is going to Europe to make sure they hear the Royal<br />Concertgebouw Orchestra in their own hall.  You not only hear the sound of the orchestra in a way<br />that is beyond words (a soft, warm glow barely suffices) but feel the vibrations through the floorboards.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app has been exactly what I was looking for to do some light bookkeeping. I like the full size and easy use.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I got sucked into the first 2 books and was thrilled when this one came out, but i'm really upset about how the 3rd book has been handled. I can't agree more with other readers!!! It really does feel like the Author is just money hungry now. I had a feeling 1/2 way through the book this wasn't going to be the end and it's just annoying. The plot has thinned out so much and it feels like there was a lot of fillers in here, things are just too crazy for me. I'd love to see how the book ended but, Sylvia Day, I'm done with you! For $10 the book was a bunch of fluff and i'm really upset that the \\"trilogy\\" isn't actually one.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I can't even use the app because I have to sign in to use it, which wouldn't be a problem if it didn't pop up an error message every time I tried!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Loved it in the theater. Love it at home. I pre-ordered this movie about a month very it was released on dvd. I received the day that the dvd came out. Very happy!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Compared to the first two books this was like butter. Clean cut, easy and heart melting perfect. The ending was my big surprise. I think I forgot to breathe. A big yay and a omg seriously?
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am so tired of trilogies.  I definitely will not be on board for book 4 or 5. Oh well this was a waste of my time and money.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Grammatically excellent English prose, which may take some getting used to. The stories are engrossing page-turners (or screen-swipes, in my case). Presentation of certain characters, eg British money and accent marks, is garbled and annoying.

B00CY1JUW2|2.0|Wow...where to start.  I have listened to this album 3 times, and the best description I have is WTF?  I'll start by saying that QOTSA are probably my favorite band.  I own everything that Josh has done from Kyuss, EODM, and TCV.  He has built up such a huge investment in my \\"rock account\\" that he can produce an album of flatulence, that I'd buy it on the spot on its release date.<br /><br />I will start by rating the albums from best to worst IMO to show you how I feel about the band.<br /><br />1.  QOTSA<br />2.  SFTD<br />3.  Rated R<br />4.  LTP<br />5. EV<br />6. Clockwork<br /><br />I know we all have different tastes, and that is fine, but there is NO WAY this album is a 5 star.  If this is a 5 star in most of your books....I feel bad for your rock collection.  This album has a few gems like Tail and Eyes Peeled, and goes average to above average with My God is the Sun and Ocean, and then in the words of Josh; \\"sucks a bag of Johnson's\\" from there on.  Kallopsia has a great chorus, but I think I'd rather pluck my nose hair then listen to the rest of it.<br /><br />But that is okay Josh is musical greatness, and he will get my hard earned cash when his tour rolls through town, and he can through out a clunker every once in awhile, and this IS a clunker

B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Stupid, pilotless and a total waste of time.  How did they ever get A list actors to agree to be in this film?
B0094BB4TW|3.0|timeline sucks. half the time i dont get my notifications. its slow and many times i have to restart the program because it either crashes or the pictures won't load.  this is more a facebook itself issue rather than a kindle issue
B009JZSFUY|5.0|Continues the history of even numbered movies being the better movies. Although I think that theory falls apart after this movie. (Wasn't a big fan of Nemesis and  although I liked Into Darkness, I thought  the previous Abrams film was better.) ALways liked the Borg as villains and this film does a good job of showcasing them.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding Monsters- great,addicting,cool,awesome.....<br />So many more ways to describe it! I love this game and I hope you do too! :)

B0002DRBX4|4.0|Anyone who has worked in an office envirnment can relate to some of the antics and office poitics in this movie.<br />Well written with a surprize ending, this movie was well worth watching. The only negative for me was the rap music that sometimes acompanied the story.
B0067R0APK|5.0|great weather app. well worth the money. try the free version and you will eagerly want more... the more that comes with the paid version.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|His thoughts reaffirmed some of my beliefs about after life.  It is easy reading considering it is written by a physician.
B00BN0BZVY|5.0|I saw the movie and loved it so thought I'd read the book.  I'm glad I did.  The book is different from the movie.  It's very good and gives wonderful insight into the thinking of someone who is mentally ill but functional.  There are a heck of a lot of people out there in this situation and it's about time that someone presented them as real people with real problems who are pretty darned nice individuals.  You just have to allow for some idiosyncracies that set them apart.  Very likable, lovable characters.  Even if you saw the movie, read the book - it's not the same story and it too is great.
0062059963|3.0|Overall the book wasn't bad. It's an easy read that kept me interested throughout.<br /><br />In books like this, I love strong female characters, think Katniss, but America is no Victor. She could be a great Queen if she got over herself. Because the thing that bothered me the most about this book is how much crying there was. It seemed at least once a chapter America was brought to tears by something. This from the girl that didn't even want to be there. Give her a backbone.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was that after what happened to Marlee, American still kept meeting with Aspen in secret. Did she not see the similarities? But that didn't even cross her mind when I feel she should have struggle with it.<br /><br />The way I see this series is very much like The Bachelor. Are all the girls there for the right reason? Does he like me? Why is he kissing other girls? If this book had spent more time on the rebels and why the country is run like it is, it would have been better.
B001CTDH76|5.0|Kudos to the writer(s) for this show.  There is much involved with the reading of other people.  It takes intense observation to see what most people don't.  I definitely would recommend to many people.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Dear Sylvia,<br /> I hope you are reading these reviews on Amazon. I think they are being written by people who LOVE your books. We have waited anxiously for Entwined. Many of us reread  the first two in anticipation of the third. I usually don't reread books but I enjoyed them as much the second time around. There is not much for me to add that hasn't already been written here. We are really disappointed that you have decided to drag out the series at $10.00 a book. Entwined was really thin. Your plan makes us feel that you don't care about us as readers as much as we care about you as one of our favorite authors. I looked on your website and see only glowing reviews. .Please don't fool yourself. Sincerely, A Loyal Reader
B000053VAZ|5.0|The acting guild did a brilliant job of putting these actors together.  They played their parts expertly and naturally.  Dealing with mental disabilities is possible.  I have recommended this movie to many friends and family.
B00A3XQVKW|4.0|While not a literary work of art, it certainly taught me a great deal about the other side and what awaits us.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This 2nd Ender book deserves 5 stars for the concept of the \\"speaker\\"--someone who neither praises your life's achievements nor judges you harshly.  To have a \\"speaker\\" for the dead is to have someone who knows your story so intimately that they are able to explain your motives, your intentions, the good you hoped to do whether things turned out well or not.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I rented this dvd and thought it was a cute story with appealing characters, but I wouldn't buy it. Kids will love it, though.
B004ALB8OM|4.0|Ok, so everyone knows that wrestling is fake..to a certain degree, but it is still a very physical and demanding sport even though it is cartoonish. This is a story about a down and out man who fights his personal demons as he gets one last chance to be in the spotlight. He's a loser who was once a glorified god on the wrestling circuit. Mickey Rourke was once one of the hottest actors on the big screen but has also had his own personal slide down into the margins. This makes him the perfect actor for this role which he fits into like a glove...or a tight pair of spandex pants...reliving the &#34;glory&#34; days ain't so easy, but in the end the man who was once a god shows that he has the &#34;right stuff&#34; to bring it in the ring, though just a mere mortal.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|We loved the movie but it kept freezing and loading again several times throughout the movie. I'll buy the DVD before I stream it again.
B000I186FW|5.0|This is an adventure/fantasy movie which tells the story of a hero with a strict moral code of ethics and the strength of character and fearlessness to challenge the oppressive powers that be. Thought provoking and inspiring, this movie kept my attention as it unraveled. I enjoyed watching the protagonist wage his personal war against those who tortured he and others in their grand experiment which led to supreme dominion over the masses...&#34;V&#34; relentlessly exercised his demons and meticulously reigned down his wrath on his enemies...and in the end &#34;V&#34; doesn't stand for vendetta. Watch the movie to find out what it really means!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book is a disappointment. I really love Gideon and Eva love affair but just could not take this one. I hate I pe-order it since last year.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Accidentally downloaded this book not realizing I had previously bought and read a hard copy. Reading on my IPad through my Kindle apt made it interesting to re-read.  I may consider downloading others that I have read.<br /><br />I have read many Baldacci works and found all to be very entertaining novels. I look forward to many more in the future.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like temple run 2 but its kind of difficult but challenging and makes u want to keep playing its kind of addiciting
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|This movie is all about one-liners, shattering glass, incompetent bad guys, car chases, and slow motion explosions. Sure there are a few thematic elements that dazzle, and the update of what's going on with McClane and his kids is welcome, but this is an old school action movie at it's core. If you're looking for a fun and fast paced ride, give this a look!
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Althought as not as good as the first movie, it does have its monents, most notably when &#34;Stu&#34; learns that he had similtaneous sex with a transvestite. I could not stop laughing and peed a little in my pants thats how hard I laughed.
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|I love this movie when I saw one I wanted to know everything about I p man ESP, when I found out he knew Bruce Lee. Then they have the best person ever playing his character and all of the old favs in this, bravo people bravo
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Enough said. Total waste of somebody's time in creating a horrible game. I never review games, but this one is so bad if I could give it negative stars I would.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|I love this movie when I saw one I wanted to know everything about I p man ESP, when I found out he knew Bruce Lee. Then they have the best person ever playing his character and all of the old favs in this, bravo people bravo
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So before I started reading the 3rd book I read a lot of reviews on it and for some reason I don't understand why so many people gave it a bad review. It was just as good and steamy as the first 2. The entire story line is still all about Eva and Gideon for some reason people were complaining about too many random sub-plots going on and that's not the case. I think everyone is just mad about having to wait for more books to continue the story. Yes there is a lot more drama going on in this book but none of it is random or out of place, and I mean it's Eva and Gideon they're relationship ship has been plagued with drama since day 1 and they always overcome it that's what makes their relationship so addicting to read about (besides the great sex of course). They actually overcome a lot of the relationship issues they had in this book which I loved and they take a HUGE step in their relationship. I'm excited to see how it pans out in the next 2 books. Writing is fantastic as usual. Overall a great read just as good as the first 2, people are just complaining because it didn't end here and they have to wait for 2 more books to come out.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I love this movie when I saw one I wanted to know everything about I p man ESP, when I found out he knew Bruce Lee. Then they have the best person ever playing his character and all of the old favs in this, bravo people bravo
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I had trouble, at first, with the multiple voices. However, once<br />I got into reading it, the only reason I stopped reading was to go to work.  A A beautiful story that pulled on my heart.
B00A2AU0KI|3.0|I enjoyed watching Eastwood, Adams, and Timberlake together. Clint has a gift for recognizing the right roles at each age of his life. This aging baseball scout Eastwood is no exception. Amy Adams contrasts nicely from her nympho Wedding Crashers role as a lawyer with a troubled father relationship. And I like Justin as a romantic lead. Love the NC cinematography, but the plot, though enjoyable, is anything but original.
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic read, in some ways even better than 50 Shades!  Anxiously waiting to start the next book in the series.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Terrific addition to the Star Trek franchise. Casting for the main characters is very well done, particularly Chris Pine as a young Captain Kirk. I couldn't t help but laugh as the actors picked up on the idiosynchs of the 60s characters with perfect tongue in cheek. The story line is exciting, and is an informative prequel. I had only one objection..the space/time connection between young Spock and old..trying to figure the logic of these sequences requires a Vulcan brain and perhaps a mind meld. Special effects are worth the price of admission.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|Bizarre and tedious.  Unfortunately this book, while interesting in spots, went on way too long. The construction of each chapter, flipping back and forth between inadequately identified first person characters, contributed to the tiresome length.<br />Joe Sortais
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Terrible acting is to be expected, but the movie drags on with a plot that doesn't t excite, uninteresting characters any one of whom could die and you ll be ok with it, and even the shoot em up scenes left me hoping that everyone would shoot each other all at once and end this misery. Politics and divorce took a toll on our friend Arnold. And Forest Whitacre was simply uninspired.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Great movie. The picture was great quality. G rated. My little three year old loves it. Her favorite charter was Dory of course.
B00BF11STU|3.0|In an attempt to show us a real behind the scenes look at the Bin Laden raid, this film gets too bogged down in rapid fire CIA speak. You d have to watch it a few times to follow the analyst s investigative trail of Islamic characters that lead to Bin Laden s door. Still, the initial torture scenes are compelling and thought provoking. And the long awaited Navy Seal raid is exciting, though, like most of the film, could have been made more compelling with more well developed characters. I wanted to feel more and think less as this drama unfolds. Just sayin'.
B00932A4XE|3.0|It just wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.  Not nearly what the previews made it seem like.  Are they ever?
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Don t miss this John Hughes classic Chicago based movie about some suburban kids who ditch school for a day, live it up on the town, while being pursued by the suspicious principle. Every scene is a memorable comic delight, and you ll watch this film over and over.
0425263924|2.0|Unlike the other reviews thus far, I actually liked the book until the end.  It held my interest and the story seemed to be winding down and then suddenly everything starts getting drawn out and you can see there is going to be another book.  This TRILOGY would have been much better with a jam packed book 3 and a solid ending.  Very disappointed that authors are only after our money and not a great love story.
B000OLRH10|4.0|After Titanic, I never would have believed Di Caprio could be a tough action character, but he s terrific in Blood Diamond. The tragic undercurrent of this film works and the urgent and competing desires of the characters keeps the adrenaline moving toward a crescendo. You ll love Leonardo's accent.
B00CDFWJIG|5.0|If you liked The Twilight Series you will enjoy this. An interesting movie to watch and one I don't mind watching over again.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|I love PJ, and I love the book and movie Into the Wild; this soundtrack suits it perfectly. Beautiful music for an amazing story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a very good game but if you have a kindle fire prepare to wait for the updates. Other than the update time Minecraft is a very good game. Eventually the update will come out but until then people with kindles will have to wait. I have no idea why it is taking so long for the updates but I (unlike some people) have patience.Overall this is one of my favorite games.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I seem to win a lot which has me wondering about the randomizer.  Other than that...great graphics, and a great way to pass the time.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest sooooo.much! It's what I do just to get away from life for a few minutes.....which turns into an hour! It's really addicting but totally worth it! Please give pintrest a go! If you don't like it...delete it but idk why you wouldn't! Hope this helps :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does the job. I love the ease of use and large display. Can't beat free especially when it works so... well.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|So disappointed the way this book ended....Does the author not know what the word trilogy means?  You can't market it one way and then deliver it another....It's cost $30 for these three books and they expect me to pay more? This is just a scam as far as I can see...I wanted to know how things turned out for Eva and Gideon...but I'll leave it up to my imagination rather than perpetuate this con.  Plenty more authors to choose from.
B00CFOY244|4.0|It was ok lot of twist . The ending will surprise you. It will leaves you in aww I can't believe it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It can be compared to Upstairs Downstairs but is much better. I look forward to Season four and hope that it will be out soon.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire HD and it works perfectly.  I have no complaints at all. Two words.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Heavy metal fans seem to be the most conservative critics: Deviate from the tried-and-true formula for thrash/power/speed/etc. metal and your fans feel betrayed and turn their backs. Hey, people other than myself might begin to hear about this band, and even like them! That's selling out! Idiots who listen to mainstream music might discover my favorite band's back catalog, previously only known to me and a few select others!<br /><br />But I was reminded of two things while listening to Super Collider: First, Megadeth has never really been all about pure thrash metal. Sure, they have two of the greatest thrash albums of all time (Peace Sells, Rust in Peace), but in keeping up with Metallica, Megadeth was happy to abandon the cause and seek success elsewhere. As a result, they wrote a whole bunch of hummable, memorable, and yet still metal songs: Symphony of Destruction, Reckoning Day, Train of Consequences, Have Cool Will Travel, etc. Were these not better than any single song on So Far So Good... So What? Sure, Megadeth recorded duds, too, but Risk WAS risky (considering how much metalheads were always going to hate it), and it was anyway bookended by the very good Cryptic Writings and the somewhat decent The World Needs a Hero. Frankly, of the thrash bands that \\"betrayed\\" the thrash \\"cause\\" in the 1990s - Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth all did - Megadeth did the best job of making new formulas work.<br /><br />Fast forward to the 2000s: Where is it written that Megadeth now has to keep the thrash flame alive? Endgame was very good, but, again, Thirteen had less thrashy, but more memorable and higher quality songs. Do you really remember any chorus to any Endgame song besides Headcrusher? But you can both headbang and sing along to Sudden Death, Public Enemy No. 1, and Black Swan. With Super Collider, Megadeth continues to beat out the competition in creativity and quality melodies, if not in thrash. I say kudos.<br /><br />And to all the critics who, while panning Super Collider, mention offhand that it's hard to find good thrash metal these days, I say that's a lie: If you want pure renaissance thrash, try Slayer's superb Christ Illusion, Anthrax's incredible Worship Music, Testament's excellent Dark Roots of Earth, Overkill's great The Electric Age, or Exodus' decent Exhibition B: The Human Condition. If you want angry, aggressive thrash/power metal that kicks you in the face and has you saying thank you, Machine Head's Unto the Locust is by far the best. If you want thrash/power/whatever that hits so hard and has so little melody or variety that you might actually sleep, then Lamb of God is for you. If you want to recall the heavier mainstream metal of the '80s, 3 Inches of Blood's Long Live Heavy Metal is damn near perfect. But if (however secretly) you find thrash-based metal with a pop twist and a Mustaine snarl an attractive guilty pleasure; and if (again, however secretly) you miss that 1990s Countdown to Extinction digestibility or Youthanasia introspection; then look no further than Megedeth's Thirteen and Super Collider. These two albums do not disappoint.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. People are giving it one star ratings only because it wont update. We didnt ask rating this app on its ability to update, we asked about how fun the game is. SO STOP IT! Its not a good reason. But i love this app. Its fun and i do want the update. I wish it would let me! But the app is good, i would recommend it.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I LOVED this series, loved the show, loved the build up of the last book and what was going to happen to sookie....omg, seriously? This has to be the biggest let down. The book wasz a total waste of time and money. Lol Iknow it sounds weird, but my feelings were hurt. She should of put SOME kind of effort in her last sookie book, Imean come on<br />I have never written a review before. Ever but Ihad to for this.<br />This book is total cr*p!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very fun. I like the backgrounds and the characters are enjoyable. The hoverboards and the keys give this game a twist. The flamingos however are very challenging.
B00BYISQTO|4.0|On first listen, one might be tempted to say that 'Trouble Will Find Me' is 'good but not great.' That was my initial reaction. It's certainly more subdued without some of the immediate payoff of 'Boxer' or the stunning highlights of 'High Violet' or 'Alligator.' But keep listening. The songs slowly unveil how wonderful they are, what a great body of work this is. It's meant for you to pay attention and quietly listen! After multiple listens i'm convinced that this is almost their best one. It still doesn't quite measure up to the across the board perfection of 'Boxer' (well, in my opinion at least). But there are so many great moments on here. If you are a fan, it's great. Just keep listening...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because the FREE stuff,and the world tour so far Tokyo and Florida and I want California

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini Singh doesn't fail to disappoint. &#34;Heart of Obsidian&#34; was full of wild passion, darkly intense emotions and blood pumping plot-twists that have you on the edge of your seat, eagerly reading until the last word.  It continues to expand on the preexisting plots from her other PsyChangeling books and has great older character cameo appearances.  A must read!
B008VBYN80|5.0|It's very interesting except that you can't build those new units and the energy to do stuff but still rabid approved so llay now
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great continuation of characters I love & missed. Don't get all the negativity,My mother always told me if you Don't  have anything nice to say then don't saying nothing at all.Thanks Sylvia keep doing what your doing.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|To start with I love these Bat Man Movies, great action, great 5.1 sound and the color and sharpness are second to none, there is nothing I dislike here.
B0063M22QO|4.0|GOOD, BUT NOT AS CHALLENGING AS I WOULD HAVE HOPED.  BUT A NICE DISTRACTION AT THE END OF THE DAY.
0345529057|5.0|I kept hearing about how wonderful this series is and when I found it for this price I thought there was nothing to lose.  The books arrived in perfect condition.  I was expecting at least some wear and tear since they were listed as used, but they were brand spanking new!  Talk about a bargain.  I would definitely do business with this company again.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|The story is good.  Alice Sebold was lucky because she didn't get killed as the cops told her.  She was lucky also because she saw the guy 5 months later, leading to his arrest, and because she was an excellent witness.  I liked her story because it did not end perfectly like a movie.  Despite all of strength, she could not help her best friend.<br />Her humility and strength is inspirational.  Anytime someone raises awareness about rape in big ways and small, it is a good thing that might help someone somewhere.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This app was great! However, the only thing is that it was released REALLY late. My friends were playing it on their ipads waaaaay before it came out on Kindle. For really popular apps, amazon should release them sooner!
B00466HN72|5.0|Got this for my son for Easter.  Super cute and funny movie for kids.  Even my adult husband enjoyed this one.  I woud recommend this for a good family movie or as an Easter gift.
1416955070|5.0|Amazon Book Review:<br />I love Cassandra Claire's detailed and exquisite work in this story. Each page is like the delicious taste of chocolate, you can't wait for the next one! This book could be compared to Twilight; with a similar love story. Although, the characters and plot are much different, they are both similar in the sense that they use fictional myths and ideas that the world has always wondered about; like vampires, demons, werewolves, and other mythical creatures.  But Clary Fray is more independent than the dependent Bella Swan, and she knows her priorities. Clary Fray is so much different than the other characters I have ever read about before. She seems to have this curious, shy, thoughtful and creative mind; one that is so overwhelmed with all of the things that are happening throughout the story. Jace Wayland is a more majestical version of Edward Cullen, although he adds more intensity to the book. He adds a mysterious side to the book; you don't know what to expect from Jace Wayland. Clary and Jace have this undefined relationship that just makes the whole story more and more intense as I continued to read this wonderful story about love, family, death and myths. This delightful story is the most intriguing thing my mind has ever consumed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first half of the book is somewhat slow and not easy to keep track of. Then it changes drastically, a turn in the story no one can see coming and after that its impossible to put down. I came to love how differently its written and will be buying more of Flynn's books.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|Is there anybody who harmonize like these guys! Even without Layne - they continue to capture the foreboding harmonies that Haunt!
0736092269|5.0|A great visual compendium of exercises. The only thing was I expected it to read more like a textbook, which chapters and what not. Either way, do not regret this purchase and it's great for finding new exercises or brushing up on the ones you currently do.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Love the  colors, love the. Ease of playing.  Keep up the good work! !!<br />I like the fact that it can be played in short or long Sessions
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like this app but you are not able to exit that app or it shuts off unlike apps like Pandora!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|One of my favorite books is The Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind.  This has all the fantastic details, elegantly architected plot, and in addition to all the things I loved about The Sword of Truth - it adds raw, adult truths and keeps me thinking and guessing... on the edge of my seat even at times.<br /><br />Love it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a wonderful game, you will get addicted. Good game for both adults and kids. This game is highly recommended.
B006Z9K97E|4.0|this book gives an insight into the life in a closed society where there is no freedom of the press
B0055SWM08|5.0|Addictive and easy to play and gets you to think. Love this game! I am glad I bought it and my kids enjoy it too.
1443413798|5.0|All three books are linked by the same characters/setting, and according to the author can be read in any order.  I would not have enjoyed this book half as much had I not read both Shadow of the Wind AND Angel's Game first.  As a matter of fact, I may have been lost had I not read them both first.<br /><br />The Prisoner of Heaven is a book primarily about my favorite of CRZ's characters, Fermin Romero de Torres.  The timeline covered in this book is the gap left between Shadow and Angel's.  Not light reading because you have to pay attention to many details that will tie it all together.  If you like CRZ, and have read the other two, buy it!  You won't be disappointed!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|My brother bought me this album and I must say it is so good to hear Josh Homme again. Each track has its own specific groove yet they all have a sort of \\"doomsday\\" kind of feel. I did some research and Josh said these were some of the songs he wrote when he was bedridden. He felt like he was never going to get out, but he never told himself so. I really don't like giving ranks because I feel like each album has its own right and is amazing in its own properties. But, I would rank it Lullabies to Paralyze for sure but I don't know about Era Vulgaris. Most people kind of bag on that album, but I personally love their alternative sound as much as their heavy metal sound. In the words of Josh Homme himself, \\"Robot Rock is back!\\"
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|When I hit play, Kingmaker got my blood going.  It set the tone for the album... and that tone is \\"driving\\".  The bass drum and bass lines really stand out, and so maybe if you have different eq settings, you might have a totally different impression.  Anyway...<br /><br />First: Dave's voice sounds awesome<br />Second: The mastering is super sharp. They clearly spent a lot of time choosing the heaviest sound to go with Dave's voice.<br />Third: Kudos to them for taking chances with the banjo/fiddle, the spoken word (more about that later), and the mix of themes and sounds.<br />Fourth: bass... bass bass bass.  And more bass.<br /><br />The tracks:<br />- Kingmaker was great to listen to.  Good hooks, good crunch, and surprisingly good vocals from Mustaine.<br />- Supercollider... I had heard it before, and was not impressed.  But somehow when it followed Kingmaker, it was better.  Sort of cheesy, but better than I remembered.<br />-Burn, and Built for War - Now I started to get a little less enthusiastic.  They are filler-ish.  Not anything to write home about, but not horrible.  Just sorta there.<br />-Off the Edge started to get the groove back a little bit, but lyrically, it's weak.<br />- BUT THEN Dance in the Rain hit, and I wasn't sure about the \\"spoken word\\" part... It worked on Angry Again, but I wasn't sure another one would be good.  WRONG.  The lyrics are good, and the time-signature shift in the music really makes it interesting.<br />- Beginning of Sorrow - sort of a re-hash of Supercollider, but with way better lyrics; classic Mustaine.<br />- Blackest Crow - starts out so cool with the bluegrass feel.  I loved it.<br />- Forget to Remember was a decent song, pop-ish, a little bit like they were stretching for a radio hit.  But still solid<br />- Don't Turn Your Back - Awesome intro, again with the heavy driving bass, and then some shredding thrown in for good measure.<br />- Cold Sweat - good way to end.  Plenty of guitar, angry voice, almost like anoutro.
B006O6F932|2.0|I wouldn't recommend this product its all plastic I expected it to be more sturdy then it is.easy to break
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Every good book has a redeemed soul, or a resurrection tale.<br />This book has both, weaving together past and future.<br /><br />A great read from beginning to end.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Graphics are decent, music is appropriate for the game. I wish the game didn't require the kindle fire to be in landscape only.
B004MYFV0O|3.0|Ok but not remarkable.  I was expecting more from this book.  But you can learn some.  Is the same all the time.  Very low  drawing levels, for kids maybe.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I had seen Django at the movies twice and I wanted to have my own copy.  I have watched it and it has proven to be as powerful as the first time I saw it.  It has a huge message for today and while the story may be difficult for some to watch, as a Southerner, I found its message to be as true today as it was when it happened.  And  I doubt that little of it was exaggerated.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AMAZING SHOW!!!!! I can't wait until the new season comes out!! Overall I love the series. First season and Second season :)
B00C9U9YOC|5.0|My friend told me to try likecloclockwork.tv.  I watched the animations and listened to the short tracks intently.  I was impressed, so I decided to order the vinyl.  Great sound and songs.  I have a popping on The Vampyre of Time and Memory but that seems to be the only issue with my pressing which I don't mind (It came with a download card that I am just hanging on to.) I Appear Missing is my highlight of the album, but every song is great. Overall, it is a great rock album and sounds great on vinyl.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|im excited to know that the series isnt over yet but sad that i have to wait for the next book and no sign of a release date as of yet :( i thought the book was amazing !!!
1451695195|5.0|It was a great book!  Explained the science verses the spiritual.  What a gift this man shared with the world.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I loaded this for my Great Grandson to play but found out I love the game also. Easy to play and love the challenge.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have NEVER returned a book bought for my kindle- until today.<br /><br />*Spoiler alert- this series is no longer a trilogy the author has decided to gouge her readers and turn it into a 4+ series<br /><br />There are so many bad things about this 'final' book- Here are the reasons why I will no longer buy another crossfire book from Sylvia Day- or probably any other book of hers for that matter.<br />1. Storylines are all over the place- she can't develop a plot line and stick with it for more than a few pages.<br />2. Price- $10 for an ebook? The paperback is $8. I am all about being green and using my kindle but to charge more seems ridiculous. I'm disgusted with myself that I've spent $20 on this series so far, at least I returned the 3rd book so I didn't blow $30 on this mess.<br />3. Trilogy- yeah this women needs a dictionary because she obviously has no idea trilogy means 3.<br /><br />Please know this review is just about the crossfire series, the other books I've read by Sylvia Day were pretty good, however when authors start turning out watered-down stories like this to reach deadlines, or to make more money off of readers, it's no longer about writing good literature but hailing to the almighty dollar.<br /><br />I will hopefully find another good author soon, for right now though buyer beware of Sylvia Day and the crossfire series. Also if you bought this book within the last 7 days you can return it. Let Sylvia know she's writing crap.
0316247545|5.0|I loved it. Beautifully written and exceptionally well made. Goes into greater detail than anything I've seen before as to why the show and the characters are so wonderful. A must have treasure for the fan of the best show ever!
1400067820|2.0|I really enjoyed the Black Swan and Fooled by Randomness, but this book was a huge disappointment.  The tone of the book is rude and uncivil. Mr. Taleb has no time for anyone that does not agree with him or even anyone who does not use the same words as he does.  He is the sole possessor of the truth, even though his statements are frequently self-contradictory. It is sad, because I think the core ideas are interesting and worth writing about.  If you can slog through the acres of accusations, name-calling, bloviation and diatribes, it is worth reading, but I found it deeply unpleasant.  He dismisses editors, but I think his most dire need on this book was a strong editor.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|It was a really good read!  I Loved the book, would deff read it again n again n again!!! Great classic!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I had played all of the Bloons TD games online and enjoyed them, so after reading some of the reviews here I decided to give it a shot.  Definitely worth the price!  I really like the idea of earning tokens you can use to &#34;level up&#34; different skills (and for those who don't have the patience, there's an option to purchase some of the upgrades with real, non-monkey money.  I gave in and bought the extra range for monkey villages, but for everything else I've just used the tokens).  :)  I also like the addition of &#34;exclusive&#34; towers, abilities, etc. that are not available in the free online version - to me, that is one of the things that makes it worth the money.  I would definitely recommend Bloons TD 5 to anyone who has played and enjoyed the online version of this or other Bloons TD games.  Great job by Ninja Kiwi!  :)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading the reviews, is there a \\"o\\" rating. Can't believe that this is heading to 5 books, what is that called? Money hungry.... what a waste.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Really love the Quell games and this one is no exception!  Involves lots of thinking to figure out how to solve each puzzle.  I love that Memento has a lot of extras like hidden levels, gems and time pieces.  I also like that it adds extra elements of solving the puzzles vs. the first two Quells such as turning all the tiles to a particular color instead of just collecting the pearls.  Plus, there is a story to this one!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|E L James has the skill to write a breathtaking, heart pounding novel. This book is no exception. I could hardly put it down!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|It was nice to read a story from Brandon on the short side. Don't get me wrong - I love his longer stuff, but it's nice to see him vary it up.
6305320802|5.0|it was just what my mother wanted, and it got there before her birthday, thank you. she loved it, it gave her a feel of nest-alga she needed.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The best performance so far from Daniel Day-Lewis.  Complex political story line and it helps to be familiar with the history of the period.  Shows what a  brilliant and wily politician Lincoln was.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is an incredible resource for document sharing between people and devices. I have Evernote on my tablet, laptop, ipod, cell phone, and desktop to easily access any thoughts I jot down throughout the day. I keep task lists, schedules, recipes, date night ideas, bucket lists, and countless other items in my notebooks and the ease with which I can organize them blows my mind. A+
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is a really fun game but you have to get to wave 11 before you can be the zombies
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The movie was excellent!  I can't wait to see the second one.  I LOVE the whole Lord of the Rings movies!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was very excited about this book. I was let down. I felt like nothing much happened to progress the story. It felt like a lot of filler. I will buy the next two books, only because I do not want to leave the story unfinished, but I will not read another series by this author. I am truly disappointed.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Another great read.  I thought I would be able to figure this out, but just couldn't.  The story kept me coming back anytime l had a minute to read.  You will enjoy this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Looks like a good game. Not a point and shoot, but rather a strategy game. And, he can play it with his friends and cousins.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want the new update for the kindle fire can u tell me when I will get the update.  Thank you so much !
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Simply put, loved it! The Blu-ray, DVD, digital copy was a great value, too. Everything was received as and when described.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Have elapsed already four seasons and always those seasons have kept their momentums for many reasons, first the intrigue plot, second the history around each character of the series -- Castle's mother and daughter, Esposito, etc. also kept its momentums’ and finally the work-flirting-love relationship between Castle and Beckett, and this fifth season in great manner allows that all above mentioned still working real good introducing in a real well manner now the element Castle-Beckett couple life...  This series for me  it is a refreshing one!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Today on June 6th the new 0.7.0 update came out and my brother got it right when he woke up and I can't seem to get it and I don't know why.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|I wish that there were better graphics like on the nexus 10. Also please add MOGA and MOGA PRO compatibility.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I've watched this movie multiple times and every time I see it I find new things in it. If you have the time rent it online. It is definitely worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the first time in this article to a red flag as to be the point where it is unshaven<br />Rowdylynnsanity@Gmail.com is my email RowdyLynnsanity@Gmai.comment me  on Twitter ads
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is my mail browser.....rarely do I have a problem with any thing. It's always up and running..and when it is down..it lets you know.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I really enjoyed the culmination of the story about Kaleb and the Ghost in this book.  So much emotion.  It took me a while to see where the story was going.  Well played.  Great build up from previous books.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great entertainment!!! Thoroughly enjoying this game. I can see myself becoming quite addicted. lol. all in good fun! enjoy!  bueno
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|The more I'm listening to this album the more I like it. Especially, its more progressive twist which nevertheless is typically laconic and eschews self-indulgent technicality, so common in modern progressive rock. It's eclectic and yet with a cohesive sense of direction. There's even a surf tune \\"Blood From Stone\\", with a strong bass line by Glover. It sounds as if the band sought to summarize their entire career, creating an album with elements from each mark and period. And yet, to me it sounds as a modern version of Mark I, i.e. unexpectedly pre-Gillan era. And as is very appropriate for an album dedicated to the late Jon Lord, keyboards take on marked prominence in the mix, which is in itself very much Mark I. Don Airey really shines here, with Lordesque Hammond work throughout, with classical progressive flights of the organ that would fit well in \\"The Book of Taliesyn\\" (see his intricate, lyrical solo in \\"Uncommon Man\\"), and with some use of synthesizers reminiscent of Lord's experimentation of the Coverdale/Hughes era (compare his solo in \\"Weirdistan\\" to \\"A' 200\\" from \\"Burn\\"). Steve Morse is overall quite restrained, not much in terms of shredding, he has nothing to prove at this stage, but listen to his beautiful legato in \\"Vincent Price\\" or Airey-Morse dueling interplay in \\"Apres Vous\\" − a-la Blackmore-Lord \\"In Rock\\". Gillan's voice is very pleasant indeed when he doesn't try to stretch it out-of-range (and he prudently doesn't on this record). If I'd prefer anything different at all, that would be punchier drums − Paice seems to drown a bit on some of the tracks. Above and Beyond anything else, most of the songs on this album are easily conceivable live (which can hardly be said about their previous few records), with longer solos and all, and I'd really wait for the band to do just that.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I couldn't even keep my attention on this movie it was just plain long drawn out  and rambling. I love the actors but I feel sorry for them being in this terrible movie because this is what I refer to as a career ending movie.
159463176X|5.0|I loved this book, because it morphed a multitude of characters' lives and circumstances around a single act. It was a pleasure to read and of course made me cry!
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Love all Eric Church's music.  He should have won awards back then.  If  you like Chief you will love this album also!
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I bought this book in 1983 when if first came out. I have always loved the books about Arthur and Camelot but when I found this one I could not put it down until I was finished. I took it everywhere with me to read whenever I had a few minutes. The only other book I read like that was \\"It\\" by Stephen King. Since that time I've re-read it so many times my original paperback was falling apart so I had to retire it (I would not part with it) and bought a new copy to read over and over - which I have not done with any other book. For me it remains the quintessential book on the legend of Arthur and Camelot.<br /><br />What made the difference for me was that every character was multidimensional, human, weak and strong rather than being the embodiment of some single attribute. Finally these were people with rich histories, feelings, motivations and complexity. No one was all good or all bad. And the richness of description and historical reference of the conflicts of the time made it more real. It became more than just a retelling of a legend, with a stronger message than the simple moral lessons of the Arthur stories of old.<br /><br />Now that it is available for the kindle, I will be downloading it so that I always have it available to me. For those times when I need a good read that casts strong female characters that are more than just witches, harlots or nuns and male characters that are not purely good or completely evil. Life, and fiction, are more interesting when you can't presume to know the answers.
B007L24T52|3.0|Not up to the usual Baldacci standard. The characters were incomplete in a sense, and the twist was foreseeable, but hey, I read it to the end and purchased the sequel!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|She has no memory of him because she was so young when they parted.  He has lovely memories of her all his life until he drifts into &#34;the long goodbye&#34;.  A sad, but rich story of family, life and love.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|weak storyline, and it clearly only about the sex. none of the relationships evolve. no character is even remotely likeable, and don't  even get me started on the ending (or lack thereof). what a waste of time and money. not interested in any of her follow-on books.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Great for any rock and roll/music/guitar lover. Basically bringing together stellar representatives of the art over 3 decades. Thanks alot.
B00018D3RI|5.0|What became more tongue and cheek in later years started out with a more serious Dirty Harry tone.  Two no nonsense rugged cops solving crimes and beating up bad guys.  The pilot episode is fantastic!!
1461035937|2.0|I ordered this book used, having reviewed a description that indicated minimal marking and highlighting. Upon receiving the book I found the the entire play section of the book was extensively highlighted, underlined, and filled in with several of the previous owners notes.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|\\"Tempest\\" is quite a good album, but it took me about a year to warm up to it. Usually Bob's music gets through to me right away, but things have changed. I've always defended his singing voice, but he's getting on in years and his voice demonstrates that. I usually would have reviewed this soon after getting it, but the first few times I attempted to listen I just couldn't get through it. So I put it aside and forgot about it until tonight. And my verdict is that it's worth owning, and worth the time it takes to warm up to it. Maybe it's just me. Maybe YOU will love it on the first listen.<br /><br />The lyrics are still up to snuff. Take your time and enjoy it.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|A fine book. Not quite up to par with the Langdon series, but nonetheless worth a read. I admire Brown's attempt to mix things up. .
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Love this series! Love that I can watch on my iPad when I'm on the go as well. Would recommend this to everyone since Season one isn't available on Demand or Netflix at the moment!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|And I am so glad I did.My daughters love it as much as I did. So excited I found it.
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|Rented for spousal unit. Predictable variation of \\"Living with the Enemy\\" but all that said, well paced and enjoyable. No great life lesson here but that ok. Date night: yes and might even get you laid. For viewing with wife? Yes. Guy only movie: nope.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Excellent...more than ten stars.  Go out and get this movie..the whole family will enjoy it. I loved it from start to finish.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a non stop can't put down love drama page turner till the end and she leaves you wanting more can't wait to see were this story goes from here...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing but stinks that you cant get updates for the kindle fire so you cant play with your friends
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Hello,<br /><br />Since Apple had the great idea to change the chargin ways for the iP5; this is great. Works well, I use it daily and I am very satisfied as you will be too.<br /><br />Thanks.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Where to start...at the end of Book 3 I asked myself what happened to this person or that person and had accepted that some of my favorite characters had died...welllll, maybe, maybe not!!!  I truly enjoyed this book and, believe it or not, read it in only a week...and then I finished and said to my self what happened to this character or that character and found out that I will have to wait for a while to find out...and true to form, some of my favorite characters (appear) to have died in this one also...welll, will have to wait and see...looking forward to the next (final?) installment...
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I think that it took me all of 15 minutes to complete the free version, it was pointless to download it. It seems like a great game but it's frustrating to download anything for 15 minutes of game play<br />.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Remember all those great Bob Seger songs growing up?<br />It's all in here, and there's a lot of them. You will enjoy this<br />cd. Makes a great gift for any Seger fan.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini never fails to amaze me by his intertwining tales! Worth every moment of your time with all three of his novels.
B005SAYRA6|5.0|Are excellent movies. Five was well written and the action was awesome.<br /> Will watch it again and again, can I get a discount?
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|We love this movie.  It remains true to the original and is good family fun.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|first of all I was surprised to see how very in shape Marlon is .channing we know,ok!.<br />Sienna just flawlessly seductive. Dennis commands as usual.<br />the story is a little too real .<br />I loved it .a good story always keep moving
B008YRVW0I|5.0|great for kids. this game is like the jewels game but u earn $ and buy stuff for. ur fish
B0090KZDSK|4.0|So glad this story isnt over yet! If the crossfire series was finished off with 3 books it would have been to rushed and that crammed full that your head would hurt by the end. The 3rd of 50 shades was rushed and finished to quickly so I say good call making it a 5 part series, we've known for a while it was going to be more then 3 books.The more Gideon and Eva the better, and Cary well his story is just as intriguing. Bring on the next one!!!!!!
B00860YICC|4.0|This is one of those movies that you shouldn't watch before bedtime because it was just too profound.  It was also kind of unbelievable that someone could be born on a cruise line, left behind, and be raised by employees.  At some point someone would intervene and take pity on a poor waif like 1900, but alas, it didn't happen.  It was an amazing story, nevertheless as we see the unfolding of the life of a man who becomes a celebrity on board ship because he is a talented pianist.  None of the music he plays is anything anyone has ever heard--it's all his own!  He is even challenged by the very notable Jelly Roll Morton, probably the greatest jazz and ragtime piano player of that time.  1900 also has the special talent of being able to read people which is kind of interesting because he really hasn't had many personal relationships in a life where his whole world view is from a ship.  He knows which people are stowaways, are potential criminals, have something to hide, and no one is the wiser.  Tim Roth really shines in this role and makes the character come alive.  His good and only friend, Max, played by Pruitt Taylor Vince acts as the narrator in this film and he plays an itinerant musician down on his luck very well.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this movie is the music of the jazz age and the dancing that goes on.  There are some humorous parts also as we see 1900 learning to read by looking at racing forms.  There's also the scene with Jelly Roll, played by Clarence Williams III which is pretty funny.  But the rest of the movie kind of left me feeling sad as I saw a man who because of his whole life being spent on the ocean could somehow not ever be able to find contentment in a landlocked environment.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Even the sad parts. Thanks Jojo Moyes for a moving portrait of 2 people, one family living with an unbearable reality.
B005DC68NI|5.0|Dear Mr. Gaughran,<br /><br />I just finished reading Let's Get Digital. It is such a helpful book--it's packed with useful information. I would even say it is INVALUABLE for those of us new to self-publishing. Thank you so much for sharing your wealth of information!<br /><br />Assuming I can get formatting, etc. done in a timely manner,my 1st book, Veil of Disguise: A Tale of International Intrigue will find its way onto Amazon, Smashwords, etc.in the not-too-distant future.<br /><br />Warm regards,<br /><br />Suzanne Ponder Sparks
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I enjoyed the historical aspects and the believable characters.  I continue to enjoy Follett's historical thrillers.  If you, like me, enjoyed The Key to Rebecca and The Eye of The Needle you will like Jackdaws.<br /><br />Joe Z
B0009A40ES|5.0|made it right on time.  wonderful condition upon arrival. it was in the plastic still and everything.  I am happy with this purchase
B001PB3RU8|4.0|I really like what F&M did with Dog Days Are Over and Cosmic Love. A couple of the others were good too, but the rest were just ok.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|although the storyline has lost a little of its initial appeal ... it is still entertaining. the actors and characters are generally pretty captivating.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Was definately worth it! Good story and lots of action!  Who would have thought a zombie love story would wanna make someone cry
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and is like temple run woth a little twist. You run around a a subway! How fun and if thats not enough it takes u on tour to see the world.
0231161166|5.0|I liked that it gives capsule introductions to researchers and takes us into their labs, Most ot the time when I started to lose my grip on a description Ms. Carey would present one of her examples (which some other reviewers found too elementary) and I would get that &#34;click&#34; that would make sense of it. I'll bet Ms. Carey is an excellent teacher.<br /><br />The book is only somewhat comprehensive and linear. That is not a criticism, as you will see below. I appreciated the author's strategy of following discoveries through labs and linking the bits together with discoveries by other researchers. I'm sure the presentation in the book is much, much more orderly and progressive than the process felt to those in the middle of it, but I got a little bit of the feeling of scientists transported to an unexpected world (unlike those searching for the expected Higgs Boson, which I'm sure has an excitement all its own) .<br /><br />I said above that this book is not comprehensive or linear. I said that as a way of comparing this book to Developmental Plasticity and Evolution (by Mary Jane West-Eberhard), which opened the door to this mind-blowing world for me. That book is exceptionally clearly written but I had to really work at it because the language is at an advanced level of specialization in the field. Just to encourage you to read it, the summary of that 600-page book is &#34;genetics follows evolution.&#34; Don't use the Kindle edition becasue you need to look at the illustrations together with the text, and even the best of Kindle will not be able to get what you need on the screen at the same time. Go to the Interlibrary Loan office of your local library and have them borrow it for you, then see if it is worth the price to you. Carey's book covers epignetics more broadly, is much less than 600 pages,and is written  for the average reader.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is an amazing game I love that you visit all different kinds of city's and its short of like temple run but instead of the temple walls its its a subway
B008220BLG|4.0|Now for a Zombie movie , this was different than most. I liked this movie and might make a chick , flick in the future!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Best game in the whole wide world everyone should have this game. Like to take advantage of other people in the game.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|DO you think Arnold was making a statement with this movie.  Well like this may be his last stand in the movies??????????
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is totally awesome but there's no caves &amp;little lava. It's not like pc.<br />There's not even endermmen<br />Church church huh up
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Now for another Die Hard movie ,this was not too bad. I like how they make his son follow in his Dads foot steps. So look for more of the Maclane Family doing wha they do best ,  KILL THE BAD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was fun very intriguing. The only problem I had is it was really short can't wait for the next chapter.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent drama series suitable for mature, sensitive adults who don't find action, adventure, or horror<br />genres very appealing.  Acting is superb & plots are realistic & thought provoking.  Highly recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Romantic catastrophe  of epic proportions ,a real game changer. The characters are holding on to each other out of their need to stay grounded in this charged up book.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The first of the F-X shows and the series that started it all.  This show does not disappoint and season 1 is the best of the best.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I honestly thought I wouldn't like this show because MTV mad it, and I usually find everything they do boreing. This show though is really good, and is one of my favorite shows
0060833459|5.0|Peter Drucker is the go-to resource for managment advice and instruction.  Even though this book was published many years ago, it is still relevant in todays corporate environment.<br /><br />Every manager should be required to read this.<br /><br />I have shared this book with my friends, family and colleagues,
B001DRF84W|1.0|I have 7 films by Ang Lee including this one. Most are excellent, but I was disappointed by Hulk. I have no interest in seeing it again.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It rooks and it will blow up your mind it will be were the wate and please  tell us if you find out how to blow up tnt
1451688091|4.0|My husband is a history and cinema buff, so this was an obvious birthday gift, after we saw the movie.  He's still reading it, but says he likes it so far.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The ending was so not right! I have been waiting for this book for 6 months and it ends with that?!?! There are so many things in the fire with no answers at all! I have to agree with most of the other reviewers on this one. I felt like the author was drawing scenes for other books not just Fifty Shades. There is no drama in the first half of the book and nothing but drama from WAY TOO many people in the last half. I do love the Gideon and Eva story but I can't handle the way we are being used to purchase more books. Fifty had about 600 pages per book at the price of $10 per book. I read above that there are supposed to be 5 books now? Come on! I really hope they pull it together by the time the finally publish book 4 b/c I can def. say I won't be prepurchasing this one I am waiting on the reviews first. Good luck to you Sylvia, I hope you recover from this one I am not giving up on you yet.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Excellent sound and fairly compact. Just wish Sony would get over all the extraneous packaging that just ends up in the landfill!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|ZeptoLab did it again! If you like &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; you're going to love this game for sure. This is another puzzle solving game with ZeptoLab unique style. A must have; in my opinion.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|One of the worst movies of the year and certainly a travesty that has any association with the \\"Die Hard\\" franchise. Don't even rent this let alone buy it. 98 minutes of your life you'll never get back. Bad, bad, bad!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Everyone is of different opinion, but I think this is the greatest \\"Star Trek\\" movie ever made! I'm 52, so it's not like I didn't grow up on \\"Star Trek,\\" which could make one think I'm prejudice against new actors filling old actors shoes, but how can I deny greatness? Ricardo Montalbon (spelling) will never be replaced, but this film is just the pinnacle of excellence! I really believe it's the best of it's ilk, & that includes \\"Star Wars,\\" for outer space epic action adventure films. I have not enjoyed a film so much since the last James Bond film, \\"Sky Fall!\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but how do i get the new update because i heard there are buckets and cake.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|Let me start by saying this movie usually wouldn't be my first choice anyway...so I am probably a tough critic. BUT I loved The Notebook and can sometimes be drawn in by a good love story. This is not one of those times. Safe Haven's critical points were so unbelievable that I couldn't ever really get beyond the fact that these essential elements would NEVER happen.  Not even in my fantasy love story dreams. Is this an action adventure? Is this a romantic drama? Make up your mind, because it doesn't work on either level. (I'd give examples but don't want to ruin it for you if you decide to watch this movie.) Next, the characters just never realize. They remain somewhat two dimensional and I never really care about them. The combination of those two things keep this movie solidly in the bad movie category.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|QotSA's \\"... Like Clockwork\\" is easily one of the best albums to be released this year. It's an album that is very easy to listen to straight through and that's exactly what I've been doing since I downloaded it. Standout tracks include the opening \\"Keep Your Eyes Peeled\\", the hard hitting \\"My God Is the Sun\\" and \\"Kalopsia\\", which features the amazing Trent Reznor along for the ride. Again, the consistency of this album makes it not only a must listen but a must buy. The songs blend into one another perfectly and makes for just about a perfect album from the talented Josh Homme and his kick-ass band. Definitely up there with the best the band has to offer and a worthy addition to their growing catalog.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys have a passion and it comes through in the quality of their music. This deluxe edition is a great value. It's nice to have the videos on DVD instead of having to go to youtube to share with your friends.
B00006BTC7|5.0|I first listened to this band because it was compared to the likes of Joy Division and the musci scene that they generated, this is a masterpiece in it's totality and would recomend to anyone who enjoys music. Even thought thsi band is not &#34;punk&#34; as Joy division could be the singing style of paul banks is pretty similar to Ian Curtis, many bands tried to emulate this style of singing ex. Editors. They recently put out a 10th Aniversary version that i purchased on CD that is a must have if you like this band and album, there is a CD with the Demos or b-sides that is a must have.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|i expected more. I liked Casino Royale better. It was a switch from previous film as far as pacing is concerned. but it could've been better. Some scenes you expected more intelligence from the bad guy.
B00BYISRC0|4.0|As i expected this album is pretty similar to High Violet, has it's on distinct sound though. I like their earlier work due to the variation in rythms from one song to the other but i guess they found their core sound and are sticking to it, was really looking forward to owning this LP since i will be seeing the band for the first time this year.
B00CHILW64|5.0|acting was excellent. hard to believe this tsunami happened<br />so long ago, but takes through the anguish and pain this<br />family went through during this horrible storm. My favorite<br />scene is when Ewan Mcgregor asks to use a cellphone<br />and the Americans, were annoyed and said they needed<br />to save their battery in case of anything. And how annoyed<br />they were about this catastrophe & just wanted to go home.<br />lol... people are jerks!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice app its very usefully and has most of the features a scientific calculator has, beats having to by one could save some money plus the touch screen makes the interface quicker and easy
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian has excellent style and builds her characters very well.  The story line kept me engaged and wondering which I really like in a book.  I read 'girl gone' so I thought I'd try this one.  have to plug girl gone because is excellent.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It does not offer the freedom I imargined it would in terms of download sellection the view was not appealling
B001F6TXME|5.0|Great price and so much fun to use. I wish it was a bit longer, but i feel I can find an extender online somewhere.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|Very good random footage, interviews and history of the band. Great birthday present. I recommend to anyone who loved the band.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Must have. Endless fun and challenges as the game progresses. my rusty reflexes have been revived and sharpened. Great variety of characters and levels and challenge keeps you interested. Also great game to pass the time
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The recent update has totally messed up my kindle fire 7 hd.  The icons are just gray boxes now so you can't tell which application you are opening.  Before the update, I was on level 105 and now the game won't open and no icons for all other apps.  Very upset!!!!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Wow!!!! All I can say is that was a great read! It has you going  through so many emotions for this guy! It has love,lust,sadness and did I mention  it is hilarious! It has moments you literally laugh out loud! What an amazing writer and amazing read! I'm glad I stumbled across this one! I will add this author to my favorites!
1616551151|5.0|Awesome resource. My daughter is an artist and the background in this book helps her creative ability. As a gamer the background stories make the gaming experience better.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very fun and addicting! Also nice variety with slots and different Bingo games! If you have coins and no chips play slots and vise oversaw no coins but have credits play Bingo and you will get more coins! However I have been without both and you either buy more or wait for your accredits the next day love it
B004TN7QPG|2.0|I purchased this reader on the assumption that it would allow me to read and index all my e-books in one place, epub, mobi, pdf, and azw.  Unfortunately, it seems that it doesn't read most mobi's.  At least not the older ones.  All of the mobi's I bought from Mobipocket before Amazon purchased them are unreadable in MR+ Pro.  They read OK in the Kindle app, so I know the files are OK.  I contacted the author of MR+ back in April, and sent him an example of one of the problem books, but have seen no response from him since.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|The only reachable by boat part of Madagascar and Greenland make the first stages of every Plague require the water spreading evolution no matter what it is to win.  This makes the first 5 to 10 minutes of the game Boring. But after that is is a great time kill game for anyone who likes to play with numbers.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Figured out what was going on very early on in the read.  Felt like the end of the book was a cheap shot, like the author had just run out of ideas or energy so left everyone hanging.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|The first two books were great and I couldn't wait for this third book to get here and ......it's not even a completed book.  I will not waste my time or money on the next one to this series.  Seriously Sylvia is the money worth more than your loyal followers up to now?  Think about PLEASE.
0060001941|5.0|If you buy this fine edition of the classic novel, and have never read the story before, do not read the foreword. It has several spoilers.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Wife, says book is excellent reading. Amazon is an excellent company, and we will purchase more products form them..Thank you
B00BI745AA|4.0|Good movie.  Watched as I traveled from CT to TX.  I will certainly be using the movies again.  Great entertainment during stressful flying
0767840135|5.0|This was the first Cirque show I ever seen and I had to have it so I got. It is one of my favorite shows especially because it has my all time favorite performer John Gilkey in it. I love the whole show and all the performances from all of the performers but John is the main reason I got this show because he is one man that can always make me smile. The other main reason I got this show is because Cirque is an incredible experience and wonderful type of show to watch. It is incredible to see what people are capable of doing.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Cute movie.  Watched as I traveled from CT to TX.  I will certainly be using the movies again.  Great entertainment during stressful flying
B00008EY7H|5.0|This is a very beautiful and stunning show with wonderful music and incredible feet of the human body that will leave the audience in awe and bring pure joy and happiness to any ones day.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was really hoping for her to tie this \\"trilogy\\" up, but that's not going to happen. Not sure what other kind of drama can be squeezed into 2 more books? I was kind of over all the sex.. while I loooove it mostly, I bet 75% of the book is them having sex (which is still totally hot but I am wanting a little more then that). Not looking forward to spending another $20 to finish these, but I'm already in this far!
B003Q6D27S|5.0|I have the entire series and I love it. I love horror movies and this one fits right in with my collection and to have it to finish off the series. Happy to have it be apart of my vast collection of movies.
B00C061I3K|5.0|If you want a funky, groovy album with really nice ambiance, buy it.. If you are more into Homework, you might be disappointed though..
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Between this show and person of interest I watch and episode of both every single day/night I really love this show and it has one of my all time favorite actors (Micheal Emerson) in it so that makes it even better. This is a wonderful box set all of the shows plus a hidden disc, the game seen in the final season, the replica of the island, The episode guide, and all of the other stuff that came with it made this a wonderful product to buy. I love this series and I have got almost all of the action figures as well I just need Jacob and the Man in Black to finish that collection off and having this series is wonderful for me and this would be a great product for any fan of the Lost franchise.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Like most others I expected a bit more of a conclusion to Gideon and Eva's story. However I really enjoyed getting to know them in a deeper way and look forward to the next two books, hopefully sooner rather than later.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I purchased this book because I genuinely enjoyed J.K. Rowling's writing style in her Harry Potter series. I was not disappointed. This novel is very well written and she has created some truly unique characters (though they are many, I had no trouble in distinguishing them). Suffice it to say, this book is definitely very \\"British,\\" which (I believe) accounts for a few of the less-than-positive reviews. American and British humor is very different, especially when it starts to creep into the dark comedy territory. I thought the petty conflict she created to serve as a stage for her characters to come to terms with themselves and each other was brilliant. I would highly recommend this book to those who like character-driven fiction and don't mind a writing style that intermingles comedy with the macabre.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read the first two books in this series and enjoyed reading and learning about this period of time.<br />Waiting for the final one to come in kindle form. I like Ken Follett and have read many of his books.
6305132984|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of Musicals this is a must own movie. The dance numbers are all well done.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I like the way the combat experience looks when battling other players and the KRA. I also like how the units in the game can be upgraded under the fusion menu.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I remember seeing this Movie with my Mother for the first time and it always brings back fond memories.Most of the songs are hard to get out of your head for a few weeks after watching.
B00520R146|5.0|My child is obsessed with this movie and his other dvd skipped so I ordered this one. It is in perfect condition!
B0001WTWCO|5.0|This is an excellent Movie which is well acted and written. The sets and scenery are what you would expect from a Movie of this caliber.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have mixed feelings about the way it ends, but I'm not disappointed. Very sad to say goodbye to the Sookie series!!! The book is always better than the movie or show! Thanks Charline for years of great reads!!
B009NY43NY|1.0|These books were always primarily based around the vampire characters and situations. That is most likely what brought all the fans on board to begin with. I was disappointed that this book, the series FINALE, had hardly anything to do with the vampires. The series was titled &#34;The Southern VAMPIRE Mysteries&#34; - and I can't help but be disappointed that the author strayed so far from that original plot.  Definitely unhappy - and it makes it even more awful knowing that there won't be any more books that might be able to redeem this series.
B00466HN6S|5.0|This was a perfect birthday gift for a perfectly adorable little child!  She absolutely loved it!  Received great service too!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I waited it seems like forever for this  book to come out and is was well worth the wait!! Kinda pisted I don't know ho  long I have to wait for the next one!!! Never a dull moment with Eva and Giddeon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|while I initially disliked this ap, I have since grown to thoroughly enjoy it. it has definitely decreased my productivity in classes on several occasions.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was by far the most riveting I've ever read!!I loved every second of it!! I would read it again just for the thrill of discovery. Picoult is fantastic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a game that keeps me entertained for HOURS!!!! I just wish the update would come out on the kindle because my mom has a iPad and she has the update on it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined with You was everything I knew it would be! I loved it! Definitely a 5+++++++ star read!  I'm one of those people who absolutely love a cliff hanger, so I was super excited to find out there's a fourth and fifth book! For however many books Sylvia Day wants to write about Gideon and Eva, I'm going to buy and read them. Awesome!
B001NKI60W|5.0|My friend and I had each seen Mamma Mia a few years ago and had also seen the play.  We love the music of ABBA, the story written around it fits the music and the cast is wonderful.  Music, love, scenery - and Meryl Streep can do no wrong.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When is the new update coming out? My friend has a android and they got a new update? Are we getting one.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Im a HUGE fan of cut the rope and I was scared this woulndnt be as good. I was very wrong. this is awesome!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Just so sad that starting with Season 2 You want to charge me per episode. won't be doing that. Maybe if You didn't want $ 1.99 each I would watch
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a marvellous spectacle book, it is heart pounding and the end is the best end ever. It is one of the best books I ever read
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A great story about a man dealing with loss and mental illness...about always looking for good in the bad, always hoping, and learning that sometimes what we most desperately want is never ours to have, and that is because it isn't what we really need.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next installment.  Hopefully the next book comes out soon.  He always leaves you hanging. Great
B00CL68NOG|2.0|I had read the reviews on this film - it was considered fair to midland and now I see why.  So much potential with these two brilliant actors, Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand, a great premise, the possibility of real relationship between a reluctant son and overbearing mother.  Instead, the film is flat with no drama, no feeling other than skimming the surface, no trajectory even though the beginning, middle and end of a road trip provides a natural journey.  Something went wrong:  there is no \\"give\\", no investment, it feels lukewarm throughout (a far cry from a much better film, \\"Mother\\" with Debbie Reynolds and Albert Brooks.  That I recommend unreservedly for the same premise with a much better outcome.)  It does not feel like the movie even begins until well over an hour in with the eating episode.  Somehow, food transcends the vice-grip of dull moderation.  I can't recommend this film, sadly, because it is a journey that never starts and goes no where.  It is a great shame the pace is so terribly off - I wanted it to be as exceptionally good as the lead cast.
193700788X|5.0|I love this book because it is well written, entertaining, and part of my favorite series.  I hate it because it is the end.  I am so sad.  I thought at least three more books.  It is rare that we get a series that we can become so attached to.  I am very glad of the way things worked out.  I felt like the last two books had a tired of it all feel to it.  I could tell Ms. Harris was getting ready to end it.  I just didn't know it would happen so soon.  If you haven't read any of the books, you should.  So worth every penny.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This is a fun little game to kill some time. The object is to link two or more spirits (dependent on the level) in a row and clear the board. Seems simple, but does get really challenging as you progress as there don't appear to be more than one way to &#34;skin the cat&#34;. Worth a buck or two if you like puzzles.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would prefer to pay a small fee to keep the app free of ads but otherwise I have been happy with it.
B00AMEZDK6|5.0|This is a timeless classic movie. I love watching it again and again. Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are marvelous.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ok I just finished reading Sylvia Day's 3rd book in the Crossfire series. Love love the book a little disappointed that I have to again for the next book. But I can't wait. Love Eva & Gidieon
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. Because I like to feed my horse. But dont like that its so hard to get gems.
B0039N74CW|5.0|Shrek is a great movie.  Have the complete series.  Music is great.  4 year old knows the songs and says Shrek when in the car and a song comes on.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Progressive, amusing, and just plain fun.  Have enjoyed my blast from the past and look forward to the next season.
193700788X|1.0|The book has no real ending, once again leaves you wondering but we will never know the answers because nothing is in writing!
B001XUPGLY|5.0|Great performances by the original series cast and especially Nimoy, but then I was always partial to Mr. Spock! Try it, even out of sequence, and you'll be delighted.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best alarm app ever :) I recommend it! It wakes you up on time and it shows how many hours you need before the alarm goes on.
159463176X|5.0|6 yrs wait was worth it,a excellent book and gives more indepth knowledge about afghan way of life and their  lifestyle

0525425772|1.0|it sucks the worst kid lawyer book by john grisham ,not in the same league as his other 3 books
B00992CF6W|5.0|i still need the upgrade. but it is really cool to play. It always keeps me on my kindle. Awesome.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great book, was browsing for something new to read between \\"a song if ice and fire\\" and really liked.<br />Interesting spin and good cast of characters that are likable and well developed. I liked it alot and told a few friends about it ant they all liked it as well.
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|- &#34;Jesus and the Devil&#34; tune kicks nicely.  The album grows on you. Would love to hear more high velocity songs with this mix but by the end of the day you're visiting an old buddy.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|2 words:  Carol Burnett.  Are you kidding?  Funny, raunchy, rotten, awful, yet somehow lovable character performed by well known tv variety show personality.  A great movie, but the heartwarming aspect mitigated by some excellent reality.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is an amazing book, by a neurosurgeon who experienced a near death experience that transformed his life. While I've always believed that science, technology, and spirituality are linked, and consciousness goes beyond the physical individual, it is great to hear this from someone with a scientific background.
B00004RFFS|5.0|These are old school vampires:  the real thing, a la Dracula and the ilk.  No werewolves, no babies, one kid and she's not really allowed.  Excellent movie.  Adult son requested I buy this.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This case is very convenient to carry your device around when you're not using it. I had no problems with it.

B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I Haven't had a band come out with a new cd in a long time that kept my attention and excitement through the whole cd like this one DOES!!!  I HIGHLY recommend giving this one a try guys!!  Won't be sorry!
B0039LAPWK|1.0|This is a terrible rip-off!!! I saved the viewing of this item for months after I received it, so I could enjoy the film in its entirety... Only to find out it only plays on \\"Region B\\" Blu-ray players, whatever that means. No warning about this in the product description. Extremely dissatisfied. I was scammed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I truly love Gideon and Eva's story!!!<br /><br />And the sex...raw, hot and so intense.<br /><br />But the end...didn't see that coming.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Ive had it for about 2 weeks and I'm surprised with it especially being a Disney&trade;  app.  It does have flaws but they're not major. :)  I also like that it's free. Yes I paid $6.99 for Minecraft and $0.99 for &quot;Where's Perry?&quot; But so far this is the best free Disney&trade; app!
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Alice in Chains return just shy of a four year hiatus with their fifth studio album, 2013's [[ASIN:B00BQ1D7X4 The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here]]. Very much characteristic of the band's signature grunge, hard-rocking sound, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here ends up being nothing short of enjoyable.  The most elite cuts of the effort are incredibly memorable.  The non-standouts aren't shabby either, but often tend to be too repetitive or somewhat one-dimensional in conception.  One thing that is consistent is that the near 70 minute effort certain rocks.<br /><br />\\"Hollow\\" opens capably, establishing the dark, malicious nature that has been associated with the band for years.  Excellent recurrent guitar riffs help to unify musically, while the songwriting stands out, particularly lyric \\"Silence so loud / silence I can't tell my up from down.\\"  Follow-up cut \\"Pretty Done\\" impresses with its `in-your-face' guitars, even if it ends up standing out less than the opener and sports too much repetition.  The chorus definitely captures ones attention (\\"I'm pretty done / once a favored son / I'm pretty done / slap me `round for fun...\\").  \\"Stone\\" is a more notable showing, with aggressive bass and the accessories of the drum kit establishing an evolving groove from the get-go.  A head-nodder, Stone is irresistible, particular simple chorus emphasizes words \\"Cold, dry, stone...\\"<br /><br />\\"Voices\\" opens nebulously, with things eventually establishing themselves (a stable groove).  The main gripe about \\"Voices\\" is it overstays its welcome a minute or so too long.  The lengthier \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" is a actually a stronger, more likable cut, despite approaching seven minutes.  Heavy, noted for its chromatic colorful tones, \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" represents the band at their best.  \\"Lab Monkey\\" keeps the momentum elevated, giving Alice in Chains a second consecutive home-run.  Perversely dark in sound,  you wouldn't think Jerry Cantrell and company were middle-aged rockers.<br /><br />\\"Low Ceiling\\" remains dark, but doesn't sound quite as foreboding as some.  The lyrics still don't scream optimism (\\"Finding ceilings low / I'm too big or this room's too small / why's my ceiling another's floor...\\").  \\"Breath on a Window\\" proceeds  solidly, but like \\"Low Ceiling\\" still falls short of the title track's glory.  \\"Scalpel\\" comes closer (\\"It's a lie, you hide in someone else / like a shining scalpel, cut yourself), even if it doesn't supersede the best.  One positive attribute is that the band `turns down' some, contrasting previous, highly dynamic cuts.  The band returns full throttle on \\"Phantom Limb\\", a seven minute juggernaut rivaling \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\".  Jagged/angular riffs, gargantuan sound, and a driving quality help to make it one of the effort's top five.  \\"Ego pulverized / no better medicine / angels have been advised / don't want no requiem\\", the lyrics snarl.  \\"Hung on a Hook\\" and \\"Choke\\" close out the album solidly, but both lack the same punch and vigor of top-echelon knockouts.<br /><br />Ultimately, [[ASIN:B00BQ1D7X4 The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here]] is a great reminder of the magic and power of Alice in Chains. Perhaps nothing will ever supersede \\"Man in the Box\\" or \\"Rooster\\", but standouts the likes of \\"Hollow\\", \\"Stone\\", \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\", and \\"Phantom Limb\\" are strong representations from rock royalty.  Highly recommended.kers.<br /><br />\\"Low Ceiling\\" remains dark, but doesn't sound quite as foreboding as some.

B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is just as addicting as the other flow games. The neon colors gives eyes a break from primary colors. Give it a try and you will love it too.
B00BYISQTO|4.0|Indie-darlings The National deliver once more with their 2013 effort, [[ASIN:B00BYISQTO Trouble Will Find Me]], released via 4AD.  Throughout the solid, enjoyable effort, frontman Matt Berninger's baritone fluctuates between overt clarity and lower-register casualness and nonchalance.  Although sometimes divisive vocally, Berninger certainly adds both magic and character alongside his bandmate's superb musical contributions.<br /><br />\\"I Should Live In Salt\\" establishes a tone, opting against the archetypical 4/4 adding a timing `hiccup' to  distinguish itself.  The different sounds present themselves organically and natural, making the opener convey a strong first impression.  \\"Demons\\" is stronger, even if vocally one is unsure initially where Matt Berninger is going with his gravelly, somewhat unemotional lower register performance.  He eventually ascends, aiding in bring the `demons' full circle.  If nothing more, the chorus is simple (\\"But I stay down with my demons...\\") while lyric (\\"...when I walk into a room I do not light it up...\\" adds indie-comic relief and just a plain, memorable lyric.  If \\"Demons\\" wasn't enough, the five-star worthy \\"Don't Swallow the Cap\\" ensures the listener is mesmerized as Berninger constantly reflects whether it's \\"I'm not alone / I'll never be / and tot eh bone I'm evergreen...\\" or \\"...I have faith but don't believe it / it's not there enough to leave it\\".  \\"Don't Swallow the Cap\\" presents a sound argument as Trouble Will Find Me's top-rated cut.<br /><br />\\"Fireproof\\" may not quite have the `fire' of juggernauts \\"Demons\\" or \\"Don't Swallow the Cap\\", but it continues a strong quality-laden run.  \\"You're fireproof,\\" Berninger sings on the refrain \\"...nothing breaks your heart / you're fireproof.\\"  The restraint of \\"Fireproof\\" is contrasted on single \\"Sea of Love\\", where the dynamics are louder, particularly pummeling drums.  The titular lyric is highlighted (\\"If I stay here, trouble will find me...\\"), though lyrics like \\"...but they say love is a virtue, don't they?\\" or \\"I see you rushing down / what did Harvard teach you?\\" may be more clever, particularly to the indie-lover's heart.  \\"Heavenfaced\\" features appropriate music to match its theme and lyrics, laying as well as anything else does up until this point.  \\"This is The Last Time\\" may be a slight disappointment if one is to be found on Trouble Will Find Me, as it is a bit long and perhaps humdrum compared to the best.<br /><br />\\"Graceless\\" is more notable, establishing a stable groove from the get-go and memorable lyrics throughout.  On \\"Slipped\\", Berninger confesses \\"...I'll never be anything you ever want me to be / I keep coming back here where everything slipped...\\", and while it is `tortured' perhaps, it is quite pleasing vocally, lyrically, and musically to the ear. \\"I Need My Girl\\" has its clever, humorous lines (\\"Remember when you lost your... and drove the car into the garden? You gout out and said I'm sorry to the vines and no one saw it...\\"), but \\"Humiliation\\" is true `the ace in the hole', `chocked full to the brim' with musical excellence.  Penultimate cut \\"Pink Rabbits\\" is a dandy, with clear vocals from Berninger, who asks \\"Am I the one you think about when you're sitting in your fainting chair drinking pink rabbits?\\" \\"Hard to Find\\" closes solidly, but doesn't stand out compared to the top echelon.  Even so, the ambience created by an array of sounds is worthwhile.<br /><br />Ultimately, The National triumph more often than not on [[ASIN:B00BYISQTO Trouble Will Find Me]].  It isn't a perfect sweep, but it's pretty doggone good.  There is more than enough enjoyment to be had.  It may not eclipse Vampire Weekend's juggernaut in [[ASIN:B00BB22GQM Modern Vampires of the City]] (arguably the year's best alternative album), but it definitely one of 2013's better albums.y say love is a virtue, don't they?\\" or \\"I see you rushing down / what did Harvard teach you?\\" may be more clever, particularly to the indie-lover's heart.  \\"Heavenfaced\\" features appropriate music to match its theme and lyrics, laying as well as anything else does up until this point.  \\"This is The Last Time\\" may be a slight disappointment if one is to be found on Trouble Will Find Me, as it is a bit long and perhaps humdrum compared to the best.<br /><br />\\"Graceless\\" is more notable, establishing a stable groove from the get-go and memorable lyrics throughout.

B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is a really good follow-up to Matched. I look forward to finishing the series. It reminds me of The Uglies series.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Good movie with great music.<br />Not sure about Sacha Baron Cohen number, seemed a bit slow.<br />Overall this dvd was worth the price.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Couldn't put this down. Loved all the characters and how their lives intertwined. Ready for the second book. Also ready to watch the first season of the HBO show
B00499NHLC|3.0|Should have known it wouldn't live up to the hype.  Heard so many people raving, but it really just didn't work for me.  Not a fan of the Watson character in this and stealing Jimmy Neutrons brain blast for ideas really took me out of the show.  Still worth a look if you like Brit TV.

B007IXWL2C|2.0|The first and Second books were nice and couldn't put them down but the third was not necessary to be written. Too repetitive and boring.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|--------No Spoilers Ahead ----------<br />One of my biggest fears in any series that have ten or more books in it, is that the story line becomes exhausted and all you get are a formula romances where everything is predictable. Repeatable even. It is not the case with Nalini Singh.<br /><br />I think all the books before this were necessary for the Psy/Changeling world to come to a place where this was possible. I won't mention the details, as many of the people are yet to read, but it's suffice to say - the book is explosive.<br /><br />It's not just romance that drives it; it's not a case of few, predictable events generated simply to highlight the romance part. The overall plot of the series (which picks up speed immensely in this book) works hand in hand with the love story one furthering another to the point where a reader is sitting on the edge of his seat desperate to find out what happens next.<br /><br />And there are many things to find out, many things that will leave you speechless and awestruck. Many details that make Heart of Obsidian into one of the most thrilling, intense rides of your life.<br /><br />I mean any author who could turn a character such as Kaleb into a likable, relatable lead without destroying what he is, without changing him fundamentally, must be a genius. She manages everything nicely: lets him stay true to himself and gives us a glimpse into the darkest corners of his soul. Furthermore, Nalini Singh pens Kaleb and Sahara as a couple it's not possible not to adore. Because despite of their flaws, they complete each other.<br /><br />I must admit I waited for this book so much, I paid 18 bucks for my kindle edition just to put my hands on it as soon as possible. And while the amount of money is actually preposterous for an e-book (especially considering that the same e-book costs 7 bucks less if bought two days later) I'm so thrilled with the read I don't even care about the extra costs. Because lets face it, most books that you wait for so long, and built enormous expectations not even trying to, let you down. But not Heart of Obsidian.<br /><br />It has everything: a breathtaking romance, suspense, the drama and action you won't believe until you read it. I don't think I can stress enough how much I loved it. All I can say - it'll spin your world upside down before you even knew what hit you.<br />Heart of Obsidian will be very, very hard to top. And I can't wait to see what Nalini Singh whips for the next one.t for so long, and built enormous expectations not even trying to, let you down.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I was so happy to hear there will be two more books to this series.  The wait will be tough, but I know it will be worth it.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|By the end of the season, I was on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait until next season!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put this down. So many twists and turns. So many changes.  Ana and Christian seem to be in for a surprise in the next book. Hmmmm.... I wonder what was on that computer that Barney saw..
0425263924|4.0|I really love the first 2 books, especially the ending of the second book was surprising. After having waited a long time for this book, I was so excited to have a look at the final ending. Since the german edition will be released in July, so I bought the english edition. But to my surprice, there is no ending in this book. So I feel just as disappointed as other people here. But honestly, the book is not that bad. I enjoyed reading it in the last two days. And I may still buy the next books.<br /><br />English is not my motherlanguage, but trilogy means ONE, TWO, THREE. Not four, five. I dont think its a bad planning, we all know what it is. So at this point, I am really disappointed. However, it's still worth reading.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was very anxious for the third book to come out! I loved the first two. I am addicted to the first two!! The thrid was horrible. Trying to decide if I am done with Sylvia Day or give her one more chance to redeem herself with the forth book.
B00015YVD6|4.0|I remember seeing this movie back when I was a kid. I loved the FX, the goofiness of Tom Hanks, and of course Daryl Hannah. After recently rewatching this movie, what I didn't remember was the nudity! I'm guessing my young male brain couldn't handle it at that stage. But I just really can't believe this is PG! Daryl was literally walking around naked for the first 20 minutes of the movie. How did this get a PG rating? Just found it kind of funny and had to post something on it. But it really is a quality movie, so enjoy.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I've waited almost a year for the third book of this, so called, trilogy. Disappointed doesn't even cover how I feel! I'm almost inclined to boycott the publishing company for allowing/recommending this BULLCRAP!<br /><br />First, I'm so getting a refund! Second, if there weren't pages of OVER describing the same buildings, people, and furniture! This was all described in detail in the first 2 books! Is this the reason Mrs. Day ran out of book space? Third, the ending, REALLY? I mean.......REALLY? HOW COULD YOU? I will admit the first to books had me hooked! But I'm like most other readers when it comes to reading more of the same crap.....DONE!!!!!! Give me the bad writing of 50 shades any day of the week compared to this rip off! Out of curiosity, is it another year before your next description of new York is published? Not that I care but good Lord, I still can't believe I waited a year for this crap! NEVER AGAIN SYLVIA DAY, NEVER AGAIN.<br /><br />REFUND IS COMING!!!!!

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this book with anticipation all the way through.  It was detailed very well and gave excellent portrayals of the characters.  I loved it.  Couldn't lay it down.  Will definitely read Grissom's next novel.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is addicting.  There are some differences between amazon app and play store apps. The Amazon version is little more difficult to build.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A friend of mine has been recommending this for years. With the movie coming this summer, I wanted to read it before even seeing the trailer. I thought it one of the best thoughtful sci-fi stories I've read in a while. I'm currently enjoying the sequel with a much-matured Ender and the \\"piggies\\".
B0055QYKQO|1.0|Can't get the thing to POST at all. Seems no power is going through the board. Tried with THREE different power supplies (all 3 psu's worked on other setups), tried with a couple different cases and checked and rechecked the wiring. Everything was plugged in correctly, my cpu is advertised as supported by the board and it's compatibility was confirmed by Gigabyte tech support (using an AMD FX 6350 processor). After the first one didn't work, I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement and the replacement didn't work either. Should have bought an Asus board in the first place.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I appreciate all Amazon does for their Customers.  Great policies and they continue to provide the support needed to keep me as a loyal Amazon customer.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A wonderful addition to the series, hoping there is more to come.  I think this may have been my favorite in the series.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I'm deeply disappointed by how lacking this book is; there is no real plot and a ton of incomplete little sub-plots. $10.09 and several months later, an over-extended prologue is poorly passed off as a novel - fans of the series deserve better than that. And where is the professional integrity?? It's gone from a trilogy to a 5 book series and the transition (through Book 3) was dismal!<br /><br />In my opinion this was a huge miscalculation, from Day and her team, because it's a missed opportunity to solidify her (previously) growing fan-base. I was ready to be clinched as a die-hard Sylvia Day fan by this book; I was ready to start buying every single one of her published books and eagerly wait for her to publish more however this has completely removed any chance of that ever happening. Which is quite sad because she is a decent author.<br /><br />You should have just concluded the series and moved on to others with your professional integrity and solid fan-base intact, Day. Hopefully you'll learn from this and respect your fans a little bit more from here onwards. And, yes, I returned the book - which I NEVER do.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun it updates every few weeks with a new version, is flawless with no glitches, and is easy to run and free. It's a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for something to do.
0894803123|3.0|Basic Recipe's ,Better books out there, But it is a good book to get you started, I'd give it a try .
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This game is a great way to pass the time.... very good to keep the ages of 7-11 occupied .
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I can't figure out how to play it.  I tried but couldn't understand it or<br /> find any  directions on how to play.
B008JFUMDS|5.0|I thought that the movie was amazing. While the beginning was a little confusing at first, it all wraps up in the end, and all the surprises and twists throughout the movie keeps the watcher in suspense the whole time. The characters all play their roles exceedingly well, and the movie as a whole was a fantastic production. I mean, who doesn't love Morgan Freeman and Dave Franco, whose roles in this film were portrayed so wonderfully well, that any other actors just wouldn't have been the same. With all the great chase scenes, and the scenes where magic is used for fighting, one simply cannot sit still. The special effects are a complete technological masterpiece, with everything from all the magic tricks to the wonderful FBI scenes. All of the magicians and FBI agents keep the viewer on the edge of the seat, making one wonder what is really up their sleeves.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|First let me say I do not agree will all the one star reviews due to the fact that they are mad because their will be more books in the series.  If you follow the author at all you would have known that the likely hood of more books was HUGE.  She alluded to it more than once.<br /><br />Anyway onto my review....This was the second series I read after 50 shades and since then I have read a lot of books in this genre.  I was sooooo excited for this book as I loved books 1 and 2! So when I started the book I was a little disappointed to the say the least.  I felt the first half moved so slow and all we were getting was a lot of steamy scenes.  Once I hit the halfway mark the booked picked up and I was getting happier.  By about 75% I was very happy.  I really enjoyed the last 75% and I am now very excited for books 4 and 5, if their is a 5.  As well their wasn't a horrible cliffhanger and we weren't left shocked like in book 2.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series read this book and let's hope that 4 takes us back to how fabulous 1 and 2 were!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I know there has been a great deal of controversy over Sookie's final choice of a long-term lover, but I am in total agreement with Ms. Harris on her decision. It is true to Sookie's deep-seated beliefs and desires. There was really no other way to go. Thanks, Charlaine Harris, for making the difficult decision for our beloved Sookie!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Written well. A great American Hero's story. Not a can't put down book but very entertaining. Good beach or anytime reading.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|The book has about 412 pages.  I'm on page 311 and struggling to get to the end.  I am NOT a \\"twixt\\", or \\"tween\\" nor a teen. Maybe that's why I'm just -- getting tired.<br />Maybe ONE DAY I'll go back and finish.  I stopped at the \\"RUIN\\" chapter.<br />However, I do think a young person in the appropriate age group who LIKES TO READ, would enjoy this story.

B004FOA84A|3.0|I liked it alot. Nice graphics but I solved it too fast.  For a pay game it should be longer.
B009JZZRGE|5.0|The BEST acted show on TV!  Great plotting, superb acting, riveting and engrossing. A &#34;can't miss&#34; series. I'll guarantee you will be pleased with the show.
B00915G6YE|5.0|Dexter is a show that certainly has had its ups and downs.  Very much of it is implausible, and it definitely takes a lot of suspension of disbelief.  But this season really began to focus on what has really always been the question.  What would happen if the wrong person found out about Dexter.  Granted yes, others have found out that he is a serial killer, and he has always been able to end up with the upper hand.  Yet, the one person he will not kill had never found out about him.  That changed this season (actually at the very end of last season), and the storyline dealing with that fallout was great.<br /><br />Another wonderful addition to the season was Yvonne Strahovski, as a true love interest.  As anyone who watched Chuck knows, she is a very talented actress beyond being drop dead gorgeous, and she played the character as cunning, vulnerable, dangerous and loving.  Unlike any of the other love interests she was not blind to what Dexter is, over the top crazy, or damaged.  Yet the character is crazy and damaged but in different ways than Lila and Lumen.<br /><br />The other story of the season was Dexter as a target of a Ukrainian mobster.  It is in a lot of ways the filler story of the season, but even so has its own little twists and turns and basically gives Dexter something to deal with while trying to keep even more people from finding out his secret.  Sgt. Doakes returns via flashbacks in the final episode of the season and the season ends on a more shocking moment than last season did.<br /><br />Dexter is not a show that will appeal to everyone, given the subject matter and the style of the show.  If you have been a fan of the series though, you will definitely like this season.  Even if your interest in the show has been waning, I think it lays a good foundation going into the final season for ending the story.
098555780X|5.0|Excellent book, chock full of pictures, diagrams and explanations, written by someone who clearly loves knotting paracord.<br /><br />The book wasn't quite for me, however.<br /><br />I was interested in a book that explained how to make paracord bracelets WITH plastic side-clip buckles.<br /><br />This book describes how to make many different types of paracord bracelets that connected often with a two-strand diamond know on one end, inserted into a simple loop on the other end of the bracelet.<br /><br />(perhaps for the paracord &#34;purists&#34; who only want to use paracord, without a plastic commercial buckle?)<br /><br />Author J.D. Lenzen also tells you about his extensive YouTube channel with videos that did explain what I was looking for.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|First off, let me say that I love these books and that I am a huge Sylvia Day fan but this is outrageous!  We have been invested in the Crossfire books for well over a year with no resolution.  Now god only knows how long we are going to have to wait for the next book.  I read that there might even be 2 more books.  WTH!  I don't mind paying for Gideon Cross but I have a huge problem if I have to wait another 9 months for the 4th book.  One of the reasons why FSOG was so popular was because all 3 books were out to read, one after another.  No waiting and becoming anxious and excited then being let down.<br /><br />I didn't love this book because I knew it wasn't going to end the series.  Have to be honest with you, EVA made me really mad at times but GIDEON always made me happy.<br /><br />Sylvia you didn't loose me because I think you are a wonderful author and I loved these Crossfire books way more then any other books on my Kindle.  But you are going to have to make this up to all your loyal fans.  Get that 4th book out sooner rather then later and I suggest you give us some of GIDEON's POV.
0307743659|5.0|I have now read the book twice, seen the Kubrick film countless times, and viewed the TV miniseries. I first read \\"The Shining\\" 20 years ago and didn't like it. The Kubrick film for me was so iconic that it was very hard to separate it from Stephen King's original book. It took me a while, but if you can separate the book from the film in your mind it will haunt you in a whole new way.<br /><br />There are literally hundreds of plot summaries of \\"The Shining,\\" so I will dispense with that for the purposes of this review. I will point out that where the book really shines (ahem) is in its grittiness and in its history of the hotel. King gets downright nasty in the book with his unsparing descriptions of Jack's alcoholic self-destruction. We get into Jack's head and see the dark, twisted logic that begins to take hold in the corners of his mind. We get into Doc's and Dick Hallorann's heads to understand their gifts more fully. Most importantly, King uses the scrapbook of the Overlook's history to help get us into the hotel's \\"mind\\" and how it has grown its power and menace steadily since the turn of the century.<br /><br />The Kubrick film is excellent in its own right, but it really is a separate story written mostly by Stanley Kubrick himself with inspiration from Stephen King. The TV miniseries was more faithful to the book but the acting by Rebecca De Mornay, Steven Weber, and Melvin Van Peebles is roll-your-eyes cheesy at times. Stephen King's book is the first and best version. Nowhere else do you get the full psychological isolation and terror that makes \\"The Shining\\" so special.<br /><br />Clear your mind of both filmed versions, open the book, and begin anew like I did. Don't let anyone else's interpretation get between you and Stephen King's twisted whispering going directly into your ear on a long, dark, sleepless night. If you want the full \\"Shining\\" experience, that's the way to do it.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Excellent recounting of the mission as we would be allowed to know very entertaining<br />Stealthy and slick good show.<br />billw...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun and some are challenging which is good. Picture quality is good. Processing speed can be slow at times but all in all it is pretty good for a free app
B00BHMF578|5.0|Watched this movie with my daughter in law. She was amazed that the hostage situation had been so violent and went on for so long,she learnt a bit of history ala Hollywood. Was this the stirrings oh what we see today.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A nice, quick read...almost too quick! I had no idea what to expect, and happily found it to be a captivating story. Looking forward to watching the film!
B005YDLJ76|3.0|The concert itself wasn't as great as I had hoped, and was pretty brief for what I expected, but it was still worth watching. I probably would not have purchased the DVD had I watched the concert beforehand.<br /><br />The DVD packaging is annoying, because there's not a sleeve or anything you can &#34;snap&#34; to prevent the DVDs from falling out. Hard to transport, or just keep in place for that matter.
B009KEN87O|5.0|love the look and feel of the game.its oldshool with a twist, hard to beat a game that's as good as. this.rare game in the sea of crap.
B005LMEB8E|3.0|I was never a Demi Lovato fan and had never watched her Disney shows, but when I saw her on 20/20 one night, I was interested in her story since I have experienced similar issues. Skyscraper was wonderful, and was the best song on the album. I thought &#34;All Night Long&#34; was a fun way to start out the record, and I loved Timbaland's production of that record. Give Your Heart a Break, which turned out to be her second single, was great and catchy. The only problem? I had been listening to that song long before it became a single, so when it exploded and I heard it everywhere, it annoyed the crap out of me! There weren't any other stand out songs that I loved, but still a good purchase. I feel like it was still very tween/teen, and not as mature as I expected.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that it was not consistent at all. The track arrangement was all over the place. It was a dance song, a slow song, etc. and didn't make much sense. That probably doesn't bother most people, but when you listen to an album straight through, it really didn't &#34;flow&#34;.
B0091REZMW|5.0|mystery manor looks great.  no bugs found at this moment. enjoyable format.  the objects in the game look realistic and are easy the use touch screen to capture.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|I enjoy Rihanna's fun dance music, so I downloaded this CD. I really don't love any of the tracks other than Love Without Tragedy (and I don't like Mother Mary very much - I had to use a software to separate the two so I could listen to LWT alone). Her starting single Diamonds didn't wow me, but I started to like it after she released the version with Kanye West on it. I don't really like her current single, Stay, but I can see how that would appeal to wider audiences, and it does show off her voice well.<br /><br />Still hoping for another Good Girl Gone Bad record someday!
0316098329|5.0|This is my favorite book.  It's a horrible situation but a beautiful story about kids, relationships, development, survival, parenting, and more.  I could have discussed several facets of this for weeks.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|The fact that Britney completed and released this album during her breakdown with no promotion other than the VMAs (which, well, we all know how that went), I was surprised when I first heard it. I bought the actual, physical CD only recently, but I've had the MP3 version since it came out. The tracks are so innovative and different, and just really different from anything we'd heard in 2007 (or before). I listen to instrumentals of songs, so being able to pick up the beats really enhances the listening experience. This album was put together fabulously. Don't be fooled by the music videos from this CD - the songs are great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good app for horse lovers; this is a top pick for anyone who enjoys the company of horses but can't afford one.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|As a 14 year old I have tried out a lot of games.  Some better than others, this is definitely one of the most addicting games ever made for the fire.  Right up there next to &quot;town building games&quot; like &quot;rebuild&quot; and &quot;world at arms&quot;, which, in my opinion just take way too long.  So if you are wanting a fun game FOR FREE I would recommend it.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|The padding in this cover is very good for protection of the kindle as well as giving you a good grip when carrying.<br />The swivel feature is nice for setting up on a table for reading or studying. Even for watching movies on a long flight!<br />The cover has multiple slots for adjusting the angle for best viewing too. The only con I have about this product is a small one,<br />I wish the sides were fully enclosed to keep out contaminants.<br />Over all....A very well made cover at a fair price.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This is a movie that (as I see it) is a great tribute to all the great actors and movies of all time in the field of fright or horror. Tim Burton really came through on this and not in his usual broken mental way of saying what he was trying to say. No offence to Tim Burton I like him just move past it and with this he did. It shows the great respect he has for those who came before him and a delicate tribute to all. I tell every one.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I hadn't played backgammon for years and didn't like other backgammon games I found online because you always played with someone else online. With this game,you can just play the computer if you want. So you can be a hermit and not interact with anyone. I've only played to difficulty 2 and so far the computer has never won. In fact, I've won several doubles. Time to step up the difficulty level to get it more competitive.
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|I have always loved this album! I had it on vinyl and wish I still did. Everyone I knew also thought it was a great \\"self portrait\\" of Dylan. I won't repeat what others have said here, only ditto. Self Portrait, Blood On the Tracks and Infidels are my all time favorite Dylan albums and I was liking him when the first hit the stores. The mark of a true artist is not to be repetitive, while maintaining your signature. Glad to see so many great reviews of this.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I thought this book was a fun read, especially considering it dealt with the fortold Apocalypse. When ever you get a lot of people together to do anything, mistakes will happen, and the Apocalypse really isn't any different. I had to keep reading to see the mess unfold. I thought all the characters were fun and engaging, but frankly wanted to see much more of Crowly and Aziraphale. Together, they had the best dialog and interaction, and I just wish there had been a lot more of them together in it.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|These books are awesome!  I usually don't read at work because ten minute breaks just don't cut it ,but with this series I read as often as I can, so hard to put down.  Going to go get the next book  now!
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|It was a funny movie from start to end and I laughed till I cried in parts!  Perfect pairing of Seth Rogen and Barbara Striesand.  Loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|When can I get the update to 0.7.0??? I want it very badly!! My brother got it on his ipod but I can't seem to find it or get it for my Kindle Fire....  :(
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|The preview looked interesting and while parts started to grab me - I tried watching it 3 times and fell asleep each time...The actors are awesome but the story line lost me....again and again and again...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I waited since 31 December 2012 for this book to come out (yes that was indeed the initial release date). Finally the 3rd time set release date of June 5th was there. My purpose was to buy the trilogy and read all three books over the weekend. Good thing I read some reviews first and found out in time that this trilogy will consist of no less than 5 books!<br /><br />The relation between an author and the reader is based on reciprocity: the author writes a book which the reader will hopefully enjoy, while the reader purchases (and hopefully enjoys) the book. It is also about a relation of trust. Sylvia Day has shown where her priorities are. Breaching the fragile bond of trust with her readers and sacrifice on the quality of the books is considered secondary to the prospect of 2 money making books. Today I decided that allowing this to happen will ultimately sent a message to other authors that promises to the readers can and may be broken. I will not be purchasing any of the books in the trilogy...uhm I mean quintet!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I love this movie! we watched it at the theater, but wanted to watch it again. loved it then, love it now
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is my favorite album by my favorite band and all the songs are exceptionally good. Plus the guitar is phenomenal and it all flows well together.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I especially like Gorgio By Moroder, which built upon late '70s disco hooks to a finale of wonderful improvised guitar play as does Motherboard. Fragmants Of Time, which had undertones of Alan Parsons and 10CC from the same period was another bright spot in an overall stellar effort. It is the favorite set in my Daft Punk collection. It all sits well between Juno Reactor and Bassnectar in my Walkman.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After months of waiting for this book to be released I finally was looking forward to reading the book . This book was such a let down. I am completely in love with the first 2 books but after waiting this long to read such garbage. Nothing major really happened and the main thing that took place in the book was so rushed I didn't even get a chance to savor it because their were no details. This book was pretty much about the drama with all of the other characters. I just feel so robbed after waiting so long to read this book. I'm completely upset over it. Sylvia Day why would you do this to your loyal readers who brag about you as an author and how well you delivered. With such delayed release date I would have expected this book be perfection. Instead I got short changed.
B001FA0NZ6|1.0|The selling point is name recognition. Bobbi Brown. I have to concurrent with other reviewers to say the content is lacking ad a self promotional book. If your good at what you do, don't be afraid to show it too the world. No one is going to put you out of business. Not everyone wants to be a makeup artist or something else. Quit with the scarcity mentality and just maybe, people will quit stabbing each other in the back to get ahead. Completion is in your head not with someone else. Create your own niche. It's not necessarily what you know than who you know.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved reading the book, but it felt like filler.  We didn't get as much thought out detail, just little vignettes. (trip here, dinner here, discussion/night out here, meeting, observation)  Luckily, there was enough hot sex to keep me from discarding the book.  I was disappointed by the ending and will wait for books 4 & 5.  I think some of the ratings are bunk.  It's definitely not below a 3.5 read.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love playing this game. I like to challenge my friends to see who gets the higher score. Its so much fun.!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Wonderful app... my 7 &amp; 10 yr old, luv it.  my youngest got the hang of it faster than I thought she would,the older child loves getting ready for the battles lol.
1600247245|4.0|I was sorry when this one was over!  I listened to it in the car on the way to work, and looked forward to the drive just to hear more of this story.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|pretty fun to play. a little bit of a challenge but that's ok. easy is just boring anyways. have fun!
B0000067L2|5.0|Cream is Fantastic Rock n roll, I love this band from a better time this music is timeless , well done songs which are a pleasure to listen to from a short lived Group ,This music c.d is a time machine which will take you back to real rock n roll fun.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Very good movie. Ultra violent and the story is very intense.<br />What I liked about this movie is that Dredd never took off his helmet, and that's awesome!
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book about a woman escaping an abusive marriage and finding a new home. After the death of her brother, Matt, Megan moves to the small town of Pride to bury him and escape her ex husband Derek. Todd and his family welcome Megan and look after her while she recuperates. Before long Megan decides to stay and continue her brother's dream of opening a bed and breakfast.<br /><br />I thank the author for the opportunity to read this book and am looking forward to the second book.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Well so far I  have found it very good, although I have not finished putting it up yet. It is so much clearer than the Kindle instructions that are online. It's a good book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva ~ Ace & Angel ~ SIGH!  This 3rd installment was so worth the wait!  Loved the story, love how they continue to work through their issues  while not putting up with each other's crap and LOVE their hot & sizzling love for one another!<br />Sylvia Day you did it again and I am grateful there will be 2 more books in the Crossfire Series - HOT HOT HOT and such a great read- although I read it so fast to see what was going to happen next that I need to re-read to savor the story:)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Thanks for the game. My little cousin loves the game. She always asks to play it. It's enjoyable to her. Thanks
B009439HEY|5.0|This collection that Steve Hackett has created covers the Genesis catalog wonderfully. The versions presented here have been redone and energized.<br />There are some songs which are done as the original.  Others have been done in an updated manner. Any fan of Steve Hackett will appreciate this set.
B003K15INU|3.0|I find Roth's writing style uneven. At times he is very wordy, but then has moments of startling clarity !  The book is dark and cynical and I can't say that I enjoyed it, but I will be thinking about it for a long time !
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm only about halfway through, but it's really holding my interest.  This is the first book I've read by this author. In fact, I never heard of her until recently.  The writing is excellent and the story/character development is great.  I say it's like peeling an onion because you keep finding out bits of information that may (probably will) change your assessment of the characters.  I particularly like having the two main characters give your their (very different) views of the same situation.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I had suspected that the release of this novel was delayed in order to give the author more time to write sequels. While I can't fault Ms. Day for capitalizing on the success of the first two books in her &#34;trilogy,&#34; this installment had too many extraneous, forced sub-plots, and there were entirely too many insignificant characters introduced. The story no longer flows.<br />Everything worthwhile that happened between Eva and Gideon in this book could have been summarized in a tidy epilogue in the second book. Sometimes the best thing you can do for a good story is to end it.
1401937268|5.0|I would recommend this set for the experienced and the novice alike.  This set is colorful, creative, and conducive to learning and truly understanding the meaning of the cards.  The book that comes with the set is just detailed enough to give you points to consider without limiting what you can interpret from your readings.  You will not regret this purchase!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I LOVE the first 2 of this series but this was a waste of time and money. To promise a trilogy and then not finish the story was just wrong on so many levels. Gideon is the only good part of this book- everything else was just filler. So disappointed that Ms Day has done this to her loyal readers that I will not be buying the last 2 books of this \\"trilogy\\".  I have purchased 100's of books from Amazon and this will be the first time that I have ever returned a book.
B002VECMAO|5.0|And this movie isn't about big explosions or conspiracies - more about how truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.  The actors do a fantastic job keeping you interested and entertained!! Great movie!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Omg I am in love with this app pinch me somebody plz this app is amazing I am a artist so I find this very useful
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game im a pc fan, but the 6.2 update is out and the appstore still says it's in 6.1. Please get update!!!!!!
B0000DZTIL|5.0|Comedy at its best while the fun and laughter will continue throughout the movie. The ideas and imaginations of the writer and with the cast doing a great job convincing its really happening makes this show fabulous. The story is about a young boy after he discovers a bright light on a restricted air force base property. Everything is affected, But that's all, as to tell more will spoil everything. Its different and worth watching fantastic entertainment for all to watch, so what are you waiting for, collect your popcorn sit and relax in front of the television, put your feet up for plenty of fun and suspense with a full on marvelous movie.  Enjoy!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|nope, neither was Bill gates or a slew of other folks. Very fascinating book that backs up the old adage, it takes work.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I can see why this character was picked up by television, although much has changed from the book to the small screen.  I can't say which version of the characters I like more.  Certainly the book is not as dark as the TV version.  In fact there is quite a bit of humor.  Typical 'who done it' had some nice twists.  Indian mysticism was a nice dramatic factor, but could get overworked.<br />All in all a fun read
0375831002|4.0|This was a required summer reading for my daughter. I review all her books, and like others I do not understand how schools will punish my children for using language they are required to read. That being said, besides the profanity, I enjoyed this book.
1452113432|4.0|great price and nice looking book, delivered ontime and in new condition as advertised.<br />haven't tried any of her recipes yet but if she can make them in her little Paris apartment then we should be OK with it!
0679720200|5.0|Camus was an Algerian philosopher, and in this book he use that to make you think about what is happening in the life of the protaganist. He handles characters in an unforgetable way and brings them so much life you feel like you are watching a movie. Not sure why this is not mandatory reading in schools.
B00BD62X14|4.0|cd was delivered ontime and in perfect condition so that was all good.<br />and although she isn't the 1st lady of France anymore, another nice cd!
0143120530|4.0|I read some of the complaints about how Foer doesn't give you the answer of how to remember everything. It maybe kinda true, and I do agree the title, in our marketing culture, leads you to believe the answer is in this book. However, he lays out enough between whats in the book and simple google searches to expound on what information he gives. All that to the side, the book is very interesting and a fun read just from a simple reporting of Mnemonic Culture, and what they do. I reccomend this book.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was way to drawed out and it ended wierd! I don't think I will even buy the next book. She should have ended this book with this one!! So upseting!! Very disappointing that she drawed this out for money she lost some of my respect in her writing.

0307595579|4.0|The begining of the first book is pretty boring. Its takes some time to grasp what is really going on in the story. The second and third books where a lot more attention grabbing. In that the main characters are thrust into a world of government conspiracy and broad view of right and wrong. i thought the books where great and would have lifed for ther to have been a 4th.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Feels like Sylvia is dragging the story and stretching it out for no reason but to make more money.  In order to do that she has messed up with the characters (especially Eva and Cary) by bringing too many angles and inconsistencies  in to the story so that the characters have lost their original charm and appeal from the first too books. I am very disappointed.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I had trouble deciding on what to rate this book. It was a perfectly nice book until the very end.<br />Some people love the ending of this book but I was not one of those. The end is not satisfying. Am I happy I read it? Yes. Do I wish that it didn't just end? YES!<br />What I did like:<br />I liked that this had both Lena's and Hana's perspectives. It gives the reader a good sense of what is happening in both of their world's, not only to them but to the people around them.<br />The writing was great-we all know that Lauren Oliver is a great writer.<br /><br />All in all, I do suggest this book to those who enjoyed the first two but I warn that you will either love or hate the ending.

B00B5AIB14|4.0|Originally supposed to be a second cd on The Babylon by Bus cd. Very good concert, can hear the energy Bob brought to the show. Only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 star review is because the sound quality wasn't a 5 star rating, but still very good and definitely worth the money!

B005D9MUWY|5.0|The stock keyboard on ASUS ME172V is hard to write with, so I checked out reviews for other keyboards. This one got high marks and I'm glad I bought it. It works great, because you can slide or punch in keys. The only thing I don't like is that it made me set it as default and I got a pop up saying it will be able to see my username and password. That makes sense, but I would rather be able to switch keyboards if I want and put in that info on a stock keyboard. Maybe, I'm a bit too paranoid.<br />--- edit ---<br />8/22/13 Crashes Office Suite Pro and KingSoft Office. I started using the Google keyboard and have been happy ever since. The only thing I miss is the option for cursors. That was nice.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I've read alot of the reviews both good and bad and agree with both...to a point.  But we're supposed to be reviewing THE BOOK, NOT the Sylvia herself, NOT her publishers.  THIS STORY! and frankly I LOVED IT! I'll admit I would have liked a little better ending, BUT all in all this was exaclty what I wanted for Eva in Gideon. I won't give away part of the story but I would have been happy with it ending at the beach.  That being said had Sylvia chose to wrap the story up there, I'm thinking she'd have gotten the same slack she's getting now for finishing off too quickly, and leaving the readers wanting more.  Ya can't please them all. Now on to the book...<br /><br />Entwined With You was just about that.... Eva and Gideon wrapped up in each other against all odds.  How can you not be happy about that considering all that they have working against them? Their pasts are still coming back to haunt them and yet they're showing how love and trust can conquer all.  They're more in love with each other then ever before. How is this not a good thing?!<br /><br />Call me a sappy romantic, but I really enjoyed this story and I loved reading how they're overcoming the continuous obstacles thrown at them, learning to trust, and falling deeper and deeper in love with each other. I can't wait to see whats in store for these two.  Oh and can Gideon be anymore Alpha Male!!  Yes please!  {{{SIGH}}}<br /><br />4 stars from this Bookjunkie...ONLY because I would have liked a stonger ending.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|First of all let me just say that I loved this book. I love Gideon Cross I love how he loved Eva and how she loved him to me this one was better then that last one. I also loved the fact that they got married what I didn't like was that it took to long to come out and for the record this ending was much better than the last two it ended on a happy note.

0394818237|5.0|My son (2 yo) started with Busy Town and liked it a lot. But when he read this one, Busy town becomes of less priority. Because this one is not only just one page per scenario but one story per job. Things are flowing, very dynamic. He got a much better sense of how things are handled and where they come from and where they go. This book makes Busy town(also very good, of course) more like a word book. There are certainly some jobs that people no longer do in such old fashion ways. However it is a plus for us. Because, although more sophisticated machines are invented and you can just push a button, the basic mechanism are still the same -- and with machine done all the jobs you as people have not idea how all the things are done. In this book, jobs are dissected step by step and are done by people -- not one big black box and thus the young reader easily see how things work. For example, in \\"where bread comes from\\", the author goes from how wheat is harvested to the baking bread in an oven. It is a very charming process for young child -- my son loves the journey of the wheat. Not just buying bread flour in grocery and dumping things in the bread machine -- although he also loves looking into the bread machine and looking at the robotic arm swirling everything:)

0345803507|5.0|I just finished the trilogy.  Once I got well into the first book, I could barely put it down.  Yes - there is sex in the book - and some of it is not \\"plain vanilla\\" - but that's not the gripping part of the story.  Relationships are challenging to anyone.  We all have baggage.  We all have expectations.  And \\"love\\" is defined differently by every individual.<br /><br />This was an intense story about two individuals who had an immediate attraction to one another, but were worlds apart in their life experiences; they had both experienced childhoods that were not \\"average\\" or \\"standard\\" by any means.  Yet they learned to love and to trust, which is a long hard road for most of us.  And they grow with one another even though it's not always an easy path.  In the book, Anastasia refers to their relationship progress as \\"3 steps forward and 2 steps back\\" - but the end result is that they continue to move forward and build a relationship.<br /><br />So... read the book and think hard about what the characters have been through in life and how they are learning to \\"compromise\\" and build an \\"us\\"... And keep an open mind.<br /><br />I hope there's a Book Four.

B008B1BL4E|4.0|Six little boys tussle in a sandbox, pushing and shoving, sometimes openly, sometimes when none of the others are looking. One of them, a runt, is getting the worst of it, but he's a vicious little guy and manages to hold his own within his own tiny corner of the sandbox. The biggest boys exert the least effort but command the most space. They all look confident, but secretly they're terrified of one another, leading them to combine forces in a constantly shifting pattern of partnerships to fend off the others.<br /><br />This is the image that comes to mind of Europe in the summer of 1914 from reading Christopher Clark's new inquiry into how the First World War came to be. Naturally, Professor Clark had something much more grown-up in mind when he wrote the book. After all, he is a Fellow at St. Catherine's College at the University of Cambridge, where he received his Ph.D. in History, and we all know that a Cambridge Don would never indulge in such belittling imagery.<br /><br />In all fairness, to put the event in proper perspective, \\"The conflict that began that summer mobilized 65 million troops, claimed three empires [Russian, Ottoman, and Austro-Hungarian], 20 million military and civilian deaths, and 21 million wounded. The horrors of Europe's twentieth century were born of this catastrophe.\\"<br /><br />With The Sleepwalkers, Clark muscles into the seemingly endless debate about why and how all this came to pass. Not that anybody on the street is talking about this stuff, of course. But among modern European historians these questions pass for excitement, and no wonder: the Great War is generally taken as the climax of the well-ordered Victorian Era that launched the human race with a lurch into the 20th Century. The origins of the cataclysm that upended tens of millions of lives are variously found in Prussian militarism, the colliding interests of European empires, the arms race, the profit motive among arms merchants, and other cross-border phenomena, but Professor Clark apparently will have none of this. He's a practitioner of that brand of history that finds truth in the quotidian details of human interaction -- in short, in the day-to-day decisions of living, breathing human beings tossed together in a crisis that nobody foresaw.<br /><br />In the first of its three parts, The Sleepwalkers thus explores the political environment, highlighting the major players in each of the contending nations -- Serbia, Austro-Hungary, Russia, Germany, France, and England -- in the years running up to 1914. Part II takes a broader look at the Continent, discussing the interplay of the leading states in the closing years of the 19th Century and the beginning of the 20th. In outline, the stable alliances of the late 1880s had given way to a bipolar system by 1907, with the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and (loosely) Italy facing off against the interlocking fortunes of Russia, France, and Great Britain. Clark asserts that \\"[t]he polarization of Europe's geopolitical system was a crucial precondition for the war that broke out in 1914.\\" Then, in Part III, Clark delves deeply into the day-by-day, sometimes hour-by-hour, decisions of the leading players from June 28, when Gavrilo Princip shot to death the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne and his wife, until the early days of August, when all the chips had fallen into place and war was declared on all fronts.<br /><br />In Clark's view, \\"1914 is less remote from us -- less illegible -- now than it was in the 1980s. Since the end of the Cold War, a system of bipolar stability has made way for a more complex and unpredictable array of forces, including declining empires and rising powers -- a state of affairs that invites comparison with the Europe of 1914.\\" Although Clark makes it easy to see history repeating itself in small ways -- for example, the genocidal course pursued by Serbia in the 1990s was little different from its behavior in the decades leading up to 1914 -- it's difficult to see the parallels to most of today's international crises. Surely, Professor Clark wouldn't pretend that the U.S. invasion of Iraq -- one of the seminal events of our times and perhaps the greatest strategic blunder in American history -- was anything but the result of hubris and colossal miscalculation on the part of an ideology-driven clique within the U.S. government.<br /><br />Disagreements aside, however, The Sleepwalkers is an outstanding piece of work.  Professor Clark's knowledge of the period he writes about is both broad and deep, and he writes with grace and verve that's highly unusual in academic circles.4 -- it's difficult to see the parallels to most of today's international crises.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Bruce Willis is a great actor but this movie was horrible. Whoever wrote this script did a horrible job. The lines in it were bad. The story was about a father and son fighting not the old Die Hard where he has to survive and save the ones he loves. The old die hard was like a MacGyver style. The character John was resourceful and sneaky and always solving puzzles. This film was not that. This was boring.
B005GSVFAK|5.0|In my opinion this is the best of the Toy Story series.  It &#34;ties a bow&#34; on what it is like to grow up and put away childish things, but at the same time celebrate that special relationship and time that we spend being a kid.  The fact that it is available now in 3D just add to the beauty of the experience.  Highly recommended.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After almost a year, I was very excited for this release. I ordered it the date it dropped and pulled an all nighter reading it.  The author does throw us a bone but the story line between old loves is tiresome, stressful and I think unrealistic.  The two main characters are suppose to be \\"soul mates\\" but continue past relationships that don't make sense.  Anyone in their right minds would MOVE ON with the one they loved, especially when they have such an intimate sexual and loving relationship. Overall, I was disappointed and I am disappointed in that as well. This chapter of their lives takes place over a short span of time and leaves us waiting again.

B00CTSDDVO|4.0|The title Star Trek Into Darkness is misleading. The trailer, too, leads one to believe this is a tale of revenge. And this film features Khan. The film Star Trek II is dedicated to Khan Noonien Singh's obsession with revenge. In one scene, released to the public before the movies premier, Captain Pike tells Captain Kirk something like, \\"The Federation isn't about personal vendettas\\". Captain Kirk replies, \\"Maybe it should be\\".<br /><br />Instead what Captain Kirk learns, pretty much on his own, perhaps as a continuation of the end of the first film Star Trek 2009, is that justice is not about revenge. Human life isn't his to take. At least not in cold blood. Leonard Nimoy appears again in this film and he also provides a firm sense of moral grounding. Nimoy's performance here is not solely about bringing Vulcan sensibilities to the part? Surely we are seeing something of the real Leonard Nimoy in his performance. Nimoy would title his second autobiography, \\"I am Spock\\". The apparent moral certainty Nimoy helps bring to the film feels real, probably because it is. In the previous film, the Romulan Captain Nero destroys Spock's home world, in a quest for revenge of a sort. All the elder Spock can say about Nero, after pausing to think about it, is that Nero is 'troubled' as if he's concerned about Nero. The ending of this film, at least Kirk's medical recovery, leads one to wonder if perhaps Khan might return.<br /><br />We also learn that friendship is more important than truth. For Spock, who cannot tell a lie, this is something he will learn, or be corrupted by, over a lifetimes worth of experience. When captain Kirk falsifies a report to Star Fleet, I was kind of hoping the lesson to be learned would be one about the importance of being truthful, but instead we're learning about the importance of friendship. And also that friends believe different things than we do and sometimes live in different ways than we do, but we should still be committed to them. It's what gives life meaning?<br /><br />In a Star Trek episode from the original series, 'The Enterprise Incident', Spock does lie, convincing a Roluman Captain that he's defecting from Star Fleet. He's actually on a spy mission. He uses the fact that it's known Vulcan's cannot lie against this female captain. When she discovers the deception, Spock confesses that, \\"I was not unmoved\\" by this woman's advances. In one of the more famous episodes from the original serious, 'Mirror, Mirror' the crew are errantly beamed aboard an Enterprise that exists in an alternate universe. One where the Federation is an 'Empire' that rules by maintaining terror. When captain Kirk is talking to his concubine on the evil ship, a woman who's figured out something is wrong, captain Kirk tells her, \\"you're the captains woman until he says you're not\\". He plans on finding his way back to his own Enterprise.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, this film sails closer to Gene Roddenberry's 'humanistic vision'. Whether it's been made under the influence of Roddenberry or not, this film has a proverbial heart.<br /><br />I agree with this view, however, a small minority of Star Trek fans have claimed that the original series was all about Captain Kirk. Even that Kirk represented the antithesis of humanism. That each week, Captain Kirk would outsmart the counter-culture figures on the show, presented in the guise of aliens or rogue factions of the Federation, correct the error of their ways, and sometime before or after bed their women. Perhaps it's about those in the Federation, reactionaries and the educated, artists and scientists, uniting and coming together over common cause. Or more likely still, it is about friendship. As Star Trek moved to the series Next Generation, and Gene Roddenberry presumably held more control over the Star Trek, it did become more cerebral. In the ensuing generations it's returned to being more about action, even more so than the original incarnation, and that trend has continued here in Into Darkness.<br /><br />Anyway, I think I enjoyed the first film more, Star Trek 2009. Perhaps it was the joy of seeing these characters in action once again, because that movie had a, pardon the phrase, illogical plot. In the 2009 film there's more dialog between the crew members. This new film has a heart. I'd feel more comfortable recommending it, I think.end has continued here in Into Darkness.<br /><br />Anyway, I think I enjoyed the first film more, Star Trek 2009.

1400079144|5.0|What can I say that the book critics have not already said about this<br />latest novel by Dan Brown? It is a truly spectacular read. For Masons,<br />and particularly Scottish Rite Masons, this book will touch upon your<br />experiences in the fraternity and make you truly proud of who you are<br />and your choice to enter Freemasonry.<br />For many of you who do not know<br /> much about the Freemasons and what the organization is all about, this<br />novel will clarify many misinterpretations that are floating around out<br />there. Eye-opening for those unaccustomed to the fraternity; reaffirming<br /> for those within it.<br />Even outside the interest of Masonry, this novel is a great read: fast-paced and full of surprises.<br />Pick it up; you won't be disappointed.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It seems like I waited patiently for this book and now am too scared to spend $9.99 and take a chance on it.  There are more 1 star reviews than anything else which is upsetting because the first two books were great.  Ms Day needs to understand that when her e-books are still incredibly pricey that many readers look at the ratings to make their decision on whether to purchase her books or not.  Still haven't made a final decision but am leaning on not buying Entwined With You!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The knife was a little heavier than I had anticipated, but even moreso usable.  Once I had sharpened the blade, I was going from cutting a piece of paper in half to batoning logs and making some kindling.  The handle was comfortable right out of the box without any sort of paracord wrap, and the sheath (which was often complained about previously) works really well.  Of course, it's hard plastic but the friction lock and multifunctionality of the tie down points on the sheath are awesome.  I'm really appreciative of the quality of this knife.

B00CWVA3SE|5.0|Lego batman 2 story line is the same as the game. My son is 6 and loves the movie. We have watched it several times already
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing. The graphics are incredible and the game itself is extremely well thought out and brilliant.  It's very challenging, but not so hard that you can't do it.  I cannot wait until there's more.  Genius!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The Silver Linings Playbook was a wonderful story about finding your happy ending to life. I would definitely recommend this book to people who like when the author writes in a way that is mainly the character is talking the story out to you. I can't wait to see the movie. Matthew Quick scored a TOUCHDOWN with this book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|very disappointed to find out there are going to be 2 more books.  I LOVED the first 2 books, this one was just drawn out.  There wasn't a lot that grabbed me to HAVE to read it in one day like the others.  The story line was good but I wanted more sex like the other ones.
030758836X|1.0|I couldn't even finish this book because I couldn't even keep up with her writing half the time I didn't even know what she was talking about. She's all over the place. The same thing over & over page after page, drags it out! Would not tell anyone about this book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|GRAND CHILDREN HAD FUN PLAYING IT, KEPT THEM BUSY FOR A LONG WEEK-END AT MY HOUSE, WOULD BUY MORES GAMES
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I love this movie and have already watched it several times. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are amazing as well as the rest of the cast.
0425263924|2.0|This is the first time I have ever taken the time to review a book. I read two to three books a week.  The reason I chose this book to review is because I think it was in poor taste to stretch this story out as much as Ms. Day has done.  When I look for a new book, I read many of the reviews for the ones I have an interest in.  I don't always make my choice based on the majority of the opinions expressed and sometimes that has been in my favor but other times I should have listened to what the majority had to say.  Based on the reviews that have been posted so far for Entwined With You I would classify my review as part of the majority.  This book was filled with too much fluff and could have easily been concluded.  If Ms. Day chooses to write spin offs from this series then that should be made clear but Gideon and Eva's story has been drawn out long enough.  I think I am done with this series.  The price of these books would have been acceptable had they truly been a trilogy but I am not willing to spend another dime on this worn out story.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this book was perfect. I loved the ups and downs and just Eva and Gideon. I enjoyed getting to know some of the other characters as well. Hope to see more of them in the next two books. I think it ended where it needed to end and yes there is more to Eva and Gideon's story.. Can't wait..
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Really? Barely any plot and a lot of immature drama. Such a let down from the two previous books. Don't waste your money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Downloaded the ebook. The book was very graphic about a subject that I was not at all familar with, but the story line was spellbinding and I couldn't put the book down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing in so many different ways. I can honestly say that I'm not a reader, nor a cryer. I bought this book late Tuesday Night on Amazon Kindle, started reading it Wednesday, and finished at 2 am of Thursday morning. I also want to add that at 2 am in my bed all alone, I was bawling my eyes out. This is something that doesn't happen regularly. I can't even remember a time when I've cried in a movie, let alone a book. So here is my wish: that readers and non-readers can experience the same rawness and magnificence that I did. I am feeling like I should go out and read more books to find another book that can even come close to measuring up to TFIOS. John Greene, this book is the best book I've ever read. Thank you!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game, easy for kids to play. Addicting, a lot like jetpack joyride. Would recommend friend's and family.
0395083621|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter, she was learning all this stuff in school. the book was in fair condition, but i was very pleased with it. Highly recommend fast shipping Thank you

B00BEXB18M|4.0|No this is not RIP... but its a solid rock album indeed. All these pousers out there giving this one star are just foolish metallica fans.  It not a 5 star either of course.  But after 30 years in this game what do you expect, his doing the best he can.  So screw all you pousers.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've used this app on multiple Android devices, including a Samsung Galaxy 3 and an Asus tablet.It has been a very helpful app for each, especially for showing approximates on how long a charge will take and how long you can operate you needed functions at current battery level.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Useful, fast, easy to learn/master. The most useful keyboard I've ever used and after having my s4 for only a week it's saved me over 5000 keystrokes. Great app

B00CS65QGW|5.0|I absolutely love this synthpop track..sounds like 70s disco and has a really catchy tune. I especially love the chorus!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Many series start to sputter or stall out at this point, but this one just keeps getting better.  Fluid movement, rhytmic verse, and such exquisitely captured emotiond. I love this seried.<br /><br />It did wrap up quickly at the end, but in an ongoing story I guess a book must have it's closure so that another can begin. As much as I'd love to just keep reading.<br /><br />I expected Sahara's powers would be more extensively used. That would have been the easy way out of writing though, so I'm glad that's not how it went and imagine we'll be seeing more of her in the future.<br /><br />This was the story of her love. Of a man no one really knows. Of strength and choices. We have seen in othee books the broken childhood creating the heroes and villains that we read of and the inner battles that exist within. What I commend the writer for in this instance is the underdtanding and then portrayal of how one person, one gesture, one relationship can be an anchor for someone facing a life few coud ever comprehend.<br /><br />I  salivating in anticipation of the next novel. Read thos one ns you will be too. But please read the series from the beginning if you have not already been doing so. Yes, some of the books are more powerful and others easier reads, but each are crucial to the emotional build of the story being told. And a couple will have you sobbing if given the chance. Especially a previous one involving a certain pack alpha whose bark's got nothing on his bite.<br /><br />Ignore the typos nd autocorrcts of my kindle driving me nuts in this review process and go get this book. You won't regret it.
1568363931|5.0|Easy recipes and tasty too!  One of the best cookbooks I have ever purchased!  I am so glad I purchased this!

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I have a nexus 7 tablet, I had the free version of this game and loved it despite the fact that it had long load times for some reason.<br /><br />But this, the HD version is much nicer in that regards, gameplay is fun, the art style is funny, and the puzzle are good.<br /><br />Get it, it's good, and was free today here on amazon :D
B0091REZMW|4.0|Really enjoy this game. After awhile you do end up looking for the same items over and over again but I still enjoy it!
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Perfect. I was really pleased with quality and ease of download. Good Good Good Good good<br />I might would fill out more of these if you didn't require so much detail
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Spoilers in this review...Ok here it is, I am a mom and I love to read. I have so many books on my kindle I cant even count. I loved fsog and loved the first two crossfire books. So excited for the third after a long wait. I am so disappointed I requested my first EVER refund from Amazon. This book was presented as a trilogy. I was in love with the characters, the way the author described them and the life they were building. Just the right amount of intimacy and heat with such a good plot. Listen, are they remarkably like fsog sure but I didn't care. It was different enough and I loved Eva because she was so different then A.  I read the third book and literally said wtf? as it ended so abruptly and in no particular cliff hanger. It was expected to come to an end with Eva and Gideon living happily ever after with all of their problems more manageable and maybe some babies but I literally feel like Ms. Day just got bored one day and stopped writing. It is that abrupt especially considering I didn't read a single review I saw the book preordered and waited on pins and needles.  I can't believe I will say this but there was too much sex in this book. Same scenes over and over. Lots of fsog similarities. Too many to mention. Sex on his private plane with bondage? yeah where have I read that? why not tie this up in the trilogy as promised and write about more characters in future books like a spin off series but stretching it out with plots that just insult and really don't matter. Beware although I am happy I have a sliver of finality in that they get married I have nothing else from this book. So sad because I wanted to love it...
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Got this for my Nexus 10 and I have gotten a ton of use out of it. Nexus 10 picks it up really well no matter which head I am using and the smallest one is incredibly accurate which is great with MyScript Calculator or image editors. Also makes using the android flow typing prediction a lot more natural. Also fits great in the elastic ring on MoKo tablet case.<br /><br />Doesn't work all that great on my iPod touch with an OtterBox case on it, but fingers are fine what I use that for. If I took the case off I know it would work flawlessly though.
B00BF11STU|3.0|It was okay i guess. It is not worth it if you are looking for a good movie, but if you have to watch it i guess it is okay.
B00B2166BS|5.0|#1 Faster charge times.<br />#2 Super easy to attach you can do it without looking.<br />#3 No chance this will break. I just grab my tablet and let it pull free.<br />#4 Protection for your USB port. Now you're not one accident away from destroying your USB port.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Hathaway and Wolverine were solid, everyone else was kind of bleating and lifeless and it was easily an hour too long.
0897502027|5.0|The book has good quality and for the book itself, I like it. But I do feel this book is not that much educational, it's basically Bruce Lee's philosophy. The book is more like a collection for Bruce Lee's fan.
140123769X|5.0|I absolutely loved this one, one of the best stories since the first arc ended. I loved how they handled the prophecy and the timeline. So, so good. Love Fables!
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Nice!  I think he is going to be huge one day! Cute and sounds great! I suggest you buy this cd.
0756686970|5.0|My son saw this at Lowes (of all places) for twice the price and was dying to have it. I told him it would have to come out of his wallet, but to wait a day or two to avoid buyer's remorse. Well, I found it Amazon for a much better price and he was willing to wait the few days for it to arrive, in order to save some $$$. It came with the Han Solo Lego minfig which was played with right away. My son loves pouring over the book and relating the characters and their adventures from the Star Wars movies.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Good sound and screen is perfect for me...Fully satisfied by myself and my son as well, he likes very much!!<br />Good to buy.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the two first books, and waited eagerly for this one. Imagine my surprise when 1. there is hardly any plot here at all and 2. what little story there is, is being spread over two books to earn more money...<br /><br />I guess the fact that I won't read the next book says it all (as I pre ordered and waited impatiently for this one).<br /><br />Talk about ruining a good thing!
B002PMV9K6|2.0|Expecting English sub-title but this dvd does not suppot... and I believe English sub title should be the basic feature which is selling in NA market...
B002ZG997C|4.0|This movie is a great watch.  Enjoyed it years ago and bought it because it's one of those movies that you can watch over again and still question the whole vision situation.  I find that people all come up with different variations of what they thought was going on from the start...
B004K00NMG|4.0|This is a favorite movie, and it shipped to my door in two days with the express shipping. My only problem was one tab was broken, however the disk does not move, so not scratched and I don't think there is a chance of it shifting off, but that did keep it from getting a perfect score.
B002W5UVSM|3.0|I've heard that this was one of the funniest books ever written. It was OK. There were definitely moments where I actually laughed out loud, but the majority of the book is either only humorous enough to get a smile on your face or make you wonder what the heck is going on. I still enjoyed the read.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is one of the best games I played an a long time for how little it costs compared to how much play time I got out of it, I loved completely.
0765325950|5.0|I picked up the first book to the Wheel of Time series almost 8 years ago, and I've been anticipating this book ever since. I had very very high expectations for this book, and it delivered on all fronts (except one). Thankfully, it focuses on Rand, Mat, Perrin, and Egwene the most. I had been getting frustrated at the last books for giving all the more minor characters a lot of pages. The only complaint I have is that I didn't quite like the ending as much as I liked the rest of the book. I maybe had unrealistic expectations for the ending, but it just didn't feel like it was the best possible one. That's just my opinion though, and other people probably either loved it or hated it more than me. Regardless, if you have read the rest of the series you probably don't need me to tell you to get this book. For anyone that hasn't read the series, start from the beginning and come back. It's worth it.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I thought this quadrilogy started out strong. The first two books were very good. I'm glad the author tied up some loose ends in the third and fourth books but there could have been so much more depth in the last two books. I would definitely recommend this series.
0767802551|5.0|Great movie period. I am a big Johnny Depp fan, and this movie shows off his very diverse acting ability. He was utterly sensational as the title character. No surprises when I say this: Al Pacino is serious in his role as Lefty. Other supporting cast members include Michael Madsen as Sonny, Bruno Kirby as Nicky Santora, and James Russo as Paulie. The supporting cast did wonderful. The story line is good; (some unexpected things do occur in this movie) I would not consider Donnie Brasco a full fledged gangster flick per se, but more or less a Crime Drama or Crime Film. But despite that, Donnie Brasco is one of the best films I have ever seen; I would even go far as to calling it one of the best crime films of the 1990s. I highly recommend this movie to people who have seen (and like) films like: Goodfellas, The Departed, etc. this movie is right up there with those. Donnie Brasco gets:<br /><br />5 Stars
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Huge MARVEL and Iron Man fan and its a temple run sort of game with weponry and a way cooler objective :)
B00BC24NT4|5.0|A shocking ending, but an incredible story! How can this British gentleman continue to write and spin such amazing, gut-wrenching stories?
B008XTVWHK|5.0|I had the comic book as a kid, then VCR taped the movie once for my kid and we wore it out! Great old dino flick. It was decent quality, came quickly, fair price.
B008I43DYU|5.0|OK, so a calculator program is not very sexy, and this one is loaded with features I'm unlikely to use. However, when I'm using my Kindle Fire (which is often) and have need of a calculator, it's great to know that there is one right there, and I don't have to go hunting for a stand-alone one.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|A very entertaining movie with a lot of great action and an interesting twist to the plat at the end.  Definitely my kind of movie.
B00A3ATW4M|3.0|Never heard this CD.  I gave it as a Christmas gift to a niece of mine.  Nothing more to say. . . . .
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Very pleased with this purchase.  A very interesting Docu-Movie with a lot of good interviews and music as well.<br />Hard to believe the great music that came out of such a trashy looking place.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game. Just so fun to play,I honestly like this better than temple run 1 or 2. I just can't which city they're going to come up with next go around. Oh, I have an idea for the next city,how about...NEW ORLEANS!!
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|They knock it out of the park with the first movies so they go back and try to include the whole audience.  For once, Hollywood, will you make the people go to the movie, not the movie go to the people.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|It was very well written but I hate when a book ends in the middle of a story. But I'm hooked
B0090KZDSK|1.0|We waited months for this?? Really SD sooooo not cool. The new plots and twist are so unnecessary. All this so it's drags on again to a 4th book..?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was lots of fun and totally immersed me in the game world. I look forward to the next game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Warning! Spoilers in comment! Don't read this if you haven't read the book.<br /><br />At first I didn't want to read this book because I knew that someone was going to die and someone was going to lose someone and etc. In fact, it took me about a month to even convince myself to buy it for my kindle, but I kept putting it off with other stories about how the girl gets the guy or how someone saves this magical land. Some fantasy that always had a happy beginning, middle, and end. I had been afraid to experience, once again, the curse of an attachment to someone with terminal disease such as cancer. In stories like these, someone always dies. And it's usually the healthy person. And it usually teaches us as regular human beings some universal lesson to love each other, keep promises, etc etc. John Green captured precisely all that ran through my mind around the time of my Aunts' deaths, one having died of bone cancer and the other of breast and stomach cancer. And the same when my Grandfather passed away less than a year ago. I don't know why we as humans always complain about dealing with pain as it is very unpleasant (for us and for those around us. No one wants to have to be the consoler or consolee), but yet we subject ourselves to it all the time through stories and the need to feel. When I began reading this book, it was hard because I would remember my aunt having the same mindset as Augustus, and I would remember the countless hours of trying to figure out life and death, which still proved to benefit me in no way as I was not and never will be prepared for death. I believe they are no longer feeling pain, so I'm happy, but I'm still feeling pain, so in a way my mourning is selfish. Anyway, I couldn't get through without crying and missing who I've lost and coming back around to realize, just like Hayley Grace, that we are grenades waiting to hurt someone, even without meaning to, so I don't want to die and be that grenade. I've always believed that life wasmade as a source of happiness for other people. You are something someone else loves, which is why I feel some people have such a hard time loving themselves, yet are so afraid to die. We are made to care about other people, and would rather not put grief upon others so why would dying be any different. Anyway, I read the book of course, as pain is only an obstacle and a benefit to the overall message and heartwarming tale that is this book. I would just like to say that John Green's mind is genius and understanding. There are few people who can claim to understand the misguided truths and fates of the living, but he does so with dignity and confidence AND for the world to see, which is why this, so far, is the best book I've ever read.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I watched it again with my youngest Grand daughter, 4yrs old. Surprisingly she didn't move a muscle and that's saying a lot for her. I didn't even realize a new Monster's is coming out. I can't wait. This was my oldest Grand Son's movie, he watched it every day. I called it &#34;Doors&#34;  Watch with the kids and family, it's fun
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|simply put this might be one of the best rock albums of the past twenty years...seriously, this is incredible music!  I've always been a qotsa fan but this album raises the bar for so many radio-friendly artists on so many levels...this album is everything that is good about radio-rock crammed into one masterpiece record...wow...
B005HEPOKU|5.0|First I chose this because after being away from it for many years, when I went back to see an episode or 2 I liked every bit as much.<br /><br />It doesn't have the gratuitous violence so common now. Your kids can watch this.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|The most graphic thing I've ever seen  Brutal if you like that kind of movie.  Rome was not a very nice place.

B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Although not the end of this amazing band it will be the end of their world tours.  The set list here is awesome, the performance is excellent the dvd package is well done and overall I am very happy with this purchase.  Hope to get a cd release.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|This is a solid album from a great band.  While I admit, it's not their best (which is subjective anyway), it's comparable to Cryptic Writings and Youthanasia which, imo, are damn fine albums.  It sounds nothing like Risk, which remains the only Megadeth album I've never gotten into.<br /><br />I'll give a quick thumbs up/thumbs down song rundown:<br /><br />1) Kingmaker - gets this disk off to a rocking start. Definite thumbs up!<br /><br />2) Super Collider - seems to be a love it or hate it type song (much like the whole album, apparently).  It's super catchy and isn't a departure at all from songs you might find on 90's Megadeth albums (but NOT Risk!).  Thumbs up.<br /><br />3) Burn! - Starts off with some great guitar work...then bottoms out with a lame chorus.  Thumbs down.<br /><br />4) Built for War - Megadeth heavy and I almost like it...but not quite.  Thumbs down.<br /><br />5) Off the Edge - Catchy, heavy beat.  Thumbs up!<br /><br />6) Dance in the Rain - Sounds old school, imo.  Bad ass!  Thumbs WAY up!!!<br /><br />7) Beginning of Sorrow - Slower tempo, sounds great.  Thumbs up.<br /><br />8) The Blackest Crow - some banjo experimentation, but it works well, imo.  Thumbs up.<br /><br />9) Forget to Remember - Good overall song.  Thumbs up.<br /><br />10) Don't Turn Your Back - Double kick drum, outstanding solo.  I like it!  Thumbs up!<br /><br />11) Cold Sweat - Eh.  I see this as being one of the more popular songs on here, but it just seems okay to me.  I'd say thumbs sideways but, if I had to choose, I'd say...thumbs down.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />12) A House Divided - Decent...fits in well with the overall sound of the album but not the best, either.  Shaky thumbs up.<br /><br />13) All I Want - Has a \\"Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" feel to it.  A very worthwhile bonus track and a solid thumbs up!<br /><br />14) Symphony of Destruction (live) - The studio version is better, imo, but you can't mess this gem up.  Thumbs up.<br /><br />So,on a disk with 14 songs (11 on the standard version), I count 11/14 thumbs up (8/11 standard version), which makes for a very solid, worthwhile album.  After reading many of the reviews, I thought this disk might be a complete bust but, to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't.  It's actually quite good and the more I listen to it, the better it gets.  The best part, for me, is that here it is in 2013, Megadeth has been around for roughly 30 years, and they are still putting out material every two years.  I'll take that any day of the week from one of my favorite bands and I hope they come out with another one in 2015!<br /><br />If you're expecting, or only like, Megadeth's thrash classics like Peace Sells, RIP, or even later classics like The System Has Failed or Endgame...don't bother.  But, if you liked Cryptic Writings and/or Youthanasia, you'll like this one.  It's certainly a welcome edition to my complete Megadeth collection...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Enjoyed the game, it kept my interest through the entire game. I would buy future releases relating to this game
1400069807|4.0|What makes Michael Moss's book exceptional is not the fact that it is extremely well-researched (which it is), nor that it is very well written (it's that too), nor that it is comprehensive (which it also appears to be). No, what makes \\"Salt Sugar Fat\\" a book you should buy right now is that it is stunningly fair. This would be an admirable feat on any topic, but for food - that insanely broad category that covers sustenance, employment, heritage, economics, politics and more - it is almost unbelievable. Indeed, I did not believe it until I read it myself.<br /><br />Because the fact is that the story of our food is not (to read the rest of this review, please visit theagencyreview.wordpress.com/salt-sugar-fat)
B000PMG16U|5.0|The third movie is my son's favorite.  I love the CGI in these films.  They would not have been the same without it.  I'm glad they waited to make them.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Good all around album, even on the skit track where the gentleman is speaking throughout, he explains his technique and how it came to be as it goes into the beat and sound, nice.... and yes, it's groovy, at times I picture the movie Scarface haha!
B007SGM084|5.0|I've never read anything like this before, and that is saying a lot as I'm a older woman. I must admit, that I've read all three books multiple times. I find that reading them over, I'm more aware of different aspects with each read.
B00777TOFG|5.0|I love this record. I listen to it over and over and over in my car and while I'm working.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Entwined with you was a lot better than the second book in this series. It's about Gideon, and Eva getting back together, but they have to hide their relationship for a while to make sure the police don't suspect anything. As things progress though a whole lot of drama happens, with Eva's ex Brett, Gideon's ex Corrine, Cary, Eva's parents and lots more. It's a whole mess of drama.<br /><br />This one was okay. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I love how we get to see more of Gideon, and Eva together. I sort of hate how Gideon still has to sleep on his own, I thought they would have worked through that by now. And I didn't like how Corrine, and Brett keep messing up Eva and Gideon's lives, it drove me crazy. I wish they would have just pushed both of them away and been done with it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I will read the next one. When this one ended it didn't answer a whole lot of the questions that were brought up. But I was excited about the advancement between Eva, and Gideon. But now I'm a little bit frustrated with the fact that there will be more of Cary's drama, along with Corrine's. I, personally do not care for either of those characters so I do not understand why they are brought into the picture so much. I felt this book could have ended the series, but alas it didn't. There will be two more books, five total from what is being said now.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was so excited for the final book but was completely let down.  I found the conclusion very disappointing.  I don't feel like the characters actions synced up with how they had been previously portrayed in all the books.  Sookie ended up in almost the exact place she started in.  I think she settled for a boring simple life.  I was expecting so much more.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I thought this book would be really good, but I was wrong. I didn't like this one.<br />It's about bad people coming back from Eva's past, and Gideon seems to be with another women now.<br />I just didn't like it. The only thing I liked about the book was the end when you find out the reason why Gideon has been with another women.<br /><br />This book makes Eva and Gideon's relationship seem a whole lot stranger than before. Now they seem to have a whole more trust in each other, but yet they keep doing things that hurt the other.<br /><br />This book was not for me. I hated to see Eva's heartbreak even if in the end it wasn't as it seemed. It still bugged me enough not to like the book.
B00CTXBO9M|1.0|why do people have to upgrade it just does not make sense and the upgrade costs .99 cents make it free amazon
B00846REIS|3.0|Bared To You is a story about two messed up people who find each other, but they aren't sure how to actually be together.<br />They go from being happy, to angry in two point five seconds. It's a crazy relationship but in a way they are perfect for each other.<br /><br />I thought the overall story was okay. I liked Eva, a lot. And I did like Gideon but sometimes I thought he was a little too much. I will be reading the next book just to see what happens, because I hate how this one ending. It was extremely frustrating.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|Love this for our kids and for me and my wife too.  Great storyline and I love the ending.<br /><br />Dan

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book was not what I had expected, however it was ok. I saw a lot of bad reviews, but think if Sylvia had just ended the book some people would have wanted more. Sylvia cannot please everyone. I will wait to see what the other two books are about.<br />Another, note I think Michael's the reason mengui is disappeared and also think it has to do with Eva and G. Think Cary need to work on himself and see what he really wants. Tati is not for him.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|It was such a good book I recommend it to everybody I loved it a so much!!! EVERYONE I MEAN EVERYONE should read this book trust me
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I hated to wait so long for this book but I still enjoyed reading it. It was a stormy, sexy don't want to put the book down book.<br />The story picked up where it left off which was good. So many twist and turns for these 2 lovers. I love how the story goes and how all the characters, Eva, Giddeon, Carey, all the ex's come together in a circle.<br />I can't get enough of these 2 so now when does the next book come ok?

I didn't start watching until Season 3 so I had to purchase seasons 1 and 2 and now season 3 so I'm up on all the who's who and what's what. Fantastic story lines. Who would have thought that I figured out what a 'lady in waiting' was by watching this show. It's great!

B008SOS63S|5.0|How did I get this old without encountering this genius?<br /><br />As it is, I have PBS to thank--more specifically, their fund-raising events, Without it, I'd never have come to find out what a virtuoso Joe Bonamassa is. He's like Clapton on steroids: a wild man on guitar, he sings with a throaty passion clarified by experience. His fingers dance along the strings like a crazed flamenco artist...the sound comes at you with such emotion that you're FEELING his anger, his heartache, his pain.<br /><br />I saw this very album...well, more properly, I saw the DVD made from it. It's amazing how much fun they seemed to have on the stage...there was so much chemistry between the performers...John Hiatt came out, and Paul Rodgers did too, and they blended together as easily as if they'd been doing this all their lives.  (Well, they HAVE, but not together...but you'd never guess it here.)<br /><br />Get this double album...there's NO WAY you'll be disappointed. From the incredible guitar fingering of \\"72nd St. Subway Blues\\" through the flaming hot blues of \\"When the Fire Hits the Sea,\\" from the rocking blues of \\"You Better Watch Yourself\\" to the amazing drive of \\"Blue and Evil\\" right on to the ups and downs of \\" If Heartaches Were Nickels\\"...you'll be amazed at this wonderful, passionate, heartfelt, aching, beautiful, and unbelievably talented man.<br /><br />Believe me...he transformed me last night, and I'm sure you'll love this album.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|The book is clearly a significant contribution to the process of developing and writing business models and plans. Initially it's almost basic and common sense approach comes across as simplistic. However, reading it reveals some really powerful insights and relevance.<br /><br />The only limitation of the book is that it is silent on how to incorparate the real hard numbers in the development of the business model. This particularly relates to how one can use the &#34;canvas&#34; to develop revenue forecasts at least for the first year of putting the model into operation.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not much to write about.... Not much really happened in this book...ok read for the series but left you hanging hanging after nothing really happened....left confused with the ending.

059306612X|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter, after a friend recommended it.  I think I love it even more than my daughter does, as she sometimes has to remind me that it is her book.  Each chapter takes you on a journey from ancient myths and legends to modern day understanding of how things work.  This hard cover version is stunningly illustrated. It has increased our families understanding of science and provided a starting point for many interesting dinner conversations.  I would highly recommend it for both Adults and children.

B000002GQH|5.0|The Moody Blues are an entirely unique and masterful band, embodying the the finest aesthetic of that era. As 14 year old boy, in 1969, I chanced to hear the debut of Threshold of a Dream on our local radio station in Anchorage, AK. I was totally blown away, because it went inside me and made me imagine and think things. It wasn't just a good beat and guitar lines. Being very imaginative and spiritually inclined, as well as a burgeoning rock guitarist, I had felt, and still do, that the Moody Blues are not only musically unique and amazing, but also able to express real spiritual and metaphysical ideas and emotions without appearing corny or contriving. When these guys sing that people in the world need to love each other, it has the profound reverence and sincere longing such a statement should have. When they suggest you think of something, it's usually mysterious, adventurous, joyful, fraught with danger, loss, or sorrow. The Moody Blues are able to speak to the inner world as well as the outer with their incredible talents. Sure, there seem to always be three or so cuts from every album that I don't think are so great, but the rest are such beautiful masterpieces that each will play in my mind and soul until I go on.<br /><br />Read all the wonderful reviews that speak so eloquently to the quality of their music and the appreciated talents of all it's band members/song writers.<br /><br />But a hint to those unfamiliar with the Moody's musical catalog, the NEXT album is the Moody Blues crowning achievement. To Our Children's Children's Children is astounding, and the remastered version here on Amazon is the mix that should have originally been released. When TOCCC came out, it was a distorted mix. Now it is clean. Same incredible stupendous music, but CLEAN. Plus bonus tracks of course! I cannot praise TOCCC enough, it is an AWESOME achievement, and deserves to be heard at least for the next four generations! For me, Seventh Sojourn was the last Moody Blues album I could say I liked. They really burned bright, so I'm glad they were able to produce as much incredible music as they did. I hope they all take satisfaction in having given so many people the inspiration they have.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|well I did expect more like an actual flashlight and it to be brighter and more colds but at least it little bit light
B007MDB71O|3.0|Did anybody actually know anything about this movie after it was released? All I knew was that it cost $250 million to produce and had grossed $73 million by June of 2012 indicating that the Disney company had a real bow-wow on their hands. Did anybody know that it was a science fiction fantasy? That it was based on a story written by the same guy who invented Tarzan? I don't think so.<br /><br />But I did see a number of favorable reviews in Amazon and the price was right so I took a shot and ordered the Blu-ray. What kind of a title is that? Who knows from \\"John Carter\\"? Michael Clayton, OK, same thing except that people knew George Clooney starred in it and that was enough. Even that one cost $25 million and grossed a little over $50 million so it just cut it. And \\"Michael Clayton\\" is a damned good picture in my book.<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" is a grand adventure in the old science fiction/fantasy tradition -- what we referred to as \\"space opera\\" years ago. The story by Edgar Rice Burroughs is only one of a series of stories with this character. At the beginning, John Carter is a deserter from the Confederate Army who is captured by Union soldiers. He makes an escape, hides in a cave and sees strange markings and a medallion in the hand of a dying man. He is holding the medallion as he repeats a word being muttered by the man: \\"Barsoom.\\" He is immediately transported to the planet Mars, the name of which is \\"Barsoom\\" to the Martians. The story takes off from there. The visual effects are state of the art, although the story is a bit muddled and unclear as to who is fighting whom.  The quality of acting is on a level superior to at least two of the Star Wars films (episodes 1 and 2)  It is grand entertainment in the old space opera tradition. A friend of mine who knew about the Burroughs story used to joke that when he retired he would move to Mars and open a saloon there called the Barsoom Bar Room.<br /><br />I did enjoy the movie which is visually quite impressive. It is interesting that the title given at the beginning is simply \\"John Carter.\\" At the end, at the start of the credit roll, the title is given as \\"John Carter of Mars.\\" That was the original title but, for some reason, \\"of Mars.\\" was dropped. Whether the original title would have helped sell the picture, well, as they say in the business, that's blood under the bridge. Apparently there were plans for a series of movies based on the John Carter stories. I think we can forget about that.

B008JJM88Q|1.0|My daughter downloaded this app to her kindle because it was the free app of the day, for starters it does not give the option for English language and that is as far as the app would allow her to go before freezing up. I normally wouldn't download an app like that, but she is 10 so it peaked her intrest. I would not recomend this app. If I had the option of no stars that's what I would give it. Thanks for taking the time to read my review.
B00008LKDY|5.0|Vivaldi published so many violin concerti, and there are so many recordings of them, that it seem hard to imagine that any particular opus or recording might really stick in your memory. This is one of them.<br /><br />Anyone who fears to hear the scratchy, raw sound of a second-rate or older school baroque violinist needs not worry. Rachel Podger's sound is clear, full and consistent. Her amazing technical facility allow her to extemporize more than even some of the foremost virtuosi. To me her playing is right up there in terms of sheer beauty with Manze on his Corelli, or maybe Chandler on his Vivaldi discs with La Serenissima.<br /><br />In addition to La Serenissima, the Polish baroque ensemble Arte dei Suonatori boasts stellar records of Telemann, Handel and Vivaldi, among others. This is their best disc, in my opinion. Their fast Vivaldi playing is in-your-face, percussive, always driving. The slow movements are always gripping, heart-wrenching, though never upstaging Podger, who unquesrtionably dominates these movements, as the solo violin ought to in the slow movement of any Vivaldi violin concerto.<br /><br />This recording received a Gramophone award for \\"Best Baroque instrumental\\" in 2003, and anyone who chooses to give it a try will almost certainly be satisfied.
B005LAII80|4.0|For those of you who haven't seen Dredd yet, if you're expecting the typical flashy PG-13 comic book movie, a remake of Stallone's Judge Dredd or a carbon copy of the 2000AD/Megazine Judge Dredd, you might be disappointed.<br /><br />This Dredd is a combination of a dark, depressing, gritty, British indie film mixed with a 70s/80s, over-the-top, R-rated action film.<br /><br />There's some subtle, dark humor neatly woven into Dredd. Unfortunately I've noticed that some viewers miss this. Maybe their attention is focused on the depressing, violent surroundings/situations and the humor falls flat or passes them by.<br /><br />I've seen \\"excessive violence\\" mentioned a lot and Dredd certainly deserves it's R rating (I wouldn't let kids watch) but to me it didn't feel much worse than many other movies. Maybe I just happen to watch a lot of violent movies but I think it has more to do with genre expectations. We normally associate over-the-top violence with horror or certain thrillers so it could come across a bit more shocking seeing this kind of violence in the comic book, sci-fi genre.<br /><br />It's also important to note that there is a subtle social/political message sprinkled throughout the movie and that the filmmakers use of \\"excessive violence\\" is part of this (fascism, crumbling society, violence).<br /><br />In my opinion, Dredd works best in 3D but is still good in 2D... although it works far better in the theater than on blu-ray.  This may have to do with the style of 3D. Instead of the jump-out-at-you 3D of many movies, Dredd's 3D is more about depth. I think this style translates better on a large movie screen than on your average TV.<br /><br />Last, I never understand why people worry about comparing movies or who stole what. If it's a good movie, enjoy it but I'm going to touch on a few things that reviewers are confused about.<br /><br />Claim: Dredd is a Hollywood copy of Raid Redemption - If you fact-check dates, you'll see that Dredd was written first and Dredd finished main filming before Raid even began filming. Also Dredd is a DNA film, an independent British film production company, not Hollywood.<br /><br />Claim: Dredd is a Robocop clone - I would not be surprised if Verhoeven's style influenced Dredd but Robocop was actually modeled after the Judge Dredd in the comic book.<br /><br />Claim: Urban is imitating Stallone's Dredd - Karl Urban and Stallone both based their character after the Judge Dredd in the comic book.  In fact, intentionally or unintentionally Urban's Dredd gives off a Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry vibe which is fitting since the comic book Judge Dredd was influenced by Dirty Harry.irst and Dredd finished main filming before Raid even began filming.

B00CATSONE|4.0|I was expecting a more in depth biography of Tesla, but I am still glad that I read this little book. It is a discussion more generally about the role of imagination in geniuses, using Tesla as an example.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Originally posted on my blog The Bibliophile's Corner<br /><br />What I Expected: I had no idea what to expect when I picked up this book. The only thing I knew about it was that it was set in the future and that it contained a virtual world created by a guy obsessed with the 80s. 80s? Yes, please.<br /><br />What I Got: Ready Player One is one of the most unique and entertaining books that I have read this year. It is mind blowing! I think what makes it so special is that it has something for everyone: hardcore nerd stuff, pop culture references of the 80s, some romance, social commentary, adventure. It's just one big book of brilliance.<br /><br />By far my favorite thing about this book is that it acts as a warning to readers to not let yourself get swept away by fantasy. As a reader/blogger/writer, I find myself spending more hours behind a book/computer/e-reader than I do outside in the real world with real people. And while that's okay sometimes, the real world still needs to be dealt with.<br /><br />The Characters: Wade, a.k.a. Perzival, is my nerd hero. He's filled with 80s and gamer knowledge, obsessive, determined, and will do anything to make sure OASIS does not fall into the wrong hands. I love seeing him go from being alone to having friends who he will save OASIS with.<br /><br />Aech is Wade's best friend. The are both equally, freakishly smart when it comes to James Halliday trivia and they frequently chat in virtual rooms, quest together, and spend a lot of their virtual time together. Aech is probably my favorite character. Especially at the end!<br /><br />Art3mis is Wade's love interest and one of the top competitors in The Hunt. Their relationship is probably one of my favorites. Since this is a hugely virtual world, yes, they only know each other via what they share online. But as the book goes on they alternate between being open with each other and being guarded. Art3mis especially.<br /><br />Fun Fact: The audio book of Ready Player One isnarrated by Wil Wheaton! I have got to get my hands on this....or ears. I need to the king of nerds to read this book to me!
B004T4KQJS|5.0|This is a very good attempt to explain the universe's beginnings to those of us who are not physicists. I think I even understood most of it. Even so it is not an easy read, but I found it well worth taking the time to try and get my head around some of the concepts. The universe is truly a wondrous place.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Originally posted on the blog<br /><br />Cover Talk: I love the tunnel stair link to the cover of this book. I really love all of the covers to this series. The black and white and rather minimalist. It's lovely.<br /><br />First Line: \\"I used to think our town, buried in the South Carolina backwoods, stuck in the muddy bottom of the Santee River valley, was the middle of nowhere.\\"<br /><br />Why I Read It: I very much enjoyed the first book and I just couldn't wait to read more. The first book ended in such a dramatic and depressing way that I wanted to keep reading to see if it would get better for Ethan and Lena.<br /><br />Characters: Ethan is never going to catch a break. I feel like every time he turns around, something bad and magical is happening. And to make things even more difficult for him, he has realized that he is not a simple Mortal. I loved Ethan before, but I absolutely adore him now. He is such a sweet, loyal, and caring person.<br /><br />Lena is a very dark place in this book. After suffering a huge loss, she blames herself and her guilt convinces her that she must be Dark. It was really different seeing Lena \\"darker\\" and I actually really liked it. I know, I know! That's awful. And the way she pulled away from Ethan was awful. But I can completely understand why she did everything that she did in this book.<br /><br />Liv and Link stick close to Ethan through much of the entire book. Lena is constantly running away and Ethan is constantly going after her. I love Liv and Link both. Liv is a Keeper in-training, Link is a Mortal, but I love how they take on the Caster world and do anything to help Ethan and Lena.<br /><br />Ridley has seriously become my favorite character. I know she's \\"dark\\". But I don't care. I know there is so much more to her than meets the eye.<br /><br />Plot/World-building: This book picks up right where the first ends. There is quite the hard hitting death in the end of the first book, and Lena has been spiraling into a black hole ever since. Ethan doesn't know what to do and can feel that he's losing her. Essentially, this whole book is Lena flirting with the dark side and Ethan, along with help from Link and Liv, chasing after her.<br /><br />This book definitely has a lot more going for it and more action packed than the first. I loved being introduced to the Caster world in Beautiful Creatures and I absolutely love drowning in the Caster world in Beautiful Darkness. Secrets are revealed about Ethan's mother and has him realizing that the Caster world is much more powerful and influential than he originally thought.<br /><br />The romance and love triangles in this book actually worked for me! They made sense, even if I wanted to grab every single person and shake the snot out of them. By the end of this book, all of the romances are put back in it's proper order, but I do wonder if they'll be shaken up again in the next.<br /><br />The last 80 or so pages had me on edge the whole time. So much was happening. People are reappearing, transforming, changing and it's all wonderful. And now, I really need to read the third one.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: This seems to be a series that will just get better as it goes on. I also think that I just love the darkness in the book more than I loved the lightness in the first.

B005DD7H50|4.0|Intriguing and original, suspenseful and engaging, &#34;Limitless&#34; is a great movie when you're in the mood for something beyond the &#34;norm.&#34;
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Wonderfully written novel giving us an insight to a person living with a mental illness. The book tells an excellent story of a tormented man who through adversity finds a new reason to live.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It's been on my list for a year now, and current events finally prompted me to read it.  I wonder how closely it really resembled the horrors that Amanda Berry and the others experienced in Cleveland ... a really good read.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|This garish film totally fails as an adaptation of the belle epoque era Moulin Rouge. The heavy-handed contemporary music and costuming are pure Las Vegas and they don't blend well with the campy, cluttered sets. Ewen MacGregor gives the only good dramatic acting performance. Nicole Kidman's stiff Camille-style routine doesn't cut it and remaining performers seem like clowns. This overdone film is actually more circus than cabaret.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome story, mixed with many emotions. Times of laughter, love, and tears. Highly recommend! Well definitely be reading more of Colleen Hoover novels.
B004ZJZQ7O|4.0|Another superb performance by gorgeous Denzel Washington. He's a master of seamless, split-second mood changes with effortless depth. This gritty film flows well, with backdrops from Harlem to the Golden Triangle, and back. Although \\"American Gangster\\" is great, Denzel's masterpiece crime drama remains the awesome \\"Training Day\\".
B00542USJW|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies. I was so happy when I saw it on Blu Ray. Have been watching all the time since! :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book held my attention throughout.  The story is amazing and when I saw the movie, I was glad that I read the book first!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|First book I have read of Ken Follett, but it will not be the last. I recommend it to all my family and friends
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a fun game. Eggs are unique. One problem, forgot password and can't get into place on Amazon to retrieve New password. Just want more gold. Any help? Thank you. Again, fun game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is such a lovely game and exciting product im so happy it exsists<br />If it didn`t i would have been so so borde thank you so much for creating this app
B00B19DW0E|1.0|We were very disappointed in this and couldn't continue watching the movie. I was surprised, the acting was poor and the effects were even worse. Nothing looked real at least in the first 20 minutes.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I'd give it 4 1/2 stars, but since that is not an option I am gonna go up rather than down.<br /><br />What I like most about this album is it is quite melodic and the songs are good.  It seems it is been too long since that has been the case with Megadeth. Some like Megadeth for their thrash aspects.  I could give a poo about that.  I care about good melodic songs and if they can be heavy on top of it thats cool too.  What surpises me on this album is simply that I really liked every song on first listen and.... WANTED TO HEAR THEM AGAIN.  For too long now I have heard a new Megadeth album and came away not caring to play it again.  This one is different.  The production and mixing are great... many songs have intros that are very different for Megadeth and then punch you in the teeth when the main part of the song comes.  Cold Sweat, the closing song, is just a fantastic cover song...really really well done.  The only negative thing I have to say is I think the inside Supercolider image would have made a cooler album cover than the one they chose.  Other than that... this is a return-to-best-form album for me.  Give me Youthanasia and Countdown To Extinction as my faves, and then this would be my third favorite already.  I love some songs from Rust in Peace and earlier albums, but as albums they were never as great to my ears (who prefer melodic metal to thrash) as they get hailed to be.<br /><br />This album has a great mix, good songs, great vocals, interesting lyrics, some great rhythm guitar and lead guitar work, thunderous drums, bass that compliment the songs without being too busy... really... what is not to like here?
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The book was good but when your expecting a great ending and you are left waiting again it is very upsetting! Especially when you waited so long for a book that was pushed back twice! There was no real point to this book. The material was good to read but with no real ending or gut wrenching pause to the next one, I have to say she lost the vibe that was making her trilogy better then fifty shades of grey and is now beating a dead horse, and exploiting her fans charging them more money for an ending we should have received with this book! Shame on you Sylvia Day! I thought more highly of you, well at least I did.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing. A deeper understanding into love, pain, and us. We are the side effects of life and in the same sense life is the side effect of us.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Fun to play even .love the different locations and characters. Definitely recommend  it. Fun for all. If you log on with Facebook page you get extra coins.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Unfortunately the last story in this fabulous series. Some endings predictable, and some unexpected plot twists. Fans will love it.
125000098X|5.0|I started reading the first book in the series by accident and<br />immediately was pulled into the series.  Archer's writting style puts<br />the reader right into the book.  You can feel the struggle and the<br />victories of each character.  You can relate that both the faults and<br />the good points of the characters as well.  Archer leaves the reader<br />with enough tension and mystery to want to keep reading the next page,<br />chapter, and book!  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a<br />good read.
B004JK61K0|5.0|Excellent email program for Android phones. Many options not available in the standard email program supplied with phone. Highly recommend
B0091REZMW|3.0|I actually like this game but started this game already once from the beginning cause I used all my diamonds and it wasn't necessary to do that. I already know where the items could be and i would like to open more rooms but haven't figured out how to open up some rooms completely without using my diamonds. It is a fun game all together though.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I've been streaming this show as a Prime member and can't wait to see the next episode. I sometimes watch it while I'm on my treadmill, makes me walk longer!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I love the show Castle and it was fun to read the book that they talk about on the show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book. Post-apocalyptic is my favorite kind of subject matter these days and this book did it SO well and I cannot wait for more. What's so great is that it had everything, violence, drama, love, and twists. This was truly a page-turner for me and I am going to buy the next series immediately!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have seen the movie of this story. I have to say I enjoyed both greatly,but the book is better by far!
B009YQJ322|5.0|I chose this film because I rented it on DirecTV and LOVED IT so much I had to own it of course. This movie has to be one of the best comic to film ports I have ever seen in my life. I mean they Karl Urban nailed the character the script was superb with a great plot and subplots. Actors were great this movie should have done far better than it did and definitely have spawned a sequel. Also for a budget of $60 million they did with this movie what most cannot do with $200 million (graphic wise) this movie is far from a CGI fest but when it is used it is used wisely. If you are a comic fan and especially a fan of Dredd I suggest you BUY this not rent BUY.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this is a very great game. i absolutely love it. it is so fun to play and the graphics are amazing.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|Rating it 3 because it does not have as much functionality as a regular Android OS Tablet but does what it is supposed to do
B00B7364H2|5.0|When I was growing up my family had an RCA Orthophonic Hi-Fi that could play LPs, 45s, and even 78s by flipping the stylus over via a little lever on the tonearm. Nobody in the family was particularly musical save me -- I went on to a career in music -- but we enjoyed music. I was the only one in the family to make the move to stereo, courtesy of my own RCA stereo record player that I got sometime around 1966 or so, as I recall, as a Christmas present.<br /><br />In those days newer was always better. I couldn't start acquiring stereo records until I had my stereo record player, after all, and once I could, monophonic seemed old-hat and passé. So new was always the way to go. The re-issue stuff on labels like RCA Camden, Columbia Odyssey, and London Stereo Treasury was mostly for times when funds were low, although there were some real treasures tucked into those record jackets.<br /><br />But we're in a different time now, when the treasures of the past are more enticing. I'm delighted that the major labels have seen fit to give such attention to their back catalogs, especially when I consider an alternate reality in which the labels let everything languish until the master tapes had decayed past full revival.<br /><br />So at some level I don't think it matters whether the performances are middle-of-the-road or exemplary, or whether the recorded sound is overly bright or too close or whatnot. The critical thing, to my mind, is that the recordings were saved. True, somewhere down the road they'll need to be re-issued via whatever storage means become the future norm. But those original magnetic tapes won't last forever, and the original LPs are subject to wear & tear, loss, and the like. In short, we could lose portions of our recorded heritage. These box-set reissues, and the remastering that went into creating them, have bought us a big chunk of time.<br /><br />The labels themselves own the copyrights to these recordings and can therefore do with them what theywill; someday the recordings will pass into public domain but will the original tapes be in viable condition? (And the labels will continue to own the physical tapes no matter what their copyright status.) So I remain deeply grateful for these box set releases, not only Mercury, but RCA and EMI and Deutsche Grammophon and Decca and all those EMI sets and so on and so forth. I have a soft spot for them and snap them up whenever they come out; I don't want to miss any, and it comforts me to know precisely where I can put my hands on well preserved copies of so much of our recorded heritage: I need look no further than my own library.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|My Star Trek purchase was awesome! I was most interested in the digital copy for my mobile devices. Couldn't be happier!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I appreciate the info provided. One complaint is I am not a fan of how info displays in landscape view.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My parents have enjoyed this series as have other family members. The series is engaging, the writing sublime and character development intriguing. Excellent program and I recommend the entire series.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Read this book.  It's not just your usual book - you can pick and choose what chapters to read and see what applies to your life.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game was pretty fun.  The price was higher than most and it seemed pricey when you consider you may only play it once.
B00AG297GK|3.0|If you don't mind a brainless movie and just need a few laughs, this is the way to go.  If you get offended easily, this is not the movie for you
B00006CXSS|5.0|Excellent from many points of view. Very close to real horrors of war, strong friendship created by perilous situations. I missed only the English subtitle for the hearing impaired
B008EEB4TA|5.0|I quickly fell in love with Marina and the Diamonds. Her music is ridiculously catchy, and this album is one good song after another.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I bought this CD because of the music from Silver Linings.<br />The music is so powerful and I enjoy listening to it everyday!<br />I'd recommend this CD to anyone who likes &#34;soul&#34; or the &#34;blues&#34;<br />ALABAMA SHAKES --- that's for sure!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really liked this book it made me feel like I was there in silo 18 participating in the thing's that were happening.  A great read, exciting, , and clever, kept my interest to the end.
B009J2VQSK|5.0|I like this product because of all the beautiful music...exactly like the movie.<br />It truly met my &#34;expectations&#34;<br />With music like &#34;Always Alright&#34; by Alabama Shakes...FANTASTIC!!!<br />I listen to this CD every day!<br />ALRIGHT!!!
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|completely awesome. all the songs are great, this is an excellent addition to an excellent artist's catalog. everyone should listen to more Phosphorescent. He is a credit to his race, and I mean that will all due respect.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When will the new update come out!? My friend has an iPod! And hers is updated!! She said its awesome and I would like to see what it looks like!!
B008EQGKII|5.0|This is an upgrade for a new HTPC system and Home Security Video feed system. Used a Samsung 840 PRO SSD, Crucial SO-DIMM and Intel i7. Unit is VERY quite and runs cool. You can't even hear it. Very fast, well built and a small foot print. I am happy and this will last me for a long time!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I was skeptical of this item but was willing to give it a shot for the price. turns out after watching a you tube tutorial/review on this item, its easy to use and works exactly like it claims. take a few times to get it right, but its usually like that learning new things. I'd def recommend this item. well worth the money spent.
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Seems like every RE movie just gets worse and worse.  This one is dreadful.  I wish I could have liked it, I'm a fan of the video game (earlier editions).  But - plot was terrible.  It's set up for a big finale, so hopefully that one wont be terrible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get this game so much entertainment! You will love it! The game is so creative we are on world tour right now in miami every where you go it is different and more fun!
B00CFO7PK2|5.0|This album is an answer to a long wait. After her latest title (En Mi Piel, 2011) we were left with a sweet sweet taste, wanting more. Now we have more, and even better. La Noche Mas Larga is a masterpiece album, beautiful piano from the Maestro Ivan \\"Melon\\" Lewis, and instant classics like Siboney or La Nave del Olvido.<br />You can't go wrong!! If there were 6 stars, it would have them.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Definitely worth a read for all soon to be, want to be, or already are parents. My husband and I both read and loved. Great advice.
B004N76NOI|5.0|I don't want to give much of this movie away, suffices to say while it was a bit bawdy, it was entirely enjoyable.  I loved Stephen Frears' The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel so I bought this and was not disappointed.  Delightfully developed characters, beautiful photography of the English countryside, interfering teenaged girls, a bucolic writers retreat and a local band comes to the boring fictitious town of Ewedown and the events unfold.....
B00BESJYAY|5.0|We really liked this.  A great surfing movie with good story and purpose.  E. Shue - man I havent seen her in a decade...
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It wasnt terrible... it wasnt great... it definately wasnt worth the wait. If Sylvia Day wanted to write more about megumi or cary, brett, ireland or that isufferable corrine then she should consider spin off novels like every other author writes, not make us suffer through 2 more completely unnecessary novels just to make a few more bucks. Have a little respect for the integrity of your story and your characters. The whole book takes place over a handful of weeks and only 1 major thing really progresses in my opinion. Granted, i really didnt read chapters 20-22, I just couldnt put myself through another long and drawn out cliff hanger while we wait for another installment of this series that has turned into a bit of a circus. Bottom line, true fans, read the book, the sex scenes are hot and eva and gideon are great together, but dont expect much resolution...
0425263924|1.0|I don't know where to begin.  The story line with Eva and Gideon was the same-old, same-old.  Rehashing the same issues.  There were some new twists but I couldn't bring myself to care about them. They bored me and I kept wondering how this would end.  Then  I was flabbergasted when I realized that the story wasn't over!  So much for a trilogy.  So I read 300+ pages of crap and learned that more crap would be coming.  I don't think so - I'm so done with this series.
1423124111|5.0|This book far exceeded my expectations and I was ecstatic when I opened the package and saw it for the first time! It is a large coffee table size and the colored posters are as magical as a trip to Disneyland!
B001N3EZW2|5.0|This is a premise that never grows old. The special effects, costumes and scenery were outdated, but I enjoyed seeing movies as I did as a child. Good also to see famous actors when they were oh so young. Miss them all. Still true we outsmart ourselves.
B0063IH60K|5.0|As always solitaire in any form is fun, and can occupy someone for hours.  Great game to have on the road, or when I need something to occupy me when I have idle time.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I pre-purchased the Kindle version* and Audible version of this book.  I was skeptical, because I didn't find much of a plot to the first 2, but wanted to see how she ended it.<br /><br />Half-way through, I'm finding even less of a plot and thought I would check out what others were saying ... only to find out that there are TWO MORE to get any conclusion to (what I see as) a non-story.  Well, guys ... I'm not buying in.  With my money or my time.  Five years from now, when I'm bored ... maybe.  I have returned my Kindle version and Audible version.  I guess the only way to tell authors we don't like what they're doing in through their pocketbook.  This author won't be getting any more of my $$$.<br /><br />It's a pity.  I've been a fan and loyal reader since \\"The Stranger I Married.\\"  However, I object to \\"stealth marketing.\\"  Just makes me angry.<br /><br />*Apparently, if you return a book, it no longer says \\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\"
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider Solitaire is a fun, relaxful, and challenging game, which can keep a person occupied for hours.  Great game, and I would reccommend it to anyone who likes to be challenged with difficult puzzles or games.
B008CIUS72|1.0|there is a built in flash player on ken fires. under web, go to settings, then under flash, click enable. I made the mistake of downloading only to find this doesn't work. there are instructions you can google &quot;flash player kindle fire enable &quot; info is on amazon's web pg.
0783231032|2.0|1941 is a good movie, but it only comes in letter box.  letter box is very small on my 40 inch 16-9 screen.
B000002KHF|5.0|dont know how old i was when i first heard moondance, but it tore me up. my next favorite was tupelo honey- thats the next one im going to order. im rebuilding my music collection for the 4th time
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought this because a track was used on DWTS. Then I listed to the entire CD. OH MY! BRILLIANT! I don't know if these reviews are censored but I'll tell you what...my boyfriend likes it when I listen as it's 'put you in the mood' music...especially Gorilla. OMG...
B001AUKUSG|5.0|if you are a blues fan, otis is great. we can remember him from the 60s, and this fits in well
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|I eagerly await each installment of this series, but have found myself increasingly disappointed with each new book.  The characters are becoming harder to care for. There's a definite lack of suspense in this latest offering, however as the last book in this series it has managed to wrap up the story lines. We find out who Sookie ends up with (as if we couldn't figure that out from the previous book).  Only mystery is Hunter, perhaps there will be a new series for him.
1594204217|5.0|Got this for a gift for my Uncle, and he loved it! I would definitely recommend it as a gift for the food lover in anyone's life.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Really fun and beautiful game!  Another great addition from zeptolab. Very cute looking pudding monsters you just want to mush them all together!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft helps you use your imagination to create crazy things. This is by far the best mojang game ever. One thing I need to know though,is how to get the updates.
B000002O5L|5.0|Lots of way cool music on this CD, Full Moon Fever, is way cool in my book. That's what I call Rock n Roll.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is worth 1.99 because it's unbelievable. It tells you who your thinking of. Even if mostly no one watches it. It's a great app you won't regret it
B000I62JAK|5.0|Where else can you watch ridiculously good looking people. Its just so funny feel good movie. That's all I have to say about it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love those game just got it today and it's very cool I think every body should get it<br />You can even make dragons
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Excellent book as usual from James Altucher.  He is not afraid to tell it like he sees it.  I love his daily practices for your life.  I am<br />Now incorporating them into my life.  I could not put this down as he has great stories that drive home the point.
