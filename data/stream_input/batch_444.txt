B000002JSR|5.0|When I first purchased this album, I had low expectations because of what people had told me about it.  Not surprisingly, I didn't think too much of Coda at first.  I listened to it (not very closely) a couple times, decided there were a couple of decent songs and a bunch of filler and relegated it to the back of my music collection.  Then a couple months later I pulled it out again.  Since that day, Coda has grown on me - a lot.  \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" is a quality live performance, as is \\"I Can't Quite You Baby.\\"  \\"Poor Tom\\" is a catchy, folksy tune - a definite highlight of the album.  \\"Walter's Walk\\" and \\"Ozone Baby\\" are very solid songs - Zep fans should like these a lot.  Then we get to \\"Darlene,\\" my favorite song on the album.  In fact, \\"Darlene\\" is one of favorite hard-rockin' songs by Zep.  It's awesome.  \\"Bonzo's Montreux\\" is, as you may have guessed, a percussion showcase by John Bonham.  I like this one a lot more than LZ II's \\"Moby Dick;\\" it's more of a coherent song.  Definitely the best drum-based song I've ever heard.  \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" finishes out the album, and it's a dang good way to go out.  \\"W and T\\" is straight-up hard rock, just a step below \\"Darlene\\" in my opinion.  Many fans of Zep dislike this album, and I don't understand why.  If you don't like it at first, listen a few times with an open mind and I bet you warm up to it.
B00006879E|4.0|I also recommend getting Silvertide's Show n Tell.  They are on the same record label as Maroon Five and the same Genre.  I even give it 5 stars.  Check that album out as well.
6305922756|5.0|I know that I write alot of crazy things, but this is the funniest movie of all time.  Though in some cases, it has some overquoted lines..you know which ones.  Let us not forget about such gems as. \\"I professional, and I'll rise above it.\\" \\"We'd love to stay and chat but we gotta sit in the lobby and wait for the limo.\\"   <br />HAHA outstanding!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Celine Dion is back making beautiful music.  This is a very good CD.  The inspiration for Miracle is the birth of her son three  years ago.  Celine's rendition of Roberta Flack's  The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face is my favorite track on this album.  This is one of the best songs ever written.  I think Celine performs this song so well.  I loved Celine's cover of the John Lennon's classic Beautiful Boy.  It is a wonderful song about the joy of watching your child grow up.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Brahms Lullaby.  It is interesting to hear a classic instrumental composition performed with lyrics and Celine does an excellent job on it.  A Mother's Prayer is a beautiful song that Celine performed as a duet with Andrea Bocelli at the Grammys a few years ago.  She sings this song as a solo here and it is just as moving.<br /><br />Celine shows that her voice sounds beautiful in any language.  She performs a French love song here that I really liked.  In Some Small Way is a song that  shows that  Celine has not lost amazing vocal range.  This is a lovely ballad in the mold of her earlier work in my opinion.<br /><br />If I Could is a very pretty song.  I have heard this song performed by various artists like Oleta Adams.  If I Could  is  a song about all the things we would do to protect our child.  I think the lyrics in this songs are very meaningful and heartfelt.  Celine sings this song superbly and with great feeling.<br /><br />I enjoyed listening to all the songs on this CD.  The music on this CD is very relaxing and romantic.  Miracle is a must have for all Celine Dion fans.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Do whatever you can to miss this really, really dumb movie, even if it includes duct taping a sleep mask to your face. The storyline was bad; the special effects/makeup came to the screen straight from the set of \\"Godzilla\\"; the characters were ridiculous and the poor acting made me giggle in stunned disbelief.<br /><br />Please don't spend your money on this.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|What a gift from the late Ray Charles,as his duets album,made the old fashioned way with the artists actually in his studio,is outstanding.Even the lesser selections like Willie Nelson and Johnny Mathis contained lush orchestrations. The highlights are songs with Bonnie Raitt, Michael McDonald, and B.B. King which brought goosebumps to this listener. My one criticism was not using Patti LaBelle for \\"Over The Rainbow\\". A must buy for any collection.
B0006213WG|5.0|They'll get the respect they deserve. Sum 41 is one of the greatest bands on the entire planet but everybody always thought of them as a joke because the band was never serious. However the maturity and growth on this record is remarkable and even with the new found maturity the music is still ground breaking and fantastic. Great effort.
B00005JN2X|4.0|The predictable plot symmetry of \\"Collateral\\" might be straight out of Screenwriting 101, but it matters little.  Ultimately, this isn't a plot-driven thriller - it's the story of a man who is given the chance to take a stand and thereby prove to himself that he has what it takes to change his life.  For that kind of story, plot runs a distant second to character - and there's absolutely nothing formulaic about Stuart Beattie's wonderfully original characters, nor the ways in which Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx bring them so vividly to life.  The strength of characterization in the writing and performances is phenomenal (check out how much we learn about Max in the cab depot before he says even a single word).  Tom Cruise might be all over the posters for this movie - and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in seeing him play a mesmerizingly ruthless bad guy - but Jamie Foxx is the real star.  He walks the line between strength and vulnerability so expertly you never know which side of it he's likely to fall.  The situations Beattie's script puts them in are wonderfully unsettling, the dialogue is crisp and intelligent, and the music and editing conspire perfectly to create an experience which is horribly unnerving but never less than totally compelling.  Mann's visual style is typically excellent, giving L.A. both its dreamlike expansiveness and gritty immediacy.  It's an utterly unromantic vision of the city, yet it makes you want to go there right now.  That's the touch of a great director.
B0002OERI0|4.0|It's been 4 long years since we've heard anything from Green Day and fortunately, American Idiot is not a dissappointment.  It definately is an experimental album, but the Green Day boys pull it off.  There are a couple of songs on the album (American Idiot, St. Jimmy, She's a Rebel) that are done in the fast-paced, up beat punk style similar to prior albums such as Dookie, Insomniac and Nimrod.  The rest of the songs on the album are slower and more mellow.  Not something we're used to from Green Day but they are all quality songs with good vocals and the result is an album that's different from their others and one that has a good mix of up tempo and more relaxed songs.  Another cool thing about this album is how there are reoccuring themes and characters throughout the album.  It's almost like the album is a story from beginning to end.  There's not a bad song on the album.  So, whether you have been a Green Day fan all along or if you just wanna check out their new album, I recommend this album.
068987474X|5.0|It's a book that will always rectify most of the delusional judgement women have towards men.  Women want the white knight to rescue them and will make every excuse under the sun to hang onto a \\"LOSER.\\"  The book contains alot of common sense knowledge, but every now and then when your seriously ga-ga over some guy this book reinforces some of the truth surrounding men.
B00028HBKM|1.0|<br />What, exactly, is the point of this film ?  What is its raison d'etre ??   <br /> <br />Is it to entertain ?  Hardly.  To shock ?  Possibly, but why ?  To reinforce faith ?  Again, I'm not convinced because those who truly have faith would not need images such as these to know why they have faith. <br /> <br />No, I believe it's little more than a cynical attempt to cash in on religious beliefs in a time the world would do well to put religious differences aside.  Judging by the reviews it appeals to people who are \\"religious\\" yet don't really understand why they are religious - the sheep in other words.  It plays the sympathy or pity cards very strongly and it is those which are reinforcing the beliefs of many of those who have seen it. <br /> <br />I would be disappointed if people went away from watching this film vowing to turn to religion - there is nothing in the film which should generate such a feeling other than it being out of sympathy.  Hardly a sound basis on which to base one's faith... <br /> <br />Some of the imagery is powerful, yet at other times I simply saw trite images designed to enhance the dramatic effect.  The film seemed to switch between a \\"factual\\" based telling of the stories of the new testament with elements of dramatic fiction interwoven to help build characters and fill in gaps.  It was like watching a cross between a documentary and Gladiator. <br /> <br />Sadly I now regard Mr Gibson with the utmost contempt.  This was not a film which needed to be made and it seems little more than one man's selfish indulgence.
B00005O3VD|5.0|36 years later, FUNNY GIRL shows why Barbra Streisand has become the legendary singer/actress/director/songwriter she so deserves.  Taking on the role that launched her to Broadway stardom, Babs does everything in this movie to prove \\"she's the greatest star.\\"  Sure, there are poses, posterings, a little bit of histrionics, but when she sings these magnificent songs, and bats those delicious eyes, she is gorgeous!  Her performance of \\"My Man\\" at the end is Oscar worthy; not to mention \\"I'm the Greatest Star\\" and \\"Don't Rain on My Parade.\\"  And of course, \\"People\\" one of Barbra's signature songs gives goosebumps even today.<br /><br />Omar Sharif is lushly suave; Kay Medford does a nice turn as Fanny's Mom, and even though Anne Francis was upset with her small role, she's still convincing and lovely.<br /><br />The comic production numbers, particularly HIS LOVES MAKES ME BEAUTIFUL and the Swan parody are priceless; Barbra can throw one liners off like the greatest of comediennes.  I wish the filmmakers would have included the poignant WHO ARE YOU NOW from the Broadway version; I think they opted to write FUNNY GIRL for Oscar consideration, but WHO ARE YOU NOW was a heartbreaker.<br /><br />Whether you can stand Barbra either professionally or personally, one can't deny this awesome debut performance.  She truly is the greatest star of the musical comedy stage and screen!
6305508550|5.0|Office Space isn't just funny, it's down right hilarious.  What's so great about it is that just about every working person can relate with the characters.  The story revolves around an office worker who is so sick of his boring, stuck in a cubicle all day long job.  His friends at the office (who are extremely funny) feel the same way.  Our main character has a hypnotical experience and is a changed man and no longer worries about the responsibilities that are dragging him down.  To everyone's surprise, his new lackadasical attitude towards life seems to be advancing both his career and personal life.  However, his co-workers are not so fortunate, as the company is downsizing.   <br /> <br />Office Space packs a bundle of laughs along with a great story and surprisingly good performances.  Milton may be the funniest movie character ever.  If you enjoy a good comedy (with an edge to it) and want something a little different from your run of the mill funny movies, give Office Space a try.  It won't dissappoint.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\" was to metal what Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" was to pop. If you were a fan of heavy metal in the 80's then this album was the soundtrack to your Saturday night out with the guys. There is just so much on this album to rave about, be it the killer chorus of \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\", the great guitar track of \\"Flash of the Blade, the cool \\"Egyptian\\" sound to the title cut, of the epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". There was something here for every metal fan. Iron Maiden has made a career out of defying the norm, and in a time when most bands were riding the metal-pop wave, writing songs about Girls..Girls..Girls, or Talking Dirty to Me, Maiden's subject matter was the RAF during WWII and the Blitz with \\"Aces High\\". \\"Powerslave\\" is about Egyptian mythology, and the album also features a song about fencing \\"Flash of the Blade\\". Not your typical song matter for an 80's metal band. But the highlight of the album for me is \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", based on an 18th Century poem, this 12 minute epic tells the tale of a doomed captain and his ship, and is musically one of the most impressive songs in Maiden's catalog. If you haven't heard this song, then buy this album immediately! It's worth the price of the cd alone. It doesn't matter if you think \\"Powerslave\\" is Maiden's best album, or if you like \\"Beast\\" or \\"Piece of Mind\\" or any one of their other albums better, you have to respect Iron Maiden for what they accomplished with \\"Powerslave\\".
B00005JMXX|2.0|This could have been a good film, if not for the characters.   <br /> <br />The caring-nurse-mother was one aspect I found irritating.  The fact that they included in a storyline that with all the havoc going on in the movie - she still had enough care and love in her heart to look after the kid with cancer who can't read.  I mean, that's a very nice thing to do, but I felt that it made the mother character come off as way too nice, to a sickening level. <br /> <br />I found the mother character very annoying because she's seen as quite the caring lady -- but then she constantly puts a guilt trip on her husband about not being there with their kid.  I thought she was evil in that way because her husband wanted to be there all the time, but because of his job - he couldn't!  It was very neurotic of her.  She put such a guilt trip (for who knows how many years) on him, that the ending result is him feeling like he needs to travel north to New York, to make it up to him.  \\"Yeah, I'm sorry son that my job prevents me from seeing you...but at least we'll die together.\\"  Of course he loves his son, is this the only way he can make things up to his wife and son?  Sorry, I found it very stupid. <br /> <br />Now I know those two paragraphs are going to make me come off as uncaring, but it really ruined the movie for me and my friends.  And could their son be anymore of a geek?  I mean an over-use of family values and romance in programs really kills the heart of the show.  What's the moral of the story?  With all the disaster surrounding us, family togetherness can still matter? <br /> <br />I'm sorry, but this could have been a cool movie. Going for heart-warming tales in dire situations.  It seems like the writers are trying to please the fans and critics too much.  The illusion of 'we can overcome anything together'.  I guess I held my hopes too high for this picture.
B000003TAR|5.0|...that hasn't already been said? Nevermind created a hype. it became overrated and, yes, over-talked about [hell it still is today! but don't get me wrong, i do love Nevermind...just got a little sick of the commercilism it was put through] by the media. When Nirvana went to create their 3rd album they could have been less artisic, cared less about the music, and could have easily made Nevermind part 2, cashed in, and lived like kings off the riches provided to them by the billions of teenyboppers who adored their angsty teen anthems. But...that's not what happened. Instead, they went into a studio and created a masterpeice of an album that was far more dark, far more loud and far more deeper than Nevermind. Did it lose them fans? if record sales show anything [which they don't because if Hilary Duff has the #1 record in the world than obviously people are not buying music based on TALENT] then In Utero definetly lost them a few million teenybopper fans...but i guess you could argue that that was for the better. Anyways, this Album is my favorite studio album [with Bleach being second...it hardly gets any attention] for quite a few reasons. One of them being that it contains some of my most favorite Nirvana songs...Rape Me, Milk It, Dumb, FFWHHROS, Serve the Servants, RFUS and of course, the most famous song off it: Heart-Shaped Box. Another reason is for Dave Grohl's profound drumming. While Nevermind had the beat kinda hidden in the back, with In Utero it is a powerful blow to your ears [in a good way..]. The Playing by the rest of the band is great too, while Kurt's guitar-playing has often recived a lot of criticism for being 'bad' here it is just in-your-face, f*** you if you don't like it, raw aggressive and energetic. It is almost as if he's playing as loud and abrasive as he possibly can just for the soul purpose of pissing people off. But there are moments where his guitar playing is quiet, humble and just plain pretty...especially with the added cello onDumb and All Apologies. Of course i can't leave Krist out...the bass, along with the drum, is way more noticable on this album than Nevermind. There are times when the heart-beat, melodic rythm of the bass seems to give the songs a sort of life of their own...as if they are alive somehow [crazy as that sounds]. Now for the lyrics...they are by far the band's best. You can read the lyrics of any song without the music and it's like poetry. Too many bands today go for unoriginal generic and oh-so-obvious lyrics like \\"my girlfriend left me, i'm so sad, she freaking hates me, la la la\\"  Compare that to any lyric from a Nirvana song and the difference is undeniable: talent. yes, there was a time when talent mattered, when people like Kurt wrote lyrics, not dumb little snippits of crap that shold have never been turned into a song, there was a time when grunge was over-hyped and Pearl Jam's Ten and Nirvana's Nevermind ruled the charts...but i'd rather remember grunge for it's poetic quality and it's ability to connect with people like no other genre could [hell with hair metal happening it wasn't hard to do something better! anything's better than that crap] as with Pearl Jam following up their radio staple Ten with the more mature Vs. Nirvana matured as well and got considerably better with In Utero. Instead of wondering what could have been had Kurt not died, just listen to In Utero and marvel at what he and his band did acomplish.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I loved this film. Macauley Culkin was so convincing in is role that I wonder if he isn't gay!!!! Seth Green was good; but Macauley upstaged him. Story is from the book DISCO BLOODBATH by James St. James; who is Seth Greens character.     The film is about a bunch of out of control Party Kids who run a night club in New York. Lots of drugs even a murder; but, in the end, become lost by their own success. Acting and direction is good. Perhaps you have to be (...)to really appreciate this fine film
B00005JNEI|5.0|Thank God for Michael Moore!  He's a true American hero and this film proves it.  I especially liked how he emphasized the Bush/Saudi connection.  There's several gruesome scenes that aren't for people with weak stomachs, but they help to tell the story like it really is.  As an American citizen, you would always like to believe that your Government is trustworthy and does the right thing, but this film shows just how untrustworthy the Government can be.  It makes you realize that if you, as an average citizen, don't take control of your government, the government will take control of  you.  It wasn't like the film suddenly turned me anti-Bush; I was against him ever since he stold the last election from Gore.  It just added many more reasons to support my views.  I think that anyone who watches this film and still plans to vote for Bush is in great need of a trip to the nuthouse.
B00067BBQE|5.0|This DVD no doubt is going to be one of the best things Evanescence has done, and also, some comfort until their next cd release. Any fan of Evanescence's wil be sure to buy this. Thank you AMY and the band!
B00005JNEI|1.0|I actually went to see this film at a friend's house because of the controversy. While there was supposedly a lot of \\"fact checking\\" done with this movie, even Richard Clark had to admit that the central premise of the Saudis leaving the USA while other aircraft were not allowed to fly was a lie. The scenes of death and destruction in Iraq with the Americans there vs. the garden of Eden that was Iraq under Saddam seemed to have overlooked the mass graves of babies in their mothers arms with bullets in their heads that Saddam ordered. But I do think that this movie is powerful. If only Moore would have been around in the USA at the same time that Leni Riefenstahl was working for the Nazis in Germany, we would not have gone to war against Hitler and his \\"final solution\\" in dealing with the \\"Jewish question\\" would have been completed. No Israel, no Palestinian intifada, no problems. And no suffering for American families who lost hundreds of thousands of their loved ones in fighting someone who was just trying to grab a little \\"lebensraum\\" for the master race. I am sure that Moore will get an Academy Award for this. I'm sure Saddam would give him a kiss for it, too. A master propagandist who is just a couple generations too late.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0446310786|4.0|<br />Atticus Finch is a lawyer in a racially divided Alabama town in the 1930s. He agrees to defend a young black man who is accused of raping a white woman. The story is told <br />through the eyes of  young girl, who is a feisty tomboy.  Scout sees things in different <br />views of the situation and bases her decisions on what she thinks is right for Mr. Tom  <br />Robinson (the accused). Scout is maturing and experiencing things in her lifetime. At this  <br />time she is encountering the issue of racism which is throughout the entire town.  The town is out to get Tom Robinson, a black man who is charged with rape. She and her <br />brother Jem are upset with the guilty verdict and feel that his trust in the goodness and rationality of humanity has been betrayed.  <br /> <br />What I like about the book was that it represented and shows how racism is a strong emotion, which is still around today.   <br /> <br />What I didn't like was reading about the interpretation and views of the townspeople and how they viewed and perceived Tom Robinson. <br />
0761536434|5.0|In many ways, this book may be misrepresented to people.  Its not simply \\"hey, remember how awesome this game was?\\" type of book, nor does it look at games from a technical side (though technology is featured at times).  This is more to do with the social impact of games.  As such, it does not spend excessive time on the failed consoles, or failed games (though the exception can be made for the Atari-buster known as E.T.).<br /><br />Its a very useful book, I'm using it for a college class!  Its probably the first 'text book' i'll actually look forward to keeping!  The book is about as comprehinsive as one volume can be (and obviously, books like High Score and Game Over will complement this book).  It is comprehensive, and exhaustive, as there are many excerpts from the people that made the games, and changed the world of home entertainment.  A great book, when teamed up with a personal history of video games, this can shed some light on the people and events behind the games.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Read the Amazon's review, with a non-satalite programmed home box I still am not and will not be obliged to take that stellar Sopranos kiddo of BMOC from any video shop.

B00028HBKC|5.0|What is there to say about this movie? This is the story that portraying to us that God has opened the door for all to heaven. You can't sugarcoat what happened to Jesus, and you can't dumb it down. Listen up people, watch this movie and remember this as you watch it: This is all for you! No, not for all of mankind, but for you. God's love is so great for us that he would give his son for just one of us. This movie was made with a purpose, and it's purpose was fulfilled. Gibson did a masterful job as well as Caviezel.  <br /> <br />Listen to me, watch this movie...and if by the end there is not a tear running down your cheek then check your heart. No, don't check your heart, check if you have one. And if your heart doesn't jump and your whole world isn't upside down at the part where Jesus turns to say \\"This day you will be with me in paradise\\" to the sinner on the cross next to him, check your pulse. I have no idea where people are even coming up with these wild allegations that this movie is not in line with the bible, are you sure you watched the right movie and you aren't reading the book \\"Adventures of Huck Finn\\"? I think that is just crazy because I've been studying the New Testament and I just don't see where it isn't following the Bible.  <br /> <br />This movie isn't fiction, it is real. THIS HAPPENED OUT OF LOVE FOR YOU! It was all for you. I watch that movie and just rejoice at the thought of someday I will be with that man in heaven. I can't wait until God comes for his loved ones. This movie is life-changing, no, this movie is the story of our lives and the greatest gift that has ever been given. I commend Mel Gibson in his passion on making the movie, the man has some gumption. Watch this movie, if you've seen it, watch it again and check your heart. Thank you for your time.  <br /> <br />And one of the soldiers looked at the cross and said \\"Truly this man was the son of God!\\"  <br /> <br />Three days later....
1400034779|4.0|This novel is arranged much like a collection of short stories that center on Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's only female private investigator.  Precious's charm and her compassion for everyone she meets in combination with a lack of the sensational gore and perversion present in so many mysteries makes this an enjoyable read.
B00000JHAU|5.0|As you can see, the reviews of this one run the whole gamut - from Awful, to great (but not on par w/ Tigermilk & Boy w/ the Arab Strap), to one of the best albums of all time.  <br /> <br />Here's the straight dope -- This album does NOT go as many places as Tigermilk or BWTAS. \\"If you're feeling sinster\\" lacks any departure tracks like Expectations and Is it wicked not to care. But that's a good thing, because IYFS is the definitive Belle and Sebastian recording. Nearly every song is in the signature B&S style you can recognize before Stuart even starts singing. This is a great \\"full listen\\" album, so it's best to devote some time to listen to it all at one shot if possible. I guess I'll do a track by track. <br /> <br />The Stars of Track & Field: I can't say enough about this song. One of Stuart's best, most timeless melodies. Nice build, great lyrics. 5/5 <br /> <br />Seeing other people: a truly signature B&S song, the swirling piano intro nabs you immediately, and the lyrics and melody keep you interested straight through. 5/5 <br /> <br />Me & the Major: This is not one of the best songs on the album. The melody is a tad annoying to me -- at least for the verse. The chorus is good. 3/5 <br /> <br />Like Dylan in the Movies: A nice softer one -- not a particularly compelling track, but still a great listen. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Fox in the snow: This is some of Stuart's better metaphorical lyrics. The song sort of plods at the start but it gains some ground throughout and ends up as a good one. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Get me away from here, I'm dying: A poppy take on the Pachelbel's Canon progression with a great lead into the title track. 4/5 <br /> <br />If you're feeling sinister: What an amazing song. It builds from some ambient noise of children playing and some soft steady strumming. Great lyrics and a wonderful, simple melody. The chorus payoff doesn't come until well over halfway through the song, but it's certainly worth the wait. 5/5 <br /> <br />Mayfly: I'm getting tired of writing these, but this one is great too. 4/5 <br /> <br />The Boy done wrong again: This song doesn't do a whole lot for me. I think it's because Stevie Jackson sounds kind of silly crooning \\"the boyyy done wronnng againnnn....\\". 3/5 <br /> <br />Judy and the Dream of Horses: B&S close out the album with another great tune. The train-whistle thinger is a great addition. This is a lot of people's favorite track on the album, though for me that is reserved for the title track or the Stars of Track and field. 4.5/5 <br /> <br /> <br />I discovered B&S by running across \\"This is just a Modern Rock song\\". That track is very different from most of their work, so after hearing and loving that so much, it was hard for me to start getting into the other stuff I'd heard. But it's a worthwhile journey.

B00027JYLC|4.0|Blessed be.An early talkie directed by legendary silent film director Tod Browning. This film defies genre. It sure is unsightly. Hold on tight. It's about circus freaks. The cast is  comprised primarily of real life Circus freaks. They are people too.In black and white, with grainy audio that may or may not be deliberate, we see a murder/ insurance fraud mystery develop. The victim is a freak; the killer is not.No money will help the freaks.Lawlessly, and in the mood for revenge, the killer is captured by the freaks. The hideous freaks do something hideous, and now have a new friend.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|To sum it up... Awesome! I enjoyed the `Scenes from a Memory' DVD, but got a little tired of the 80's style graphics and a few of the visual effects. This DVD, Live at Budokan, is a Dream Theater and musician's dream. Great shots of the individual band members, right at the high points of their solos and fills, and fantastic surround sound audio. Particularly enjoy how they mixed around, in 5.1 surround, Jordan Rudess' keyboard tracks. Great zoomed, fixed shot of John Petrucci's solos, I felt like I was watching an instructional video, but with the whole band. If you're a musician, or just appreciate the highly technical ability of this band, you will love this video. I still can't get over the bonus DVD multi-angle for \\"Instermedley\\". Great work Dream Theater! You made a great video treasure for your fans and more...
B00009V7RF|1.0|\\"Let's get Retarded?\\" oh that's so funny and clever and witty!  This band is comparible to Crash Test Dummies and the great Spin Doctors!  Let's make fun of the mentally challenged and appeal to the lowest common denominator!!!  Hey, your next cd should be called \\"Let's get crippled and ride in a wheelchair\\" or \\"Let's have a stroke and slur our speech\\"; oh yes, with talent like that, the black peas will be around for a long time!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|For anyone concerned about war and the repercussions of a single mis-guided bomb this documentary will shed some light on often ignored ideas about the subject of war. <br /> <br />This film contains mostly historical images and memories of the Cold War Era, World War II and Vietnam as seen through the perspective of Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Despite looking at war through hindsight the results remain the same, civilians die in despair, soldiers are placed in harms way and educated desk jockeys with a famous name direct it all behind the cover of powerful governments. I found McNamara to be both humble and amazingly sensitive to the catastrophe of what he subjected our American soldiers to during the Vietnam War. Even though McNamara was notorious for being arrogant, uncommunicative and boldly defiant when faced with protecting his presidents (Kennedy & Johnson), with age I think you will find he has mellowed and looked at his wake honestly and with some regrets. I found him to be similar to our current Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who has apparently not learned any of the lessons McNamara is teaching these days. I wonder if Rumsfeld will be so forthcoming in another 30 years to admit his weaknesses and errors along with his administrations.  <br /> <br />McNamara claims that war cannot end without ruining communities and propagating death and destruction in its wake. He is honest in his description of the loss that other countries have suffered at our often expedient retaliations, for instant 100,000 people were incinerated in Tokyo alone PRIOR to dropping nuclear weapons during WWII and he feels that this occurred partly because of his analysis of what the weapons our government was developing could do. McNamara clearly states he felt he acted as a war criminal but was never tried. He also fully admits responsibility for the deaths of thousands of civilians. He questions the survivability of the human race when over 2500 nuclear weapons existwithin reach of a single world leader who chooses to make a very bad decision on any given day. He feels that war morality is purely based upon winning and that leaders choose war because they believe what the see and not what is truth. Funny how that statement applies today! Interestingly enough even in Vietnam our generals were asking for more troops while the Washington desk jockeys reduced the call-up by half and this fact continues to occur today. Many aspects of this film will clearly resonate within the Iraq war. So how much evil will eventually equal good? <br /> <br /> Robert McNamara provides 10 lessons about war that need to be heeded by all future generations and leaders: <br /> <br />1. The human race will not eliminate war but can reduce brutality by seeking \\"just\\" wars. <br />2. Human fallibility and nuclear weapons will lead to destruction. <br />3. America is not omniscient and should not proceed unilaterally except in our own defense. <br />4. Moral principles are ambiguous but US Foreign policy should seek to avoid the carnage of 160 million dead in the 20th century alone. <br />5. We have failed as a nation to advance fundamental necessities of nutrition, literacy, health and employment both at home and abroad. <br />6. Corporate executives have a responsibility to their employees, their customers and to society as a whole. <br />7. Kennedy states: \\"The primary responsibility of a president is to keep the nation out of war if at all possible.\\" <br />8. Individuals should be held responsible for crimes against humanity and a system of jurisprudence based on the International Court should be supported. <br />9. Terrorism will not be dealt with effectively without empathy. <br />10. The U.S. is contributing to the breakdown of the Non-Proliferation Regime and placing society at risk of terrorists obtaining weapons of mass destruction. <br /> <br /> It seems the fog has indeed been lifted but now it takes listening to. Afterall \\"out of the mouth ofbabes\\" may come something interesting but true wisdom always comes from the elders, those folks that have lived through exactly what we never want to live through again but are on the verge of doing. The most profound revelation I learned from this film was a fact that McNamara struggled over, he stated that the mere mention of withdrawing troops from Vietnam by Kennedy resulted in the military coup that killed Diem of South Vietnam and began the war in Vietnam. Aren't we currently doing the same in South Korea and will America only be left to blame once again? McNamara's learned wisdom is important to contemplate but more significant is caring how we are represented by our government to the rest of the world and realizing that all of the blood shed in our name can never be washed clean. It will always leave the threat of fog if we place our future in the wrong hands. <br />
B000002MT0|2.0|although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album \\"musicology\\" instead.
068987474X|5.0|I've never understood the male psyche. It's challenging to say the least but isn't that what makes Life interesting, exciting and never monotonous?<br /><br />Having heard about this book on Oprah, I resolved to make a purchase. I read it through at one sitting! I must honestly say that it opened my eyes and confirmed some things in my relationships with men that I intuitively knew but was unwilling to admit to myself.<br /><br />I'm glad that this was written so that all the naive, weak-willed, and yes, 'foolish' women would no longer fall for the 'excuses' of men. Granted, some guys will be honest to admit truth (the 0.05% perhaps) but I simply wish there were more open communication between the sexes.<br /><br />So, enough of the games and come clean with us, guys. What are you afraid of??? I mean, you're only Man without a rib (aka Wo-man)....We need each other no matter how you look at it.
0140277447|5.0|I'm an 18 year old college freshman.  Generally, people my age aren't interested in books like The Rape of Nanking... but they should be.  This is one of the most little known events of the second world war, yet it is one that should be discussed in every history classroom.  I never learned about this in high school.  I just happened to stumble across it online one day, and went to B&N to pick it up.  As I read, I was shocked to discover that the Japanese all but ignore the massacre that took place in Nanking.  It is not even included in textbooks.  Even more suprising is that China has not brought it up since the war's end.  It just boggles my mind how something so incredibly barbaric could be hidden from so many and completely ignored.  This book was very well written, a quick read, and intriguing enough to keep my attention (I'm rather young, so its hard for anything to keep my attention for too long).
B00004W4UB|5.0|This movie is so, so creepy and gothic and weird, without being too bloody or too gratuitous. It's silently creepy and disturbing, that's its power.     I didn't buy the Jekyll and Hyde being two different guys because anybody with half a mind can see its Malkovich in both roles, so I find it hard to believe that Mary Reilly and others wouldn't recognize that, they should have disguised him better, not just different hair color.     Other than that, everything in the film works great. Malkovich is superb as always in his subdued sophisticated decadent villain acting mode, and Julia Roberts really shows her range as an actress, playing this timid mousy little maid with a sad past.
B000002KN8|3.0|It's hard to rate this with stars, so I just gave it three. I just wanna quote a close friend here: This album is so bad that it bypassed bad, went to good, then went full circle back to bad again.  <br /> <br />I think it's bad in one of those hilarious good ways. Just hearing the lyrics of Photographic makes me laugh harder than when I watch President Bush speak.. and that's alot of laughing. So I think that if you have a sick and twisted sense of humor, and for instance enjoy the failure of a prominent rock band, you should own this. But don't buy it! steal it, burn it, whatever.. it is just not worth twenty dollars, or even ten dollars. I'm probably gonna get it from a dm fan who doesn't want the album to shame her collection. <br /> <br />I don't know why I like this album.. it's a sick fasination.. like a freak show. It's so bad, it blows your mind! I didn't know such awful things could be released. Such a mistake for a first album!
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I love Underworld. What a fantastic movie. The plot is fit for my type of storyline I would like to see. Kate Beckinsale was the best in this movie. A well thought out movie with lots of a action sequences mostly gunfights. The stunts Kate did were really cool. I can't wait to see Underworld 2.
B00064MW6A|4.0|...and I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />I went into this movie as a not expecting much - but hoping to be entertained and I was.  The movie was bright, colorful and camp as Christmas.<br /><br />Like the other reviewers said - it has nothing to do with the comic lore - but if you can get past that and want to see a cheesy super \\"hero\\" movie - then go for it.<br /><br />I had a good time and sometimes that's all you want from a movie.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|First I'll tell you everything that's wrong with \\"The Evil Dead\\" -- the acting is poor, the dialogue is bad, the characters are 2-D, the special effects are cheesy and the film quality is mediocre. And you know what? \\"The Evil Dead\\" is still one of the most transgressive, experimental horror films ever made.  <br /> <br />The plot is about as bare-bones as it gets: A group of college kids go into the woods of Tennessee for some R&R, they find a tape recording of the cabin's owner reciting passages from the \\"Book of the Dead\\" that unwittingly release demons into the surrounding woods, and one by one the cast is possessed. The only way to stop the possessed is through the act of bodily dismemberment... and even then, decapitated heads continue to giggle and squeal; severed limbs continue to twitch and bleed. Before long our blood-soaked hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is alone in a fight for his life against the possessed corpses of his friends.  <br /> <br />\\"The Evil Dead\\" is an absolute clinic in how to do low-budget horror right. Sam Raimi shocks the viewer with gore: There are decapitations and axe dismemberments, gnawed off hands, pus-spewing demons, thumbs in eye sockets, a cabin that drips blood, and in one of the more queasy scenes I've witnessed in any movie, a woman is brutally raped by vines out in the woods. But Raimi doesn't just pulverize the viewer with carnage; he also uses odd-angled shots and an eerie \\"loud-quiet-loud\\" score to disorient the viewer and build an eerie, hallucinatory atmosphere: By the end of the film, the relentless howl of the woods outside the cabin becomes almost as frightening as the goriest dismemberment. <br /> <br />This is easily one of the goriest, most creative movies I've seen, and a real landmark not just in horror films but also in low-budget film making. A must have for horror fans.
B00005JMJG|5.0|in this wondeful movie are about the meaning of true love and ethics. I definitely think the movie clearly makes a case for not exercising in mind control, whatever the motive or gain. It's dehumanizing and only love can get the characters out of a kind of inhumanity. This is a principled approach to ethics that says that some boundaries should never be crossed. Wasn't Hitler a utilitarian? What if he could have bio-mechanically controlled minds not just brainwashed them from the outside in?  <br /> <br />Yet, this movie stands out because love wins the day.
B000002JR8|5.0|Far Beyond Driven is definitely the best Pantera album. Such songs as 5 Minutes Alone and I'm Broken make this a must have for any and all fans of the hard stuff. These guys were definitely the kings of metal (too bad....). Dimebag is one of my all time favorite guitarist, he was actually the reason I started playing a couple years back. Other great songs are Strength Beyond Strength, Becoming, Slaughtered, 25 Years, Shedding Skin, Use My Third Arm, and Throes of Rejection. If you do not own this album, your metal collection will never be complete.
B00005JMJG|5.0|you might not be so angry and alienated if you actually sought out loving relationships. I don't mean to be moralizing but I am old enough to tell you been there and done that. Nothing compares to real love. Take it from someone probably old enough to be your mother.
B00005YUNY|5.0|Frustrated Yesfans rejoice!This is as close as we have gotten yet to the magical power of this bands' legendary live prowess,on DVD or VHS(official releases,anyhow!).Although Wakeman-less,the band proves,beyond any shadow of a doubt what a force to be reckoned with they can be,when captured effectively in a live setting.There are very strong versions here, of the epics,in particular.Close To The Edge,Ritual,and Gates Of Delirium...?all in one show?!...these guys are supposed to be aging dinosaurs of the (supposedly!) all-but-defunct progressive rock genre.Here they prove ALL of these assumptions wrong,AND then some!The newer material, too,is represented extremely well- In The Presence Of from the highly underrated Magnification release is a revelation unto itself(possible slight vocal overdubs notwithstanding).When I first saw this,it was a joyous occasion,for it was profound confirmation of what we Yesfans already knew-this IS, & has been,for a mighty long time-The Finest Live Band Upon The Planet.Here Steve Howe shines so brightly(guitar sound quibbles aside-its what he's playing that's important!),it's a wonder his legend hasn't grown any further than he had already accrued in the 70's-his playing just seems to get better & better!Here Chris Squire plays those amazing basslines from Gates in front of our astonished faces.Here Jon Anderson's voice descends from Heaven in a more majestic manner than it ever did,back when we were all young.And,here,finally!-is visible proof of the strength,power and endurance of Alan White on the drumkit(my brother refers to it as \\"A roomful of drums\\"-Alan's Percussion Room!),who singlehandedly steals the whole show by never letting up-possibly the single most focused performance by a drummer I have ever witnessed!The Orchestra,too,is fabulous-young,good-looking(mostly female!),and enthusiastically enjoying playing along with this,some of the most challenging material of our time.Completely enjoyable,beginning to end.If you love Yes,THIS is a must!If you don't love them,well,by gosh!HERE is a good place to see what you've been missing!
0553278223|5.0|A perfectly crafted collection of interwoven stories. A social commentary made up of flawless story telling that makes us look into ourselves and just say \\"woah.\\" And it's not just for science fiction fans- I'm definitely not one. I'm just a huge Bradbury fan.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie was saved by a great performance by Bill Murray.  Without his quirky and fascinating presence, this film would have nothing going for it.<br /><br />What a great dramatic actor Murray has become.
B000683VI4|5.0|Everyone has different reasons for watching movies. There are ones with violence, ones with romance, ones with mystery, and ones with deep meaning. You sometimes pay for a movie not knowing what you will get to see. I didn't know anything about The Notebook prior to walking into the movie theatre. All I knew is I wanted something nice. <br />I sat in a mostly full theatre watching this movie. Watching these actors that have been on screen many times before, watching them tell a story. Nothing struck me more than just how this was life. There was a story, one about love, but real love. The kind I watched my grandparents share and when I said my wedding vows I knew I wanted for myself. The colors in this movie, the sentiments, the feeling swept through me like I was there. I finished watching this movie with tears falling down my cheeks. Embarrassed, I looked around for a way to duck out before anybody thought I was a foolish woman for crying. But everyone else in the theatre was crying too. Even the men were wiping tears from their eyes. Husbands held their wives and girlfriends nodded in understanding. I knew then I was not alone. I haven't been so moved since watching Bridges of Madison County. I told my husband later I wish he had been there to see it. I said, everything I ever wanted out of my life with him was there, the good and the bad.  <br />I anxiously awaited for this movie to come out on DVD and it seems now it's been postponed until February of 2005. I will have to wait longer to buy a copy of this movie...a movie I fell in love with one summer day. <br />
B00005JMH2|5.0|I have been a fan of the original Japanese version for years and anticipated the release of this one for some time.  I was hoping beyond hope that they would stick closely to the original screen play, and I was not disappointed.  I loved it, I laughed and cried and cheered.  I was definately NOT disappointed. <br /> <br />Bravo to Richard Gere, Susan Serandon and even J.LO and my all time favorite crazy man Stanley Tucci.
B00006LI26|5.0|This is an amazing album.  The first Helloween album I ever heard was Dark Ride.  This album is much darker and more powerful.  If you like speed metal or thrash this album is a must buy.  Probably their best.  The newer albums seem toned down a little bit.  I suggest this album and both Keeper albums as well as Dark Ride and Rabbit Dont Come Easy.  Helloween is definately one of the most underrated bands around today.  If you like metal or shred pick this album up!!!
B00006RU5B|3.0|Ok, when i heard that longtime vocal genius Chris Cornell was teaming up with the ex members of Rage Against the Machine...i wondered how this Frankenstein was going to work. Lets face it, you are taking a very melodic, moody voice and throwing it together with a politically charged, anthem filled band.  Seemed like oil and water, just didn't mix.  Cochise came on the radio, and i wasn't direly convinced that it was ok. It took Like a Stone to convince me that this could work out fine. Then i heard the song again....and again....and again...and again... <br /> <br />Then a friend of mine picked up the album and we listened to it in his basement.  I can still remember that around track 9 we looked at each other and said \\"this is still audioslave? How much longer is it?\\" and other comments like that.  This album drags on and on and on, almost like the timespan their songs remained in constant radioplay.  <br /> <br />Now thats not to say that the songs are not good, or at least ok...but so many only good or ok songs tend to ware a listener's patience very thin, as is the case with this album. I can understand that molding a supergroup together brings two sides to the table, each with amazing amounts of ideas and the like.  This however, was a case of too many ideas being considered \\"good\\" and actually making it on the album, rather than using a larger filter to keep only the gems on this album. I applaud the slower, more melody driven songs on this album, because Cornell's voice does coincide well with Tom Morello and the boys of Rage.  They can make awesome music, i can see it, and they did make good music on this record, but they also made their fair share of mediocre music. <br /> <br />My advice to a potential buyer: persue this album with a very open mind, open a large amount of time up, and if you get bored, grit your teeth and take one for the team. Then, after all that happens, applaud Audioslave's efforts even if you despise them, and then consider Chris Cornell's solo effort \\"Euphoria Morning.\\"  Now its miles different than this album musically, but trust me, you will enjoy it a lot more.
B00005JMXX|3.0|i enjoyed the efx, haven't seen many that were better. the water coming through NYC seemed pretty good. here comes the \\"bad\\" part.. i was totally \\"disturbed\\" with the reaction of our southern \\"buddies\\" i.e. mexico and the rest of south america.\\"forgive all debts\\" and we'll let you in? they never did say what african nations demanded of europe. this part of the movie struck a nerve. as what used to be called (and still is i guess) an \\"ugly america\\", and having been out of this country, i fully realize (as most of you do not) that most of the \\"third world\\" would LOVE to see America on it's knees. to see this great country of mine beg to be let into mexico turned my stomach. it was for me the only part of the movie that was \\"true\\". a great warning for those that saw it. if you didn't, look again. we (americans) are not welcomed anywhere, unless we have the cash. <br />good movie, great efx, and a message.....seems not to many saw it though. a side bar: how many south american countries gave aid to us during the hurricanes that just hit the US? NONE!! what a suprize!!!!

B00004XONN|5.0|I own the entire Radiohead collection and thought for a while that \\"OK Computer\\" was their best yet, that is, until I listed to \\"Kid A\\" again. This is by far their most mature and diverse of all their recordings. \\"Amnesiac\\" is excellent as well, but clearly borrows from the prior creative success of this album. I will note, however, that one may not take to this entire recording automatically, and it may take a few listens before it really sticks to you. However, once it does, I believe it will be the favorite of any Radiohead fan. If you are new to this group, \\"The Bends\\", \\"Kid A\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" are probably essential listening. Everything else is gravy.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I'm your typical screwed-by-love princess. And this film would have made me a convert for the saying \\"it is better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all.\\", had I seen it ten years ago.<br /><br />But the story is not just about love, it's about ethics. If you are possessed with the ability to influence someone's mind, how far do you take it? Do you use it as a tool to control other people? Or do you share it as share it as a resource to grow and learn?<br /><br />This film demonstrates the reasons why humans have a need to go through pain and suffering - though we needn't dwell in these states once the objective is achieved.<br /><br />In love, the pain we go through in aftermath, and much of the suffering we endure during, is to learn and to grow. And if we're able to do that, maybe the next time won't go so wrong... or at least not in the same predictable way.<br /><br />This film is good for helping heal broken hearts, and is somewhat of a balm to the righteous lonely who refuse to settle for a relationship that falls short of their reasonable aspirations.
0790729628|2.0|I didn't have time to look through the several hundred reviews to see who else noticed the blatant mistakes in this cut of Bladerunner.  So I apologize if this is a reiteration but I believe that this subject warrents a fresh review. <br /> <br />Like I said there are editing mistakes in this film, at least two really horrible ones.  Ridley Scott was quoted at saying he did a quick edit for this dvd release and has plans to do a better job for a more complete (one would presume special edition) release. <br /> <br />I too bought this, drooling in anticipation of the director's cut of one of my most beloved films.  While I do believe that the lack of narration improves the film (although this never really bothered me all that much, perhaps because my first several viewings were when I was a kid), the bad editing means you should wait for a better DVD release.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|The film speaks for itself. As fresh and damn well entertaining as it was forty years ago, this is How To Make a Family Movie 101. The cast are uniformly excellent (ignoring Dick Van Dyke's appaulling Cockney accent) and the songs are by far the Sherman Brothers' best. The extended running time never drags and the script sparkles with it's aim at every demographic. <br />The extras are still a little sketchy - the 'plus much more' not boding very well - but the real gem of this is the commentary. Very few classic movies of this vintage are lucky enough to have their two principle performers still alive and I really had hoped that Andrews and Van Dyke would take to the microphone. I am not disappointed! Hopefully this will be an all-new group commentary and not just interveiw snippets spliced together. <br />The other hope for this disc - and this one seems less likely - is that this will be released around the same time as the stage production of the movie hits the London stage. I would love to see some coverage of this show on the extras ala Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, but since the show will be in it's infancy, I doubt whether there would be time to assemble such footage. We may have to wait for the fiftieth anniversary edition for that!
1878424319|5.0|A sliver of a tome, this one is worth having at arm's length in case you are facing one of life's challenges and your self-esteem is in precarious balance. Don Miguel Ruiz has written something quite simple yet profound based on ancient Toltec wisdom he learned from his elders in Mexico. The book explains how, as children, we're taught all kinds of things about what we must do and who we must please-and as we find out, often through expensive psychoanalysis or at least a hefty dollop of Oprah, a lot of those beliefs make us unhappy. He explains succinctly that we have become mired in others' \\"black magic\\". This problem started for us at birth when the nurturing process begins. We have chosen to believe what we have been programmed to believe, i.e., that we are imperfect, we are bad, that we depend on each other to assess our value. Ruiz explains that we can create our own earthbound heaven by reclaiming the birthright of our happiness and stop believing all the lies we've been given. But a person can make four simple pacts that will make a huge difference in his or her life.<br /><br />In brief, the four agreements are:<br />(1) \\"Be impeccable with your word.\\"  Don't lie, don't gossip. Follow through on your commitments.<br />(2) \\"Don't take anything personally.\\" Don't judge yourself by how others perceive you. Everyone acts out of his or her own preconceptions. If someone asks you for a favor, you will do it only if you want to and not because you have to.<br />(3) \\"Don't make assumptions.\\" No could have, should have second-guessing. Allow experiences to be what they are, for as Tony Randall memorably said as Felix on \\"The Odd Couple\\", \\"Never assume...because you make an 'ass' of 'u' and 'me'.\\"<br />(4) \\"Always do your best.\\" And you will never have to worry how you could have done better.<br /><br />These are basic principles, common sense really, but taken together, it's a powerful message to anyone who questions the value of their existence. Obviously this is all easier said than done, especially when you are challenged by those who have yet to be touched by these agreements. That's what makes this particularly essential reading for the soul.lly when you are challenged by those who have yet to be touched by these agreements.

B0000DCGT0|5.0|Seabiscuit is one of those movies which I should have seen much earlier, but did not do so because of the generally unfavourable reviews which I received from friends. Next time, I am going to be much more probing and patient.<br /><br />It turned out to be one of the most incredible movies I have seen in many years. But here I must say something about movies in general. Different people have a different penchant towards movies. Most of the times, this is obviously so because of our specific interests. An ice-hockey fan is much more likely to truly appreciate the movie 'Miracle', based on the American team's victory against Russia in the 1981 olympics. And so it goes for any one of us. In my case, American History is one of my major intersts, and I so I don't find it surprising that I greatly liked 'Seabiscuit'.<br /><br />The movie is hardly about a horse, although the horse is the central character in the movie. The most important thing is that it's based on a true story and that changes the equations. Seabiscuit, first and last, is about a people, struggling through depression times, who come together as a nation, beginning a juggernaut towards freedom and progress that continues to this day (Unfortunately we cannot be as certain about that statement given the events and attitudes of the past decade). The common spirit which embodies the American people and their dreams clearly shines through in the movie. Representing this dream is an unlikely combination of men; an ardent businessman who is the eternal optimist, a cast away but spirited trainer who nonetheless has a remarkable way with horses, and a smart alec, ambitious and intense jockey, with all the follies and hopes of youth. All three are facing the cruel ways of the depression. The businessman has lost a child and has been through a divorce, and is struggling to achieve his pre depression eminence and status. He meets a woman, in every way his equal, who will support him through every time. Having risen from rags to riches, he is the perfect example of the American ideal, honest yet ambitious, having great strength of character, yet warm, and most importantly, blissfully optimistic about the future. And that's exactly where the finishing line is for him-at the future. An extremely talented salesman, he is looking forward to have something to live for. Opportunity comes in the form of an aged, quiet, and extremely sincere horse trainer, who has a private and warm relationship with horses. The third character in the drama is a jockey who is struggling to make ends meet. A fierce ambition and Dickens's works keep him alive and well. Together, these three 'can-do' Americans find a horse, a lazy creature who nonetheless captures the attention of all three. They train him, plod him and finally lead him to victory. But that is as far as it can be trivialised.<br /><br />The story of the horse is the story of the American people. This is demonstrated most convincingly in the publicity interviews which the businessman is extremely fond of giving. Slowly but surely, the horse is winning his way to success. He has to compete against the best bred animals in the country. He loses some, he wins some. In speaking to the reporters, who in those days were hungry for any heartening news to take the public's mind off the economic crisis, he constantly extols the virtues of not giving up. 'You lose some, and you win some. Sometimes, you fall down. But then you either pack up and go home, or you stay put and fight', he says. The reporters nod their head vigorously. That is what strikes a chord in the mind of every American in that time. 'Stay put!' That's exactly what Americans did in the 20s and 30s. And that is exactly what enabled that country to become the citadel of democracy during the dark ages that followed. It is all too easy for critics to attribute America's success to resources and money. But if it had not been for the unity and sense of a common way of life that millionsof Americans shared, and the nitty gritty that they put into achieving it, all that would have come to naught. It is a tribute to the can-do spirit of the 'Yankees'. And Seabiscuit was one type of an epitome of that spirit. He did inspire a nation in a subtle but archetypal way, and it worked.<br /><br />As for the performances, I have seldom seen such fine performances in which the actors really walk around in the skin of the characters. It's hard to say who among the three was better: Jeff Bridges as the good businessman with a gleam in his eye, always looking towards the future, Chris Cooper as the laid back looking but resolute horse trainer (his bearing is amazing), or Toby Maguire as the headstrong and single minded young jockey. I would say that each one of them deserved an Oscar nomination. The recreation of the period is charming, and the musical score by Randy Newman is perfect and nostalgic.<br /><br />One of the allegiations I have heard about this movie is that it's predictable. But then so was the story about the prince, princess and the demon which my mother told me as a child. That fact diminished neither the virtue nor the value of the story. And in this case, the story is true. The fact that it's predictable does not mar it's inspirational character one bit. Also, it obviously looks predictable in retrospect! The three central characters hardly knew what their and their horse's fate was going to be. And a disturbed nation hardly knew what tidings the future would bring for her. But the horse and the nation, both persevered, and, at least for the most part, became a model of democracy for the rest of the world in a century that had almost brought it to an end through conflict.icans shared, and the nitty gritty that they put into achieving it, all that would have come to naught.

B00005JKN9|5.0|2 overlong and unecessary love scenes and some cheesy use of cgi here and there cannot keep this film from being an overall filmmaking triumph.  In my mind this is Scorsese's third best film behind Casino and The King Of Comedy simply because it succeeds on more levels than it should.  The cinematography, score, production design and performances of Brendan Gleeson, Henry Thomas and Daniel Day Lewis take this film as far as it can go.  With each viewing of this film it gets better and better for me.  Many people will write this off as a misstep in Scorsese's long and respected career but I think it in many ways is a giant leap forward in terms of scope and control of his distinct visual style.  Yes it went over budget, yes it maybe could have used some more editing in spots and sure it ain't as gritty as Goodfellas or Mean Streets...But I'm telling you ladies and gents this is what cinema is all about.
B00008DDSA|5.0|THE FIRST THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT, I UNDERLINE: NOT - FOR EVERYONE. BUT, THIS IS A MOVIE THAT IS WELL MADE AND COULD, IF WE ALLOW IT TO - TEACH US ABOUT A  WELL-HIDDEN (IN THE CLOSED) GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ENJOY SEXUAL STIMULATION EITHER RECEIVING OR GIVING PAIN OR HUMILIATION. I COULDN'T POSSIBLY CARE LESS ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE OR THEIR SICK BEHAVIOUR, BUT THIS MOVIE SOMEHOW HUMANIZES AND DE-DEMONIZED THIS PERVERSION. WHAT I MEAN IS THAT ALTHOUGHT THE MOVIE DOESN'T MOVE VERY FAST (READ IN: IT IS A LITTLE BORING) I FOUND MYSELF HAPPY FOR THIS COUPLE OF SICKOS GETTING TOGETHER AND LOVING EACH OTHER. AFTER ALL, IT IS NOT EVERYDAY ANYONE CAN FIND THEIR SOULMATE THE WAY THAT THESE TWO PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO DO. <br />THE ACTING BY THE GIRL WAS OUTANDING AND I THINK THAT THIS IS A UNIQUE, NOT FOR EVERYONE, GREAT MOVIE.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Knopfler's a pro. Any complaints about his verbosity say a lot more about the critic than the artist. This collection of tunes, like the prior few, are charming and wear well. The guitar pyro-technics may be gone, but the whole guitar-god image was a bit of a sham anyway. The power chords of MONEY FOR NOTHING and HEAVY FUEL are farther away from Knopfler's real talent than the understated melodic hints that SHANGRI LL offers. As a story teller, Knopfler's in fine form. Telling stories is obviously what interests him. He's good at it too. He's got enough money not to have to please those who want 20 minute guitar solos and/or \\"innovation\\", whatever that is. Thank goodness. His sensibility, as a writer, guitar player and band leader is modest and humane. Hopefully, he'll keep writing and recording his little impressionistic sketches. They're routinely a pleasure.
B00005ATQ9|1.0|I rated this a one star entry hoping to catch someone's eye. This is absolutely Stanley Kubrick's best movie. If you had lived back then (the 1750s), this is what it would have looked like. The battle scenes are great, the music is beyond great, and Ryan O'Neal (the worst actor of his generation) doesn't ruin the film.   <br /> <br />Remember: \\"Money well timed and properly applied can accomplish anything.\\" Thackery/Kubrick <br /> <br />Just ask John Kerry.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is the most honest appraisal extant of the administration's gross mishandling of the Iraqi fiasco. It is propaganda, to be sure, but it is honest and sincere propaganda. I have yet to see a credible and factually accurate rebuttal in the legitimate media. There is no need to defend this film; it stands on its own. Truth has a way of emerging from under the pile of right wing feces hurled at it. Time will demonstrate the validity of the claims made in the movie. <br />Knowing the truth requires more than just listening to the spin of your favorite pundit. I have read over sixty books regarding this administration, both on the left and the right.I vociferously watch all broadcast media, including, but not limited to, Fox, MSNBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, and the major networks. My conclusions regarding this administration are a result of my analysis based on the evidence available to me. <br />What I have seen from the right wing concerning this film is fear. What are conservatives scared of? It appears that with the absence of the Soviet Union as an adversary, our paranoia has made us fabricate a new enemy.There are 18,000 Al Qaeda terrorists WORLDWIDE, operating on an annual budget of 10 million dollars. Because they are so small, they will occasionally succeed against overwhelming opposition. They WILL attack again. This is a given. However, I am not frightened of my own mortality. If a terrorist kills me, so be it. However, I would be willing to wager my life's earnings against this possibility. To say such a scenario is a remote possibility is an understatement.It is perfectly natural to fear that which you are ignorant of, or challenges your belief system. Truth is scary. To recognize it requires reasoning and an ability to accept ideas that may be contrary to your own. You must have the intelligence and flexibility to be able to modify your point of view if the facts change. Being resolute is functionally useless if you make bad judgements and are not willingto modify your outlook as facts change. <br />Michael Moore, and the rest of us \\"left wingnuts\\" were not waiting in the bushes to ambush the president. In fact, we were reluctantly brought into this arena due to the poor judgements, deceptions, and outright lies foisted upon us by an arrogant leader to whom the average American is beneath contempt. Record deficits, a net shrinking of the American workforce, the collapse of our booming economy, and the spread of fear and ignorance; this is George W. Bush's legacy. Tell my daughter as she spends the rest of her life paying off the incredible deficit this charlatan has foisted on our children, and their children. When poor leadership decisions destabilize the world and take away everything you have worked for and believed in, then it becomes your patriotic duty to defend and protect those basic rights that separate Americans from lesser primates. Today, many career professionals have seen their industries crumble through no fault of their own. The administration's answer? Go back to community college. Tell that to people with advanced degrees, whose jobs have migrated overseas. Tell that to any one 50 years old or older. Some of us don't like shopping (or working) at Wal*Mart, or being thrown a bone by our leaders. <br />Respect of the presidency is not a given; like any public servant, the president must earn the respect of his employer, the people of America. If he is doing a poor job, making bad decisions, using poor judgement, and killing Americans in a war based on premises now conclusively proven by the president's own appointee, Charles Duelfer, to be totally false, then he should be fired. He must show respect to the American people, not arrogance. He must perform to a certain standard. Make no mistake, he is not a king; he works for you, he works for me. We pay his salary, and he must be accountable to us, ALL OF US, not just his base.  <br />This is why Michael Moore does what he does, and why \\"liberal\\" America feels as it does. This administration must be torn down if America is to endure; we can do better and we will do better.

B000002UAO|5.0|So, The Beatles were already in the map: they had left the Cavern Club, the haircut was famous (some would say, at the time, infamous), the \\"personalities\\" were already stablished (John, the literary, Paul, the cute one, George, the quiet beatle, Ringo, the sweet one with a inferiority complex), Paul, with Yesterday, had already made the point that The Beatles was not \\"just another rock group to detour our youth from the path of morality\\", Bob Dylan left the acoustic guitar for a while and was singing that \\"johny is in the basement mixing up the medicine\\" under the sound of amplified guitars. This is, in a very poor description, the begining. And then it came Rubber Soul, where The Beatles, as George Martin put it, begun to improve their songwriter's qualities. Here's the second start, that lend to Sgt. Pepper, to culminate in the most well-successed rock group ever. The pieces (or tracks) are like the pieces of J.S. Bach: simple, beautiful, clean, untouchable. The work on the voices in this album is amazing: it's extremely original, creative, amusing (listen to the intro of \\"Paperback Writer\\"; the backing vocals on \\"Michelle\\"; the backing vocals on \\"Nowhere Man\\"; Lennon and McCartney (and then, Harrison) on \\"The Word\\" and \\"Wait\\"). The arrangements are great (that classical piano in \\"In My Life\\", that lasts, in the song, a few seconds, is enough to ilustrate this point), the themes are more personal (\\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"In my Life\\"). There's a very visible progression in their work: in Rubber Soul, The Beatles prepared their way to become what they are, as Paul McCartney said about the conception of Sgt, Pepper's: \\"we no longer were musicians; we were artists\\". <br /> <br />

But that's okay; Miles, as usual, has his own problems. There's his brother Mark's new business venture, which involves some rather unattractive bugs, currently stashed in an old laundry room in Vorkosigan House. There's convincing Ekaterin that the fact that she made a mistake in marrying Tien at twenty doesn't mean that she's forever incapable of making good marital choices. There's convincing Ekaterin that he's not trying to manipulate her, which is tough, because he is. He's Miles, after all; it's easier for him to skip breathing for a few days than to skip manipulating people for a similar period.

There's the rumors going around that Miles murdered Ekaterin's first husband. There's the other countship that's in dispute, with one of the putative heirs trying to blackmail Miles to force the Vorkosigans to support him when the Council of Counts votes on who's the real Count.

B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is in essence, a simple movie, but a movie that touches on so many relateable feelings and deep and deeper emotions, that it crosses the line into greatness.<br /><br />So far, this is my favorite movie of the year and should, most certainly, be a frequently uttered movie on Oscar night.<br /><br />Who are we? What makes us who we are? Would we be where we are in our lives without ALL of the experiences we have enjoyed or despised. If we took away the bad things, would we be the same people?<br /><br />ETERNAL SUNSHINE is brilliantly played by JIM CARREY and KATE WINSLET. Funny. Charming. Emotional. NORMAL. And when I say 'NORMAL', I mean that for the first time in a long time, we finally have a movie that plays and sounds REAL. The dialogue is FANTASTIC!! THIS is the way people talk. THIS is the way real relationships are. When Kate and Jim talk, you believe, and you instantly feel their connection. At different times in their lives, their conversations are more entertwined.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman... OSCAR for Best screenplay!<br /><br />I won't say anything more. Don't want to give anything away and ruin it for people who haven't seen.

B0000844I8|5.0|Frankly, who is going to watch Stargate other than science fiction fans?  That said... can you name ten better science fiction movies?  This movie has an interesting plot, surprisingly good action and writing and was very suspenseful in the theater.  It also has good effects and excellent sound and a top sound track.   <br /> <br />As for the TV series being better...  I really like SG-1 but the movie has a much cooler feel to it.  It's much more mysterious and dark.  Some SG-1 stories are awesome and they have a great cast as well, but it is very straighforward and really lacks the menace that the original movie portrayed.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is one of the Beatles greatest albums, but then again, any one of the Beatles albums is one of their greatest.  The music on this album is the first time their tunes took a psychedelic turn.  The guitars are juiced up with some distortion on some tracks, the harmonies are solid as per usual, Ringo keeps his steady thumping beat, and they again experiment with different instruments, and backward guitars and sound clips as on Tomorrow Never Knows. I'll break each song track for track.  1. Taxman:One of Harrisons best tracks, with a great guitar solo.          2. Eleanor Rigby: Just Paul and a bunch of strings, but it is stellar.          3. I'm Only Sleeping: A dreamy Lennon tune, with some backwards guitar thrown in for good measure.  Trippy and very cool          4. Love You To: Another Harrison tune, this one with sitar, its good but probably my least favorite track on the album          5. Here, There and Everywhere: A beautiful ballad care of McCartney, with some really great chord changes and harmonies.         6. Yellow Submarine: Ringo takes over lead vocals on this far out little ditty. A sing along tune i guess you could say.          7. She Said, She Said: One of the Beatles best rockers, Lennon taking the line \\"I know what its like to be dead\\" from Peter Fonda at some acid party they were having.          8. Good Day Sunshine: A sunny, upbeat tune by McCartney.          9. And Your Bird Can Sing: A great feel good tune, with a great guitar riff from Lennon.          10. For No One: A great ballad by Paul, with a cool French horn solo.          11. Doctor Robert: An ode to the Beatles pill and drug supplier.  \\"Take a drink from his Special Cup....\\"          12. I Want to Tell You:Apparently Harrison invented a chord on his guitar for this one.  A cool little number with some piano          13. Got to Get You into My Life: Pauls song to maryjane, not a girl by the way.  Its about his love of the sweet sweet bud.        14. Tomorrow Never Knows: Oneof the Beatles first psychedelic tunes, pretty erie actually and one of Lennons trippiest songs.  As a whole I give Revolver 5 stars.  Its simply a masterpiece and one of the greatest rock albums ever I think.  Check it out.
B00005N5S2|5.0|The movie \\"MacArthur\\", played by the great Gregory Peck, mainly takes place between the years 1942 through 1952, from MacArthur as a four star general to when he `retires' in the wake of Eisenhower's presidency. The movie takes you through MacArthur's historic events: leaving Corregidor, arriving in Australia saying those never to be forgotten words 'I shall return', island hopping back to the Philippines, on through the Korean War, then ultimately his retirement. <br /> <br />I cannot express in words how wonderful Peck's portrayal of MacArthur was. He WAS Douglas MacArthur in every sense of the man. He played the part of the historic figure perfectly; where he was beloved by people, yet at times could be so agressive, straightforward, and outspoken that he made people clench their teeth in annoyance of that man (how do you think he got the nickname, 'American Caesar'?). A truly gifted actor, Greogry Peck will forever fill my memories of 'THE actor who played one of the greatest men of all time.' <br /> <br />Setting aside Peck's performance, a few other honorable mentions are Marj Dusay as MacArthur's wife and Ed Flanders respectfully as Harry S. Truman. Dusay had few lines but instead, through her quiet courage and determination in standing by her husband's side shows indeed the importance she played as the faithful wife. Ed Flanders deserves much applause for his role as President Truman with a splendid performance as one of the many men who, though he hates MacArthur's guts, can't help admiring his military genius. <br /> <br />In the historical point of view, I felt that \\"MacArthur\\" was fairly accurate, especially the depictions of the Korean \\"Conflict\\" (War). It portrayed just how much of a 'political' war it had begun, especially with the Chinese making it into an international incident.  <br /> <br />As for myself being half American-Japanese living in Japan, it was quite interesting to see how MacArthur began the reformation of Japan after WWII. I was alsoquite impressed with Yuki Shimoda playing the Prime Minister of Japan, and how he gave MacArthur full support in making sure that Japan could not again build a military force. That meeting between the Prime Minister and MacArthur was very touching to me. <br /> <br />After watching the film, I also couldn't help but feel somewhat sad seeing how the world has changed from the circumstances of the past. After the Korean War, where communism was allowed to take hold of North Korea, the situation between North Korean and Japan is now somewhat strained, what with various incidents including kidnapping and illegal transportations. It is sad to see in the movie how this would have been prevented if MacArthur had been given leeway to finish the Korean War with a sound victory instead of the unforgivable option, the \\"armistice.\\" <br /> <br />All in all this is a wonderful movie that shouldn't be missed. There is one warning I would like to add which a few reviewers have also mentioned. The film is somewhat 'choppy' as in the plot moves along pretty swiftly. Unless you are very well informed about the years in which the movie takes place, there is a high possibility you would be lost as to what is going on. My suggestion is either 1) watch the movie with someone who understands the history of that time well, or 2) study the history before watching the movie. I can guarantee though that after watching \\"MacArthur\\", curiosity will overcome you and make you want to read more about those years. <br /> <br />*Rated PG for some war violence. But in any case, best watched by older teens and adults so that they know what is going on. I guess this will lean more towards being a 'guy' movie, though for any girl (like me) who loves good acting and is interested in history will most definitely like this movie*

6305313687|2.0|For however brilliantly this film depicts skinhead culture/rhetoric, and relationships between family members, I feel that the messages too often come out wrong and confused.    Dereky Vinyard's typical right-wing rhetoric will sound very convincing to confused teenagers, which is the point of the film.  We can see exactly how he gets such a loyal following, but his cases for racism are so convincing at times that I feel this movie doesn't do a good enough job to cut them down.  I think the ending is one of the most disgraceful cop-outs in film history.  Instead of using compelling evidence to counterstrike Derek's points, all we get is a simple-minded \\"racism is bad\\" stance.  The case for racism is made much stronger than the case against it.  Also adding to the confusion are scenes that seem to serve no purpose other than to provide racist comedic relief: the scene with the fat skinhead singing in his van (actually, all the fat skinhead scenes...character/actor name escapes me at the moment).  Also, the more horrifying and brutal violence against minorities happens to those in the film you have difficulty sympathizing with.  The infamous \\"curb\\" scene for instance--as ugly as it is, it sits in an almost grey area because the victim is established as a criminal, car thief.  Mean while, an innocent black woman only gets pinned down and has food poured on her.  Anyone know what \\"white wash\\" means?  I think Tony Kaye and all the actors did incendiary jobs of portraying convincing, by Hollywood standard, young white supremecists, but there are just too many mixed signals coming out of this movie for me to really embrace it as an anti-hate film.

0312995423|3.0|In the Digital Fortress by Dan Brown, author of The Davinci Code, presents a semi-counterutopic, as well as science fictional novel that is meant to provide the reader with a perspective on the modern life, within which the reader is supposedly, and without much information, living.  <br /> <br />As an introductory statement, the whole narrative circles around the playing-field of the NSA. It turns out that not guns nor bombs but codes, mathematical equations and digital systems control the world. The novel begins with an interesting remark in that it is said that, “In death, all things become clear.” The material to be used and under discussion are: optical transmission, digital and analog circuits, photonics, photo-detectors, mechatronics, game theory, non-classical logic, matrix, probability theory and its applications, systems engineering, structural analysis, speech recognition, complex calculus, algebraic geometry, electromagnetics (supervenient), signal processing, and number theory with functional security models. The very first narrated actor of the “movie,” (I characterize this book as movie since I totally claim and can reveal that Mr. Brown writes all of his books to be available to the Hollywood industry), is a mathematics geek with a fascinating pictographic mind and a numeric walking-calculator named Susan. She discovers the alleged fact that the life on the Earth turns out to be Photo-detected, digi-monitored, decoded, precognitioned by NSA.  <br /> <br />As an author and a philosophical analyst, I must point out that the sharp contrast between socialism and democracy must be recalled as a must while reading this book. This book also brings an analogy into our minds’ eye to that of George Orwell. Another counterfactual reasoning is that one wonders how Orwell would react to this book only if he had the democratic fortune and longevity to read it! To illustrate, the Internet was invented to opto-monitor the exchange of any strategic information. To make it didactic, our dear agent Susan, the female version of our celebrated beautiful mind John Nash, in the end, finds out that an oceanic level of the funds are channeled into the projects of NSA, and, all things are clear in death. No wonder that mathematics, the mystical explanation of the harmony of the universe, the long-lasting divine love of our two millennia old philosophers, has appeared with a popular branch that is called “Cryptology”! Cryptology is the field of the study of codes and counter-codes. I recall that one reviewer from Spain has argued that five years from the time she read the book ~The Davinci Code’, no one will remember the book. I would like to validate her claim. Nevertheless, her claim could be only true for this novel, not most probably for the Davinci Code. <br />Now, for all of us, who are fond of binaries and codifications, which includes Mr. Brown as well, if you can answer the following question for me I will greatly admire your life-long answer: for sure, we live in a digital world though not true for too many parts of the world. For sure, our modern life is surrounded by digital fortresses and our life is coded and digitalized at sometime at some place and point. <br />Now, yes to all of these, yes to Orwell’s ancient reflection. I truly appreciate if you can tell if LOVE is DECODABLE, and if so, what is it? <br /> <br />
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Just a few days ago, I wasn't even aware of Avenged Sevenfold. I had once listened to their track 'Unholy confessions' but that was quite some time ago but I didn't think they would such a great band after I listened to all of the songs in their album 'Walking the fallen'. It's so good! The more I listen to it, the more I love it! They never get old. <br /> <br />They sound a lot like Killswitch Engage (one of my most fave band) but the vocals are so much better! <br /> <br />With AWESOME guitar riffs, some really great piano, violin parts, and fantastic melodic, rhythmic and energetic new-age metallica type vocals, this abum will OWN you! <br /> <br />Seriously, please don't pay attention to the silly people writing biased reviewes and bashing this band with totally unnecessary criticism. <br /> <br />Avenged Sevenfold rocks! Whether or not you like Metal/Rock, you'll love their music. So buy it today! <br />
B00000K19E|5.0|I bought \\"The Matrix\\" in DVD format yesterday. I bought it because this movie is one of the most recent and truest milestones in the story of cinema. And it's funny, because when the movie was released, back in 1999, it was not an instant success. I remember thinking (at the time): \\"The world-dominated-by-machines plot, and starring Keanu Reeves - I will not waste my money and my time\\". Now I regret not having watched it in the theatre.<br /><br />The plot is not original. It has been used in many science fiction movies, books, comics and so on. The machines have revolted against the humans, and we are nothing but slaves to them. \\"The Terminator\\" series comes to mind. But this time the treatment given to the story is different. \\"The Matrix\\" is an organic, mind blowing science fiction. There are lots of fluids, limbs, lack of hair, the design of the machines is also very organic, and the viewers can relate to that in a positive way. Also, the mistery provided by the first scenes - \\"What is the Matrix?\\" - tingles in our minds.<br /><br />This movie concentrates heavily on its characters. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, Cypher, Switch, Apoc, Tank, Dozer, Mouse and, last but not least, Agent Smith, all of them have their own personalities, singularities, and maneirisms, presented along the duration of the movie - two hours that go by very fast. And each character (except for Neo) is played by a relatively unknown actor, or an actor that were at a low point in their careers at the time. Today, it's impossible to not know who Carrie-Ann Moss, Lawrence Fishburn or Hugo Weaving are.<br /><br />But \\"The Matrix\\" is an excellent movie because of all its elements. Acting is good. Action scenes are fantastic. The soundscore is unforgettable. The soundtrack is quite appropriate (energic, full of fury - there could be no better choice than RATM). The script is ballanced - fast-paced scenes mixed in with slow, explanation dialogues and even one or two love scenes in the middle. And, finally, the direction.<br /><br />I don't know if the \\"freezing time\\" technology was invented by the Wachowski brothers, and I couldn't care less about it. What I do know is that they mastered it in \\"The Matrix\\". The first time I watched this movie I was extremely impressed with those \\"frozen\\" scenes. Action sequences can be now dated as \\"before Matrix\\" and \\"after Matrix\\". And the two directors provide a lesson about how to use slow-motion with good taste.<br /><br />Some people say that \\"The Matrix\\" is a re-telling of the New Testament. So what? \\"The Lord of the rings\\" is another one, too. What I want to say is that, no matter how you see it, \\"The Matrix\\" has a very interesting plot, and scenes that always leave the viewers with their jaws hanging. And it has become one of the greatest references in movie-making.<br /><br />Grade 9.3/10d, finally, the direction. <br /> <br />I don't know if the \\"freezing time\\" technology was invented by the Wachowski brothers, and I couldn't care less about it.

0375432302|1.0|This book is moderately well written, it has no serious continuity gaps but has a lot of fiction and not enough truth to intertwine with to make a decent pseudo-scientific fiction.<br />Dan Brown lacks the power of a good storyteller to make his readers belive his \\"facts\\", and also, his supposed riddles are weak and an insult to try to make us belive that an educated mind would have trouble solving them, much less, survive the ages without anyone being the wiser.<br />A good read for anyone interested in \\"hardy-boys\\" type of books.
0812550706|5.0|Ive read this book three times so far.  Every time I think about reading it again, my imagination craves it.
B000002H4C|4.0|Although the movie hasn't aged as well, this soundtrack is a 1980's essential.  Very solid production and selection of songs and artists.  In general, I found the tracks produced at Cherokee Studios in Miami to capture the mood of the movie well.<BR>The movie versions of Sammy Hagar's 'Heavy Metal' and Black Sabbath's 'Mob Rules' are far superior and grittier than the versions on Standing Hampton and Mob Rules albums, respectively.<BR>Riggs's two songs of 'Radar Rider' and 'Heartbeat' are definite standouts on the soundtrack.  For those who are interested, Riggs released a 10 song album in 1982 with no dogs on it except the one on the cover.  Jerry Riggs went on to join Pat Travers band.  Too bad.<BR>The two tracks by Cheap Trick are career highpoints.  In particular, 'I Must Be Dreaming' had a 'thinking outside the box' introduction and reprise.<BR>Don Felder's two tracks are the epitome of cool.  'Takin' a Ride on Heavy Metal' was a minor hit. Abraham Laboriel's bass line on 'All of You's verses makes the song.<BR>Don Fagan puts a Steely Dan spin to the soundtrack with a slowly-building instrumental intro to a large-harmonied conclusion.<BR>Grand Funk Railroad, Blue Oyster Cult, Nazareth provided solid tracks with 'Queen Bee', 'Veteran of the Psychic War' and 'Crazy'.  Journey also supplied 'Open Arms' before its release on the 'Escape' album/cd.<BR>My least favourite tracks, but still listenable, are Devo's 'Working in a Coal Mine', Trust's 'Prefabricated' and Stevie Nick's 'Blue Lamp'.
B0000042MY|5.0|The soaring strains of this soundtrack have been lodged in my heart since I first listened to it when I viewed 'Last of the Mohicans' on its first run twenty-plus years ago.  I think it's a work of great inspiration; heroic, majestic, lyrical and full of the pathos that is at the essence of the film. Whoever chose this composer knew what he was doing.  The movie is lifted up, magnified and a perfect match for its subject: the great drama of savagery, honor and self-sacrifice  on America's wild 18th century frontier. It is music that is full of beauty and bold purpose, as much great art as any symphony.  I would (and have) watched the film simply to listen to the soundtrack.  I cannot recommend it more highly.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|The competition within the music industry is tough. A slightly unsatisfactory record will slump in sales as other uprising artists emerge to fame. As such, D12's latest effort \\"D12 World\\" was not only unsatisfactory, but rather repulsive. They're no longer in contention for the \\"kings\\" of hardcore hip-hop.  <br /> <br />After \\"Devil's night\\", great expectations were put on their next set of recordings. Exactly what did the fans expect? Crisp, flawless rapping. Funky, dangerous beats. Awesome backing melodies. And of course, excessively featuring Eminem. And in \\"D12 World\\", the listener receives none. (or to very limited degree) <br /> <br />With the exception of the opener(Git up now) and the two singles (My band & How come), the whole album is simply too weak. One would find it very difficult to \\"absorb\\" oneself into the music, and, essential in hardcore hip-hop, having the desire to crank up the subroofer in one's car.  <br /> <br />The lyrical contents are meaningless most of the time, and most frustrating of all, very random. They'll be talking about inspiration to succeed one minute, then go right on talking about doing it away with Mums and african-american, promiscuous females, leaving listeners wondering, \\"wtf?!\\".  <br /> <br />Despite this undone, I anticipate eagerly for the new Em album, \\"Encore\\". However, this disasterous release does leave a permanent black mark on my impression of D12 as the most successful hip-hop band.  <br /> <br />
B00000AF95|3.0|After the momentum Kiss had built up following their decision to take off the makeup and with the release \\"Lick It Up\\", their direction was again beginning to revert backwards. The atmosphere and recording sessions for \\"Animalize\\" was a bit confused and unorganized, first since a virtual revolving door of lead guitarists started here, and also with Gene Simmons being distracted with movie projects and being absent from the studio for much of the time.<br /><br />Guitarist Vinnie Vincent's tenure turned out to be short-lived after tensions arose between him, Gene & Paul; as a result, he was dismissed from the band following the completion of the abbreviated \\"Lick It Up\\" tour. Kiss searched again for another guitarist and found one in Mark St. John, a guitar teacher from California and former member of the obscure metal band, White Tiger.<br /><br />St. John was a \\"technical\\" player with a dazzling fretboard and whammy bar technique, and perfectly fit the mold of the atypical 80's metal guitarist. His lead playing on \\"Animalize\\" is quite good, but by the end of the album, he sounds a bit generic. Gene Simmons would later remark that St. John was fond of showing off his great technique and how \\"flexible\\" his fingers were; St. John himself countered that this wasn't the case, that all he wanted was to be a member of Kiss. That he was, but like Vinnie Vincent, his tenure was also to become short-lived, as this would be the first and last album he would record with Kiss.<br /><br />With Gene Simmons out on location shooting the film \\"Runaway\\" with Tom Selleck, the production duties on \\"Animalize\\" fell to Paul Stanley, who did as good a job under the circumstances as he could. Simmons was given an almost obligatory co-producer credit on the album, in spite of the fact that he was out of the picture much of the time. Former Plasmatics bassist Jean Beauvoir filled in for Simmons on many of the tracks, and also co-wrote several songs with Stanley. Simmons turns up only on the nihilistic \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\", \\"Lonely Is The Hunter\\", which sounds almost like a throwaway, and the better \\"Murder In High Heels\\".<br /><br />Some of the tracks on \\"Animalize\\" are very good, including the lead track \\"I've Had Enough (Into The Fire)\\", the single \\"Heaven's On Fire\\", which received some radio airplay at the time and became a moderate hit, and the breakneck \\"Under The Gun\\"; the track \\"Thrills In The Night\\", though a typical cookie-cutter pop/metal song is also good and seemed to be the most overlooked track on the album.<br /><br />Following the release of \\"Animalize\\", Kiss shot a video for \\"Heaven's On Fire\\" and embarked on another tour; unfortunately, Mark St. John developed a rare arthritic condition in his hands called Reiter's Syndrome, which rendered him unable to play. With a tour of Europe to do first, Kiss had to find a temporary replacement; they found Bruce Kulick to fill in, but unfortunately, St. John did not recover and was let go from the band after only several European dates. Kulick then became a permanent member and remained with Kiss until 1996, when the original band reunited.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Animalize\\" is not a bad effort considering the circumstances that surrounded it, and the trend toward 80's hair metal would continue over the course of the next 3 albums with not so good results.nihilistic \\"Burn Bitch Burn\\", \\"Lonely Is The Hunter\\", which sounds almost like a throwaway, and the better \\"Murder In High Heels\\".<br /><br />Some of the tracks on \\"Animalize\\" are very good, including the lead track \\"I've Had Enough (Into The Fire)\\", the single \\"Heaven's On Fire\\", which received some radio airplay at the time and became a moderate hit, and the breakneck \\"Under The Gun\\"; the track \\"Thrills In The Night\\", though a typical cookie-cutter pop/metal song is also good and seemed to be the most overlooked track on the album.<br /><br />Following the release of \\"Animalize\\", Kiss shot a video for \\"Heaven's On Fire\\" and embarked on another tour; unfortunately, Mark St. John developed a rare arthritic condition in his hands called Reiter's Syndrome, which rendered him unable to play.

068987474X|1.0|Firstly, \\"He's just not that into you\\"...this sounds like a title for a book written by a 7th grader. No, wait...actually, I think I had notes passed to me in 7th grade Algebra that were more mature and creative than the title of this book.     Secondly, WOMEN...don't fall for this garbage! Not all men are this shallow and evasive about relationships.     This book is based on a stupid premise by a writer for 'Sex and the City', and yet, the average woman is supposed to buy into this logic -- that men have a language with which they communicate to women, and women are too dense to interpret it?     Desperate women around the world, take heart! If you're searching for love in all the wrong places, you will be relieved to know that the rejection you've faced is simply because men are just not 'that into' you!!! Come on!     I have been married to the funniest, sweetest and VERY shy man for 10 years...and he WAS \\"into\\" me, although it took him a while to ask me out for fear of rejection. If I had read this book back then, I would have thought he wasn't \\"INTO\\" me, and moved on. But the truth is, he was in love with me...Yes, ladies, men fear rejection! Men get nervous around women. They want love like we do.     The author (recently married, so he is an expert on relationships, I assume), spins his expertise with his 'Sex and the City mindset'. The problem is, most people don't think like this (at least the ones who are out of college and have become somewhat more serious about their lives and futures).     This book is pop-culture drivel and doesn't take into account that men are as different from one another as women are. It makes men almost one-dimensional, devoid of personalities and individuality. It categorizes men as incapable of speaking the truth to women about relationships and instead, opt for 'signals' to hopefully communicate to a woman.     Ahh, yes, women are deep, truthful, soul-searching humans, with a desire for a partner for life. But men aren't. Period. They run and make excuses and don't answer their cell phones and tell you their grandmother died so they can't go out tonight. Ridiculous!     If you prefer to find the love of your life in a bar, drink Cosmopolitans for lunch, and wish to de-code the immature, so-called unspoken language of men, this is the book for you. However, if you believe that men are deeper than this shallow, ridiculous stereotype, pass on it.     I guess I'm just \\"not that into\\" this book...
B00000AF98|2.0|\\"Crazy Nights\\" is a strange album...chocked right in the center of the burgeoning pop/glam metal of the late 80's, it straddles the line between being completely in style, but also being horribly out of place.<br /><br />The first problem with \\"Crazy Nights\\" is the material...it's loaded with weak, unfocused songs which harken back to the first pop phase of Kiss circa 1980; the second problem is the somewhat lackluster performances, particularly from Gene Simmons, whose attention again was drawn away from Kiss to his movie career at the time.<br /><br />Just prior to \\"Crazy Nights\\", Simmons had completed the stupid horror film \\"Trick Or Treat\\", and was filming the equally dumb \\"Never Too Young To Die\\" while the album was being recorded. His presence is diminished, appearing only on \\"No No No\\" and \\"Thief In The Night\\", both of which sound very uninspired and derivative.<br /><br />The third problem is with the production...Stanley (& allegedly Simmons) had produced the last two albums, but this time they opted for an outside producer; they chose veteran producer Ron Nevison after both expressed a mutual desire to work with the other. Nevison had produced albums for Thin Lizzy, UFO, The Who, Ozzy Osbourne, and most successfully, Heart; but choosing him to produce the album had a nearly disastrous effect for Kiss.<br /><br />Nevison's production on \\"Crazy Nights\\" is both slick and smooth, but also flat and dull; the heavy rock edge is melted away again as keyboards and synthesizers make a sudden reappearance and dominate much of the proceedings, especially on the lame tracks \\"My Way\\", \\"Turn On The Night\\", and the Heart ripoff \\"Reason To Live\\", which was released as a single and a video, both of which went nowhere. Once more, Kiss fans were scratching their heads in disbelief.<br /><br />This would mark the second time in the band's career that they began facing a sharp decline in their fan base, as well as record sales and concert attendance; Kiss would again need a miracle, but it would still be some time in coming.racle, but it would still be some time in coming.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this cd because it seemed different than most of the music that Celine has recorded in the past. Well... my hesitation was unfounded, as this cd is really good. Celine's voice is excellent and the production is well done. I enjoy all of the songs.     Some of the songs are repeated from previous Celine cd's (First time ever I saw your face, Brahms lullaby, The prayer), but the cd is still worth buying.     You don't have to have a child to enjoy this cd. If you love the sound of Celine's voice, then you will love this cd.
B000001FQQ|3.0|\\"Hot In The Shade\\" is a decent but uneven effort; there are lots of songs on it, but more doesn't necessarily mean better; at least half constitute as filler. The opening \\"Rise To It\\" is one such example; yes, it's got a catchy, sing-a-long chorus, but it sounds like a holdover from \\"Smashes, Thrashes & Hits\\"...another dumb sexual double-entendre song. From here, the material tends to be up and down, hit and miss.<br /><br />The highlights of the album are the good but derivative \\"Silver Spoon\\", the single \\"Hide Your Heart\\" (again, a decent video), and Eric Carr's swan song \\"Little Caesar\\"; the 2nd single, \\"Forever\\" is another cut right from the mold power ballad that when performed live, never fails to get the lighters out and lit up. Incidentally, \\"Hide Your Heart\\" was also recorded at the same time by Ace Frehley on his \\"Trouble Walkin'\\" album; as much as I love Ace, I have to give the nod to Kiss here, as Ace's version lacks the punch. Sorry, Ace!<br /><br />Gene Simmons once again becomes more involved on \\"Hot In The Shade\\", but his songs more than any of the others are \\"hit & miss\\"...the \\"hits\\" include \\"Betrayed\\" and \\"Cadillac Dreams\\", while the \\"misses\\" are the strange \\"Boomerang\\" and the unoriginal \\"The Street Giveth And The Street Taketh Away\\".<br /><br />Despite the album's flaws, it will always be remembered as the last with Eric Carr, who passed away from cancer in 1991; in late 1990, I was fortunate enough to see Eric perform for the last time in Chicago during the \\"Hot In The Shade\\" tour. If you watched him play, you wouldn't have known that he was ill; even when he was in the video for \\"God Gave Rock & Roll To You II\\" shortly before his death, he gave the project everything he had despite his serious illness. Eric was truly one of a kind and is sorely missed!
B00003CX5P|5.0|My favorite character in this movie was darth Maul!!!!! I couldn't get enough of that evil (...). He is the coolest villain in cinema history. I loved episode 2 but it was missing Darth Maul!!!!Hopefully somehow he can come back in episode Three.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Heres what is changed on the SE DVDs:  Episode IV: A New Hope    01. The Imperial March has been added to Darth Vader's first appearance on Princess Leia's ship.  02.

There's a new scene which has been shot during the filming of Episode III in which the Emperor dissolves the Senate.  05. In the Cantina, the Duros(green aliens guys) have been replaced with Neimoidians and some aliens from the prequels have been added.  06.

More stormtroopers have been added to the Death Star.  17. Temuera Morrison's voice is being recorded for use with all the stormtroopers.  18. The Obi-Wan/Vader duel has been spruced up. It is much more epic and there is much more movement. A modified version of Duel of the Fates is being considered for the scene.  19. The Death Star plans that are taken from R2 have been updated. When the Rebels are reviewing the Death Star plans they look similar to the plans we see in Attack of the Clones.  20. The Death Star battle is much more epic with more Tie Fighters and more Rebels being blown to bits. We get to see old Naboo starfighters being used by the Rebels.  21. There's a new scene(shot during Episode III) where Darth Vader goes to Coruscant and lands his ship in the same building Count Dooku does at the end of Attack of the Clones. Except now the building is all fixed up and it is now Palpatine's palace. He meets with Palpatine to ask for forgiveness for his failure and inform him of a new potential who is strong in the Force.  22. Chewbacca now gets a medal.    Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back    01. The taun-tauns are now CG.  02. The battle of Hoth is much more epic. We see the Imperial ships land on Hoth and release AT-ATs.

A new scene was shot in which the stormtroopers, after they capture Han, Leia and Chewie, bring Vader the box containing C-3PO in pieces. Vader orders the stormtroopers to bring the broken droid to Chewbacca's cell so that he can fix him.  09. The lightsaber effects have been redone in certain parts.  10. Luke's fall from Cloud City has been reshot against bluescreen using a stuntman.    Episode VI: Return of the Jedi    01. Jabba the Hutt is now a combination of the puppet and CG.  02. The Rancor is CG and looks disgusting as ever.  03. Yoda is CG. Yoda disappears leaving his clothes behind like Obi-Wan now.  04. The ewoks are now mostly CG and there are a lot more of them.  05. The plan is to insert the love theme Across the Stars when Luke is talking with Leia about their mother.  06. Temuera Morrison's like before is now the voice for Boba Fett and all the stormtroopers.  07. In the battle of Endor there are thousands of Ewoks and they are more vicious than there midgets-in-suits counterparts. More bite the dust now.  08. White boxes around ships removed.  09. The black blotches around Palpatine's face are gone.  10. Some of the lightsaber effects have been redone. The shadows that the lightsabers made on the floor are gone.  11. During Anakin's death scene it starts with a sad rendition of the Imperial March and slowly evolves into Anakin's Theme.  12. Sebastion Shaw who played Anakin when he was unmasked has been replaced with Hayden Christenson in make-up to make him look older. Anakin has much more dialogue. He apologizes for the destruction he caused, he thanks his son for turning him back to the light, he tells his son to rebuild the Jedi and he says he loves him and his sister. Just before he dies he says, \\"It is finished...\\".  13. We see more planets celebrating at the end of the movie. We see an aged Jar Jar, who is now the leader of the Gungans, on Naboo celebrating with the people of Naboo and the Gungans. We see an old Watto, who is now unable to fly, sitting in a hover chair cheering on Tatooine. During these scenes Across the Stars plays transitioning to the victory celebration music at the Ewok tree village.  14. Anakin's spirit is nowplayed by Hayden Christenson with make-up to make him look his age. He looks on proudly at his son Luke with the spirit of Padme by his side.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I cannot express how much I enjoyed this movie.  It can be enjoyed by simply watching it or by analyzing the subtle background mythology and culture.
B000089RVX|3.0|Having heard all the raves, I had to listen.  The album is somewhat better than average, but really no more than that.  Apparently several tracks have received a lot of radio play and therefore have become stuck in a lot of people's heads: thus, the popularity.  To me, all the upbeat tracks sound the same.  On random play, it would be hard to tell which one was playing. Amy Lee is obviously talented.  She is pitch perfect and manages a pleasing tone on the ballads, but she could stand some voice lessons to get the pinched quality out of her voice on the more intense songs. The lyrics are sometimes interesting, sometimes just dark. Maybe this group's next album will contain more variety.
6305841861|5.0|.....the 'comedy' element is almost nonexistent to a young mind.  With that said, Evil Dead 2 scared the hell out of me.  Seeing it again, however, I can appreciate the humor in the film.  Also, I'd have to say the scene where Bruce Campbell fights himself is probably one of the greatest acting achievements of all time and my man should be given a Oscar for it.  It's something that you can watch over and over.  How about that laughing moose head?  Or Ash bending his knees in synch with the 'evil-possessed lamp'?  Anyone that doesn't outright fall in love with this movie has no business watching movies in the first place.  Am I wrong?
B00007LTIC|5.0|I love this album. Going for the One is Yes at their most rockin'. Even the finicky Robert Cristgau loved the song. (only the boogie woogie jam in America on Keys to Ascension comes close). Parallels is Yes at their most spiritual. Wonderous Stories is Yes at thier sweetest. To quote Jon from the recent Universal show, \\"Love, love, love. That's all there really is.\\" I love this album.
B00000K19E|5.0|There have been many reviewers (even on this page) that like to point out the biblical references in this movie...about how Neo represents Jesus, and so on.  Actually, Chistianity is at the bottom of the list of religious influences.  Most people in this country see similarities between the movie and their own faith and draw conclusions that are mostly untrue.  The Wachowskis, being well versed in religion and philosophy went to great detail in their symbolism imbeded throughout this trilogy. <br /> <br />The movie's primary influences are based in Buddhism and Hinduism.  In Hinduism, the adage, \\"the world is Maya (the world is an illusion)\\" plays an important part in the story.  The idea that the world is our own creation and by simply changing our preception and awareness, we in turn change our surroundings.  In Buddhism, the idea that the universe is merely a perception and through intense meditation, one can 'override' the current perception with his own perception and effectively change the surroundings.  Sounds like the matrix, right?   <br /> <br />If you'd like to read what was most likely the biggest influence on the Wachowskis regarding this film, check out 'The Stellar Man' by John Baines.  Baines, a Hermetic philospher, wrote this book in 1985 and metaphorically identified the 'collective unconscious' as a central computer that locks the minds of the human race into an animalistic state.  The stellar man would be one who has successfully been 'unplugged' from the collective unconscious and attained true freedom from the illusion.  In the film, of course, Neo is the stellar man; a being completely 'awake' and able to alter the reality around him.
B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween gets credited with creating the Slasher film craze of the 80's, but take a good looks at this classic 1978 film...it's bloodless.  Ok, it's not quite Psycho where the knife slashes are never quite seen, but despite it's reputation there is virtually no Gore to this film.<br /><br />The story you know...Michael Myers, who killed his sister as a young boy, escapes the mental hospital where he had been since the murder and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield to get revenge.<br /><br />Depsite its lack of gore, Halloween still packs much more of a scare than any Firday the 13th or Freddy Krueger films.  John Carpenter's greatest acheivement was turning his Haddonfield into \\"ANYTOWN USA\\".<br /><br />This little suburb could have been yours or mind with it's big shade trees and picket fences and clothes hanging on the line.  It's the realism of the setting...of kids walking the streets home from school, trick-or-treating, and watching late night horror movies on TV.  We've all been there which allows this film to really hit home.<br /><br />Jamie Lee Curtis made her name in this movie as Lori, a shy, sheltered teen who finds herself in a life and death battle with Michael Myers.<br /><br />The treat to this 25th Anniversay additon is the full length documentary of the making of the movie including stock footage and current interviews with cast and crew.  See how Carpenter could only afford Donald Pleasance for a few days and had to shoot all his scenes together.<br /><br />Also nice is a short featurette where co-star PJ soles returns to the neighborhood where the film was shot and tries to find the house used for much of the film.<br /><br />Great stuff...great print and a classic horror film
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a very good CD. It has alot of GREAT songs and very good beats. There's one song that's isn't that good, that's \\"Early Morning\\". But if your a Britney fan you'll like it.

0375422307|5.0|Satrapi's 'Persepolis' is an absolutely amazing read and one that was completely surprising and quite unassumingly wonderful. I honestly cannot recommend it enough and can't wait to read 'Persepolis 2.' <br /> <br />It is just such a rare, warm, brutally honest, humourous and heartbreaking work that is completely enlightening. It is a revolutionary use of comic genre, and completely dissimilar to anything I have previously encountered. <br /> <br />There is such tenderness between its pages, yet also such strength. I finished it tearful, partly because the incredible journey was over and partly because I felt grateful to have encountered something so unlike contemporary media.  The illustrations are simple yet humourous and profound, much like the work as a whole. <br /> <br />There is not much else to say, except I wish I could start over again not having read it, and perhaps I shall try. I suggest that you too give this glorious work a chance.
B000267JQK|5.0|I first heard of them at my friends house. He was watching some music videos online, and I just happened to catch the Driven Under video. I was instantly hooked. The very next day I got this cd, and it is one of the greatest things I have ever heard. A must have for any cd collection.
B000002GB9|4.0|I'm not a big Styx (Dennis DeYoung) fan but I do like Grand Illusion. As a matter of fact, this is the only Styx CD in my collection. Although I love the music of \\"Yes\\", The \\"Styx\\" genre of music never really appealed to me. It's a liitle too theatrical sounding to me. We can thank Dennis DeYoung for that. <br />I'm more appreciative of Tommy Shaw's style and sound of music. <br />Never the less this is a very good Styx CD, especially the last four tracks.
068987474X|1.0|I was really disappointed with this book. It is definitely not worth buying in hardcover. I searched for this book, and once I finally found it I was bummed. Girls know everything in this book, but as the book says, they keep questioning themselves. Woman are emotional. Woman get attached. This book isn't going to make me any stronger than I already am when a guy doesn't call me back. Instead of wasting your time reading this book, get out there and meet a guy who'll be just that into you.
068987474X|4.0|This book is super simple reality with a hilarious sugar coating. It is actually a good book.
B00009L1OB|5.0|As the follow-up to the '82 multi-platinum \\"Rio\\", Duran Duran really had to something to live up to, and they did with the album \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\". The sound is totally different from the first two albums, but that's just what makes it shine even more.    So many of the tracks on this album are totally great. \\"The Reflex\\" sounds somewhat different than the #1 smash radio version, but is still totally awesome. Of course, there's the chart hits \\"Union Of The Snake\\" and \\"New Moon On Monday\\", but for me the non-releases were particular gems. \\"Tiger Tiger\\" is an inspired instrumental that sounds almost exotic. \\"I Take The Dice\\" is a particularly great song, and my favorite on the album. And of course, there's \\"The Seventh Stranger\\", a great ballad-toned song and the album's closer. Either way, when you listen to this album you can see why it only helped to propel Duran Duran even further into superstardom. Truly a classic!
B000002HMH|5.0|I just want to say that this album (including Reload), should be given another oportunity, they're both full of sound textures, and achieving that takes a lot of effort and creativity most bands in the metal genre simply don't have, that's why Metallica still stands in the top of the mountain. Stop bitching about this record because is a packed with excelent music, take it as an experiment, but give you people a chance an enjoy it!!!!
B00003CXUM|5.0|This criterion collection of In The Mood For Love is by far the best dvd experience I've ever had.  The cover may be pricey but I'm telling you that it's all worth it, especially if you're a big fan of the film.  What made the dvd experience more exciting for me is the inclusion of deleted scenes, which really did answer all of my questions in the film.  Not to mention, the shock value these deleted scenes deliver.  This dvd definitely stands out.  It does deliver the value for your money.  I do encourage you to get it. <br /> <br />     I just want to respond to a negative comment, which said that there is no plot or that the plot is very shallow, and notice that only the cinematography and the art direction is being given praise.  If you're going to watch a Wong Kar-Wai film, you should know that the movie will not draw you with thick plots or plot-driven scenarios.  Wong Kar-Wai delves more on character development, which is always the base where the plot will eventually follow.  The magic of Wong Kar-Wai films is that it does not spoon-feed you with previously used plots.  His films are more like a jigsaw puzzle where he invites his audience to give his own view or understanding of the film.  The cool ambience and setting is merely an addition to the subtle but relatively wonderful plot each Wong Kar-Wai film has.      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNEU|4.0|I thought this movie reflects in some way, the best and the worst of high school football have to offered. Its a very gritty look of the town, its people and how they played the game of football through their kids. It also a look of how these kids pursued their dreams of glory regardless of the cost. The movie centered around few characters from the team, to its coach, his quarterback, fumble inclined back up running back to a cocky superb running back who was injured.<br /><br />The movie have been watered down quite a bit from the book which must have angered the people of Odessa, Texas to no end when it was first published. I thought the feel was very authentic and it was successful in showing the rest of the world how seriously some people take high school football. (Probably no more then how many people in other parts of the world take soccer so seriously or in Japan where high school baseball take on mythical level.)<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton did an excellent job portarying the head coach, Gary Grimes. In fact, he have been watered down from the book version pretty considerably. Lucus Black playes Boobie Miles very well. Of course, this is not exactly a very likable character in the beginning. Shallow, uneducated braggart who represent all that was wrong with star high school football player who only think football. Many in the audience reacted to his injury on the field with certain satisfaction. But ironically, Miles character developed into something truly worthy after he realized that his playing time was over and it was interesting to see this shallow braggart developed into a whole human being.<br /><br />I initially thought that this was another \\"Hoosier\\" type of movie but I was mistaken. The movie tries to do many things on different levels but overall, it was an indellible movie about kids in sports.
B00030590I|5.0|This is an excellent, poetic movie, a dreamscaped ballet of the struggle to discover honor and the torment of having to make a choice when the scales weighing personal freedom and duty to the state seem evenly balanced. <br /> <br />Floating in the air and stepping across the surface of the water is much more real than some reviewers understand.  <br /> <br />BUT---at this time, Amazon is not giving the aspect ratio of this DVD, and if you don't see it in widescreen, then you are not seeing the movie at all. Maybe, this was an oversight on Amazon's part, but I will not purchase it until I know whether it is widescreen. I do own the Chinese DVD and it is widescreen 16:9. The Chinese DVD is not difficult to use--it has English subtitles
B000002OOY|5.0|John Williams has out done himself. This soundtrack has one of the greatest themes of all time. 'Welcome to Jurassic Park', one of the greatest songs ever! Execllent suspense music, it gets the blood pumping. Up there with Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jaws. Buy this CD, why do you think I gave it 5 stars!?!
B00005JNEI|5.0|First of all, why does Amazon include \\"reviews\\" from people who haven't seen this film?   The \\"reviewer\\" whose review title is \\"Anti-American Commie Movie\\" ADMITS that he/she has NEVER seen this film so why in the world would Amazon allow his/her review - I mean, after all, shouldn't one actually see the movie they are giving comment on?  <br /> <br />Secondly, this is a very thought provoking piece that dares to tell the truth about what has happened to the American landscape, our democaracy and civil rights (or lack therof)during the current administration's regime.  We, as a nation, have been lied to repeatedly and it's time we looked at the truth of what has happened to us and our country rather than the \\"spin cycle\\" we've been in during the last 4 years.  See this movie, regardless of where you stand politically, BUT see it with an open mind and listen to the truth that it courageously imparts.
B00000IQMT|4.0|I am an avid Star Wars fan and have been so all my life. The music on this soundtrack is great(all of John William's is). The reason that I gave this soundtrack 4 stars is because the movie itself wasn't very good. The music reflects the movie and in this situation the music far outshines the movie. Tracks that I thought were very well done are 2, 7, 14, 15. Thats it. Those scenes in the movie are the only scenes worth watching. All in All, for Star Wars and Music fans buy it, but don't expect a whole lot.
B000000OSE|4.0|Use Your Illusion I and II are two of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time. Use Your Illusion II being the better of the two albums but this one is still really good. The Illusion albums show Guns N; Roses at the creative peak of their carear. Axl wrote his best lyrics and amazing compositions, Slash played his best solos, and Izzy realized he was a killer songwriter.<br /><br />The album starts off with the hard hitting 'Right Next Door To Hell' which is a fast pased rocker and isnt half bad but it isnt really great either. 'Dust N' Bones' is a Izzy song and its one of the three best songs on the album. the cover of Paul McCartneys 'Live And Let Die' is a thousand times better then the original thanks to Slash. The beautiful 'Dont Cry' is one this one. Its the original version, the one you know and have heard everyone talk about. Its one of the best songs ever written! 'Perfect Crime' is a great fast pased hard rocker witha great riff. 'You Aint The First' is another great Izzy song. 'Bad Obsession' is one of the better songs on the album and its also another Izzy song, it has a killer slide riff and solo by Slash and its really bluesy and its just a killer song! Once I gave it a chance 'Back Off Bitch' is one of the best songs on the album its got all the same ingrediant as Bad Obsession but without the slide. 'Double Talkin' Jive' is another great Izzy song but he doesnt sing it Axl does, and it has a really cool classical guitar solo at the end that played by of course Slash.<br /><br />'November Rain'.... well what can you say that hasnt been said? Its this generations Stairway To Heaven. The three guitar solos are three of Slashs best of his whole carear. The lyrics are just mind blowingly beautiful lyrics. Its the second best Guns N' Roses song just behind Estranged off Use Your Illusion II.<br /><br />'The Garden' is alright but kinda contrived and it has Alice Cooper on vocals during the chorus and its not too good. 'Garden Of Eden' is so contrived its not even funny. It has great lyrics but you cant understand him because you cant hear as fast as Axl sings, not the best song in the world. I didnt like 'Dont Damn Me' ecause this song like the prevous two is contrived to the max! 'Bad Apples' is concedered by many critics to be the best song on the Illusion albums but I dont like it. Its about how being a rock star is so hard. 'Dead Horse' is one of the better songs on the two albums with a great intro and awsome chorus. 'Coma' is alright bu it is really really long. Longer then November Rain and Estranged. This song is like 11 minutes long and while it has great music and lyrics and cool sounds it does get boring.<br /><br />So as you see this is one of the best albums of all time but you cant get one and not the other you must gte I and II. And dont get the mixed version cause it sucks!ntrived its not even funny. It has great lyrics but you cant understand him because you cant hear as fast as Axl sings, not the best song in the world.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|before i purchased \\"Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses\\" on my recent 14th birthday, i was kind of unsure on whether slipknot had any talent at all. i had heard the songs \\"Spit it Out\\" and \\"Wait and Bleed\\", which were both good, but i could sense the simplicity of them. however, when i bought \\"Vol. 3...\\", i was amazed at the quality of the album. <br /> <br />here's the tracklistings and ratings: <br /> <br />1. PRELUDE 3.0 (8/10) kind of an intro the album. it gets 8/10 for an intro, if it was track 7 for instance, it would get probably a 6/10. <br />2. THE BLISTER EXISTS (9/10) excellent start to the album. 2 minutes into the song, there is an awesome drum line repeated for about 30 seconds... nice! plus the verses are kick-ass. the only thing keeping this track from 10/10 is the length, it's a bit long. <br />3. THREE NIL (7/10) i guess i never got into this song, as it sounds a lot like regular slipknot material. the chorus is a little catchy tho. <br />4. DUALITY (10/10) the first single off the album, and probably the best track on the cd. the thing is, the verses (which are rap) aren't very good even tho they grow on you a bit. so that means the chorus is so catchy and excellent it's almost annoying! unbelievable greatness. <br />5. OPIUM OF THE PEOPLE (8/10) i like the verses in this song a lot. however, the chorus degrades the track because of the slower tempo than the verses. good song overall. <br />6. CIRCLE (8/10) the first acoustic track on the album. i think how slipknot are trying out acoustic songs is awesome. i've been a massive fan of acoustic songs since \\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\\" by Green Day. corey shows that he can sing as well as scream on this track. <br />7. WELCOME (8/10) another song with excellent verses, and a chorus that is so-so. however, the driving guitars in the verses take this track to the next level. (whatever that means, it just sounded good). <br />8. VERMILION (6/10) i've heard that this is the second and latest single offVol. 3, but i'm not sure. the verses are cool, but the chorus is kind of... barely existant. i think this track was put here just to be a part one for \\"Vermilion pt. 2\\" <br />9. PULSE OF THE MAGGOTS (9/10) this is one of those slipknot songs that just sounds awesome on a really loud stereo or headphones. everything just fits in perfectly. i still find the whole \\"maggot\\" thing weird, but if it helps slipknot put out good music, i'm ok with it. <br />10. BEFORE I FORGET (7/10) haven't really listened to this song that much, but it is good. it sounds a bit like filler, but a good way to just add to the intensity of the album. <br />11. VERMILION PT. 2 (10/10) wow. the second acoustic track on the album. this is more my-cup-of-tea than Circle. i love these type of songs. i guess you could call it a love song. well yeah, you could call it a love song, considering the lyrics are about how this girl is \\"everything to me, the unaquited dream, the song that no one sings\\". probably tied with Duality for the best on the album. corey's vocals are beyond impressive here. SHOULD BE A SINGLE! it would take a few people by surprise. <br />12. THE NAMELESS (6/10) i dont understand the rhythm in the verses, but the chorus is pretty cool. then it slows down a LOT and goes into a melodic singing session, but not for long... back to normal. a weak track. <br />13. THE VIRUS OF LIFE (5/10) if this isn't filler, what is? it takes a while to start up fully too. it's almost like a virus to listen to it. slipknot should've just released the album about a month later so they'd have time to put another song like Duality in its place. <br />14. DANGER - KEEP AWAY (8/10) kind of an outro. it has some screaming at the start in the background... not sure if it's melodic singing or someone screaming in abosolute pain and horror. a little disturbing. but when the vocals come in, it's an excellent end to the album. same as Prelude 3.0, if it was track 7, it'd get 6/10. <br /> <br /> <br />if there'sone thing i can say about this album, it's that instead of the album as a whole being great, it's the stand-out tracks (The Blister Exists, Duality, Vermilion Pt. 2) that make this exceptionally good. it motivates me to get their s/t and Iowa. looking forward to hearing new stuff from them. <br /> <br />hope this was helpful!
0061015725|4.0|This is the first Crichton book I've read, though I've seen Jurassic Park.  I found it very entertaining and a quick read.  (Well, OK, I simply couldn't put it down.) <br /> <br />The main character's wife works at a company that is developing nanoparticles -- tiny robots that have very little intelligence programmed in them individually, but that can display the advanced sort of group intelligence that flocks or swarms of animals do, such as ant colonies or bee swarms.  It turns out that this company has used some artificial life programming developed at the former company of the now-unemployed main character (Jack). <br /> <br />As with those who work on many new technologies, those who work on this project let their passion for science get ahead of their common sense.  Soon nanobots are running amok in the Nevada desert, reproducing, evolving, and getting collectively smarter and nastier, and it's up to Jack to figure out how to make everything right again.  Much intrigue, explaining of science, and thrilling action ensue. <br /> <br />I was riveted by this book, but I have two minor complaints.  While Crichton did an admirable job explaining what's known about nanotechnology, artificial life programming, population biology, and microbiology, he does play fast and loose with the science when it suits his needs.  Second, many of the mysteries to be solved later in the book were hinted at pretty obviously early on.  On the other hand, it does make one feel pretty smart to figure out what's going on before the characters do. <br /> <br />I recommend this for a light, quick read that will educate (a little) while it entertains.  It also serves as a cautionary tale to consider the unintended consequences of our rapidly evolving technologies.   <br /> <br />Other reviewers have cited Crichton books they liked better than this one; I'll look forward to reading those as well.
B00008G9JN|5.0|During the mid-seventies, rock-and-roll \\"dabbled\\" with Brithonic folklore, ancient Pagan traditions, and the like.  Jethro Tull would not be outdone.  With Fleetwood Mac cranking out English folks songs based on Welsh witchcraft (e.g., \\"Rhiannon\\"), Traffic doing old folk dirges (e.g., \\"John Barleycorn\\"), Jethro Tull responded in kind with an entire album covering various themes such as the May Day festival of Beltane (i.e., \\"Cup of Wonder\\"), the celebration of the winter solstice (i.e., \\"Solstice Bells\\"), the interplay between the pagan sexual revelries and the wilderness, (i.e., \\"Velvet Green\\" and \\"Hunting Girl\\"), as well songs about mythical folk figures, such as Britian's answer to Pan, Jack-in-the-Green.  The album delineates a period of musical growth for Anderson et co., moving away from the \\"greaser\\" sound to focus on a more earthy folk sound previously explored in classics like \\"Mother Goose.\\"  To some degree, the folklore tilt of this album was reflected in subsequent albums such as \\"Heavy Horses\\" and \\"Stormwatch\\" with emphasis on songs like \\"Weathercock\\" and \\"Dun Ringell,\\" either of which would have felt very much at home on \\"Songs From the Wood.\\"  In my opinion, this is one of their more musically rich offerings, and a must-have for any serious Tull collection.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|The (hoprefully) last entry of the 'Matrix' trilogy should be remembered by a single fact -- that is, it was released on the same day worldwide on November 5th, 2003 -- in USA, Russia, India, Japan, Iceland, etc.  Think about the reason behind that; think about the internet, which would spread the viewers' comments about the film all over the world.  One thing Joel Silver did right is the decision about the release date, for without that, people would be informed how awful this 'Revolutions' was. <br /> <br />The story starts again where the 'Reloaded' ended.  And what comes then after that first sequel, which suggested many mysteries and plots going on?  Nothing memorable.  Keanu's Neo is trapped somewhere, a certain place like a subway station, where 'The Trainman' appears.  What does HE do?  Nothing.  What does Neo do to escape from there?  Nothing.  What does Monica Bellucci do in this new sequel?  Nothing (except for saying a line or two, I guess). The fate of Trinity and Neo?  Well, both look as if they lost interest in the film itself.  And someone please tell me, who was that guy with French accent? <br /> <br />Well, I am not exaggerating, and the things go on and on in this way.  Yes, the city of Zion, the key element which should be one of the culminating points of the film, is in danger, threatened by the armies of lethal machines.  OK, but most of the main characters are removed from the scene, so we experience less emotions about the fatal battle, which should be more 'life-or-death' matter to the characters. <br /> <br />The battle between Neo and Agent Smith is tedious, not because of the CGIs, but exactly because those CGIs.  In the original, we are impressed with the fact that Keanu Reeves could do the kung-hu fighting; here, we are supposed to be impressed with Neo flying in the air, or lots (yes, lots) of sneering Agent Smiths.  The ho-hum effects end up with the repetitious fights that seems to refuse to end. <br /> <br />Not everything is bad,I admit.  The battle of the City of Zion is certainly gripping (though too long).  Jada Pinkett Smith gives terrific acting.  But what I could remember is only this -- the tame, cop-out ending, which suggests more sequels to come.   <br /> <br />'The Matrix Revolutions' is a good proof that there are limits for creative energy for any humans, even if you spent as much money as possible.  Sorry if I sound cruel, but that's the truth.

B000058983|4.0|'Forever Changes' is one of the finest examples of albums produced in the psychadelic rock genre circa 1967-8. It's right up there on a creative level with what the best bands of the psychadelic rock genre (i.e. Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, etc.) were doing at that time. So, if you are interested the psychadelic sound or in the feel of that era, I would highly recommend checking this album out. <br /> <br />Having said that, I would also say that you should not purchase this album expecting to hear one of the greatest albums ever made. This album, as experimental as it surely was at the time of its creation, fails to transcend the psychadelic rock genre out of which it was produced. In other words, it sounds dated in a way that the best works of rock in general during that same period (i.e. Sgt. Pepper's, Beggar's Banquet, Velvet Underground & Nico) do not.  <br /> <br />'Forever Changes' has managed to be placed in the very unusual position of being overrated for being underrated. This album has so long been the critic's list of supposedly underappreciated great albums, that it has become not only something of a critical requirement to list this album among one's top all time choices, but it has also become something of a competion among rock critics to prove who is the most astute by prooving who can generate the most lavish praise about 'Forever Changes'. While this is good in the sense that a cool album has reached an audience it never would have otherwise, it also does a diservice to better albums given less praise by critics simply because they had a better popular reception at the time of their release. <br /> <br />It is certainly interesting to consider what Love (the version of the band that produced \\"Forever Changes\\" anyway) might have accomplised had they stayed together. Perhaps they could have scaled heights that contemporaries like the Dead and Pink Floyd reached by the early 70s. But while such supposition is worth consideration, it does not entail placing the early promising work of a talented band with a great deal of untapped potential (i.e. Moby Grape) above those works of bands with simliar talent who realized their potential.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is that \\"Forever Changes\\" merits four out of five stars as it is an excellent example of the genre and period out of which it was produced but fails to achieve anything further than that. So if your looking for psychadelic rock in particular, grab \\"Forever Changes\\". If you looking for something more, look somwhere else.
B000683VI4|5.0|Now I'm a sci-fi and action movie guy (my favorite movies are the Alien series) and I'll be honest I went to see this movie with my girlfriend because it was her turn to pick a movie to watch in theater.  I tell you what, I've wept tears at very few movies (like one) but this movie is so touching and life-like that I don't care who you are, you will respect it if not love it.  From young teenagers to college folks to middle-aged people all the way to senior citizens, everybody will find a niche with this movie.  Best love movie of the year is not saying enough, it is quite possibly the best MOVIE of the year period, five stars without a doubt.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Look, I don't give a s**t if you think shes a poser or not. If you really spend your time sitting around analizing who's \\"real\\" punk and who's \\"Fake\\" punk, then its time to find a life. As far as the music goes, i think its a huge improvement from her last album (which, I'll admit, I didn't like. too boring IMO). It's alot catchier and has more of the pop-punk vibe. Is pretty much every song \\"radio friendly\\"? Yes. Does that make it a bad Album? No. So if your a fan of bands/artists like Simple Plan, Skye Sweetnam or Wakefield, you'll love Avril and this new album...
0780626966|5.0|Better than Halloween and the Friday the 13th series, there has always been something about the Nightmare on Elm Street Collection that has made it so much better than the aforementioned slasher flicks.  Maybe it's because that the first film came from the ingeniously macabre mind of Wes Craven and he crafted a cinematic villain that was truly scary instead of just someone walking around with a big knife and a mask.  Or maybe it's because that same villain had more menacing personality and voice than your Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers or Leatherface.  In any case, even though it had it's ups and downs, this really is an essential collection for horror fans.  We all know the first film is an absolute classic, written and directed by Wes Craven and featuring the debut of a young Johnny Depp, and it introduced us to razor clawed dream killer Freddy Kruger (Robert Englund) and his reign of terror upon the children of Elm Street.  The second film, Freddy's Revenge, was a major step down but featured some great gore effects.  The third film, Dream Warriors, which was directed by Chuck Russell and scripted by Craven and Frank Darabont, featured a young Patricia Arquette as well as Laurence Fishburne, while the fourth film, the Dream Master (directed by Die Hard 2 and Exorcist: The Beginning director Renny Harlin) lets down on the story but the sets and effects enough are worth the price of admission alone.  The Dream Child, directed by Stephen Hopkins (Predator 2, Lost in Space) is stylish but shallow, while the following film Freddy's Dead is beyond bad.  The last film, New Nightmare, which featured the return of creator Wes Craven, is ingeniously creative and ends the series with the bang it deserves.  It's true that the Nightmare on Elm Street series has had a sordid history, but as I said before, it is an absolute must have for any and every horror fan.
B00005JMX6|2.0|After I read the reviews on amazon, I decided this movie would be a good film to buy.  Mistake!  I honestly would rank this a B class film because of the bad acting, dialog, and editing.  There is some good songs in the film but that is about it.  Overall, a big disappointment save your money.  It is hardly even worth watching.
B0002858YS|5.0|Is it just me or is this 80s revival that's going on right now the best thing that has happened in pop culture in a LONG time? I'm telling you, from the music to the fashion, who would have thought that the decade that once shamed us is now a breath of fresh air? Not me, that's for sure! But with bands like The Killers emerging with that 80s flavor, who can resist?<br /><br />I bought 'Hot Fuss' after hearing \\"Somebody Told Me\\" just one time because, believe me, I was hooked on that little ditty. With it's catchy lyrics and powerful sound, I felt like I had struck gold. But after listening to that one song just about a gazillion times, I got a bit curious as to what the rest of the \\"fuss\\" was all about (hehehe...I'm lame). Little did I know that the entire album would blow away the first single.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Brightside\\" was the second track to grab my attention because again, the song was catchy, yet it had a little more meaning and feeling behind it. \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" was a song that just snuck up on me and had me hooked instantly as one of the coolest sounding songs on the whole record. \\"On Top\\" and \\"Midnight Show\\" are two other favorites, as well as the slow and beautiful album closer.<br /><br />Brandon Flowers' voice is what drives the entire album and makes each track unique but somehow similar to the one before it. His delivery is crazed in some moments, hypnotic in others, sometimes even sweet, but nevertheless commanding. I am definitely looking forward to anything The Killers do in the future because if it's half as good as this record, it will be better than most more mainstream music.
B00003CXUM|5.0|If you like Maggie Cheung in Center Stage, you'll in the mood for her again in this visually stunniing and emotionally impacting period romantic film from WKW. It was perfect to cast her alongside with Tony Leung, because they had a great deal of chemistry and were vulnerable under the direction of WKW.<br /><br />It's a beautiful film about adultery and meeting a stranger next door and falling in love again without an outcome. The scene when Tony Leung was pretending to be Maggie's husband and she had to act as though she had just found out about his secret affair. It goes something like:\\" Are you sleeping with another woman?\\" And Leung would respond:\\" Are you crazy?! Who told you that?...\\" was so funny and touching to watch. The two would eventually fall in love. I still can't forget when Leung called Maggie and said,\\" If I have an extra ticket, would you come with me?\\" Unfortunately, she didn't and they didn't divorce their cheating spouses. I wonder if the kid who appeared with Maggie in the old apartment building years later was the offspring of Leung and her. It's trully amazing to see two of HK's finest actors turning in a multi-layered performance without a script and the film was made on-and-off for 15 months which had driven Maggie to near insanity. Maybe that was how she gave such an intense performance. And you like fashion, Maggie worn at least 20 dresses in this movie. The soundtrack and cinematography are also impeccable!
0805076476|4.0|This is visceral fare, indeed.  FIGHT CLUB is searing satire, with smirks instead of guffaws.  Tyler Durden taps the anger and frustration of those who join Fight Club to cleanse themselves of the meangingless of life, and then he forms another project that unleashes organized terror on the city and its organizations.    All of this is told by a nameless narrator who also finds release in fight club, who increasingly behaves like Tyler Durden, and ultimately rebels against the senselessness of attack against the senselessness of life.  He learns that the response is a deadly as the deadening routines of work and life. By the end of the book, we wonder who is who: who is the narrator, who is Tyler Durden, and who are all of the soap-producing zombies who advance Project Mayhem.    This a book that will deliver a hard blow to the stomach, the groin, and the head ... a book that will haunt your thinking ... and a book delivered in razor-sharp prose, intended to draw blood.    Read it at your peril ... your peril of seeing life differently, and of questioning many of the heartless tasks you're expected to perform where you work, all to advance the organization's objectives and safeguard the \\"bottom-line.\\"  Much of what we do day-to-day is as pointless and meanspirited as Fight Club and Project Mayhem.

B000099T2L|2.0|I bought this album thinking it would be tight: \\"it's Beyonce so they're gonna give her nothin but hits for her album...\\" how wrong I was. Crazy in love was hot, Baby Boy was hot, Hip hop star was a hot mess, Be With You was hot, The Closer I Get to You was a dissapointment, Yes, Me Myself and I, and just about every other song on the album I didn't mention (espescially The Closer I get to You) were flat out boring and that daddy song just made me uncomfortable, why was that on there???   I loved Dangerously in Love on Survivor and was excited to see what she would do differently with it on this album... the b*tch didn't even resing the vocals!!! She just put different production behind it and called it a day, but whatever. Anyways I'm kinda sorry I spent my 8 dollars on that album instead of just downloading the few songs I liked on it.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Wow, after watching this movie, I was suprised that the name Jerry Bruckheimer wasn't listed after director in the credits.  In truth, this movie is actually worse than the usual disaster movie.  Bland and predictable dialogue combined with a wildly uncredible storyline make this movie hard to watch til the end.  The lack of a storyline wouldn't be such a negative for this disaster movie if the action didn't become stale and predictable halfway through.  About mid way through, this movie becomes more of a comedy in that you will start to laugh about how bad it is (ie.  \\"I'm coming for you, regardless of the instant freezing and hundred mile walk in blizzard conditions\\"...lol).  Essentially what this movie lacked was a climatic environmental challenge.  You never really get the sense that the characters are being effected by their surroundings (nor do you care when some of them are).  The director should have realized when he was filming this that if you need to add something like killer wolves escaped from the zoo to add on to your elemental disaster, you're elemental disaster isn't thrilling enough.  What really hit me as comical is the way the director actually tries to make some kind of comment about taking care of the environment at the very end (through the one character he's built as the \\"bad guy\\" nonetheless).  In the end, this movie is nothing more than a hollow tribute to how much money movie executives can throw at a poorly written disaster film.

630521610X|4.0|I gotta say, first and foremost, this is pretty much just another slasher movie.  Sure,  there are 2 fairly brief scenes in which the characters discuss the supposed conventions of slasher films, and fairly frequent references to them at other points, but this hardly qualifies it as a parody or a sorta post-modern dissection of the genre.  Furthermore, these verbal references don't really seem to affect the action of the film to any substantial degree: Cut them out and leave everything else the same and all the critics would've completely ignored this film, and accussed it of just being a retread of all the old 80's slasher films.  And they would've been right.  What we have here is simply a slight twist on the old genre, not a re-invention.<br /><br />Fortunately, being a slasher film is nothing to be ashamed of, and this is a good one.  Most notably, the opening scene is simply brilliant.  The phone conversation part of it is actually very well written, and performed surprisingly convincingly.  Even the whole quiz aspect of it works pretty well.  And the murders themselves are extremely intense and brutal, if not actually that gory, and it ends on a truly unnerving image.(though I've always been particularly disturbed by hanging corpses, so maybe that's just me)  Personally, I think this to be an almost perfect horror set-piece, and they couldn't possibly have hoped to top it. Sadly, they don't come at all close, but the rest of the movie is pretty good.<br /><br />I won't bother going into the plot, other than to say that the killer's identity is a mystery, and the final revelation is actually pretty satisfying.  A bit far-fetched, and the viewer couldn't reasonably be expected to be all the pieces together based on the evidence we're given, but it's still pretty cool.<br /><br />The characters and acting are usually alright.  Neve Campbell is pretty bland as the protagonist.  I don't empathize with her much, but I don't hate her either.  In fact, this is true of pretty much all the characters, though there are a few exceptions.  Most notably,  Matthew Lillard has got to be the most annoying actor on the face of the earth, and I cringed every time he came on camera.  Fortunately he doesn't get all that much  screentime.  Rose McGowan falls into the hot but very obnoxious category, but she doesn't actually play that huge of a role either, so she ain't too big of a problem.  David Arquette annoyed me quite a bit the first time I saw this movie, but viewing it again he's alright.  Characters who we're supposed to like because of how incredibly dorky they are usually don't work for me, but he's actually kinda likable.  (Perhaps I've come to terms with my own dorkiness)  Also, the Fonze does a nice job in his small role as the principal, particularly in the scene where he's attacked.(which is  his only major scene)  Very, very reminiscent of how I remember acting when I've become senselessly scared of nothing.(Course, turns out he had reason to be afraid... )  Other that that, nobody's worthy of much mention, which is fine cause slasher movie aren't about acting.<br /><br />The film could stand to have been cut a bit.  There are some effective scenes throughout the middle portion of the movie, but there's a bit to much nothing as well.  These 'nothing' scenes aren't necessarily too boring individually, but as a whole they just drag the pace a bit too much.  Still, this movie manages to generate a fairly oppressive atmosphere when it's actually tries to,(particularly the music) so it's a bit more versatile than lots of slashers.  Sadly, it still has a few too many senseless jump scenes, but that just comes with the territory.<br /><br />The later horror scenes generally work pretty well, even if they aren't in the same league as the first.  Craven actually holds back on some of the standard stalking-scene techniques, most notably the perspective-cam, which is nice because it makes these techniques more effective when they actually are used.  Sadly, the second best horror scene comes only shortly after the first, where Neve is called by the killer.(I'm having an impossible time remebering the characters names. Sorry)  Lots of people dislike the climax, but I think it's pretty good, largely because I think the final revelation satisfying enough to carry the scene.  Scream hasn't got a whole lot going on in the creative death front, generally being satisfied with knifings and a few actual shootings.  There's one odd death, which I won't give away, which is kinda cool.  Not that great, but still pretty decent.  It isn't terribly gory either.  There's a wee bit of guts, but other than that it's pretty much just characters being covered with blood.(It's really hard to believe that this was only 20 seconds away from an NC-17.  Well, alright, I've not actually seen what they've cut, but I've read descriptions, and even that stuff doesn't seem like it could be extreme at all, saving one shot)  Still, the deaths are pretty intense, and occasionally cringe-inducing, so they work well enough.<br /><br />Well that's it.  5 stars for the opening scene, maybe 3.5 for the rest.  4 stars overall.horror scene comes only shortly after the first, where Neve is called by the killer.(I'm having an impossible time remebering the characters names.

B0002CX4RM|3.0|The costumes and sets are not different enough from traditional to justify their odd effects. It all just seems silly. There is no inspiration here, just red paint and kindergarten fingerprinted hand prints as \\"design\\".   <br />But, I don't buy opera for the great visuals in the main.  I'm grateful when they are there, but I can deal with most anything in that department. <br />However, even in the aural department, this just didn't ignite for me.  Lieferkus (whom I very much like) is the wrong voice for French opera.  Olga Borodina (whom I really really like) was fine, but too phlegmatic in personality for me as Dalila (better when I just listened).  Domingo (Old Reliable)was in vintage Domingo form, and in Samson's great aria he was wonderful.  But, all in all, this didn't light my fire.  I'll go back to the San Francisco version and see how Shirley Verrett and a younger Domingo compare.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|the funniest movie this year.  if you dont like it you are a political nut from either side.  I have heard complaints that this movie doesnt go after bush or the white house and nails the actors.  there are already 100000000 movies bashing bush and no one says anything about these retarded actors.  I happen to be liberal and I think this movie is hilarious.  this movie is better then citizen kane and has a more poinent message then schindler's list.
0767803434|4.0|Air Force One is probably one of the best and realistic movies ever made. In the world after 9-11, you would wonder if this can happen to the real Air Force One... The world's most safest aircraft with the president of the United States, touted as the most powerful man in the world on board, being hijacked is just a nightmare...<br /><br />This movie has what you would expect from a typical action packed movie that involves hijackers on a plane. What I love abt this movie is the details put together to make the Air Force One set look just like its counterpart in the real world.. Great effort!<br /><br />Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman is just brilliant in this movie! They are the stars!<br /><br />A pity though that this DVD is lacking great extras such as a behind the scenes look or interviews with the cast. I would love to know how they built the set for Air Force One.<br /><br />The only extras in this DVD is the commentary from director Wolfgang Petersen and trailers for the featurette..<br /><br />However, if u like a good action packed movie and have always wanted to see the presidential plane in action, get this DVD..

B000003JBM|5.0|Well lemme say this, First of all this is a classic to me, Even though I love hip-hop all around me, It change me. Like I said Hip-Hop's my spirit. Anyway, my most favorite picks of the album are Loungin, No Time to Play, Down the Backstreets, Trust Me, Slicker than Most, Le Bien, Le Mal, and Sights in the City. <br />For those of you don't like hip-hop or don't like the sound of jazz that's play on here, I urge you to go cop it. 'Cause it's my favorite CD to date. <br /> <br />I've been a fan to Guru since he work w/ the group Gang Starr ( on which he formed in '88 with his partner DJ Premier) had just put out classic albums that change the game of hip-hop (Y'know like classics like STEP IN THE ARENA and DAILY OPERATION) And 'mos definitely I've seen him on BET on Jazz one time when he shot a video for the song \\"Loungin\\" on which he did with Donald Byrd and VH1 Soul he was on the \\"Trust Me\\" video w/ N'Dea Davenport of the Brand New Heavies. <br /> <br />Anyway, a long period short, Like I said I urge ya'll 2 go pick this up 'cause it takes u back from the early days of jazz and hip-hop or jazz rap whateva I have to call it. ('member the days when A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Digable Planets, The Jungle Brothers, US3, Jeru the Damaja, etc. were out?) Highly recommended as a must-have. 'Cause Guru is my favorite rapper to date. <br /> <br />Peace, I luv ya'll.

B00008CMR6|3.0|By 1970, John Wayne had his Oscar in his pocket and Rio Lobo on some inspection looks like just a lot of good, clean fun he and the cast decided to have, with no particular regard for making cinematic history. The plot rambles and has some implausabilities-like why does the Duke, who plays a Yankee, go home to Blackthorne, Texas? And Jorge Rivero as a Confederate officer takes some getting used to. Same thing, different reason, with Jennifer O'Neill. She seems too contemporary for a historic setting and her acting is questionable. However, by dogies, she is just so beautiful (and one of the hottest actresses in demand in the early 70's) that she can be forgiven for any dramatic failings.  <br /> <br />One of the strengths of the film is the Duke's self-deprecating humor is in fine display, and so is John Wayne himself. Chisum, which was made about this time, is a better film in my estimation, but Mr. Wayne is practically relegated to a supporting player in it. In Rio Lobo he is in almost every scene and that alone makes it a pleasure to watch. Jack Elam hams it up and David Huddleston adds a nice touch of comedy. Trivia buffs will enjoy Sherri Lansing (future studio head) in the near buff and George Plimpton, fresh off his Paper Tiger days, getting a bit role as a short-lived bad guy.  <br /> <br />As for improving the movie, it suffers because the death of the lieutenant, which is the main motivating force for Wayne's character to go after the bad guys, is little seen by the audience. We need to connect with this guy so we feel strongly that justice must be done. This character should have been played by a well-known actor in a cameo role. An obvious choice would have been Patrick Wayne. Then the audience would know the character even though their presence onscreen is brief and make a stronger emotional connection with them. Another thing is the sheriff of Rio Lobo is supposed to be a really mean hombre, but we don't have enough scenes with him to establish this. At the very least, a scene should be added where he brutally questions the Sherri Lansing character and scars her. It wouldn't have to be graphic-just enough to once again emotionally connect with the audience. <br /> <br />Mr. Wayne's DVDs are not getting the attention that his fans deserve! George Plimpton had a television special on making Rio Lobo-this should be an extra included. And, my gosh, The Alamo had 500,000 feet of film shot-some by John Ford. What do we get in bonus material? ZIP! NADA! JACKSQUAT! C'mon Hollywood, this is THE most important film actor of the 20th Century! Get off yer duffs and find this stuff. This is HISTORY!

I have to say I love the way Picoult lets you hear multiple characters voices and thoughts.  But Anna is probably one of the strongest female characters I've read in a novel in quite sometime, amazing considering she is only a child.  Between this novel and The Pact, my eyes were swollen for three days!  Picoult is definetly a gifted writer who allows the reader to experience so many strong emotions in just one book.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|Minority Report combines an elaborate plot you can never really pin down until the very end, loads of summer blockbuster-type action, all sorts of nifty futuristic technologies and special effects, the star power of Tom Cruise, and the direction of Steven Spielberg.  Given all that, this movie was virtually guaranteed to please audiences, and it does not disappoint.  While the plot is loosely adapted from a short story by Philip K. Dick (who truly belongs in the upper echelon of science fiction writers but is still vastly underappreciated), it does manage to embody much of the sociopolitical questions and concerns related to technological advancement that animated Dick's body of work.  In the world of Minority Report, set in 2054, privacy has basically disappeared.  Retinal scans trace your every move, your mind is constantly bombarded by customized advertising (it's like having your brain infected by unlimited and infinitely invasive spyware programs), and you can be arrested and put away (in a comatose cocoon) for a crime you did not commit - if you live in Washington, D.C., at least.  The experimental precrime unit set up in the nation's capitol six year ago quickly reduced the murder rate to zero, employing a trio of exceptional young people gifted (or cursed, depending on which way you look at it) with an uncanny ability to see murders before they happen - thanks to the milky liquid they lie in, their prevision powers are significantly boosted and translated into electrical data the precrime authorities can view themselves.  Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, and he interprets the signals of the precognitives' visions in order to locate and stop each impending murder before it can happen.  Things are going very well - until the federal government sticks their noses into things.  A national referendum will soon decide whether precrime will be adopted nationwide, and Anderton finds himself having to deal with an annoying little runt from the Attorney General's office - Danny Witwer, played by a silly-mustachioed Colin Farrel.  Anderton and his boss, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) do not want their project turned over to the feds, but things get unimaginably complicated when the precognitives identify Anderton himself as a soon-to-be murderer.  Anderton runs, anxious to prove his innocence and desperately anxious to understand what is going on.  Convinced he would never murder anyone (especially a predicted victim he has never even heard of), he has to face the troubling fact that the precognitives are never wrong.  His friends and coworkers now face the unusual task of going after one of their own, and Anderton proves himself quite difficult to catch.<br /><br />I thought the ending of the movie was superb; in many ways, Minority Report is a mystery, and the film plays its cards pretty close to the vest up until the final few scenes.  If you like action and dazzling special effects, you'll find that here in spades, but those who crave an intelligent story behind all the bells and whistles will be doubly pleased by this film.  Apart from the heart of the story itself, Minority Report provides food for thought that you may still be chewing on days later - e.g., the whole privacy issue and the Constitutional implications that, while not really addressed in the film, come across loud and clear; then there's the whole matter of the isolated precognitives, three young people denied a real life in the outside world and forced to live and relive horrifying previsions of murders day in and day out.  Tom Cruise turns in another sterling performance, and his character is remarkably human and complex, as the loss of his son six years earlier and the problems he continues to have adjusting to that loss make of him an incredibly human type of hero.  I should also mention the fact that the film boasts several very funny scenes, serving to release the viewer's tension momentarily - that's a good thing because things get pretty tense as the story progresses and you'll want to be mentally ready for the twists waiting for you around the final few bends.<br /><br />The movie itself runs almost two and a half hours, and a second disc features an impressive number of featurettes examining the origins of this first Cruise-Spielberg project, the making of the film, and somewhat technical looks at the special effects that bring the world of 2054 to vivid life on the screen.  This all adds up to a DVD that will appeal to almost everyone out there who enjoys good movies.hings get pretty tense as the story progresses and you'll want to be mentally ready for the twists waiting for you around the final few bends.   <br /> <br />The movie itself runs almost two and a half hours, and a second disc features an impressive number of featurettes examining the origins of this first Cruise-Spielberg project, the making of the film, and somewhat technical looks at the special effects that bring the world of 2054 to vivid life on the screen.

This novel is told with the use of flashbacks in both Em's and Chris' voice, in addition to their respective families, which shows that things are never what they seem (which I've been telling my mother for years).  Sometimes boundaries are needed, and in this book its hard to figure out if its the parents, the kids, or the parents and the kids.  I laughed and I cried, and cried somemore.  To me, a novel that pulls at your emotions they was The Pact does is truly a well-written novel. <br /> <br />Regardless, this book moved me so much I went straight to Picoult's website and decided to read more of her work.  I thought it was a truly poignant story of what is happening across the country today. <br />
B00004U2G4|5.0|This is a response to Proud Led Head.  Led Zeppelin's first album came out in January '69.  Truth came out in August '68.  That's te truth.  If you believe otherwise, you're just insane.  Zep's first album was recorded in October '68 and even so, Truth STILL predates it.  Just accept that you're wrong and that the world does not revolve around Led Zeppelin.  And the other crap about how Beck can't lick Page's boots, etc.?  I'm not even going to deign to answer that.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a great album, I must say.  If you don't already own it, buy it (and no, I don't work for Beck himself).

1400032717|5.0|This is probably the best novel I've read in the last 5 years.  It's utterly original and the viewpoint of being inside an autistic mind is phenomenally well done.  I've never actually been compelled to write an Amazon review before, but this book deserves it.
B00000K19E|5.0|Okay. This book is not a biblical anything. Not New Testament anything! Nothing religious. The Wachowski Brothers themselves said it themselves, it is their own version of an allusion to one of the first, possibly most important book written in western culture. I don't remember the name. It was a big philosophical book, an allegory to human life. It was the story about how the entire world lived underground and were staring at the shadows of flames on a huge wall. They all thought that this was the only way of life. One person, though, has an idea. Their idea is that there might be something BEHIND them... and so he turns around and finds a huge flame, and behind it he sees stairs leading to the outside world. He goes up the steps and is astounded as he finds the outside world, and has tries to tell everyone else. So he goes up to people and says something like 'we've been living wrongly, i have found the stairs to the outside world' and the person, of course doesn't believe him. so he says 'come see for yourself' Then they come out and blah blah. This is where the phrase \\"I've seen the light\\" comes from. The Wachowski brothers themself have admitted that The Matrix was a metaphor to that story. Thus, as you see it odd that Morpheus says \\"I cannot explain it, I can only show you it\\" and stuff... it's not. You can't be told that a way of life is completely wrong, you can only be shown it. It's also referring to the way that advertising and all this other typical american crap is falsifying the human way of life. That people are blinded by advertizing, to where they have become 'robots' that can't think for themselves, they are controlled by this, thus the fight between the humans and the robots its just a metaphor for people struggling to show a blinded society the light. All this coming from a 14 year old kid, you should be ashamed of yourselves. :P <br />I think that the plot of this story is extremely well thought-out and although it began to get somewhat boring towards the end, it was still extremely important to the storyline, that only humans can free themselves from ignorance
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Australian group Jet lived up to their name when they sonically swooped onto the music scene with their first full-length CD - \\"Get Born.\\"  The lead-off single - Are You Gonna Be My Girl? - is simply one of the most compelling rock songs in recent memory.  Yes, it's highly derivative of earlier rock music, but it's brilliant.  How many TV shows, movies, and products immediately used the song in ads?  Sure, it burned out from overexposure pretty quickly, but fortunately the CD is filled with equally gripping rock.<br /><br />The band deftly combines elements of 60s and 70s rock (especially the Stones and the Who) but adds touches of more recent rock for a fresh sound.  For example, \\"Rollover D.J.\\" is reminiscent of Oasis.  \\"Move On\\" is a mid-tempo song that incorporates an alt-country sound, a la Wilco.  \\"Timothy\\" is an interesting ballad with lyrics that could have been written by David Bowie during his Ziggy Stardust period. \\"Radio Song\\" has some nice prog-rock touches that wouldn't sound out of place on an early Radiohead CD.  \\"Lazy Gun\\" is conceivably the pinnacle of the CD, as it changes tempo and style, weaving all over the place; it also, perhaps tellingly, sounds the least like anybody else.  The lyrics, though, seem to sum up Jet's philosophy - Change nothing/ Futures in/ Close the door/ Wear a name/ Be the same/ Take some more.<br /><br />Jet puts everything together so well that it's almost impossible to dislike this CD.  Plus, let's face it, the artists they rip off are by and large past their prime - either disbanded or making musty music.  Judged on its own merits, \\"Get Born\\" is an exceedingly strong rock record.  Of course, Jet now faces the tremendous challenge of following up this CD and standing apart from the other raft of similar retro-rockers, including the Strokes, the Hives, and the Vines.  Only time will tell whether the band will establish its own identity or become stale.  In the meantime, this CD is highly recommended.

B000002KB8|5.0|Taking the Blues Rock sound of Led Zeppling, and then downtuning the guitars was orginally used to help a handicapped guitar player, but little did Black Sabbath know that this, not only would would spark a revolution, but an entire new musical genre as well. That's right heavy metal started here. Combine Pink Floyd and Led Zepplin together, downtune it, and Black Sabbath is what you got. It is actually very good and this is their best CD in my oppinion. Their other releases were good, and some were lame. This band nor it's musci where greeted with favor from harsh critics and reviewers saying that it was just a wall of noise, and that it wasn't music, and that it was evil and was satan worship. None of which were true. Despite the reviews Black Sabbath continued and every metal band to this day should thank this band for what it did for their music. Thank you Ozzy and Black Sabbath for inventing the best musical genre on earth. Much debt is owed to you.
0393035158|2.0|Harris is using present-day fear and resentment to foster his arguments against tolerance for religious faith.  <br /> <br />While it is absolutely true that religious fundamentalists have and will continue to attempt to force their fear ridden, illogical, and dogmatic beliefs on others with threats of eternal damnation, social ostracism, torture and death, it is important to differentiate between the religious fundamentalist and other religionists who have personally experienced the presence of a loving caring God who fosters only that which is good, beautify and true in human experience. <br /> <br />The problem with the fundamentalist always quoting scripture from some \\"sacred book\\" is his or her belief that the book is infallible. All \\"sacred books\\" contain much that was written by God knowing men; however, the same books contain much that was written by those with a fundamentalist mentality. None of them are totally reliable.  <br /> <br />Agnostics and atheists have for centuries attempted to escape the cruel bondage of institutionalized religion by pointing to the inconsistency in religious dogma. Nothing that Harris presents is new. All of these agnostics and atheists with their consistent logical intellects have, however, somehow failed to make the crucial distinction between the fundamentalist and the men and women of experiential faith. Failure to make this distintion forced each one of them to \\"throw the baby out with the bath water.\\" <br /> <br />If you are persuaded by the logic of Harris's arguments, I would suggest you read the book \\"AN ENCOUNTER WITH A PROPHET\\" by Clyde A. Lewis. Mr. Lewis successfully challenges all of Harris's agreements, without once claiming that you must give up your innate ability to reason. Lewis like Harris refuses to foster time worn myths about God. In fact he destroys these myths, leaving the reader with a powerful new understanding of God and how he really relates to his children.  <br /> <br />
B000286S8S|1.0|First:  Thankyou to B.J. Oconner for a well thought out review. <br />Second: It seems this band went from \\"Ahead of its time\\" with Dave to a decade behind the times with Sammy.  I won't knock either singer.  But this is unmistakable with those 3 \\"new\\" songs.  Didn't realize Van Hagar was grunge.   <br />Third:  The only way they could sell this album was by alternating songs.  If they split it up Dave era and Sammy era, the only way Sam would get any royalties is if he bought every copy himself because all 5 of Van Hagar's fans couldn't possibly buy enough to save Sam's ego. <br />Fourth:  Don't tell me I'm not a \\"true fan\\" because I don't fawn over the poetic felonies that they committed between 86-96.  And while they may have toured as \\"Van Halen\\", it was in name only. <br />Two bands, two sounds, two attitudes, two genres that share the same name.   <br />Fifth:  Sam singing Dave songs is blasphemy by definition and in extremely poor taste.  You don't claim Judas sacrificed himself on the cross for our sins like Jesus did.  An analogy, not comparison. <br />Sixth:  I truly believe Van Hagar would have been better received by DLR fans had he gone the Brian Johnson route and embraced DLR's legacy with the band like Brian did with Bon Scott. He alienated fans by trying to dismiss 1978-1984 as an inferior product to his.  It has become painfully obvious throughout the last 20 years that Classic Van Halen has outlived the Van Hagar \\"hair band\\" version with overwhelming proof by popularity and rock radio play lists.  I've heard \\"Its About Time\\" once on the radio, the day it was released and the call in response was so undeniably, universally hated they have not played it since.   <br />Seventh:  Is it really so hard to believe they would leave out VH3 when they went out of their way to forget Diamond Dave?  That pisses me off to the point I want to become violent.  That's like Black Sabbath trying to dismiss Ozzy.  They won't be in the Hall of Fame because of Hagar.They will be for Classic Van Halen and if they try to, it should be written into law they never again release another chord.  And lyrically, Sam can not hold Diamond Dave's witty pen.
B00006690G|2.0|Eminem's CD \\"The Eminem Show\\" is a wreck. It isn't terrible, but it's very far from being great. Eminem screams like an insane idiot for the majority of the disc which isn't that appealing. \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" is a song meant for his mother. He explains of his life and how he is \\"sorry\\" for what he's done. The whole hard life/terrible mother thing is an overused cliche by Eminem. He needs to come up with something else to rap about. The song isn't that bad though. \\"Square Dance\\" is a pretty good song with a country song feel to it but still hip-hop flow. The track is so different and creative that you've got to like it. \\"Drips\\" is one of two of the best songs on the CD. It's a song about getting an STD from a girlfriend who works at the cleaners. Who else but Eminem can write a song about STD's and make it hot? \\"Superman\\" is the other best song on the CD. This is a slower R&B type song with Eminem singing and rapping with female vocals to accompany him. The rest of the CD such as songs like \\"Sing For The Moment\\", \\"Til' I Collapse\\", and \\"When The Music Stops\\" are garbage and should have never been made. Eminem needs to calm down and step up to the plate. I don't think I'll every buy another Eminem CD.
6305181772|4.0|I hardily agree with the majority of reviews that rate this move as 4 or 5 stars.  It is action packed and suspensful, and all the actors do an excellent job.  My only comment refers to the DVD edition and the letterbox treatment.  It is just awful.  It's a travisty that this film has to be seen on such a small scale.  The black bars take up half the screen. This movie definately needs some special edition treatment.  I'll be waiting...
B00000DFRS|5.0|Whitney Houston is popular for her older songs such as \\"I'm Every Woman\\". She has a wonderful voice and with this CD proves that she can still deliver that old school flow with newer beats. Ms. Houston teams with Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean, Babyface, and Rodney Jerkins on this album. Whitney starts the album off with the slow songs \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" and \\"When You Believe\\". You've got to love Whitney for her vocal skills shown on both of these songs. \\"If I Told You That\\" and \\"In My Business\\" continue the album with that newer feel. \\"Get It Back\\" is one of my personal favorites. This Rodney Jerkins track mixes a hip-hop bass line with Whitney's soulful vocal skills. This track is essential for the success of \\"My Love Is Your Love\\". \\"Until You Come Back\\" is the Whitney from the 80s to the early 90s that everyone knew. \\"I Was Made To Love Him\\" is a hidden track on the disc that sounds like a Lauryn Hill song with it's Stevie Wonder harmonicas and it's guitar chords. I think it's the perfect ending to a perfect album. Whitney deserves 5 stars because she gave all she had. Some older artists who were big back in the day try to come out with a newer sound that fails because it's corny and isn't the sound people associate them with. Whitney soars because she makes it her own.
B000002UAI|5.0|\\"Beatles For Sale,\\" the Fab Four's fourth album, is not regarded as highly as their other works. The Beatles hammered this record out pretty fast as they recorded it between tours, and they were pressed for time in coming up with new stuff. Thus, the album is only half original material, while the other half are cover songs (8 Beatles originals and 6 covers, to be precise). But I'm not bothered by this one single bit. Yes, more original songs would've been appreciated, but we must remember that one of the Beatles' early trademarks was doing excellent cover songs as well as their own stuff, and \\"Beatles For Sale\\" gives you a healthy dose of both. The end result is a wonderful Beatles album. Regarding the band's original compositions, they're all classics: John Lennon's \\"No Reply\\" and \\"I'm A Loser,\\" Paul McCartney's \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" (an older song that McCartney dug up from his club days with the group) and \\"What You're Doing,\\" and the duo's brilliant collaborations on \\"Baby's In Black,\\" \\"Eight Days A Week,\\" \\"Every Little Thing,\\" and \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party.\\" The Beatles ain't no slouches when covering other people's songs either, and the batch of covers on \\"Beatles For Sale\\" are all tremendous fun. Lennon has a great time at the mike on Chuck Berry's \\"Rock And Roll Music,\\" McCartney tears it up on the medley of \\"Kansas City\\" and \\"Hey Hey Hey,\\" Ringo Starr gets one of his signature vocal performances on Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't,\\" and George Harrison, also a Carl Perkins fan, does great justice to \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby.\\" \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" is another fine cover, as is the group's rendition of Buddy Holly's \\"Words Of Love\\" (with Ringo playing on a packing case!).The Beatles' close friend Derek Taylor wrote in the album's liner notes back in 1964: \\"The kids of AD 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well-being and warmth as we do today.\\" Needless to say, Taylor was 100% right. \\"Beatles For Sale\\" may be underappreciated by some, but it shouldn't be. By dividing the album into half originals and half covers, the Fab Four give us the best of both of their musical worlds. Whether doing their own stuff OR other people's, these guys had the magic touch. \\"Beatles For Sale,\\" filled with great Beatles music from beginning to end, is great testament to that.
B00004S367|4.0|Most of the songs on this album are absolutely brilliant and offer a clear glimpse into the genius of the then young and newly \\"freed\\" Stevie Wonder.  The reason that I start off this review by talking about the brilliant songs on here is because this album is really more like a loose collection of great songs than an album per se.  This album was released after Stevie Wonder won full creative control over his music, and we begin to truly see why Stevie is the greatest composer and one of the greatest songwriters in popular music history.  Stevie has written some of the most bright, colorful, illustrative, and insightful songs that I have ever heard, which shows that even though he may not have physical sight, his vision is a lot clearer than most of our's.  \\"Love Having You Around\\" is one of the most fun and funky songs that he's made.  It has a wonderful melody and the breakdown in the middle of the song is nothing short of amazing.  Stevie completely changes pace with the next song which definitely ranks in the top ten most brilliant songs that he's ever written.  \\"Superwoman\\" starts out as a pretty light and upbeat track with an absolutely marvelous melody.  It then makes an astral transformation to find Stevie in a much more subdued and comtemplative mood.  \\"Love Every Little Thing About You\\" is a great little upbeat song that completely overflows with with positive energy.  \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" is an interesting song with two separate and distinct parts that alternate throughout much of the song.  The next two songs, \\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\" and \\"Girl Blue\\", are the two most lyrically impressive songs on this album.  \\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\" is the definition of magnificent simplicity, both in the lyrics and the melody.  \\"Seems So Long\\" is also a great song with a really deep and melancholy tone.  This song is the most personal song on this very personal album, and it finds Stevie talking about being able to love and trust again after years of beingalone.  The next song is basically a slice of high octane funk that fully justifies its extended play time.  The deeply spiritual and intriguing 'Evil' with its non stop changes in key, ends this album off on a very powerful note.  Stevie's moog synthesizer is tuned to sound like an organ here, and the mood and tone are extremely effective.  This album offered just a glimpse of what was to come, with the brilliant and absolutely perfect \\"Talking Book\\" and the greatest album ever recorded \\"Innervisions\\" to follow shortly thereafter.  This is not Stevie's best work but it is a great album nonetheless and a wonderful place to start for anyone who wants to understand his genius.
B00079HZUM|5.0|\\"Stage Beauty\\" succeeds beautifully in what any good period piece does, whether set 300 years ago or 300 years from now. It takes us into that setting, finds evocative characters, and has them bring up plot matters that resonate. With us, that is ... not necessarily with those actually living in the time depicted.<br /><br />I say this because the central element of the story has been described as unbelievable or unconvincing by some critics. Ned Kynaston (Billy Crudup), at the end of his run in playing female parts, is pulled from personal and professional despair through the insight and love of Maria (Claire Danes), his dresser and successor -- and they create a triumph out of this by bringing some real emotion to the Restoration stage.<br /><br />This has been decried as bringing Method acting to the 17th Century. It's nothing of the kind. Innovation is made during a fertile, provocative period of history. It did take 250 years to get away from excess artifice and gesture on stage. Yet \\"Stage Beauty\\" makes you believe that these characters could have accomplished it in the 1660s.<br /><br />If you can live with that, showing a success on stage that we can believe, even if it couldn't \\"actually have happened\\" ... then you'll enjoy this story. I was riveted by the way Ned and Maria turn their mutual fortunes around. So was Rupert Everett's wryly spoken Charles II, and so, perhaps, will you.<br /><br />The story centers on Ned's withering and growth in the face of adversity, and Crudup shows a huge range of emotions in carrying out this character's experiences. Complacency, haughtiness, sardonic amusement, appalled shock, tenderness -- but most of all, a crushing verdict on his own abilities, delivered before Charles and his mistress in a setting that only adds to his humiliation. I was taken entirely out of that moment in how I felt for him, almost an out-of-body experience.<br /><br />Maria is the mainspring to Ned's watch face, and Danes shows her own range and depth of feeling. She takes the winds of celebrity, itself something new for that time, and runs with them. Though she's not past being bewildered by them, especially when her portrait is being painted.<br /><br />Her suffering in the wings of several theaters -- down to Ned being abased before drunks -- shows many depths of love, for acting as such, for brilliance of technique, for Ned himself.<br /><br />She almost never talks directly of love. (Hugh Bonneville's perceptive Samuel Pepys helps bring it out at one crucial turning point.) She shows her love to Ned, to all levels of him, without once actually saying so.<br /><br />Their regard for each other transcends everything that is thrown at them -- from his raging self-doubt, to the royal court's machinations and violence, to her being obsessed with acting technique at the expense of creating passion and fire.<br /><br />This is a story of words transcending gestures and artifice. The words win out, whether in backstage maneuvering, unexpected honesty (even from the King's mistress!), or gauging what can be done with a character. It's a brave new world of being direct, getting past evasions and imitations of emotions.<br /><br />Danes and Crudup inhabit their characters. They're simply English, no question -- the accents are perfect. The Restoration physical settings are superb -- dark enough for post-exile, pre-Fire London, entirely believable for courts, stages, and back-stages. The score is evocative, with twangs of Scots influence.<br /><br />Every element immerses us in this world, even with the acting paradigm shift noted above. One can believe in these characters and their difficulties, and it ultimately comes to matter little that this is the 1660s. It's a human triumph which is timeless.<br /><br />Not every question of life is answered, for Ned and Maria, but you know that they're embarking toward a New World of finding out about themselves -- more metaphorical than the journey undertaken at the end of\\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" but far more believable. Join them, and be sure you do so in widescreen.undertaken at the end of \\"Shakespeare in Love,\\" but far more believable. Join them, and be sure you do so in widescreen.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|Green Day completely suprised everyone with their newest album by breaking out of their predictable formula of 3-chord progressions and songs about masturbation. They have made a masterpiece \\"rock opera\\" that pays homage to 1969's \\"Tommy\\" by The Who with a message about today's society and the government. I always believed that no album of my time would ever compare to that of the musical genious of the 60's and 70's, but Green Day has proven me wrong, and quite honestly they were the last band I expected to ever do this! This album has the potential to become a historic rock album, as long as it is not destroyed by MTV and the other unnecessary components of our society. I can't wait to share this album with my children in the future as my Dad did with bands like The Who and Led Zeppelin.
B00005JMJG|5.0|When you hear the basic storyline of \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\\" it sounds like another one of those \\"wacky\\" romantic comedies that they love to put out every month.  However, when you realize that this is written by Charlie Kaufman (who also wrote \\"Adaptation\\" and \\"Being John Malkovich\\"), then you know that this will be a very different movie.  This is such an enjoyable, hilarious and a brutally honest film that has immediately become a favorite of mine.<br /><br />Jim Carrey plays \\"Joel;\\" a quiet and shy person who keeps to himself most of the time.  He's bummed out when he discovers that his girlfriend had a new procedure done in where she has erased him from her memory.  Not knowing what else to do, Joel decides that he must get the same thing done to him and goes to the clinic to have her erased from his memory, hoping that the pain and sadness will go away.  When he's undergoing the procedure, unconscious and reliving the memories as they are being erased, Joel begins to realize that there were some very happy moments he had with her and he doesn't want to lose them after all.<br /><br />It's really hard to categorize a movie like this.  While it is indeed a comedy on some levels, it has a lot of dramatic elements to it, as well.  Because of this, people will either fall in love with it or despise every minute of it.  What really struck home with me is how honest and creative it really is.  You'll find a lot more honesty and truth in \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" than in most of the \\"cute\\" comedies that are out there today.  It is extremely easy to relate to the characters, and that is what makes it all the more realistic for us.  Jim Carrey is absolutely fantastic in this, as he is very controlled and doesn't try to steal the show.  This is when you really get to see his acting skills shine.  Kate Winslet takes the challenge of playing opposite of Carrey head-on and succeeds every single time.  We cannot forget about Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, who also make the movie that much more entertaining.<br /><br />What I really admire about the movie is the theme of it, and that is that just because a relationship doesn't work out in the end, it doesn't mean that it was time wasted.  Sure, there are certain memories we wish would go away somehow, but how would that change us as a person if we could do such a thing?  We learn from our experiences; from the good and the bad.  That's how we mature as human-beings, and Kaufman's clever writing really establishes that perfectly.  The DVD has some cool extras, such as behind-the-scenes documentaries, audio commentary from the writer and the director, deleted scenes and more.<br /><br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" remains the best film to come out of 2004 for me.  It's strange, yet clever; funny yet sad, and imaginative, yet honest.  If you're looking for a risk-taking film that is like a breath of fresh air, then I highly recommend this excellent picture.  This can possibly be the best movie of Jim Carrey's career.  Take a chance and find out why so many people are raving about it in the first place. -Michael Cranerk Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Wilkinson, who also make the movie that much more entertaining. <br /> <br />What I really admire about the movie is the theme of it, and that is that just because a relationship doesn't work out in the end, it doesn't mean that it was time wasted.

B00005O3VC|5.0|THE HOLY GRAIL is the finest work from the esteemed British comedy troup Monty Python.  Their hilarious skewering of the myth of King Arthur and the Round Table is successful on so many levels that it makes one, well, laugh out load and smirk with knowing admiration.  From gross physical humor(the Black Knight losing his limbs in combat, but refusing to give in) to pungent socail commentary (most of the movie) the Pythons deliver over and over.<br /><br />I have seen this numerous times (40?) over the years and still can be reduced to painfull fits of laughter by at least several scenes.  Do you need any other recommendation?
B00008OWZC|5.0|Wow. As a young pup not that was not around during the 1970s, I can tell you just how much the music of years gone by, and the music from today that draws so much from years gone by, sounds so much better than a lot of the crap out today. People like Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and ZZ Top consistently hold up so much better than Britney Spears, Blink 182, and Good Charlotte. This great live album by Led Zeppelin proves just that. Here, they blister through a set of great classic songs. It plays to the band's strengths: Plant's howling, Page's fantastic fretwork and arrangements, JPJ's versatility, and Bonham's lightning and thunder. This set has given life to some songs, namely Stairway To Heaven and Rock And Roll, that have been worn out by Classic Rock radio stations spinning them three times a day. These live versions just have so much energy. The sound quality is also really great, especially for the time period. The drums can be heard very well. There's not as much hiss as you would normally hear. My only complaint would have to be Moby Dick. A great drum solo is always appreciated, but at 19 minutes? By the way, the extended medley versions of Dazed And Confused and Whole Lotta Love are awesome, and just kick my ass everytime. It's just that Moby Dick is too much for me to stomach, and I love longer songs like Skynyrd's Freebird and Stevie Ray Vaughan's 13 minute rendition of Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) on the Live At Montreux discs. How about Communication Breakdown instead? Or When The Levee Breaks? But that's a minor quibble. Overall, a great set from Zeppelin's best period, the first five albums. After that, they lost a bit, but were still great nonetheless. Hey, bands of today, instead of trying to be like Green Day or Nirvana, try to be like this band, or the other great bands of this time, like Hendrix, Cream, Pink Floyd, The Doors, ZZ Top, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. Be more like Los Lonely Boys, and the music will be a lot better.
6305364613|2.0|..to ninth grade English!  Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes sound like they merely read the lines (even haltingly at times), not understand and feel them.  The only redeeming things about this are the sets, so wonderfully overabundant at times it's dreamlike, and the characters of Tybalt and Mercutio.  One other thing is the mostly successful attempt to update the play.  This version is nothing compared to the 1968 Franco Zeffirelli one, with the hauntingly beautiful Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, who combine the innocence and shyness of adolesence with its overwhelming emotion, every line and look bleeding with it.  The DiCaprio/Danes movie is a poor version of a great play.  I rented it again recently, to see if it got better, but I cringed whenever Romeo and Juliet talked.  It's really too bad.
6300216748|5.0|An appealing spy thriller about a secret CIA plan to invade the Middle East in the era when Houston-based Halliburton was still called Brown & Root.<br /><br />Jeans and tweed clad CIA agent Robert Redford tries to avoid death at the hands of CIA paid assasin Max von Sydow. A memorable closing scene: Reford asks von Sydow why he doesn't immigrate to the US. The old Swede (playing an Alsatian) replies that he prefers the calmness of Europe.<br /><br />Fiction finally became reality in March 2003. We know now that the neo-cons had hatched a \\"Condor\\" plan in the seventies but it was nixed by Nixon. When W came to power, the neo-cons  (Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Cheney, Perle, etc) were finally able to put their unAmerican plan into effect. The rest is history.
B0000640SB|4.0|This is a fun and clever film about federal agents who police alien activity (some government sanctioned) in the U.S. The story is told more or less tongue-in-cheek so despite some scary alien make-up effects you're not going to jump out of your seat with this one.  Tommy Lee Jones is suave as Agent \\"K\\" and, while amusing, Will Smith seems to be riffing off his Fresh Prince persona here as Agent \\"J\\".  It's obvious from subsequent solid work he's done that he learned something from the tutelage of a seasoned pro like Jones.  Vincent D'Onofrio does an amusing turn as a malevolent alien who inhabits the body of a rustic type.  My only complaint is the film does not properly utilize the extremely talented Linda Fiorentino who plays the coroner and had done some solid work in independent film.  If this is how she is underused by the mainstream film community she's better off in the independents.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|Great Movie! Great Cast! There is a lot of action in this movie and fabulous special effects. The cast is excellent and Will Smith also interjects a bit of humor into this exciting alien invasion flick. Highly recommended!

0553381407|5.0|Toxic Parents is a great resource for anyone who is suffering abuse at the hands of a parent.  Susan Forward is an internationally recognized therapist and writer, who has also hosted her own ABC talk radio program.<br /><br />  As the director of Luke 17: 3 Ministries, a ministry for Adult Daughters of Abusive or Controlling Birth-Families, I must say that, next to the Bible itself, I have found Toxic Parents to be an invaluable resource for dealing with relatives who will destroy you if you allow it. When you love a family member, and treat them with love, it is hard to understand, or believe, that they would return your love with abuse and maliciousness.  But unfortunately, that is reality for many of us, and this book helps us to come to terms with that, and protect ourselves from our family's destructiveness.<br /><br />  Do your parents still treat you like a child?  Do they control you with threats or guilt or manipulate you with  money?  Does it seem that no  matter what you do, it's never good enough?  As a child, did you have to take care of your parents because of their problems?  Do you still?<br /><br />  Toxic Parents explains the dynamics of a dysfunctional family in a very easy-to-read format.  Types of toxic parents are discussed in detail, such as inadequate parents, controllers, alcoholics, verbal, physical, and sexual abusers, as well as the family system and why parents behave this way.<br /><br />  Some topics covered are: Spoken and Unspoken Rules, Obedience No Matter What, I Don't Know Where You End and I Begin, No One in This Family is an Alcoholic, The Family Balancing Act, and Fear of Anger.  We are shown the rigid mechanisms by which toxic parents cope, such as Denial, Projection (accusing or blaming the child), Sabotage, Triangling (confiding in or enlisting the child against someone else), and Keeping Secrets.<br /><br />  The reader is given steps to reclaim her life and instruction on assertiveness, how to state what you are or are not willing to do, and how to confront your parent, including old, ill, or deceased parents.  The chapters on confrontation are especially valuable, teaching what to expect and how to handle your parents' reactions( 'It never happened', 'It was your fault','I said I was sorry', 'We did the best we could','Look what we did for you', etc.), as well as your siblings' reactions and reactions from other assorted relatives.<br /><br />  Toxic Parents teaches you that you are not responsible for your parents' behavior, teasing, neglect, abuse, or unhappiness, their problems, or their choice to do nothing to solve their problems.  Your parents are responsible for their own lives and their own actions.<br /><br />  This book will help you decide what kind of a relationship, if any, you can have with your parents.  It helped me recognize much of what was going on in my own dysfunctional birth-family, and is a very valuable tool for anyone who needs help in understanding and freeing herself from a situation that is poisoning her life.  It will open your eyes- and I highly recommend it to anyone dealing with \\"parent\\" issues in their adult lives.illing to do, and how to confront your parent, including old, ill, or deceased parents.

B0002VKZL6|5.0|Sometimes you just want to hear a song that tells a story.  Other times you just want to sit and listen to a guitar master do his magic.  With this album you can, and do, get both.  There is a South-of-the-border feel to several of the songs on this album, but that just serves to make the experience more varied.  More effort is paid to the lyrics than the \\"licks\\" in this album, but if you are a fan of Knopfler's quitar work, there is still plenty to listen to on Shangi-la.  The eclectic subject matter that you have come to expect from Knopfler is here in force, so along with NASCAR, centuries old surveyors, and Napoleonic war veterans you can now add Elvis Presley, Lonnie Donnegan, Las Vegas, and Ray Kroc.  So turn down the lights and be entertained, a master is in the house.
B00006L83N|5.0|Ill admit it. At first I thought the vocals were junk compared to the previous albums. But it really grows on you. And christ it is the same singer through out the entire cd, he is very possibly the best vocalist I have ever heard. This being their new cd too, its good to see that they keep progressing (unlike Dream Theater whose last album was horrible music writing with excellent muscianship, still doesnt work, plus Kevin Moore owns Rudess). And Michael Romeo's guitar playing has also progressed, which is good to see, and while hes definately not the most skileld guitarist out there. He definately has an amazingly creative style. You can definately feel his Paul Gilbert influences. Their keyboardist is amazing as well, some very beautiful stuff in this cd. I would buy Divine Wings of Tragedy first, but this is definately their best album and definately worth buying.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Let's face it; Day After Tomorrow is one of \\"those\\" movies.  It's made by the same team that made Independence Day and it shows.  Not much new character development went into this movie, although a Will Smith type of character would have been much appreciated (and perhaps using the other Quaid brother).<br /><br />There's a plot to overtake the world; this time, it's not the aliens.  The weather is out of control.  It makes for some terrific effects surrounded by some abysmal acting.  How could anyone possibly recommend it?  Well, it has moments of fun.<br /><br />If you have a big, widescreen TV with great dolby digital 5.1 surround sound and liked Independence Day, you should check this one out.  However, if you have just average speakers and a normal sized TV and couldn't stand Independence Day, stay away from this movie...far, far away.
B000089RVX|5.0|Yes, I am goth. Yes I am a guy. Now that i have said that, i like this album. Great everything. I like base guitare best, but these people have great normal guitare. The solos here are the best ever. while posers like John Petruni of Dream Theater or Steve Vai have two minute long solos because they think they are good but there not. Evanescence needs one five second solo on the entire album to prove that they are the best. Great riffs (I dont no wat those are) and good songwriting (i dont no wat that is either) is on this album. This was put on mtv a lot and anything that is on mtv is good anything that is not on it is not good because it is not on mtv. Somehow even though i am goth to rebel against society, i only like what is on mtv. I am now going downstairs in the bassment to set my hair on fire.
1401201911|5.0|I haven't read a comic in a long time.  Can't remember the last time I actually did.  I read some good stuff about this book and also like things that play around a little bit with mythology and ask a few \\"what if\\" questions.  Millar has created a world where Superman is Russian and doesn't even use a secret identity.  Lex Luthor is elevated to a status of a great American icon whose motivations might be bad, but do the ends justify the means? <br /> <br />The book asks a lot of good moral questions and yet doesn't get preachy at all; it also remains immensly enjoyable. <br /> <br />It's a good read.  The illustrations are top notch.  I'm extremely happy I picked it up and will be looking for other Mark Millar novels. <br /> <br />It's a Superman story that's dying to be translated to the big screen, but likely will never happen.  Pick it up and enjoy it for yourself.
B000002N2N|4.0|This was the Ramones first live album.  It was recorded on New Year's Eve 1977 with the group's original lineup.  The band tears through 28 songs, from their first three albums.  That's two thirds of the songs they had recorded at that point.  While the songs aren't as polished as the studio versions, they are played with a lot of heart and energy before an enthusiastic audience.  I wish I could have seen the Ramones back then, but I was only ten years old at the time.  I did get to see them later, but that wasn't the original quartet.  Anyway, this is the Ramones definitive live album and I recommend it to all their fans.
B00030590I|5.0|\\"Hero\\" is written like a poem and sung like a ballad. It is at once simplistic yet complicated, dark yet dazzlingly beautiful. Far before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was introduced to the Western theatrical world, a multitude of martial arts films abounded in SE Asia. \\"Hero\\" is the embodiment of the strength, savageness, and unsurpassed beauty that comes from the harmony built by body, mind and soul through years of practicing martial arts.  <br /> <br />Jet Li steps back from his stereotypical Hollywood bash film to execute an unparalleled work of art. Combined with the commanding presence of Maggie Chung, his female counterpart, and the talents of Tony Leung and Zhang Ziyi, this is a fiercely acrobatic ballet only tangibly supplemented by a barely necessary sparse dialogue. Though set in Ancient China, the film is laced lightly over with distant facts which are used as the mere backdrop for the retelling of an epic.  <br /> <br />The cinematography & choreography of this film are amazing. With every retelling of the story, the vivid color changes and panaromic sweeps inherent in each scene speak a thousand words on their own, giving the actors a masterful stage to play on. The fantastical and somewhat spiritual, supernatural tone of each scene is accentuated by the trademark Chinese martial arts wire work, giving the impression that the four main characters are no ordinary people, but fine artisans and such masters of their craft that they have transcended normal physical laws.  <br /> <br />To fully appreciate this movie one has to recognize that \\"Hero\\" is about one thing: story telling. Any legendary story in any culture holds elements of the fantastical, the mythical, the unknown. \\"Hero\\" encompasses all of these elements and demonstrates the depth of human imagination.

B000062XGD|4.0|Cast Away is a ok movie. Its about a guy who works for Fed-Ex and the airplane he is on crashes and he survies and lives on a island for 3 years by himself. The guy gets weird and talks to a volyball that has blood on it. Unless you like movies about people who live on islands alone dont watch Cast Away.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Whether you love him, or hate him, the power of this movie is undeniable.  Every person in America should see this movie whether you are a republican, democrat or of other political affiliation.  The facts presented here are overwhelming.

B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is a great movie but sometimes it gets so boring that you turn it off. It is almost 3 hours long and about 2 hours is just people talking  about things that are not interesting. It is about 2 best friends who are both piolts that are at Pearl Harbor during the attack. Watch it but your probably going to fast forward a lot of stuff.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This album is simply amazing, its the IN UTERO of heavy metal with darker lyrics, more haunting riffs and down right whoop ass metal! I almost wasn't able to buy this album 'cause of the Goddamn PMRC..HAH! YOU F*CKIN LOSERS!! YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD STOP METAL??? YOU'LL ALL BURN IN HELL!!! Okay, I've stopped so about this album: Its just awesome! Even this version where Daves new vocals are worse never ceases to f***ing amaze me! This is better than Peace Sells and better than The System has Failed because half the songs on here are perfect whereas maybe three songs on the other ones were perfect, but this is just Metal Classic to the Nth degree! I really cant explain how awesome this is, I really cant! This maybe the only album where it has been so good that I am speechless of its brilliance!
0792839730|5.0|A Bridge Too Far is a great movie. Its about Opperation Market Garden from World War 2. Theres not a lot of battle scenes. The quality of the movie is really good for a 1977 movie. It is more of a documentary than a movie. If you like war movies you should watch A Bridge Too Far.
B0002EXH54|5.0|After two albums (If you dont count Metallicas KILL 'EM ALL) Megadeth has finally gotten some attention from metalheads around the world. This is the album that put Megadeth on the map with Metallica, Slayer and soon to come Anthrax for the Four Horsemen of thrash/speed metal. Although this came out at about the same time as Master of Puppets (Metallicas best album) I still find this the best of '86 and it has many great things about it.  <br />  Okay, about the album: The best songs are Peace Sells, Good Mourning/Black Friday and Bad Omen. All of these songs rate as some of the best Megadeth has ever unleashed upon their fans and we now praise them for these masterpieces. This truly rates in at one of the best Megadeth albums with Mustaines trademark solos with Polands helpas the other guitar soloist and with sarcastic lyrics like \\"What do you mean I pray to God? I talk to him everyday!\\" from the mindblowing 'Peace Sells' and the explicitly grotesque lyrics of \\"My hammers a cold piece of blood-lethal steel, I grin while you writhe in the pain that I deal\\" from the speedy 'Black Friday'. Basslines and drums are also top knotch here. Samuelson could kick Lar$ Ulrichs ass and while Ellefson was no match for Master Burton he still made some pretty sweet melodies. <br />  Okay, about the remastered and remixed version: I love thought of remastering an album to make its sound and production more crisp and clear but the remixing was NOT such a good idea. I still give this five stars though because all in all the songs are relatively the same with really nothing big taken out so just buy one of the best metal albums of all time!
B000001H00|5.0|Milstei is my favorite violinist ever. I first got hooked on his Tchaikovsky recording then his Brahms (he does a brilliant Brahms so check it out) and his Mendelssohn and Saint-Saens three are also very good. The first recording I'd ever heard of these Bach sonatas and partitas was one by Heifetz. It was very good. I've never heard Heifetz do anything bad actually. My private teacher told me that Milstein did it well, and I'd heard the same thing in reviews so I thought, \\" I need to hear this.\\"So I went down to the library and got it. It is excellent. The reason Milstein is so good at Bach is because he is so articulate. His technique is also just as good as Heifetz. I really think he is the greatest violinist of the twentieth century.
B0006213WG|1.0|What a coincidence, MTV decies boy bands are over and now they move into the pop punk genre. What does MTV have planned for us next? A \\"metal\\" version of britney spears? A rap version of \\"puddle of mudd\\". MTV viewers are a lame excuse for living.
B00005JMXX|1.0|Let's see, divorced couple reignites their passion in the face of disaster, and young people find each other just when it seems too late.  Wasn't this the personal angst we were supposed to identify with in Independance Day and the Patriot (oh wait, that wasn't his ex-wife, it was his sister-in-law who just looked exactly like his ex-wife.  The Revolution pre-dated no fault divorce!) <br /> <br />I'm sorry.  I really tried.  I couldn't accept the characters.  (Sam and his nerd buddies can do calculus in their head, but can't figure out that their might be food and fuel in the ship outside their window.  The librarians decry the burning of books for warmth, but neglect to chop up the wooden furniture that is all over the library, that, btw, would have burned far slower!) <br /> <br />I couldn't accept the situations.  (For example, why did the pediatrician have to wait in the darkened hospital.  Why not just take what the child needed and go in another vehicle and transfer him to an ambulance later?)   <br /> <br />I couldn't accept the scientific basis (If the Troposphere is 150 degrees below zero, why don't we have frozen chunks of gas floating above our heads.  Why do we have to wait for meteors from outer space when we can just watch them form in our own atmosphere!)   <br /> <br />In fact, I think that Roland should use his vast array of scientific know how and create a sequel that allows the government to thaw all their flash frozen citizens.  Oh wait.  Somebody already made encino man.
6302648750|5.0|This is a great comedy to watch.  Very campy.  Middle-aged women will find it cute too.  Good ensemble cast.    Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) is a broadway star. Ernest (Bruce Willis) and Helen (Goldie Hawn) are an engaged couple at the show.  Helen knows Madeline from way back and meets her again back.  Ernest is a big fan of Madeline. They go backstage to see Madeline and the second Madeline sees Ernest, it is lust at first sight. Helen becomes jealous.  Next thing we know Ernest and Madeline are getting married.      Seven years later, Helen is 300 pounds and still jealous and angry of Madeline who is now an actress.  Evicted from her apartment, she is sent to a mental hospital.  She gets the notion to \\"eliminate\\" Madeline from her mind.   Seven more years pass.  Madeline is aging, still married to Ernest.  The couple barely even look at each other.  She can't stand his breathing.  They see Helen at her birthday/book signing party.  Helen is looking younger and trimmer than ever.  She looks sexy.  Now Helen wants her past-fiancee back. Meanwhile, Madeline goes to see Von Rhuman (Isabella Rossellini)  to purchase a luminous magic potion to give her everlasting beauty.    Now the fun begins.  This film is one-thousand laughs and is fast-paced.  Bruce Willis is absolutly funny.  He is brilliant.  You have never seen Bruce Willis like this before.    Cameos: Debra Jo Rupp as a psychiatric patient.  Jonathan Silverman as a party guest. Italian model, Fabio is one of Von Rhuman's body guards.    Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn make a great comedic team.  But they both are scene stealers.    Of course, Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep had to wear make-up to make them look aged as both in real-life still are well-preserved.   I recommend you see this film in fullscreen on VHS.
B000006MS3|5.0|The liner notes for this album say, \\"This album was made to be played loud,\\" which might surprise someone who comes in on the song which features someone braying like a donkey. But playing this album loud is actually necessary to understand this music. Bush has always been fascinated by the range of possibilities in music, having made her debut mark on the public consciousness with the juvenile yet affecting paeon to Bronte, the hit single \\"Wuthering Heights.\\" In that song, besides the audacity of making a rock song from the point of view of an 18th century literary heroine, Bush's voice went through nearly four octaves. The Dreaming also contains songs that go through all those four octaves, but also tests the dynamic range of her voice from soft to loud, or smooth to rough, from sweet to raucous, accented, filtered, overdubbed, screaming, and whispering. The result is uneven, but I feel that's part of her point, and for me the album is interesting partly because it's not all of a single piece.<br /><br />The first song, \\"Sat in Your Lap,\\" starts the album off strong, with a drumbeat that's infectious and impossible to ignore. There's three separate vocal sounds in this song: the opening breathy verse, the follow-up higher-pitch and much more strident portion of the verse, then the near-screaming chorus. Each separate vocal delivery varies also in its relation to the ear, with the breathy voice seemingly next to you, the higher-pitch voice as if it was across the room, and the chorus somewhat in your face, all accomplished in the mix and how much of the vocal is contained in each speaker. It's these kinds of distinctions that come through only if you hear the album loud (earphones are especially useful in that they also reduce any outside noises so you can focus on the music mix). A later song, \\"Suspended in Gaffa,\\" plays with the same strange mix of vocal deliveries with music that's more string-based than drums.<br /><br />While every song tests the listener's indulgence at times, the single song that incorporates the most extreme experimentation is \\"Get Out of My House.\\" The music is reminiscent of the opening song, but from the beginning voices of the background men's voices baying, \\"Heeee-hawwww,\\" this song anounces that it's not normal fare. Middle sections of Bush speaking French in a Marlene Dietrich-ish voice filtered as if through a telephone connection as well as constant screaming in the background are hardly leavened by the occassionally silky vocals layered on top. The return of the donkey at the end simply underscores the weirdness. Yet, like some of Laurie Anderson's more outre offerings, there's something fascinating about the song at the same time. Bush epitomizes Anderson's concept of \\"difficult listening music,\\" as opposed to the radio genre of \\"easy listening.\\" This is not a song or an album that one plays in the background at a party, unless you want your guests to riot. It's meant for the listener to actively follow, to hear those strange noises and try to puzzle out just why this song has a donkey bray. (Personally, even after reading the lyrics over, I'm still as confused by this song as ever, but still feel that there's something there.)<br /><br />Bush's live shows had also been as eclectic as her music, and the different accents she adopts in the songs here mirrors her interest in combining drama, dance, and dialogue with her drumbeats. For example, the title song incorporates the digerdoo and Australian mysticism. \\"There Goes a Tenner\\" is dramatic song with Bush adopting a Cockney accent of a rough burgler engaging in a bit of a caper, one in which the criminal is afraid will go awry and which does. \\"Houdini\\" is a song about that famous escape artist with the point of view being Houdini's wife and assistant, flipping back and forth through time from her memories of kissing him and passing the key to his shackles in that kiss to his and her focus on debunking spirtualists' claims to be able to contact the departed. Even more surprising, and no less dramatic, is \\"Pull Out the Pin,\\" where Bush takes on the role of Vietcong explaining why he must throw a grenade at the unwelcome Western soldier.<br /><br />Sometimes the songs are anthemic, such as the chorus of \\"Night of the Swallow,\\" which foreshadows some of the songs of Hounds of Love in its incorporation of multiple tracks of Bush's voice in combation with a heavy emphasis on an Irish-tinged violin. \\"The Dreaming\\" also comes across as something of an anthem, with its call-and-response lyrical structure.<br /><br />The Dreaming is not for every listener; in fact, it's not for many listeners at all. It's not that Bush is inaccessible. Later songs and albums were much less experimental in nature. But The Dreaming was Bush at her most playful and erratic, her ideas, styles and themes as varied as the notes she choses to sing. Tori Amos once described her own music as anchovies to the pizza-hungry world--it's just not to some people's taste. To extend that analogy, The Dreaming is tonight's special pizza, a dish that sounds weird from the menu but just might work for some tastes, and likely won't be made a regular feature of the menu. Some people are willing to give it a try, and even if parts aren't that palatable, they admire the thought behind mixing those particular ingredients together.o contact the departed.

B0002S947K|5.0|Most definitely my favorite release this year. Ray and Ethan Johns have created a modern day masterpiece, which may sound like a broad, swooping, over-rated statement. It is not! and the funny thing is they've created a CD that sounds nothing like modern day, slick, over produced pop/rock. No, this recording sounds like it was a long forgotten treasure, buried in the basement vaults of RCA. Ray has a unique gift of writing and singing that allows you to not only compare him to other artists, but hold him on his own, as well. Ethan creates a wonderful backdrop and timeless production. Not only should you buy this disc, but see the man perform live. His voice just soars in concert! A major talent, I hope for years to come. My only complaint, Ethan should have recieved double billing. His work on this record is just as important as Ray's. On a side note: Please do not tag this guy with the \\"jam band\\" & \\"john mayer's of the world\\" crowd. He's far more talented and special than that!!!
B00005LSYZ|2.0|Don't make the mistake of listening to this album after listening to BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN (oh hell, BARK AT THE MOON also!). This was Ozzy's \\"glam\\" album. His band was dressed like Poison, and producer Ron Nevison polished the whole thing until it became slic, and slick, and a litle mor slick!<br /><br />The result was a flat, lifeless album, with some few good songs spread along it, but the execution really failed. Rany Castillo's drumming was no way comparable to that of Tommy Alridge or Lee Kerslake; the bass of Phil Soussan is buried, there's no way to compare it with Bob Daisley. And Jake Lee, altough very skillfull, never had a real chance to compete with Randy Rhoads's ability to play and compose.<br /><br />This is not a bad album by any standards (Ozzy can't do that; he and his team are too much good for it). It's jsut worst than his other albums.

B00005JNEU|4.0|On Friday night the only thing that happens in many small towns throughout America is high school football.  During the game the intense lights of parental desire for high achievement on the football field are pushed to a maximum through cheers and standing ovations on great plays by the athletes.  This pressure is a build up of parental and booster club demands on the coaches and the players with demands to win the Friday night game - every Friday night game.<br /><br />H. G. Bissinger decided to capture the atmosphere around the Friday night high school football games as he traveled to Odessa, Texas, in 1988.  This can be read in Bissinger's bestseller Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream, which is the foundation for the film.  In Odessa football is the most important issue of the town during the fall when the lights of Ratliff Stadium are lit.  All businesses close for the game as every single living soul congregates at the stadium to support the towns pride, the Permian Panther's.  However, the game is so much more than just a game, it becomes an outlet for parents and town folks.  The Permian High School athletes have to face these demands of parents, booster clubs, coaches, and the people of the town in what seems to be a struggle for life in a game of football.  The game seems to be the only way out of the town for the young high school students as football is encouraged above education.  The people of Odessa frantically try to achieve this opportunity for the players.  Thus, the goal is always to win the State Championship game.<br /><br />The journey to the State Championship becomes a long and hard trial of emotional and physical stamina on the young high school players as on and off field behavior is being scrutinized in regards to football.  The story focuses on a small number of players that become the mirror image of the whole team.  A couple of these players are James \\"Boobie\\" Miles (Derek Luke), Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund).  Boobie is a rare talent in football, but football is also the only thing that he knows, while the quarterback, Mike, has a sick mother that frequently requires his attention.  These boys on the football team are pushed into an environment where they are turned into men as it is their last year of high school.<br /><br />The director Peter Berg portrays Bissinger's written account through a cinematic experience that is depicted with grainy realism that does not hide the ugliness or the heroic effort by the high school athletes as they try to meet the demands of Odessa.  Berg brings the audience into the locker room where the viewer can visually smell the sweat, feel the emotions, and suffer the pain of each tackle. There is no mystique to what happens in the film and it is this visual frankness that punches the air out the gut of the audience.  Lastly, Berg does not display deep intricate character development, but focuses on the social dilemma of all the characters and the environment in which the story takes place.  In the end, Berg offers the audience a great cinematic experience that requires reflection as this coming of age sports film deals with several issues that are smacked into the viewers face.edlund).

B0002YJ29O|4.0|At first I hesitated for the obvious lack of Glenn Gould's capacity for polyphonic music: how would one be able to tell head from tail when so many pianos are playing at the same time?<br /><br />Relax, and put your heart at ease, and do what the musicians here are doing and enjoy. These are no ordinary musicians but top musicians and they are having a marvelous time and they are sharing with you their joy. Martha Argerich and Kissin are doing a four hands piece as an overture and then, pieces for two pianos and more and more pianos, with the wonderful string players like Kremer and Maisky and even some singers in between. Basically it was Kissin stringing the whole concert together. The concert was such a success and it's  thoroughly enjoyable with lots of fun.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Blessed be.Why oh why do so many people have a hard time seperating this beautiful production from TOS? This under-rated entry opened the door to a new generation of special effects. The jump to warp speed is reminiscent of LSD trails; and was probably meant to be that way. This well thought-out rendition of 1960s icons backs the viewer into the future. Philosopher George Santiana once said that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it. In Star Trek - The Motion Picture, we see the past actually come to life. Yes it can be dismissed as an updated version of a TOS episode inwhere the satellite/computer Nomad goes beserk. But what's wrong with that? Childlike V'ger must merge with the creator, and is hellbent on so doing. Destruction awaits any and all obstacles. The thesis seems to be that eventually man and machine will merge thus creating a new life form. Is this possible? Talk about awesome love dolls (right guys?).IMHO the film is convincing on a Star Trek level, but able to conquer the uninitiated sci-fi crowd as well. The cast looks great together, and the film is obviously true to it's TV roots. The so-called Director's cut deletes an important part of the scene inwhere there is a fatality transporter accident, and lengthens an already boring pod ride scene from the station to the new Enterprise. But despite it's flaws, Star Trek - The Motion Picture sure pleases most viewers. Finally, few movies have an ambiguous conclusion., like this one does.

B00005JNEI|5.0|I would like to start by saying that, regardless of an individual's political leanings, I strongly advise every American voter to take the time to watch this film.  Even if you only believe that a fraction of what Michael Moore has portrayed in Fahrenheit 9/11 to be based in fact, you will  realize the extent of the serious problems that currently exist in the running of our great nation and that changes must be made to protect ALL Americans. <br /> <br />The first time I saw this film, I was in a suburban movie theater on a weekday afternoon.  The show was well attended by a very diverse crowd and the most amazing thing happened at the end of the film.  People actually stood in the aisles for several minutes and applauded the film as if it were a live performance.  In my entire life I have rarely experienced something as unexpected and moving as the entire audience's heartfelt and spontaneous reaction to this documentary. <br /> <br />Whether you love Michael or hate him, this film should not be missed. <br /> <br />
B00005JNJ7|4.0|Any film that has the White House publicly denouncing it has to be big, doesn't it? Leave it up to Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the consistently irrelevant South Park series on Comedy Central, to set off not only the radical politically-oriented activists of Hollywood, specifically Sean Penn who wrote an op-ed basically saying \\"f--- you\\" the film's creators, but the current administration at well. Though one has to agree with the White House's statement that the current war on terrorism is far from what one would call a comical matter, perhaps they were more irked about the look-alike of Bush in the film's poster. Whether they like to admit or not, many view President Bush this way, whether it be his supporter or detractors, and with Election Day less then three weeks away, perhaps its best if we all take some time off, relax, and divert our minds away from the current political climate if only for two hours. <br /> <br />The story for Team America: World Police is a comical take on the current war on terrorism and how both sides of the political spectrum have viewed it since September 11th. Team America, the governing police force of the planet dedicated to bringing terrorists to justice any which way possible, learns, thanks to their computer network known as I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E., that a group of Middle-Eastern terrorists, under the control of communist dictator Kim Jong Il unbeknownst to the crime force, has gotten their hands on weapons of mass destruction, which they plan to use to bring chaos to the world. In order to stop them before they enact their devilish plan, Team America recruits a rising Broadway actor Gary Johnson, quite possibly the best in the business (with the exception of his hero, Alec Baldwin), to disguise himself as a Middle-Eastern terrorist and infiltrate the secret organization to unlock their plans. It's a race against time to stop the power hungry Kim Jong Il and bring an end to his fiendish plot before every country on the planet is brought into what he calls \\"the perfect balance\\". The story for Team America: World Police fails to exist, or at least longer then first thirty minutes of the feature, but, as was case with South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, the audience its intended for doesn't care that much as long as the film makes them laugh, which its sure to do, in one sick twisted way or another. Though Trey Parker and Matt Stone do take their jabs at the \\"arrogant\\" jerks of the world's police force, their true black vendetta seems to be squarely with the radical liberal activists in Hollywood. If you hate any one of these hippies, or you just enjoy seeing puppets blown up, this is definitely a must-see film, for the last twenty minutes at least. Here's one question to ponder though: What the Hell did Matt Damon do to piss these guys off? Michael Moore is understandable (besides being a socialist whiner, he apparently placed a cartoon in Bowling for Columbine that was made to look like it was done by the South Park guys, which it wasn't) but Matt Damon? How about them apples?! <br /> <br />Another conventional concept Team America lacks is a generalized cast make-up - there may be a specific cast list on IMDB but considering it's a lengthy roster of individuals who few, if any in the general populous, know anything about, it isn't worth wasting ink over. But ditching cinematic canon isn't a new development for the South Park creators, so it isn't surprising for them to make their project work in spite of that clear fact. Gary Johnston, one of the best actors in the world, one who hides a dark secret he has kept since childhood, is the landmark hero of Team America and lampoons the basic \\"Ben Affleck-esque\\" heroes presented in the Bruckheimer extravaganzas such as Pearl Harbor (a film so bad the film dedicates a song to it) and Armageddon. There was one particular scene, more actually but in an effort to not give away too much we'll narrow it down to one, will have many people wrenching. At the beginning of the movie, Gary is discovered by the head of Team America in a Broadway stage show known as \\"Lease\\". \\"Lease\\", a take on the Broadway musical \\"Rent\\", features the song \\"Everybody has AIDs\\", and while it was intended as off the cuff humoristic take on the homosexuality of Broadway actors, it bordered on the line of  complete insensitivity and wasn't necessary. Sarah, whose finance is killed by a Middle-Eastern terrorist while on a mission in Paris, France, is the foxy team member that falls head over strings for Gary, though she desperately tries to fight it early on. The scene that will be talked about the most, whether it be at the water cooler or the high school lunch room, is the one that was under the most scrutiny when it was presented to the MPAA for the film's rating decision. There's no simple way to describe it other then to say it will either have you rolling on the floor laughing or racked with disgust. Just be forewarned, if you don't enjoy seeing puppets, or the more politically correct term would be the mechanically impaired, bang each other every which way for what seems like the longest twenty seconds in cinematic history, once you hear the words \\"I promise you I will never die\\" come from Gary's mouth, better cover your eyes quickly before being scarred for life. Chris, a no nonsense martial-arts expert, gives Team America the seriously needed attitude adjustment it deserves (\\"Let's make this interesting ... You lose!\\") and kicks major marionette butt in the process. Kim Jong Il, the vicious North Korean communist dictator, works extremely well when he's on screen, almost all of his scenes are gut-busters (both literally and figuratively), but he does have his fair share of problems. Specifically, the main problem is that he doesn't get as nearly enough screen time as he should. He's quite possibly the funniest character in the entire film, possibly because he sounds so much like Cartman from the South Park series,but only makes appearances sporadically throughout the feature. Granted this film is suppose to be about the heroes of Team America but with a villain as incomprehensible as Kim Jong Il, why not focus on him more? One can only hope more will appear in the unrated edition of the film's DVD release six months from now. <br /> <br />Overall, Team America won't persuade anyone to vote for a particular candidate this November, which, if you're from a swing state, you're pretty much sick of both by now, but whether you're a \\"right-wing nut job\\" or a liberal \\"wiener\\", you'll find something to laugh at in this film, one side more then other. On the last episode of 60 Minutes, you know - the program that faked the Bush National Guard memos, Andy Rooney, for what seems like the first time in years, actually made sense when he stated that those who haven't decided who they are going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election by now are idiots. Though that may seem harsh, in essence, he's right and an impertinent comedy such as Team America: World Police should have no profound effect on anybody's political affiliation. As Trey Parker and Matt Stone themselves said upon releasing this film, if anyone comes out of this film, or a Michael Moore documentary, basing their political decisions on what they have just seen, they shouldn't be voting. This film is for pure entertainment purposes only and should not be taken seriously by anyone with a brain, let alone some decent common sense. Let's be frank - Team America: World Police is in no way shape or form a feature that should ever be viewed by children under the age of fifteen even with the consent of parents. There's enough foul language, vomit, excessive violence, and puppet sex to make the most immature high school flunky blush. The film, as irrelevantly hilarious as it may be at times, has its share of problems that make it far from being one of the best films of the year, let alone one of the top-rated comedies of theseason. Team America seems to be betting too much on a one-trick pony - whether it be blowing everything up in site with as many big explosions as possible or doing stupid things, such as martial-art fighting, involving marionettes. What seems humorous at first eventually becomes amusing then cute ultimately falling into the area of just flat-out annoying and this is only after about forty minutes. Though it does work out in the end, this film should never have made into theaters and would have been bettered suited to a special presentation on either Comedy Central or HBO, and perhaps cut down by about thirty minutes. The parody of modern musicals may have worked brilliantly for South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut but it doesn't here almost at all. Though some of the songs are worth a few chuckles here and there, namely Kim Jong Il's \\"I'm so Lonely\\" (the online R-rated clip version was way better), they don't do anything for the film and really drag the film down. Bottom-line, if enjoy seeing mind-less peace-harping losers such as Michael Moore, Martin Sheen, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover, Helen Hunt, Matt Damon (\\"Matt Damon!\\"), and others getting smashed, bashed, and blown-up in anyway possible then this is the worth the price of at least matinee performance alone. With only three more weeks until four more years, take some time off from back-breaking political labor to relieve pressure from those infuriating fanatic left-wing activists.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|When I first saw Love Actually, i totally loved it. And since my first time, I watched it several times, again and again. In my opinion, it definitely is the most romantic comedy of all times. I usually watch it when I'm feeling a bit down, and I must say it is a great movie for such situations. It features several stories. You have a prime-minister's story (Hugh Grant) who's falls in love with  his house-help girl. Then a story about Brittish guy, who travells to America in order to get American girls who love Brittish accent (also with Elisha Cuthbert). Then about a man who's wife cheated on him, so he went to France and met a Portuguesse girl. Then, a youun boy who's in loved with a girl from school, and his father who is mourning after his wife. Also a story about two co-workers who finally get together, but this doesn't work because she has a sick brother. Next is the story of a married couple and the man starts flirting with his secretary. There's also a story about a couple who has met during filming an erotic movie. And there is also a story about a newlyweds and a guy's friend who is in loved with his wife (Keira Knightley). And all of this stories and characters are somehow connected to others. A great movie overall. If you love romance, you'll love it.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold are an amazing hardcore band. The only bad part about the album is that some parts have punk singing, which suks, but the rest makes up for it. They add some really cool goth type melodeath guitars on the songs. The drumming is also good. The vocalist has an amazing range from slowly singing to black metal screeching. I hope on their next album they lose the punk and go heavier and more gothic. The best songs are Chapter Four, Desecrete Through Reverance, Eternal Rest, Radiant Eclipse and I Won't See You Tonight Part1 and 2. <br />This band rules. Other good and even better bands are Lamb of god, Otep, the black dahlia murder, unearth and deicide! Can't wait to see what this bands new album will be like. <br />
B00005NTNM|4.0|In the original \\"Dirty Harry,\\" Inspector Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) went after a serial killer and in the \\"Magnum Force\\" sequel he went after vigilante cops.  To balance the latter, with its liberal nightmare, the third film in the series, \\"The Enforcer,\\" offers up a conservative counterpart by having the villains be long-haired hippie freaks in something called the Ecumenical Liberation Army (i.e., think about Tanya, a.k.a. Patty Hearst, and the SLA).  The obvious point is that when it comes to be judge, jury, and executioner, Dirty Harry does not make distinctions, ideological or otherwise.<br /><br />On the one hand the villains in \\"The Enforcer\\" are the weakest of any of the films in the series, but then the ELA is only Dirty Harry's target and not his opponent.  That would be Kate Moore (Tyne Daly).  The film begins with another example of how Dirty Harry has this bad habit of going after criminals on the streets of San Francisco in his own special way (hey, criminals ask for a car, Harry gives them a car), which always gets him punished by being transferred from Homicide to something less fun like the Personnel department, which is where he ends up this time, working on the promotion board.  When he first Moore she is up for a promotion and although he puts her through the wringer, making clear his disdain for the idea that a woman can be a good cop, the politics of the time not only ensure that she gets promoted to fullfill some quota, but the ironic frame of the film means she ends up being Harry's partner when he is put back on the street so that he has a chance to go around and shoot more people, who, this time around at least, tend to start shooting first so that it is more self defense than natural orneriness when Harry starts firing back with greater accuracy and bigger bullets.<br /><br />Moore surprises Harry because she is not stupid, either in what she says or does, and manages to learn from him despite his attitude and unwillingness to explicitly teacher her anything about the job.  Of course, in due time she actually saves Harry's life and he is forced to mumble something about how he could have a worse partner than Moore.  Of course, in retrospect we are not surprised that Tyne Daly, who went on to win four Emmys (including three in a row) for her consummate performance as Mary Beth Lacey on \\"Cagney & Lacey), can hold her own with Clint Eastwood.  Given how laughable the hippie revolutionaries are this film could have ended up being a big joke without her performance and the chemistry she has with the star, which is made all the more impressive by the fact that there is absolute nothing sexual about their relationship.<br /><br />The best parts of this movie are Harry and Moore establishing their relationship and becoming a team.  These are the scenes that have not only the most humor, as Harry's chauvinism runs into Moore's competence, but also that actually bet beyond the facade of the character of Dirty Harry.  This is what makes many of the action sequences, in contrast, to seem so cartoonish, especially in the film's end game when the mayor is kidnapped and Harry gets to use a bazooka during the final shootout on Alcatraz Island.  It might seem strange that the interpersonal relationship is the best part of a Dirty Harry movie, but that is the part of \\"The Enforcer\\" that gets five stars, while the violence that was supposed to be the big attraction gets only a three (and the film almost loses another star because of the costumes and music, even more so now that they are both so outdated).er anything about the job.

B0000029AP|4.0|This is the band at their pinnacle. The songwriting is as tight and edgy as they would ever become. Production sounds better than  their latter albums.  One could sum up \\"Toys..\\" with the words Dark, greasey and at times desperate. The high spots are all over the album from the first nasty riffs from the title track to the bluesy grooves of \\"Uncle Salty\\". Guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford's lead and rythm tracks mesh together well enough to make ANY two-guitar lineup to drool. Balance between music,booze, and drugs reached nirvana for the band here. This album will bruise your ears its so tough. Unfortunately it's all downhill from there. But that's another review.
B000065V9Y|5.0|Time has treated this record well.  It still stands out as a stunning statement of loss, confusion, strangeness, sadness, and hoped for hope.  These songs are very profound meditations about emotions and thoughts that many of us have had the necessary misfortune to experience.  And Peter Gabriel shows them to us here, in all of their gut and heart wrenching gore and detail.  This is a stunning statement of purpose whose emotional impact is really quite amazing.  I utterly agree with other reviewers that this music is far more effective (and less expensive) than at least a dozen therapy sessions. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.  And I find it noteworthy that some of the fools who didn't like (and probably didn't understand) this record when it was first released probably can relate to it now....
B0002BO0AS|5.0|This is probably the second best metalcore band ive heard(the best being lamb of god). These guys just play with so much power adn passion.

6305508550|4.0|If they made a live-action \\"Dilbert\\" movie, it might resemble \\"Office Space\\" -- a hysterically funny office film by Mike Judge (of Beavis & Butthead fame). Filled with quirky characters and a hilarious employee rebellion, this is a movie for anyone who ever felt trapped in a soul-destroying job.<br /><br />Peter (Ron Livingston) spends every day in a cubicle, doing pointless work under the thumb of his smarmy boss. His life is boring, and he doesn't even have the confidence to tell the pretty waittress (Jennifer Aniston) that he likes her. In an effort to relax, he accompanies his controlling girlfriend to a hypnosis session. Unfortunately, the hypnotist dies of a heart attack... while Peter is still under.<br /><br />The next morning, Peter wakes up happy and laid-back -- and determined to get out of his rotten job, and live fat and happy. He conspires with Samir Nagheenanajar (Ajay Naidu) and ill-named Michael Bolton (David Herman) -- two coworkers who are about to be axed -- to skim money off the company's assets with no one the wiser. Only problem is, their scene is rapidly spinning out of control.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" started off as an early 90s animated skit, featuring the character of Milton. You know, that increasingly crazed employee who complains that \\"you took my stapler.\\" This time, Milton is a minor character, but a pivotal one. The focus is mainly on the mellowed-out Peter and his wild scheme to profit the downtrodden employees of Initech.<br /><br />Judge creates a hysterical tangle of cubicle workers, layoffs and the most annoying boss in the history of film (\\"Yeeeeeeaaaahhhh... uhhh...\\"). This brand of humor is twisted, down to the slow-motion, ghetto-style beating of the copier in the middle of a field. And let's not even get into the dialogue (\\"Oh, and next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day...\\")<br /><br />The trio of lead characters are a riot -- there's Peter, whose newfound perspective is immensely entertaining. There's Samir, who can barely restrain his rage at his rotten job. And there's Michael, who has a seething resentment of the same-named singer. Jennifer Aniston does a pretty good job as a love interest for Peter -- a waittress who hates her job as much as he hates his.<br /><br />\\"Office Space\\" has become something of a deserving cult classic -- funny, strange, and sympathetic to the ants that toil in their cubicles.

B000068FY0|3.0|Most folks only know Supertramp from the multi-platinum release \\"breakfast in america\\"  and this is usually all the credit they receive from critics as well. Much of this has to do with their enormous promise they could never live up to. \\"Crime of the Century\\", however, is one of their finest efforts. The 1974 albums contains the classic-rock radio friendly hits \\"School\\", \\"Bloody well Right\\", and \\"Dreamer\\". The rest of the album, while containing much weaker efforts still has moments such as the title track and \\"Hide in your shell\\". The band mixes blues influence well with touches of jazz  in a production seemingly newer than 1974. (thats 30 years past!) A good album to start with if interested in the work of songwriters Roger Hodgson  and Rick Davies. Although I'm sure the kids won't even know who these guys are.

Other great characters would have to be; Martin Sheen, who should be declared a master of acting as he plays the role of Robert E. Lee, the leader of the Confederate soldiers. I now seriously consider him to be the only one who can acurately portray him, no one else would even come close.  <br /> <br />Tom Berenger and Richard Jordan also give very good supporting roles in the movie as the lower captains and officers. Basically all the men who give a talking performance manages to add their little bit to this movie to make it great. <br /> <br />Now even though the movie is about Gettysburg, there are also several other storylines in this four hour movie. My favorite would have to be the Battle of Little Round Top. Bridges and his men are forced to defend the rear of a line of union soldiers at the top of several hills. The confederates have been ordered to try and break through and then flank the unportected remaining forces of the Union army. <br /> <br />As soon as several attacks fail the union soldiers make a desperate charge with nothing but empty guns and bayonets fixed ont their rifles. \\"Sir, i'm ordering these confederates around with an empty rifle!\\" One of my favorite quotes in that part of the movie. <br /> <br />There are other great reinactments of several battles, but the one that stole the show was when the Confederalists marched toward the town of Gettysburg as thousands of Union soldiers waited for them. I thought that it was very moving for the Confederalists to march with their friends and possibly family members, knowing that most of them might not come back. {The Union forces were firing cannonsat them as the walked at least 2 miles over open ground. <br /> <br />Another great scene would have to be when Lee rode into a large group of his men in order to wish them good luck. It was very powerful to see his men cheer him and rush up to shake his hand. A great moment that shows anyone can have a hero to look up to. <br /> <br />Anyway this is one great movie. I guarantee you that you will find yourself wanting to see the entire movie without skiping any scenes, at least if you want to see just how good this movie can get. A powerful and touching film, and It will leave you breathless....
B00005JMH2|1.0|No, thank you, I'll sit this \\"Dance\\" out. Remakes are always risky, especially when the original flick is as beloved as Masayuki Suo's enchanting \\"Shall We Dance?\\" But even taken by itself, the American version of \\"Shall We Dance?\\" is a limp exercise in romantic comedy, that steps on its own toes over and over.<br /><br />John Clark (Richard Gere) has it all -- a successful career, a lovely and loving wife (Susan Sarandon), and a good home. So, of course, he's not satisfied and has a weird midlife crisis -- on the way home, he sees a woman (Jennifer Lopez looking sadly out her window at a dancing studio. He decides that his life has no meaning without a depressed pretty woman, and signs up for dancing lessons.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he ends up with older Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), not window-gazing Paulina. For some inexplicable reason (it's the 21st century! Can't men dance if they want?), Clark keeps his dance lessons a secret from his wife, and she starts suspecting he's having an affair. So she hires a private detective to shadow him, as Clark's dances with Paulina get hotter.<br /><br />The basis of \\"Shall We Dance?\\" was ballroom dancing, and its awkward place in Japanese culture. But it doesn't make ANY sense when you shift it to Chicago -- the American culture is so different that the social commentary is simply tossed out the window. Instead, we get J.Lo, which is apparently supposed to cover the gaping plot holes. Guess what -- it doesn't work.<br /><br />Usually a remake strays from the original plot, but unfortunately this clings close to the original. Scripting and camerawork are full of words and shots that echo too loudly of the original. Not out of respect for Masayuki Suo, but apparently out of artistic laziness -- it's like a xerox of a classic manuscript.<br /><br />What does Peter Chelsom give this movie. Here's what he gives it: Vulgar bright colours, and silly subplots involving Tucci's disguises and Bobby Cannavale as a closeted macho man. Too much time is spent on the moronic side characters, apparently so we don't notice the plot's lack of logic.<br /><br />Richard Gere does a passable job as a bored businessman, but he's somewhat overshadowed by the subtle, strong performance by Susan Sarandon, and a fun turn by Stanley Tucci. Jennifer Lopez proves again that she is Hollywood's most inept actress. She's supposed to convey heartbreak, yearning and depth, and only manages a sort of blank sullenness. She dances well, but that's all.<br /><br />\\"Shall We Dance?\\" takes a small, charming Japanese sleeper hit and remakes it as a big, brassy all-star movie with the grace of a dancing mammoth. A few fleeting sweet moments and a pair of great performances save it from utter mediocrity, but it's a near thing.a closeted macho man.

4789004546|5.0|The dicionary starts with a short section on basic Japanese grammar. Here, they explain the verb conjugations, and give some explanation about the characteristics of Japanese grammar. After this is done, the dictionary it self starts. The entries in the dictionary are alphabetically ordered. One of the things it contain are particles (of course). But besides particles it also contains entries on verb conjugations, different kinds of politeness, formation of irregular verbs, ... In short, I'd bet that almost every grammatical question you might have, could be answered by searching this dictionary.    Then about the entries themselves: every entry has the same layout. Each entry starts with the name of the entry (ex. mada) and states what kind of word(-part) it is (particle, adverb, conjugation, ...). Next, a simple explanation is given for the word, it's meaning or function. After this, you can find key sentences, formation-rules, examples, and possibly notes and related expressions. The examples are given in both japanese writing and romanji, together with their english translation.    I know this dictionary costs more than some of the other books on Japanese grammar that you might find, but I definitely recommend this one to all serious students of the Japanese language. If you are serious about learning Japanese, you'll definately appreciate this dictionary.
B0002234LS|3.0|That could be right, and this one certainly makes a tilt at proving it - for most viewers, the last twenty minutes of \\"Secret Window\\" may well undermine most of the pleasure of the previous seventy. The problem seems to be the source material: Stephen King's story is probably too slight to justify a feature, and the setup is so well crafted in the \\"intelligent thriller\\" mode that the climax, when it comes, feels far less clever than it ought to be. Still, it's not without its compensations. David Koepp continues to demonstrate that he can direct as well as write. He provides plenty of Hitchcockian moments of suspense, and the score by Philip Glass evokes precisely the kind of music Bernard Herrmann used to write. Johnny Depp is wonderful - as always - and here he again shows a real talent for comedy that has been under-utilized for much of his career. He cleverly and convincingly plays the eccentric writer, harried by an ongoing divorce and writer's block, who talks to himself and has an increasingly severe facial tic. His thoroughly entertaining performance adds enormously to the enjoyment of what is otherwise a rather light-weight affair.
B000063DGC|5.0|Tribute is awesome. No argument. The trouble is THERE IS ONLY ONE OF THEM. Back in '88, I found myself a bootleg on record in the 'cool' record store. It cost me 30 dollars then. The cover says \\"Ozzmium\\", and that it was recorded at the Montreal Forum on July 31, 1981. The record itself says \\"Buddy Love Sings About Girls\\" Which was hilarious, because when you drop the needle, the opener \\"Flying High Again\\" blares out, with a drunken sounding Ozzy shouting \\"Oh no, oh no...Here we go now!!!\\" The crowd begins out at the same audio level as the music, but 10 seconds into the song, the music is at the forefront. As bootlegs go, the sound quality is EXCELLENT. I dont know if it was a soundboard recording or not, but if it was just some guy in section 113 with a tape recorder, thne he lucked out big time. It must be a board recording. Its recorded very high, like you know how commercials are always louder than the TV? Thats what this is like. We need more of these documents, as Randy left us with so little, but yet so much. i am sorry that the artist does not get compensated for this bootleg, but it is a precious thing to me. I will not sell it. If you happen to come across a copy, and I am sure they are extremely rare to say the least, grab it. I dont know how much it would cost today, but 30 bucks in 1988 for a RECORD was pretty pricey...Good luck...

B000022TSY|5.0|The Plot: Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda are two drug dealers from L.A. who get rich selling coke to Phil Spector(imagine that...). They celebrate by hitting the road on their choppers towards Mardi Gras. Among many of the kind Americans they run into along the way is the one and only Jack Nicholson, an alcoholic ACLU attorney who helps them out of jail. In return, they decide to take him to New Orleans with them and get him stoned in the process (the funniest scene in the movie--Nicholson offers an inspiring monologue concerning extraterrestrial intelligence). Enduring harassment and abuse from the rural locals, they arrive at Mardi Gras. Tony Basil(!) is one of the hookers they drop acid with in the graveyard (an unsettling psychedelic sequence only surpassed by the climax of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"). Sounds great, doesn't it? It is. Despite its flaws and shortcomings, this is an American classic not to be missed. <br />Any fan of independent films will adore this movie (check out \\"Midnight Cowboy\\", too, if you like this one). The acting is amateurish but the script is inspired, and the cinematography and soundtrack are terrific. <br />This movie is a symbolic snuff film, and the American Dream is the victim in the spotlight. It foreshadows the paranoia and hostility that would later precipitate the War On Drugs and, now, the War On Terror. Ironically, the alcoholic lawyer played by Jack Nicholson is the only person that has a clear and sober idea of what is going on, and he is quickly silenced by the barbaric locals. The two main characters themselves have a vague idea of it, but are too caught up in their own hedonism to see it clearly. Near the end of the film, Peter Fonda grimly concludes: \\"We blew it.\\" Ouch--the truth hurts; I wasn't even alive in the '60s and I'm still feeling it today.
B0001FR3IQ|3.0|It was a dark and stormy night ... AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT, VIEWERS!! Every gesture, every moment, in the opening fifteen minutes of \\"Gothika\\" is emphasized by a thunderclap, a 10,000-watt burst of lightning, and a surging snatch of melodrama from John Ottman's first truly forgettable score. Right from the start, this film is so self-consciously and distractingly \\"atmospheric\\" that it never gets close to the kind of creepiness it's aiming for - we're never allowed to lower our defences for long enough to be shocked. Sadly, it's a case of style over substance, as Mathieu Kassovitz seems more intent on proving his visual literacy on a Hollywood budget, and stretching Halle Berry's no-nudity clause to the limits of plausibility with a litany of redundant swimming, showering and disrobing scenes. A better screenplay might not have been hampered by this kind of handling, but this one is unnecessarily average. The premise is great, and the pace escalates nicely towards the end, but Sebastian Gutierrez resists a wonderful opportunity to trump the \\"ghost story\\" conceit and make this about the very issue he sets up in the opening scenes: repression as a mechanism for survival. How much more interesting would this have been if, rather than being literally possessed by the ghost of a dead girl, Dr Grey had actually witnessed the girl's murder and repressed all knowledge of her husband's crime as a way of protecting herself, until it irrupted uncontrollably? It's essentially the same story - just make a few simple tweaks and lop off that appalling epilogue which makes it clear Dr Grey REALLY IS seeing ghosts. This could so easily have been turned from a supernatural bore into a genuine psychological thriller.  Dark Castle Entertainment can either continue to deliver B-grade horror films on A-grade budgets (with deservedly C-grade boxoffice results), or catch up with the contemporary cinema audience which is just too sophisticated to accept '50s schlock in shiny new packages.  Even the mall crowd is bored with this kind of thing.ven the mall crowd is bored with this kind of thing.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|if there is one word to describe this movie  - that will be \\"amazing\\". I mean amazing in every aspect - creation of canvas, puppetry, music (especially this one), photography and screen play. This is a riot of imagination - using puppets is not a new concept but the level of details that has gone into the sets is startling. The biggest consideration has been the attitude of the puppets they are so close to original population that is mind blowing. The theme song \\" America Fu...k Ya\\" is so appropriate.<br /><br />This a story of a special American forces called Team America fighting terrorists and the spread of now infamous WMD. Their ideas are novel but sometimes the methods are little crude and insensitive. KIM Chong-il is the primary villain and his charater is more than just hilarious - he is really a rebel without a cause -  a lonely fellow with nothing better to do. You will laugh laugh & laugh.  It also portrays the Hollywood stars and Michael Moore in a different light. The great thing about the movie is that it is not biased from the right or left and has been able to follow a middle ground.<br /><br />Just one of the point  - I believe sometimes there is too much unnecessary slang which could have been replaced with more wit other than that nothing to complain about.

B000002UTT|4.0|i first heard this album or parts of it during the summer of 88. i was in greece that summer and i heard the song The Look many times. each time it was played in a club people would go nuts and the dance floor would be packed in seconds. i was listening to mostly blues related stuff then and i still lean that way however that scene and song was highly contagious. when i got home i picked up the album and after repeated listenings i confirmed what i already knew. great album. with songs like dangerous,listen to your heart and the look it's almost a best of roxette. it's sounds  a bit 80ish now but it's still a good listen and anyone interested in roxette and wants to pick up a record of theirs then this is the one. great record.
B00005221L|4.0|PREDATOR is definitely a testosterone driven film, from its opening helicopter sequences to its brutal showdown at the end.  When I first saw this movie back in 1987, I was overwhelmed by its originality and felt it was very suspenseful.  I guess since we've come such a long way since then, my latest viewing awakened me to some of the film's major flaws:  it takes too long to have the Predator do his thing.  While I agree that not showing him builds suspense, too much time was spent on the guerilla battle.  It served to slow things down for me.  The addition of the female hostage was also bothersome in that she really didn't add anything to the film, and there was no reason to spare her when all the other guerillas bit the dust.  The soldiers are the stereotype of any kind of jungle/rescue mission movie, and Arnold's cigar chomping is getting old and redundant.  However, once the predator starts taking center stage, the movie regains its momentum and plays out well.  How did Arnold survive the nuclear blast at the end?  Where did the alien come from and why was he here?  These are the things that keep me from giving it a 5.
B000002L7V|2.0|This was a very dissapointing release from the little elf himself to me. Theres just no way he could follow up The Last in Line with this one. The songs sound like throwaways from the last album, i.e, filler. Vivian Campbell is in rare uninspired form (at least for his pre Def Leppard days) and the rest of the band just sounds tired. There are a few good songs, but they're few and far between. If you're a Dio fan who doesn't need everything and has the first two, skip this one and get Dream Evil instead.

Please go see this movie and support the creators so they can make more hilarious works of cinema

1558807381|5.0|This film is truly a homage to pure, undamaged, fairy-tale magic. Although created in the age before computer animation, it sends the viewer to a realm that is foreign but feels familiar - maybe because it lives deep in our unconscious - a world of magical creatures and unicorns and princesses, and, of course, Evil. In this bold Ridley Scott deviation, the craft of moviemaking and wild imagination combined bring to life our innermost fears and fantasies. As far as makeup, set, direction and technical special effects are concerned, this is a true work of art. Any trick of the trade we've seen in LOTR comes from here. The host of magical creatures and the extensive netherworld bring to mind the phantasmagorical images of Rheon Argonian's dream-world or the medieval illustrations to Dante's Hell by Alberto Rios. The Evil is pure evil. The Good is light and luminous. But the borders of light and darkness are blurred, like in any good fairy-tale. As far as cast is concerned, the characters seem to live in their skins. Cruise, the hero, is still very young here, and despite his later reputation is completely in his element: he is saving the world. And, the drama between His Satanic Lordship (Tim Curry) and the Princess (Mia Sara) is darkly captivating and emotionally charged in all sorts of directions... <BR>This film, strangely overlooked, sets the archetype in the genre of fantasy. It leaves an impression. It doesn't even require the viewer to suspend disbelief - the realm it portrays must be real, somewhere, somehow, simply because of the way it's made and because deep inside we believe in the basic, primal struggle of light and dark, of one life force with another. There is something beautiful and urgent and innocent in the simple facts of that enchanted world, in its fragility - its summer and light resting in the horn of a single unicorn. It is also deeply passionate, whether this passion drives one to save the world or to destroy it. <BR>In a word, if you've ever longed for the magical, even if it was long-ago when you were a kid and didn't learn yet to be scornful and cynical of emotions, this movie is for you. Enjoy it!
0393035158|4.0|Harris has a very hard task, namely, to argue to people who rely on faith for their big ideas that such reliance is futile and will spawn bad blood all around. Such people don't much listen to reason, so why would they suddenly listen to Harris's argument? Still, for the many who hover between reason and faith (and none can dispense with reason entirely) the book should nudge them away from trusting in faith, given its clear demonstration that faith is completely unreliable as a source of truth. (Why else are there over 4000 different religions in the USA alone?)

B00006L3LD|5.0|Well, the easiest way to describe this cd is to say that it's like a breath of fresh air. This isn't something I saw coming, I mean I know Incubus evolves and changes with each album, but this is a pretty big step in a new direction few have traveled. Where not many can succeed, Incubus does, and that's why they're definitely not your typical radio or MTV band. Some bands try to recreate the success of a big single, but Incubus builds on what they create, which isn't very usual these days. Brandon Boyd is truely a genius in my humble opinion, he has a flawless voice which he puts on display magnificently, his lyrics are heart felt and simply amazing. Mike, Chris, Dirk, and Jose are at the top of their game once again. They know when to be heavier, and when to be lighter, and they just fit Brandon's voice immaculately. There's not a thing about this cd that could be better.<br /><br />The DVD is also a treat, which shows Incubus really gives the fans what they want. It features behind the scenes footage (which is absolutely hilarious) and the Are You In? video (which is equally hilarious). This also contains a live version of Warning which shows how good the band is live.<br /><br />Some of the best songs on here are Nice To Know You, Wish You Were Here, Just A Phase, Warning, and Under My Umbrella. I recommend this cd to anyone and everyone. It has something for everybody.

They obviously don't know what they're listening to and might as well not even have ears. <br />Mr. Cincotti's second CD travels far beyond his first, and truly establishes his innate ability to make great music.

His piano playing is immpecable, and most surprisingly his songwriting is unique, melodic, and very powerful. <br />

B00005JNEI|5.0|I had never seen a Michael Moore movie and didn't know what to expect. While the film maker makes clear at the onset that Moore is biased against Bush, it is actual footage of President Bush that exposes himself to his own words, behavior and actions.  Moore poignantly handles the darker side of the war from a very personal perspective with the families and soldiers. He is very supportive of the plight of the soldiers and families and uses no trickery but rather employs the real words and footage, and its effect is very moving and powerful. Moore forces us to see the realities of President Bush's zealous march into Iraq, looking for the concocted WMDs. While parts of this movie were sad to see, others were outright funny. One sees the hilarity and hypocrisy of the pro-war Congressmen who wouldn't dare send their kids to the front line, never mind the fact that both Cheney & Bush did all they could to avoid seeing facing any real combat during the Nam war. Moore is brave to examine and question the rush to Iraq and showcase, those who stood to gain and the unfortunate who bore the real cost from this action. I'd highly recommend this film to all teenagers and adults.

B000063DFQ|4.0|Piece of Mind is one of Maiden's all-time great albums. Listed in chronological order as follows: <br />      Number of the Beast <br />      Piece of Mind <br />      Powerslave <br />      Seventh Son of a Seventh Son <br />      Brave New World <br />      Dance of Death <br />Maiden has really come back strong with their two latest albums, which are among their best. They equal or exceed Maiden's past albums, and signal the reawakening of Maiden's Golden Age. Long Live the Kings of Metal! <br /> <br />Adding to what the others have already said, Die With Your Boots On is a good song, but I hate the Eddie voice in it.  It deminishes the value of the song, with those few but vexacious words.  <br /> <br />In Where Eagles Dare, Maiden is again playing to their strengths (lyrics invovling: history, literature, movies). Where Eagle Dare is a good song overall, but is a little slow unfortunatly. <br /> <br />Possibly Maiden's greatest song, The Trooper,is another historical epic. It tells about the charge of the Light Brigade in Balaclava and has shredding riffs, and Dickinson's vocals are explosive. <br /> <br />Revelations proves, as others have said, Dickinson can write as well as use his crazy vocals to exhort Maiden to greatness. <br /> <br />Without Dickinson, Maiden still has a great sound.  However, lets face it, Blaze just sucks. X Factor and Virtual XI are horrible \\"Maiden Machine\\" churnouts, and Maiden needs Dickinson to thrive. That is why the albums Iron Maiden and Killers are not on my list of Maiden-album-greats.  <br />If you are new to Maiden, BUY THIS RECORD NOW! along with the others I have listed and you can't go wrong. If you have been a Maiden fan for some time, you have no excuse for not owning this record, BUY NOW! Seriously though, it is a great album regardless of what others have said. <br /> <br />AVE 93rd Highland Reg!!
B0001XALTG|4.0|This is one of the most imaginitive and visionary movies ever made.  Danny Boyle is a genius of filmmaking(28 Days Later is another good example) and this movie is no exception. <br />The story, based on the book by Irvine Welsh, is a somewhat random and only mildly interesting.  It's the cast, however, who really make this movie great.  Every character is wonderful.  Also, Johnny Lee Miller looks really hot in this film. <br />The characters bounce from withdrawel back to depravity throughout the movie and have various bad experiences along the way.(the dead baby, the death of Tommy) None of the characters are especially likeable but somehow seem to possess their own charm.   <br />This movie does not preach its message, and for some people the message is not clear.  This movie glorifies heroin in some ways but also gives a realistic depiction of the resulting depravity.  Anyone who watches Trainspotting will not be the same after they watch it.
B000002UTO|5.0|I was a huge fan of Duran Duran throughout the early '80s -- and I still have the posters and LPs to prove it! But after Andy and Roger left, I was a little saddened at the \\"ending of an era.\\" I thought \\"Notorious\\" was alright. When \\"Big Thing\\" was released, I didn't even rush out to buy it. A friend let me borrow his tape (it was the '80s!) after it had been out for around a year, and so I took it home and listened... and was thoroughly blown away and enchanted. And kicking myself that I waited so long to even give it a chance! The pop songs are great, but the ballads are just masterful. Even today, it's one of the CDs that I play often and never get tired of. One favorite is \\"Do You Believe in Shame?\\", which was released as a single, I believe, and also used in the movie *Tequila Sunrise* starring Mel Gibson, Kurt Russell, and Michelle Pfieffer (why do I remember this stuff??). But far and away, the songs that stick in my heart and my head are \\"Palomino\\" and \\"Land.\\" Beauty, heartache, loving, longing -- it's all there. Admittedly, Simon has quite a distinct voice, and just hearing it on any song makes me feel like a gawky teenager again (but in a good way). His vocals on these two songs especially make me appreciate his talents. And of course I'm beyond grateful to my friend for letting me borrow his tape in the first place, since I practically wore it out before I returned it. Luckily, CDs last much longer! <br />
B0001V6ZJ8|4.0|Most everyone who has given an online review of Moulin Rouge has noted the color and clarity of this DVD release, and I agree with the consensus, the picture quality is excellent. For some reason what seems to be overlooked is the SOUND QUALITY of the film. Apparently, the sound wasn't cleaned-up as best as it could have or was not given the attention it should have been given or there was nothing that could have been done. I tend to believe if closer attention was given to the audio it could have been better. Let's not forget besides viewing the film we also have to listen to it. Quite a few times I had to go back to watch a scene over to understand the dialogue. Hopefully next time around when MGM updates this DVD the'll take another crack at the audio. When it comes to buying CD's and DVD's, sometimes we will only get the best quality if we demand it. Video and Record executives have earned a reputation for taking shortcuts and it is up to consumers to hold them to a higher standard.
B00006FR47|4.0|This is one of the first albums I bought back in the day. I used to drop off to sleep listening to it with the speakers placed next to both ears.  It is pure 70's rock energy start to finish, nothing mediocre, all great.
B0000DZ3IG|2.0|I'm so disappointed two songs on the soundtrack.  The version of \\"All you need is love\\" is missing the horns, strings, and guitar that made the recessional scene in the movie so special.  Without the instruments it's just a bad cover of a Beatles song.  The second disappointment is \\"Christmas is all around\\"--in the movie it was sung with personality and verve--again missing from the soundtrack.  I feel cheated and to quote from Kevin Smith, \\"I want my $17.99 back!\\"   <br /> <br />
B0002VL0KQ|3.0|I have always been a fan of Celine, and I grew up listenning to her.  I found out about 2 months ago that sometime in mid October, Celine was going to release some sort of project cd with Anne Geddes.  When I found out more, I got interested.  It seemed like such a special way for her thought and love for babies to be exposed.  When I bought the cd, I brought it home immediately to put it in the cd player.  When I pushed play, I was somewhat pleased, but somewhat dissapointed.  This cd is different from all of her others.  This cd is soft with gentle melodies, and has no heart pounding or extreme energy songs.  Lullaby styles make it very unique but also get somewhat repetative.    I liked her Let's Talk About Love cd the best out of all her cds I've heard.  I saw someone comment on how this cd is similar to it, but I disagree.  There's not much I can say except, this cd is okay... definitely worth buying, but don't pack up your other Celine cds.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I can honestly say that this is the first movie in a decade in which I've cried from laughing so hard. This brilliant comedy uses the medium of puppets to convey the stupidity of Hollywood conventions and, of course, the idiocy of the typical A-List Hollywood actor. Anyone who is offended my the rantings of Michael Moore or Sean Penn NEEDS to see this movie.
B00005JNJ7|3.0|This movie was extremely inventive and entertaining at times, but the attempt to get the world record for crudeness was silly and immature.  In other words, Middle Schoolers and low-achieving adults will flock to this movie in droves!  The Pornographic doll sex, the puke (again!!!), and the record-breaking use of all types of vulgarity just wasn't for me. I did enjoy seeing all my favorite liberal movie star/political activists die horrible deaths, though, and the Kim Jung Il puppet was outstanding so this wasn't an entire waste of my money.

Axl may have been kinda rough <br />on the edges, but the fact remains he still is one of the best of the best to ever hold a mic. Slash, that is a name that haunts Jimmi Hendrix in the grave. Slash is a force to be seen. <br />One of, no \\"the\\" best to strum a 6-string. the rest were lengends in themselves. some die-hard GnR fans say they don't <br />like the album because the GUNS didn't make a cent off of it. <br />But when you give a review of an album you don't take points away because the band didn't make $ off of it. You don't look at <br />that, you also do not look at if they were cover tunes or not. <br />You look at how well they were composed. Every single on there <br />is mastery of the instument and voice. If it were me, 2 or 3 songs would have been changed. but to a die hard GUNS fan like  <br />me the could have sang yankee doodle and it would have been a <br />smash hit. Some have put down this album but praised Axl's  <br />Chinese Democracy, in which only Axl of the original GnR is  <br />present.

B0002Z0EYK|1.0|This is the most disappointing film I've ever seen this year! Brad Pitt was completely wrong for the role of Achilles. I laughed whenever Orlando Bloom is on a scene (and this is not a comedy); he has exactly ONE facial expression throughout the film, that of perpetual surprise. It's a good thing that Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean were in the movie, they redeemed it somehow in my opinion.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I guess I must be one of those \\"intelligensia\\" another reviewer referred to. <br /> <br />After watching this flick half-way through, I pretty much caught the gist of it and walked out.  It is my opinion that if this film is not overtly anti-Semitic, it implies that attitude.  Also, I was troubled that in this film, there was not a lot of context regarding Jesus' life and teachings beyond the 12 hours of Passion-related events leading to His  death. <br /> <br />Am I being too critical regarding the implied anti-Semitic elements and lack of context?  May I mention a couple of other things:  During Holy Week of 2004, there were two acts of vandalism perpetrated against a Jewish synagogue near where I live.  The synagogue had never experienced vandalism before.  It is the opinion of the clergy there, as well as that of Christian clergy at nearby parishes, that the Gibson movie may have influenced some young folks to commit the vandalism. <br /> <br />In addition, there was an article in the L.A. Times about the \\"Passion.\\"  The article mentioned a poll of young people who went to see the \\"Passion.\\"  Many of these young people indicated that after seeing the film, they tended to have a more negative view of Jewish people.   <br /> <br />Of course, this does not mean that every young person who sees this film will go out and vandalize a synagogue.  Surely, Mr. Gibson would be quite upset about such acts being perpetrated against any religious institution.  However, this does bring up the issue of responsibility in producing art, and in providing context when telling an emotionally-charged story like \\"Passion.\\"   <br /> <br />
0446614459|4.0|for a person's life to change? Baldacci's answer is a split second as the premise of his introductory novel with secret service agents Sean King and Michelle(sorry blanked on last name). Sean King was guarding Presidential canditate Ritter in a Hotel when he was momentarily distracted leading to an assasin's bullet downing his principal and ending his Secret Service career.<br /><br />Eight years later an error in judgement led to the kidnapping of another Presidential candidate that Michelle was guarding leading to her career likewise turning towards a downward spiral.  Michelle turns to the now lawyerly King for help in finding her candidate.<br /><br />That plot summary was not as sharp as others but I am more concerned reviewing the actual writing in this case than writing a synopsis that could compete with others;)<br /><br />I think the first half of this novel is Baldacci's best since Total Control. His characterizations could be two dimensional save for being penned by an author who clearly imagines who these people are and expresses them very clearly to the reader. Reading it a mini-movie ran in my head complete with casting(I won't burden you with my casting choices lol), suffice to say I felt the characterization of the main characters exceptional. The plotting throughout the first half was well done, not too fast but I didn't find it plodding either in fact I found it quite gripping turning the pages as Baldacci dropped clues and several red herrings onto the readers' lap. There was an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust I found a key ingredient in Baldacci's best working novels. Furthermore there was a wry humour throughout this work and I found myself often grinning at the dialogue and even snickering at the line;\\"there are over a million lawyers in America, no wonder the country's so screwed up.\\" Also I found parts of this novel to be possibly interpreted as being very tongue in cheek poking fun at particular constituents and conspirists who still have not found the other gun man from the grassy knoll yet.<br /><br />That was the good. Now onto the bad, and ugly.<br /><br />The last quarter I would only give 2-1/2 to 3 stars to at most. The pacing sped up sure which was a positive and negative as the only possible redeeming feature of the \\"villian\\" who in the first 3/4 was clever and interesting, but when revealed became as I think another reviewer mentioned a caricature. I however interpreted this bad guy to be very Moriatiesque (or however you would say like Holme's Dr. Moriarty.) which at least made me forgive a little about the whole ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel a lot reading it very quickly and anxiously awaiting HOUR GAME to follow up on these characters. It is not Baldacci's best but not his worst either. A strange amagamation between the two.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Finally something out of Hollywood that says what most Americans are thinking. Thank you Parker and Stone. Thank you so much. I can't wait to get the soundtrack.
B00001W9G0|4.0|When Carrie and the girls waxed enthusiastically about \\"The Way We Were\\" in an episode of HBO's \\"Sex in the City\\", I realized what a touchstone this movie has become for many who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Over thirty years have elapsed since its initial release, and it's easy to forget what a massive challenge director Sydney Pollack had in making this movie. Primarily he had to harness the elephantine personality of Barbra Streisand, then the most powerful female movie star, within a period movie that was designed to provide an incisive look at the McCarthy-era witch hunts. Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances, still her best onscreen work. She was also lucky to have veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents write such a strong, multi-dimensional character in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinee idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling.<br /><br />In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. I particularly like the intimate caf&eacute; scene where Hubbell announces to Katie that his article has just been published and later on when she cajoles him to stay for dinner and rattles on in typical Streisand rat-a-tat fashion about how she spent all her ration stamps on steaks and baked potatoes. Her look of realized humiliation afterward is priceless. She also handles her showcase scenes well, for instance, at the radio station when Hubbell concedes that the relationship is impossible to continue and later when Katie begs Hubbell to come over to help her sleep. I realize I was being manipulated by only-in-Hollywood, Oscar-baiting gesticulations, but the scenes somehow work regardless.<br /><br />When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles. But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, \\"The Way We Were: A Look Back\\". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures.<br /><br />Despite its narrative disconnect in the last third, I still love this movie, and it does deserve its place among the great screen romances. The evocative music along with the overplayed title tune certainly adds to its impact. It's just that it doesn't belong in a sub-category of films that deal seriously with the Communist red scare. The DVD transfer is good though not exceptional, and for diehard fans of the movie, the well done documentary seems essential.res.

B00005JNJ7|5.0|This should be required viewing for anyone who believes that Hollywood Liberals are speaking for the rest of America.  This movie desimates people like Alec Baldwin and Michael Moore, who are socialist wannabes. <br /> <br />Team America is the funniest, most politcally incorrect, and offensive movie since Blazing Saddles.  The puppet sex will have you rolling your seat.  The minute-long puppet puking scene will have you falling out of your seat.

B0002MB7QW|3.0|Ok as with most of Roland's movies the premise is great yet mid-way through one can see not much thought was put into it.  For example:<br />  An Alien civilization that is capable of travelling Light years, has a fleet of ships that is capable of destroying cities with a beam, has a force field that can withstand bombs, and their first intent?  DESTROY NEW YORK CITY!!!!  But wait the Earth and Mankind is saved by a drunken pilot and lo and behold Jeff Goldblum who infects their super computer with a laptop running Windows 95!!!  Ok waste of $$$ Maybe next time?<br /><br />  OH NO!!!  A Lizard that is made by nuclear tests (Godzilla) and what does he decide to destroy?  Ummm NEW YORK CITY maybe?<br /><br />Well the only saving grace for Roland thus far was The Patriot.  So he did good with that one.  But this movie The Day After Tomorrow brings him back down.<br /><br />Ok it is a good idea.  Global Warming and the destruction of yes you guessed it... NEW YORK CITY.  What is wrong with Roland and New York?  But it gets better.  You have snow in India ok... skull crushing hail in Japan that happens during a common thunderstorm ummm ok...and tornadoes in Los Angeles that just happens to tear down the Hollywood sign...ummmmmmm ok.  But the storms grow to epic sizes and a wave comes in off the Atlantic Ocean.  Now stay with me here.  The Statue of Liberty is 305 feet from the ground to the tip of the torch, the wave that came in was about 50 feet below the torch.  Let us give Roland the benefit of the doubt and say the wave is 200 feet high.  Moves in towards New York from the Statue to NYC in a few seconds and this distance and this distance is approximately 1/2 a mile.  It reaches Manhattan and takes about 5 minutes to get mid way up the Island of NYC but gives Jake just enough time to save his girl and get in the Public Libraary (even though the wall of water is about 2 blocks away).  Oh I forgot to mention the escape of the computer wolves.<br /><br />  Jake calls his father to see what he can do and although he is in a huge area of the library they act as if he can not swim out of the little area he is on the phone with his father as the water floods in.<br />(Now the part that made this movie a comedy in my opinion)  The cold that can freeze you solid in a few seconds.  This sounds as outlandish as the starving, badly made, escapee wolves that are out for blood after a few hours of freedom.  I am sorry for being technical and scientific but I do not know of a temperature on Earth cold enough to freeze clothed, warm blooded life in a matter of seconds.  But we are told this by the same guy that wants us to believe that Will Smith can knock out and kill an Alien with one punch.<br /><br />  ANYWAY!  Jake is chased by the all enveloping ice that is closing in on him from all directions with the exception of the path he is on.  Quaid finds him under the frozen ocean that... wait, how does 200 feet of water freeze instantly before the really cold air hits?  OH it must have been the 180 inches of precipitation that fell overnight?  Yes the 15 feet of snow that fell in Europe tells about how 200 feet of water can freeze instantly before the air is cold enough to freeze people instantly.  It has to get better right?<br /><br />  WAIT!  IS THAT IT?  It is over?  Astronauts on a space station see that the clouds are breaking up?  That is it?  Well Roland once again dropped the ball on what could have been an epic movie.  What can he ruin the next time?<br /><br />  Hey Roland if you are reading this how about this: Evolution gave Lizards, and Mammals a shot at living and they failed.  So now it is time for the Insects.  Due to over population in humans our food supplies run short and a virus breaks out.  We are so closely cramped the virus spreads like wildfire.  The insects eat the humans and grow exponentially from all of the meat.  From eating human brains they gain the ability to think.  They grow to epic proportions about 100 feet in length and decide to fly inland from the Atlantic ocean.  First stop?  Come on need I say?  New York City!  Flying in from they pass the Statue of Liberty at over 300 MPH in a swarm never seen before.  They reach lower Manhattan in one second but the hero sees them come in and runs away to safety just as the insects take their sweet time covering land.  His job was to work at the CDC and he was working on a vaccine made from spider venom.  He then flies an Apache Helicopter that he found in a junkyard to spread the vaccine that will do two things: Kill the insects AND save mankind!  Give me a call Roland ok?  Have your people contact my people and we can work on yet another ridiculous plot.  Or how about Aliens that can be invisible yet come to a planet (unprotected) that is 75% water even though the Water kills,,, oh wait another one that ruins ideas already ruined that one.<br /><br />Over all movie is good up to when the freezing starts.

B00005JNEI|5.0|You have to admire the Bushphiles. Despite the almost weekly barrage of negative news reports, Govt. reports, Book releases and even movie releases, depicting a President that is woefully over his head, these supporters are as rock solid, \\"steadfast\\" if you will, in their faith of Bush as many of them are in their fundamental faith of God.<br /><br />Is this good? Well maybe. It shows character but it also infers a certain amount of innocence. President Bush could be characterized as \\"steadfast\\". Well, Merriam-Webster defines \\"steadfast\\" thusly, firmly fixed in place : IMMOVABLE b : not subject to change. As you can see being \\"steadfast\\" depending on application can be a good or bad thing. Let's look at a related word \\"intransigence\\" refusing to compromise or to abandon an extreme position or attitude : UNCOMPROMISING b : IRRECONCILABLE. To the Bushphobes, this word describes President Bush more accurately. If you are a Bushphile have you really checked the overwhelming amount of unfavorable independent information coming forth. Have you read or viewed any of the less than positive information available regarding our President, have you seen Fahrenheit 9/11?<br /><br />Fahrenheit 9/11<br /><br />In a surreal scene, our President, G.W. Bush is reading a book to a class of first graders in a Florida elementary school. After having been told that an airplane had hit a World Trade Center Tower in New York previously, George went into the classroom as not to keep these six and seven year olds waiting. While in the classroom, he is informed by a subordinate, that a second plane has hit the other tower. Does George excuse himself stating that he has an emergency to attend too? No, George sits there, sometimes reading \\"My Pet Goat\\", sometimes staring off, for almost SEVEN MINUTES!<br /><br />Michael Moore's controversial film begins by rehashing the equally controversial and extremely polarizing 2000 Presidential election. Though rushing through the Florida shenanigans, making some interesting points but with time restraints barely touching on the variety of previously reported inconsistencies.<br /><br />From there, Moore moves on to the 9/11 catastrophe itself and thankfully, he tastefully refrains from showing actual footage of the disaster instead concentrating on bystanders reactions, generally showing people looking up but resisting the temptation to go there with the camera.<br /><br />Then, in the previously mentioned schoolroom scene, Moore suggests that maybe the President is reflecting upon his missteps, such as not having at least one meeting with his own head of counterterrorism or not reading the briefing of Aug 6, 2001 stating al Qeada intended to attack the United States soon by hijacking airplanes.<br /><br />Michael Moore goes on to characterize other facets of previous and following events which, in his and my opinion, illustrate the questionable actions of the President and or his staff.<br /><br />Moore indicates that in each of G.W.'s failed business ventures he had Saudi and even the bin Laden family financial backing, which in Moore's opinion have extended a dark Bush/Saudi/bin Laden alliance, ultimately the reason 142 Saudis including bin Laden family members being rushed out of the United States after Sept. 13th.<br /><br />But Moore's real salvos are reserved for the ill conceived, ill planned and ultimately unnecessary invasion of Iraq. This segment starts out with White House, counterterrorism chief, Richard Clark basically saying the Bush administration wanted to and planned to invade Iraq from before they took office and that Afghanistan and al-Qeada were an inconvenient diversion. Of course Moore extrapolates that for his case that Bush marginalized the continuing hunt for bin Laden to gear up for the now infamous Bush War.<br /><br />But hey, I'm giving away too much of this fascinating movie. See It!<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Michael Moore is truly in his element as he excoriates the clueless G.W. Bush. This movie reminds me of a roast except for this recipient, the jibes are real and not in fun, however, there are indeed many humorous moments albeit satirical in nature.<br /><br />My favorite humorous part was when Moore initially depicted a burning map of Afghanistan set to the theme song from the popular TV show, Bonanza, then showing the cast (G.W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfield and Tony Blair) dressed in Bonanza style cowboy attire.<br /><br />Of course, the Bush clan paints this movie as a pack of scurrilous lies with no basis in truth but then, why does it jive with the facts I do know and why does it have a conspicuous ring of truth?<br /><br />Back to our Bushphiles. If you intend to vote for G.W. but haven't seen or read anything negative about the President, at least see this movie. This is the most important presidential election I can remember in forty years. If you see this movie and still want to vote for Bush, fine I can live with that.

B0002DB50E|5.0|This is arguably one of Cronenberg's best works but definately darker stuff (even for our beloved Canadian) and not for everyone.  Basically, with this film you'll either love it and see it as visionary or hate it and think it's excessive.  Of course since I'm rating it five stars, I think it's the former.<br /><br />With that said, the interface/menu on this is one of the best Criterion has done on any title, past or present.  I'm thinking based off of this latest, they should take care of all of Cronenberg's films (The Fly and Crash could definately use the Criterion treatment).  The VHS/DVD Videodrome transfer wasn't bad before by any means, but this is definately as good as you're gonna get.  As far as the supplementals, they're subpar...I think they could've done better.  There is, however, a nice set of vintage trailers which is probably NOT how you'd expect them to market Videodrome (though to Universal's credit, this would be tough to market today as well).<br /><br />Overall, if you've read this far go ahead and pay the thirty-bucks for this great great film...it's worth it!
B00000JMQE|5.0|It would be impossible to find anything that would hold a candle to the original Wizard of OZ so I was not expecting much when I bought this DVD but I absolutely loved it!!! The graphics were just awesome and you get to see other areas of the magical OZ that we all loved in the original movie and the writers were very creative with this. There was no singing in this movie so don't expect a musical.<br /><br />To put it short, Dorothy is now in therapy because she can't sleep and no one will believe her when she talks about her adventure on OZ. Her aunt takes her to the doctor who wants to give her shock therapy and as he is just about to do it, a storm knocks the power off and this is where the adventure begins.<br /><br />Dorothy runs away from the hospital with help from a new found friend and winds up in OZ. Nothing is as it was, the yellow brick road is all broken up and the emerald city is in ruins. What happened and where is everybody??? Well Dorothy finds out and takes us on quite a good adventure where we run into talking rocks, a queen who changes heads as we would change clothes, a population of wheelers, an awesome looking pumpkinheaded being, a different looking tin man, a sweet chicken and a bunch of other wonderfully created beings.<br /><br />I wish they made more movies like this.

It builds a plot <br />like building a 3,000 piece Lego masterpiece.  What <br />an ending!  To me, it wasn't predicatble...probably <br />because I am naive when it comes to psychotic <br />killers...I don't know that many - LOL!   <br /> <br />Anyway, let me share a couple of things with you.  <br />First, I won't give away the meaning of the title <br />\\"Se7en\\".  You will discover that very shortly into the <br />film.   <br /> <br />But let me quote a couple of the lines from the film: <br /> <br />\\"About the only thing we know about that guy right now <br />is that he is independently wealthy, well educated, <br />and TOTALLY INSANE.\\"   <br /> <br />\\"...because he's John Doe by choice.\\" <br /> <br />The maniac in this film is \\"completing his <br />masterpiece.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Lord works in mysterious ways.\\"   <br /> <br />With that, \\"Se7en\\" gets a resounding 6 on a scale of <br />1-5 (5 being the highest) in the psycho thriller  <br />genre.  I purchased the New Line Platinum Series with <br />a second DVD with supplemental material.  It contains <br />alternate endings which I haven't watched yet...but <br />I'm sure they'll be a treat.   <br /> <br />As Halloween approaches, it's the time of year to <br />watch \\"Se7en.\\"  You'll never read Chaucer with the <br />same understanding ever again.  Brad Pitt and Morgan <br />Freeman (the rookie meets the seasoned veteran) are well cast as determined and crafty detectives.  Don't miss <br />it.   <br /> <br />Count to \\"Se7en\\" and buy this DVD.  You'll watch it more than once.  It is a blood-curdling masterpiece.
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I really wanted to like this album.  I am not moved by it; I don't love it and I'm disappointed with it.  There are only one or two songs that particularly stand out to me.  The rest blend together way too much. <br /> <br />So many of the sounds are the same - the piano, the tempo, the \\"dreamy\\" guitars... I swear it almost put me to sleep on a long road trip.  I swore off listening to it for several months.  Having put it back on in my car (dangerous, yes, I know - considering the road trip) for several rotations of listening to the words, I still remain unimpressed.  For me, everything between tracks 1 and 10 are filler.  Train Wreck is the next closest song to stand out, but so many of the songs just feel like filler.   <br /> <br />I don't feel that she was particularly inspired when it came to composition, if she was for the lyrics.
B00028HBKM|4.0|OK PEOPLE, WHAT IS ALL THIS TALK ABOUT HOW VIOLENT THIS MOVIE IS? GIVE ME A BREAK THE MOVIE WASN'T  ALL THAT VIOLENT WITH ALL THE VIOLENCE AND KILLING ON THE NEWS YOU THINK YOU PEOPLE COULD HANDLE SOME IN A MOVIE. PLUS, IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN JESUS, GOD OR YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE BIBLE MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH THE MOVIE, A COUPLE OF YOU MADE COMMENTS ABOUT JESUS'S LIFE LIKE IT WAS FICTION IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE WHY WATCH IT ! TAKE THE MOVIE FOR WHAT IT WAS A MOVIE ABOUT THE LAST MOMENTS OF JESUS CHRIST'S LIFE AND HIS ATTEMPT 2 SAVE OUR SOULS. I MEAN THE MOVIE WASN'T THAT BAD, BUT IT WASN'T EARTH SHATTERING EITHER, SPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW THE STORY FROM THE BIBLE.
B0000DZ3EA|3.0|I just discovered this CD and was looking forward to ordering, but.... <br /> <br />After reading some of the reviews by other PG fans I cannot but wonder why most of these Greatest Hits repackingings have such miserable editing.  Also, various undeserving songs are added that only seem to be a terrible attempt to represent a balance of material over a career.  \\"Hit\\" should be just that, a collection of hits!  Loyal fans want our favorite songs, not edited versions crammed onto 2 cd's.  Recent hits collections by Pink Floyd and The Rolling Stones made the same mistakes. <br /> <br />These record companies are after our money, but if they just gave us what we want, I for one would more readily part with my hard-earned cash.  This trend will not end if we just accept these awful collections.  Most companies will turn out other collections later (or did so earlier), so as to 'milk' their cash cows. <br /> <br />Sorry for the rant, but that's how I see it.
0446605409|5.0|This was a great read, I mean just wow. I could literally not put it down, causing my friends to inquire just how good this book really was. I had my friends read it and they said it was a great book and had a great main character (John Corey). As an aspiring writer, I'm usually skeptical of the books I read and the authors I choose. I originally thought this book was going to be about Plum Island and a mystery having to do with biological scientific fact. What I later discovered was there was more to this book than just that. A great murder mystery, lovable and hatable characters, non-stop action, and a nearly perfect beginning, middle, and end. Nelson Demille is truly a spectacular author.
B0000CAXID|5.0|I got this album way back when it first came out and that was when I was in grade 7. Of course, cassette tapes still existed back then so I got my copy in that format. I already knew the lead singer David Grohl from Nirvana and since I listened to an immense amount of Nirvana CDs, I thought this might be a nice touch. The sound is very different and done in a hardcore alternative fashion which is very pleasing since I always wondered what happened to alternative music when it seemed to have faded during the time. I loved every song on this album and now label it as a certified classic. My favourite songs are \\"I'll stick around,\\" \\"Big me,\\" \\"Good Grief,\\" \\"Floaty,\\" \\"Oh, George\\" and \\"Exhausted.\\" If you don't have this album yet, you should pick it up before any other Foo Fighters record. I still play this from time to time to recollect some good memories and for nostalgia purpose.
B000007T2Z|3.0|So what do we have here? Only 3 tracks for my $15, what was I thinking? Actually, the three tracks come in at over 1 hour of music.<br /><br />If you like the 3.5 minute catchy pop ditty then I'd probably give this CD a body swerve. GYBE weave everything from bagpipes to sampling some crazy dude shouting through their tracks to come up with something unlike most other bands.<br /><br />The question is, does it work? The honest answer is yes and no. Track 3 (Providence) comes in at 29 minutes long and, to me, that's too long. East Hastings is the best track but even then, it's more like 3 songs rather than one. A portion of it is used to great effect in the Brit zombie flick 28 days later.<br /><br />But it, listen to it and make up your own mind.
B00028HBKM|3.0|\\"But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed for our inequities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.\\" <br /> <br />- Isaiah 53:5 <br /> <br />This disturbing movie explores two themes.  The first theme is introduced by the quotation from Isaiah, above, which opens the movie.  As Reinhold Niebuhr has emphasized, God's love is suffering love.  Rather than destroy evil, God takes evil upon himself.  Because of the magnitude of evil in the world, Jesus' suffering had to be immense.  This suffering is the main focus of the Passion of the Christ, and the violence and malice directed at Jesus reach almost unimaginable proportions.   <br /> <br />The second theme is a struggle between supernatural forces.  Director Mel Gibson believes that Satan is real, and he has spoken of himself in the past, when he was separated from God, as a \\"monster.\\"  Thus, Jesus' suffering is seen as a struggle between Satan and his forces, on one hand, and God and Jesus, on the other.   <br /> <br />The movie emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal man.  The night before his crucifixion, on the Mount of Olives, he is afraid, and we observe his life as a man - not an ordinary man, but a man, nonetheless - through many flashbacks of him working as a carpenter, exchanging tenderness with his mother, interceding to save the life of an adulteress, and preaching the gospel. <br /> <br />In the last scene, we witness Christ's resurrection, which Gibson presents as a physical event.  In Christ's face, we see his appreciation of what he has accomplished through his suffering on the cross.  While he still has the form of the man, it is an idealized form.  He still bears the wounds of his crucifixion, but they have been transformed and cleaned.   <br /> <br />Some have seen indications of anti-Semitism in this movie; I saw none.  The Pharisees bring Jesus before the civil authorities but he suffers most directly at the hands of Roman soldiers.  I would also say that the Romans were portrayed as being more depraved and uncivilized than the Jews. <br />
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Team America is hilarious.  The humor is the perfect mix of obscene slapstick and, well, obscene satire.  Everything being a potential target, Trey and Matt manage to keep the film surprisingly apolitical.  The only political figures in the movie are Michael Moore, Kim Jong Il, and Alec Baldwin; other than those three, anyone else who sees this movie, knowing the record of its producers, should not be offended.  The humor is amazingly creative.  The house-cat panthers, the original songs, the fact that a feature length film is entirely done by marionette alone, the list goes on and on.
B000060MMI|5.0|This is a great drinking album.  No, really, I know it sounds silly, but it's true.  It's great for other stuff too, though.  :)  I guess I'm a little biased since they happen to be one of my all time favorite bands, but honestly, this album is awesome.  I bought it the day it came out and I'm still not tired of it.  \\"Cruel Mistress\\" is one of my favorites from this one.  It's sort of pirate-y, mutiny on the high seas, swashbuckler sounding.  (If that makes any sense, which it probably doesn't.  It's just a fun song.)  Buy it.  It's well worth your money.
B000068R1X|1.0|I'm an Ozzy fan,(Thank you Bob Daisley) and when I lost my Bark at the Moon Cd. I bought the remastered version, played part of Bark at the Moon and in the trash it went. Then I was talked into giving it another try so I bought another remastered Bark at the Moon. I listened to the whole song and gave that CD away.<br /><br />  I think this remastered stuff sucks. It's different musicians trying to play the originals. This gives Ozzy the profits and he doesnt have to share with the original band members. Then to make up for this fact they add a couple of songs most people hadnt heard before. Even the songs that are added to make the purchase of these remastered Cds (all of Ozzy CDs) seem like a deal, are pretty old. They are great songs But I had \\"B\\" side recorded back in 1979 /1980.<br /><br />  If you are a die hard Ozzy fan who loves the originals, Look around and buy the \\"original\\" recording. Ive bought them on Amazon used in \\"new\\" or \\"like new\\" condition and they are perfect.
B00028HBKM|3.0|It's difficult to rate a film in which a segment of filmgoers will find great meaning, while, for the rest of us it is, it is 2 hours of pointless tedium. \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a gutsy but lackluster attempt to dramatize the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, from his prayers at Gethsemane until his death on the cross. It is a heavily embellished account -so much so that it is doubtful that it could all happen within 12 hours. This is really a \\"bring your own context\\" film. Those who don't know the story of Jesus' life won't be able to make heads or tails of \\"The Passion\\". The character of Mary Magdelene (Monica Bellucci), for example, gives the impression of being Jesus' sister, or perhaps another family member, not his follower. And Jesus (Jim Caviezal), himself, impresses as harmless and probably crazy when taken out of context, not as a credible threat to Jewish orthodoxy. We never see the intelligence or charisma that made this man legendary. The film is subtitled. All characters speak in dubiously accented Latin and/or Aramaic. But the facility with which the actors work in languages that they don't speak is interesting. -As are the film's colors. Actually, the colors are quite dull, but many scenes have an overwhelming blue or, more commonly, brown tone. The most notable aspect of \\"The Passion\\" is its haunting, prominently featured score by John Debney. The fact that \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a spiritual  inspiration for some of its audience is proof of its cinematic value, however. In order to arouse the emotions of its audience, a film must be doing something right for some people.<br /><br />Much of \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" has the quality of a vivid dream sequence. Its flashbacks, bizarre devil imagery, haunting soundtrack, long silences, and strange color casts give the impression of something that is not to be taken literally. There is meticulous attention to historical accuracy in some things, while in other matters  accuracy is inexplicably flaunted: Jewish children wearing skull caps, nails driven into hands instead of wrists, an unrealistic time frame, Jesus and Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) conversing in Latin, Monica Bellucci is old enough to be Mary Magdalene's mother, and she too often uncovers her flowing hair in public. Modern films are held to pretty high standards for historical accuracy in their appearance, although not in the behavior of characters. So it puzzled me that director Mel Gibson fell down on minor points that would not have detracted from the film in any way had they been more accurate, when he went so far as to have the characters speaking their native languages. Gibson, true to form, exaggerated the violence beyond what is described in the Gospels. There are only about 13 minutes of intense violence in the film, but it is presented for maximum effect. \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is highly impressionistic in that it depicts and, indeed, extrapolates the elements of Jesus' last day on Earth that have meaning for screenwriters Benedict Fitzgerald and Mel Gibson, as manifested in their imaginations.<br /><br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\"s opening sequence isn't its best, but it illustrates one reason  the film fell flat for me. The scene of Jesus imploring God to spare him in Gethsemane is entirely blue and so melodramatic that I could do nothing but laugh, I'm afraid. Of course this is a matter of interpretation and style. But people don't really act like that. It was a sign of more melodrama to come. \\"The Passion\\"s melodrama is so heavy that it made me apathetic to even the most extreme suffering. It places the film's emotions beyond a realistic plane. A lot of the audience, Christians included, will find Jesus' behavior bewildering. He seems to deliberately incriminate himself before the Pharisees and all but asks for more torture from the Romans. He invites suffering, as if he were a masochist. All I can say is that the film is thoroughly Athanasian. To make a long story short for those who don't know, Athanasian Christianity emphasized the suffering of God, in the form of Jesus, to redeem the souls of humans. It was adopted as Christian orthodoxy in the 4th century. The emphasis on suffering is diminished in Protestant and many modern Catholic practices. But if Athanasian Christianity is your thing, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is your movie. Whether mainline Christians will appreciate \\"The Passion\\"s theology is another matter. The implication that someone deserves to have his eye pecked out because he mocked Jesus demonstrates a different value system entirely from \\"Forgive them. They know not what they do.\\" Ultimately, I found the monotonous persecution of one man for 2 hours to be, frankly, boring.<br /><br />The DVD: The are no bonus features, but there is an optional commentary for the visually impaired. A narrator recounts everything that happens on screen, including descriptions of the camera perspective, for the entire film. He even reads the credits. It's eloquent and  well-done. The default language is Latin/Aramaic/Hebrew with English subtitles. But Spanish subtitles and English captioning for the hearing impaired are also available.ho don't know, Athanasian Christianity emphasized the suffering of God, in the form of Jesus, to redeem the souls of humans.

B000001GBJ|5.0|This album is mostly instrumental, which I love. The peaceful, serene music relaxes me after a stressful day at work. Great music to listen to at bedtime, too.

B00005JMJG|1.0|Please - save your money! <br /> <br />If you like overly trite relationship \\"humor\\" overborne with \\"deep\\" thought, and pseudo stoner intellect (pseudo as in, If you never have, this is how you think it would be) this movie is for you.   <br /> <br />If you prefer subtle humor, with actual interest, go with something sortof funny - like Kill BIll (which I didn't like). <br />Calling this a comedy is like calling Fahrenheit 911 a documentary (read - factual). <br /> <br />This is without a doubt the worst Jim Carrey movie, and probably the worst so-called \\"Best\\" movie I have ever seen.  It moved so slowly it made \\"Howard's End\\" seem like the first \\"Indiana Jones\\".  Perhaps the critics who loved this smoked a couple of rocks to get them through the fast moving first hour, and then got a speed ball refresher to make it through the utterly lifeless middle. <br /> <br />I watch movies to get away, if you want to watch an overborne, melodramatic comedy with albiet good talent in the acting, then you *might* like this.  Buyer beware,  I have never seen anything almost as unwatchable.  If you think this is funny, then seek professional help. <br /> <br />

6300214435|4.0|The scene opens in Shanghai, where incredibly sexy Wilhelmina (Willie) Scott (Kate Kapshaw) leads a stunning cabaret dance, only to be stolen by Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) , together with a very precious diamond, and an airplane, from a very powerful Chinese Mafia boss. All with the help of Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) , a streetwise little Chinese boy (with a very irritating voice!) , surely based on Chang from the Tin Tin books.<br /><br />They land, seemingly by chance in a poverty-stricken Indian village, where all the children have been stolen away by a savage Thugee cult of Death. From there it is on to the Pankot Palace, before our friends descend into the pits of the hellish Temple of Doom, where they must rescue the poor enslaved children. Plenty of suspense and action, some quite gory scenes, comedy, and of course the romance between Indy and Willie, who really looked sexy in that outfit she was wearing when they came out of the mines.<br />Not quite the masterpiece that Raiders of the Lost Ark was, but most of the time it was entertaining.<br /><br />Although the scene in the cocoa pans , in the pits,  did really drag on , and what happened to that cute little Maharaja in the end?
B000002U82|5.0|If you're bored one day, try this with this album and The Wizard of Oz. Start the movie, and when the MGM lion roars for the third time, start playing the album. Turn the sound off on the tv, and listen how the lyrics go along with the movie. For example, when the evil lady who turns out to be the witch is trying to take Toto away, the lyrics mention, \\"the dog days\\" and the tone of the music gets more tense. When Dorothy runs away and goes to the magician's cart, he tells her to go home, and the lyrics say, \\"Home, home again <br />I like to be here when I can <br />And when I come home cold and tired <br />It's good to warm my bones beside the fire <br />Far away across the field <br />The tolling of the iron bell <br />Calls the faithful to their knees <br />To hear the softly spoken magic spells\\" <br />Magic spells, as in the wizard, and going \\"home again\\". <br /> <br />Very interesting. Is it a coincidence?
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore has added his name to the long, growing list of \\"fast-buck\\" artists all looking to cash in on the latest publishing craze this year: \\"Bush Bashing!\\"  (Right along with Bob \\"Plan of Attack\\" Woodward and a host of others!)  Is is beyond belief and the height of arrogance that Moore would have the adacity to suggest that his film should be entered in the \\"Best Picture\\" category at next year's Oscars!  9-11 is not even a \\"documentary\\" but rather an \\"editorial!\\"  Pure and simple!  The film's obvious bias and slant were pre-determined long before Moore ever loaded his cameras.  This is not the truth but rather some very seletive Propaganda by a man with his own agenda, his own personal axe to grind!  (And as Hitler once said, \\"The bigger the lie, the more people will believe it!\\")  To date the Disney-funded film has grossed about half a billion dollars.  If Moore cares so much about the things he accuses the President of, then perhaps he'd like to donate some of that windfall profit to paying down the national deficit!  At the very least he might at least get a shave and a haircut, and hire a personal \\"trainer\\" to help him trim down his bulging bodyframe!  Now that would be money better spent than on the cost of any of Moore's DVDs or books...any of them!!
B000001FI7|4.0|Although this genre of music will not sell well at radio stations and party functions, trip-hop definitely stands out when one wants a relaxing, reflecting time on one's own. The music have a sleep-inducing feel, and at the same time showing off quality musicianship and wonderful vocals.  <br /> <br />The solo vocalist in \\"Dummy\\" maintains a dreamy,angelic voice throughout, focusing on the tone of the music rather than the melody. You will find that the techno beats somewhat overused, but nevertheless still effective.  <br /> <br />There are no real standout tracks, but \\"It could be sweet\\" and \\"Glory box\\" tend to sound more unique and welcomingly energetic in comparison to the other lazy, lethargic and often trantic tracks.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a fresh new genre of music away from the pop, hip-hop and rock scene, then I recommend trip-hop, and \\"dummy\\" is among the top trip-hop albums in the scene.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|I'm sure many people wondered what happened to Avril Lavigne after her 2002 debut, \\"Let Go\\". She had a great deal of success with her singles and her debut in general which was a good thing considering how entertaining her album was. Just when some people were beginning to think that Avril would be a one-album-wonder, she struck back with a sophomore album, \\"Under My Skin\\". Compared to her debut, \\"Under My Skin\\" is much darker and deeper. Avril wrote or co-wrote every song and enlisted the help of Chantal Kreviazuk, bandmate Evan Taubenfeld and former Evanscence co-founder, Ben Moody. The result was an even better pop-rock offering. Avril is still in no way a punk artist nor is she pure pop or pure rock. Despite how you categorize her, this album is definitely worth a listen and may even surprise some. <br /> <br />The album opens with a song that is probably as far from the style of \\"Let Go\\" as possible. With lyrics written by Avril herself, \\"Take Me Away\\" starts the album off with angsty pop-rock that works. While it is not the best song on the album per se, it is still an awesome song and better than most  pop-rock songs out there. \\"Together\\", the first song that was co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk, follows. It's simpler lyrically but still a personal favourite. The song describes how Avril feels better when she is by herself than when she is with her man. The subject matter is slightly overused but the style more than makes up for it. Next up is the first single, \\"Don't Tell Me\\". It has a more mature message than, say, \\"Sk8r Boi\\". This song is about a boyfriend who keeps pressuring Avril to sleep with him but she refuses. At first, I didn't like this song as much as I liked Avril's other singles, but it quickly grew on me. <br /> <br />\\"He Wasn't\\" is a favourite among fans, probably because it's closer to the style of Avril's debt. Many people compared it to \\"Sk8r Boi\\" but I do not see the resemblance. This song was produced by Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace, andco-written by Chantal Kreviazuk but unfortunately its lyrics are much weaker than other songs on the album. (\\"This is where I start to bite my nails, and clean my room when all else fails\\"). It is a fun song, but we know that Avril can to better. \\"How Does It Feel\\" is much mellower and while many complain that it has weak lyrics (\\"How does it feel to be, different from me?\\") I think they actually suit the song quite well. This was also co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk and Avril sounds great at this calmer style. A personal favourite, and the second single, \\"My Happy Ending\\" is up next. Lyrically, it's one of the best songs on the album and Avril sounds genuinely angry. The bridge in particular sounds great although the vocals throughout the song are remarkable. <br /> <br />Possibly the strongest song on the album, co-written by Ben Moody (formerly of Evanescence), follows and is entitled \\"Nobody's Home\\". This song is nothing short of deep and I was surprised to find out that Avril wrote the lyrics all on her own. The lyrics are descriptive and melancholy yet beautiful and touching at the same time. Though simple in places, they express the meaning of the song exceptionally. The next track, \\"Forgotten\\" has the same feel as \\"Unwanted\\" off of Avril's debut. Also co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk, this song has a more angsty feel. The lyrics aren't quite as strong however that may be because it was placed after the two best songs on the album. Avril's vocals are a little more subdued in this song, giving more of a grudging vibe rather than straight anger. \\"Who Knows\\" could have been great, but suffers due to a weak chorus. The verses are well-written and the chorus tries hard to be inspiring (\\"Who knows what could happen, do what you do just keep on laughing\\"). Unfortunately, the inspiration comes across as trite and forced and Avril would have been better off continuing the song in the same vein as the verses.  <br /> <br />\\"Fall To Pieces\\" is similar to \\"How Does It Feel\\" in the sense that it has simple lyrics that express the meaning of the song impeccably. This song was co-written by Raine Maida and it is Avril's delivery that makes the lyrics work. It is a nice change to hear Avril sing a sweet love song though she never goes so far as to lose her usual style (which is a good thing). \\"Freak Out\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album simply because it seems out of place. Whereas many of the other songs showed some depth and meaning, this one settles for being upbeat and catchy. We already know Avril can manage this style and it sounds like this song was more suited for \\"Let Go\\". \\"This song is dedicated in loving memory to my Grandpa\\" is written above the lyrics to the final song, \\"Slipped Away\\". This song is a sweet, emotional piano ballad that, obviously, is about the death of Avril's grandfather. While the lyrics are simple, they are expressive and you can really feel Avril's grief. <br /> <br />Overall Mark: 4.5/5 <br /> <br />While some listeners may still be caught up on the fact that Avril is not a punk singer as most people think she should be, Avril really proves herself a competent writer and singer with her second offering. As much as I enjoyed her debut, this album is even better simply because of the improvement in the lyrics. Avril seems more at home on this album and as a result, she suits the songs far better. A couple of songs suffer from weak choruses but Avril can usually make it work for the best. Personally, I would be happy if she continued working with Chantal Kreviazuk and Ben Moody as they usually bring out her best work.
B000005RS0|5.0|Tina's \\"Private Dancer\\" is one of the classic 80s album alongside Chaka Khan's \\"I Feel For You\\", and Ashford & Simpson's \\"Solid\\", two albums I grew up on. I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B0002IU988|5.0|Wow, so this is what the members of creed have become. With new singers Myles Kennedy, they sound a lot better, everyone's part within the band is clearly defined. <br />So the members of Creed re-emerge as Alter Bridge, and yes it sounds very different from Creed. And they probably have influence from Metal, because the vocalist's voice sounds like the guy from Iron Maiden. <br />This album features a wide range of songs, changing rapidly to each from tempo to tempo, such as the really heavy \\"Metalingus\\" to the sad \\"Down To My Last\\". Mark Tremonti is an incredible guitarist, i hope people can notice that. His performance on this album simply stands out more than any other member. While Brian Marshall's bass lines could'nt be heard too clearly, Scott Philips impressive drumming makes up for it. <br />Standout tracks include \\"One Day Remains\\" \\"Open Your Eyes\\" \\"Metalingus\\" \\"Broken Wings\\" and \\"Down To My Last\\". Each song is a real head banger and draws you in very quickly. <br /> <br />I had mixed thoughts before I got this cd, but it's justified that this is an awesome album. Creed fans may find this different from the usual Creed, but rock lovers would love this all the same
B000002MIB|5.0|WOW what a great album by the Ultimate Van Halen.  Everysong is great including the Drum solo by Alex, the 11 minute 316 by Eddie, and A BASS SOLO by Michael Anthony- A BASS SOLO!!!!!!! I hate when people say the album sucks cause of bad quality and how Sammy did with some of the songs.  Even though most of the songs are from \\"For Unlawful Carnel Knowledge\\" the album is still an Live album worth getting.  It is like a god to all other live albums.  So don't listen to those peoples reviews about the bad side of it.  Van Halen is Van Halen and they are RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW!!!!!
1878424319|5.0|The author says the we have chosen to believe what we have been programmed to believe. Recognizing how difficult it is to change core beliefs, he merely makes practical suggestions about how one can view things differently.  All of the rhetoric, pro and con, about this book may stimulate the intellect; however, the ultimate question to ask about new ideas is  `How well do they work\\". These Four Agreements work. This is precisely why an open mind is so important for spiritual growth. With an open mind one can experiment with new ideas instead of sitting around debating the merits of the ideas. <br /> <br />If you doubt the validity of what this author says, I would invite you to call up any one of your friends and see if they can carry on a conversation for 10 minutes without engaging in character assignation. The author says they can't, and I discovered he was right. <br /> <br />If you are open to new ideas, this book will be beneficial to you. <br /> <br />If you have the courage to further question what you have been programmed to believe, I would strongly recommend the book An Encounter with a Prophet by Clyde A. Lewis. An Encounter with a Prophet enabled me to give up my programmed beliefs about God -beliefs that were causing me a good deal of disturbance. The book also provided practical suggestions that I could experiment with. Those suggestions also worked. <br />
B00005JLO2|4.0|Much of the criticism of this movie is unfounded. It's certainly not too long (it's just over 2 hours long, which is about standard for a historical drama). The acting is fine; although, the British accents of Ledger and Hudson were not that great (but, at least, they weren't annoyingly fake). The editing is fine; if you can't follow the film, then you must not be too smart. Most other criticisms, like Ebert complaining that it was too anglo-centric, are false as well.<br /><br />The one criticism I have is that we are supposed to sympathize with Harry (Ledger's character) when he receives the white feathers for his cowardice. Afterall, he was a coward for abandoning his fellow officers and friends on the eve of going to war, and he knew the consequences. However, the struggles that he encounters on his mission to redeem his honor will certainly illicit sympathy, so that you will too forgive him for his cowardice.<br /><br />All in all, this was a good film. If you enjoy historical dramas like Elizabeth and Amadeus, then I think you should purchase this DVD. The story is often compelling and the cinematography is often brilliant. Improvements could have certainly been made, but that would have required a longer movie, and apparently people can't handle more than two hours (which is very sad).
B00000JCB2|1.0|I must say, I didn't enjoy listening to this album at all. I rememberd hearing Break stuff from a friend and enjoying it, so i went, wut the hell and tried this album out.....and did i ever regret it.  <br />I heard this band was a huge band in europe, and I honestly thought that these nations over seas didnt have very good music. Yeah, this album is just that broken <br />Sereously, dont buy this album. Its a waste.

B000274THQ|4.0|'Goodbye, Lenin!' is wonderful social satire and refreshingly unique, telling a story of a woman, Christiane (Katrin Sa), who loses her husband to adultery and politics, finds solace in her East German party, but collapses into a coma mid-heart attack after seeing her son attacked by East German troops amidst a demonstration gone wrong. The bulk of the film centers around not the mother, but her son Alex (played compellingly by Daniel Brhl). It is the year 1989, and throughout his mother's coma he has seen her life collapse into West Germany as the Wall falls and capitalism takes over. In an endearingly witty sequence, we also see him transform into a loving, mature man as he takes care of her and falls in love with her nurse. When his mother wakes, the doctors inform him of her weak heart: she must not be distressed or excited, lest she have another heart attack, this time fatal. He fears the changes may dangerously provoke her, so he takes her home, hides her from the world, and goes the extra mile to turn their apartment (and her old friends) back in time to East Germany before the fall of Communism. This is an interesting premise, and thanks to fine writing, acting, and direction, the gimmick does not get old, but only more interesting. And though it loses its focus toward the very end and begins to stretch further than it needs to, the film as a whole is so thoughtfully made that its end does not become less moving as a result, but remains memorable and innovative, much like its first two thirds.
B0002234LS|5.0|This movie is so great! I knew what was going to happen in the end.But it still supprised me.
0783222955|5.0|A gripping story of blind racism in a Depression-era small town in Alabama.  Gregory Peck gives a career-defining performance that earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor.  This film represents one of the few times that adult subject matter is presented tastefully from a child's point of view.  Based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning best seller, the direction, acting, and the musical score enhances the story beyond the book (by giving flesh and blood to the characters).  This is a must have film for your collection--try to get the wide screen version, too.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Don't drive yourself nuts trying to connect the dots. Yes [SPOILER] the first four-fifths of the movie are a dream. The last fifth is a convaluted series of \\"real-life\\" images. In terms of structure, this is much simpler than some of Lynch's other work--Lost Highway for example--where the whole plot (sans a few scattered minutes) is internal. But, the plot is not really the point. Enjoy the experience of the images. Enjoy the dreamlike quality. If you're looking for a realistic plot (even a complex realistic plot like Memento), you're going to be disappointed.   <br /> <br />That being said:  <br /> <br />David Lynch is quite simply one of the greatest artists working in mainstream film. He is bringing the experimental, avant-garde film world to Hollywood, and for that alone he should be congratulated. The fact that he produces artistic pieces that are also intensly enjoyable to watch is a rare gift.  <br /> <br />I'll go to Quentin Tarantino (or for that matter Joss Whedon or Amy Sherman-Palladino) if I'm looking for great dialogue. I'll go to Tim Burton or Wes Anderson if I'm looking for great characters. But David Lynch is where I'll go for a great experience.  <br /> <br />A few other filmakers: Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze/Charlie Kaufman, Sam Mendes, Darren Aronofsky, etc. create great experiences (OK, I can't really say I \\"enjoy\\" Anderson or Aronofsky), but David Lynch, by separating himself from the strictures of an A-B-C plot, creates the most interesting experiences of all.  <br /> <br />The best comparison I can think of for Mulholland Dr. is a short film by the experimental filmaker Maya Deren: Meshes of the Afternoon. This film, made around 1943 I think, is about fifteen minutes long, silent, and features a series of images revolving around a woman coming home in the middle of the day and eventually winding up--well, it's not really clear what she winds up. The movie is a beautiful series of images: a cloaked figure with a mirror for a face, brokenmirror bits on a beach, a flower, a lover, and (yes) a key that transforms into a knife and becomes the tool behind a murder/suicide at the end of the film.   <br /> <br />If you can find Meshes of the Afternoon (and that's kind of hard) definitely watch it. Until then, wait for the next Lynchian experience
B0002OERI0|3.0|(...)     Okay, this album only gets three stars because its half decent and half misleading. Green Day almost lost it here but luckily the instrumental status is outstanding. Unfortunately however the lyrical content is very bad, some is pretty funny, but most (like in the title track) is very crappy and dumb. The frontman poorly tries to sound political instead of funny like he used to be, which is a bad thing. But as I said earlier the instruments here are some of the best Green Day has ever made. So this album is, while not a total disaster, is not as good as many previous releases.
0553565915|5.0|This book Embraced by the Light by Betty Eadie is one of the books to be on any NDE experiencer's bookshelf, even if it is simply for the early historical basis and the \\"warm fuzzy\\" feeling that her eloquent writing invokes in the reader. The Light of love and the Light of God felt and seen at the NDEs is something I myself experienced eight years ago. This book, Dannion Brinkley's book Saved by the Light, and Tiffany Snow's book Psychic Gifts Tools to Connect and any of Raymond Moody's books, are a welcome and necessary part of any curious visitor to the near-death experience, and I would also suggest reading all the information complied by IANDS.
B000001E29|4.0|This is very good work of his. Eclectic, weird, and Waits-ian are the best words to describe it. But the best way to understand it is to go get it and listen to it yourself. No disapointment will be involved.
B00004IC9G|4.0|Originally released in 1982 as this is the classic debut record from Manowar. This is the legit release, taken direct from the master tapes. Believe there used to be a piss-poor quality bootleg of this title in circulation several years back. It's easy to describe Manowar's music, L-O-U-D & HEAVY, I MEAN H-E-A-V-Y M-E-T-A-L!! You know, the kind that can get you evicted from your apartment if you play the record on '10' enough times. All eight tracks totally rip, but the best are the in-your-face opener &#34;Death Tone&#34;, &#34;Metal Daze&#34;, the band's namesake &#34;Manowar&#34; and &#34;Dark Avenger&#34;. Sort of dug the Orson Welles narration that goes along with the disc. For any 'newcomers' that may be reading this, 'Battle Hymms' should appeal to fans of Bathory, Hammerfall, Slayer and maybe Testament.
B000000OAN|5.0|First of all, I would like to remind certain reviewers that this site isn't about ROCK MUSIC, it about music in general. I don't think that music listeners who use this site as a tool to decide whether they should purchase a product or not, need some senseless person to determine what's rock and what's not. You know who you are.    In case you are not aware, Queen never boasted of being a band of Rock only, they in fact wrote what Freddie termed as \\" Music to Escape into\\". Coincidently they happen to write great ROCK music along with a classical style of music which is more than what I can say for most of today's artists. It's no wonder why great  performers like Guns and Roses, Metallica, Elton John, Extreme, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Jeff beck, Tony Iommi, George Michael, Ian Hunter, David Bowie, Seal, Lisa Stansfield, Paul Young, Zucchero, Monserrat Cabelle would either be influenced, or want to be associated with Queen.   Queen was the first major bands to have the courage to incorporate all types of music and styles into  one unique and classic style that became the trade mark of the band. Queen influenced some of the more exciting bands to emerge in the eighties, mainly because their music didn't sound like SOS (Same old Sh#@). I once was asked by The Inquiring Photographer (from the New York Daily News) if Disco was dead, and my answer was basically, \\"Disco needs to broaden it base and needs to take more chances.\\" I had Queen in mind when I said this because they were a unique band with a unique sound.  A night At The Opera was the first record released during my lifetime that eliminated all barriers and basically sent a message to  music listeners a that \\"There is another dimension to Rock, and here it is\\".  Queen wasn't afraid of criticism or failure, which are important ingredients to making a Great Rock Band.  I realize that this sounds more like a personal rebuttal than a review for this record, but I think the music on ANATO speaks for itself and doen't need justification from me.  Queen were flat out the greatest Live Band, the most innovative studio bands, and the most creative band of our time. regardless of your taste in music.  In case you need proof,  watch \\"Live Aid\\" and see for yourself.

B0006213WG|5.0|This CD is SO awesome! This CD really shows off the fact that Sum 41 is NOT just another Simple Plan. Dave, Sum's lead guitarist, is fantastic. Sum 41 has a lot of talent, and even though a lot of people didn't like the fact that they went \\"metal\\" (even though they're FAR from heavy metal) this album is really great.     The intro song, while less than a minute long, still builds up the anticipation until the energy explodes into \\"No Reason\\". The energy is still there, all the way up to the final song, \\"88\\". Sum 41 signs off with a creepy ending that ties this whole album together.    The messages in this song are great, and Whibley sings the songs with conviction. I can't think of a weak song on this whole CD. I hope Sum 41 finally gets the attention they deserve with this one!!
B000002MUW|4.0|I thought that Bedtime Stories was a good album by Madonna, a little better than her overly sexual Erotica album of 1992. There's a huge R&B influence here, versus the Patrick Leonard/Stephen Bray huge pop dominance of her '80s albums.  And she sounded superb on songs like Survival, Secret, Inside of Me, the funky Human Nature, Don't Stop and others. I liked her songs with Dave Hall, one of '94-95's best and underrated R&B producers.  He had a lot of songs around that time. I like the closing three, how Sanctuary fades out and Bedtime Story enters in.  And the final song, Take A Bow-- When I found out that Babyface was on it, I went, It's going to Number 1!--and it did happen! Ten years later, I still hear it on radio stations and stores--still a gorgeous ballad from her! The album blended very well with the R. Kelly dominance that took so much of mainstream radio.  It shows how she's so good at reinventing and changing her look for each album that she does.
B000002UB3|1.0|I heard the Beatles album \\"Rubber Soul\\", the one with their one hit \\"Norwegian Wood\\". That song was good and the other filler songs were...eh...(flipping my hand around like to say \\"ehhhh\\", you know?)...I always saw these guys as a one hit wonder. But someone said, \\"You gotta hear 'Abbey Road' by them.\\" And, I was like. Okay. Apparently this band was an influence for great bands like Herman's Hermits and New Order and stuff, so, I thought, okay...if I can find it, i'\\"ll chekc it out. I found it. Checked it out. Uh...Ever heard of a word called \\"Porduction\\", lads? They...I don't know when one song ends and the other stops. They have different lead singers for every song. The songs have no thru line or melody to speak of. I see here that some people gave this thing 5 stars. Hello! What? There's a reason you never hear of these guys any more. They're probably all living in a shack trying to live on their little checks for \\"Norwegian\\" Wood.
B00003CXTG|2.0|The title makes you think this is a movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It is not. This is a movie about a couple of young fighter pilots that end up falling in love with the same woman. They just happened to be at Pearl Harbor when it got bombed. Even worse, Michael Bay does not use a lot of facts. He had our two main stars go on the mission to bomb Japan, when in reality the two pilots did not go.    For most of the movie, it's just some stupid love story. One guy loves a girld. They think he dies, and the guy's friend decides to jump on her. Eventually, they find out the guy's not dead, and a fight gets out. That's most of the movie.     Being the 141 million dollar film that it was, there are a lot of great angles, and very realistic CG effects, but not even that can save the film.    Ben Affleck has got to be one of the worst actors ever. He's so dull. How the hell did he get the part? I know there are much better actors out there. Why did they get him?    Overall, this movie is just not entertaining.    I don't know if they like to tell kids this, but America cut off Japan's oil. All the kids at my high school didn't know that.    I was there to see the filming at Pearl Harbor, and I could have been in it, but they didn't need me.
B00005JMJG|4.0|My one piece of advice to anyone who is going to watch this film is to watch it TWICE!! The first time I watched it I spent most of the film trying to figure out what the heck was going on. Which for me spoilt the enjoyment of it. But the second viewing was brilliant!  <br />It's a great feel good movie, yes it has it's sad parts but overall it leaves you with a big smile on your face. <br />So, if the first time you watch it your aren't sure, give it another try! I did and i love it now! <br />Big thumbs up to Jim and Kate who were fabulous, and also to the writer and director. This is a very unique film, one of it's kind!
B000092ZYX|4.0|Dear (potential) Radiohead fan,<br />This is a great album, but there is no need to pay extra money and get this import UNLESS it is from the US.  You see copies of this album in Canada are copy-protected, which leads to problems when playing it on your computer (Mac or PC), but what is more upsetting is that this same technology was not forced on the US market, where Napster was invented.  I actually gave away my Canadian copy and went to the US to buy a non-copy-protected version, since I like making compilations.  Oh yeah.  And the copy-protected version also skipped on my walkman.  Since EMI Canada seems unwilling to compensate or even acknowledge complaints about their defective CDs, I'd recommend buying this just to spite them!  However, if you have no desire to rip this CD (for your own copies!), and are going to play it only on a standard CD player (not a discman or computer), then you might want to buy the regular domestic copy, which is no different in these uses.
B000002IQ9|4.0|As good as Phil Collins' solo albums can be, they often contain no small amount of \\"filler\\", and the slick, glossy production on records like \\"Face Value\\" and \\"No Jacket Required\\" makes them seem somewhat dated. <br /> <br />But this live album remedies some of that. Although no-one can accuse Phil Collins' horn-laden pop music of being 'gritty', it nevertheless sounds a little more genuine and less over-produced, and the track list is very strong, including almost all of Collins' best songs from the 80s: <br />The spooky \\"In The Air Tonight\\" is here, as is \\"Take Me Home\\", \\"Separate Lives\\", \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love\\" and several others. <br /> <br />There is still too much synth on tracks like \\"Against All Odds\\" (an otherwise superb ballad) and \\"One More Night\\", but that's what Collins' music is like, and \\"Serious Hits...Live\\" remains a good, solid collection of adult pop songs.
B00005JMXX|4.0|This is one of those movies you think to yourself, \\"could this ever happen\\", but besides that the special effects are one of the best I have ever seen and I have seen many of these types of movies so if your into movie theater effects and not just worried about the plot of the movie this is a good one for your collection.

B00005JL2O|1.0|Goldmember is the epitome of the tired, recycled, over-produced garbage that Hollywood puts out specifically for the sake of  fast food tie-ins.  There's hardly an original moment in the entire movie.  This fact must not have escaped the writers, because it's brought up in a joke or two (which seems like a way to cover up thier laziness).  As for Beyonce's acting, well I'm happy to say she didn't embarrass herself.  Not that it matters.  She could have been completely edited out and you would still have virtually the same film.  The only reason I can come up with her being there is to sell movie tickets, dvd's, soundtracks, and so on. Anyway, if you're one of the lucky few who haven't seen this movie I'd recommend keeping it that way.  But if you still feel that you must, do yourself a favor and rent it first.

B00005R23X|4.0|i don't care if you are romanian, or have read the book via cliff notes or seen every version on film. thre is no tepes basis, no capes, no romance in dracula. the only movie that is true to the character of dracula from stoker's novel is the 1922 nosferatu. this 1992 version is excellent in atmosphere and performances save for reeves and ryder. oldman tops lee and comes close to the great lugosi. hopkins is easily the best personification of van helsing to date. now on to the facts. first, dracula is NOT based on vlad tepes. stoker had already outlined the novel and was calling it the undead with the title character being called count vampyr. romania has only used the fact that stoker utilized tepes name dracula and not his person to exploit stupid americans into taking dracula tours. in fact if you read closely, stoker makes reference to dracula being decended from a completly different race than tepes, at times alluding to relation to attila. romanians may view tepes as a hero, but the dracula tours and crap are all for money and tourism. Even the castle billed as draculas castle (bran castle) was NOT tepes residence. his castle is actually much closer to that pictured in the movie. it is located over 1000 feet above the arges river. (See mcnally, in search of dracula and miller, dracula for reference) No movie this one included has come close to the personification of dracula physically either, including wardrobe. only nosferatu was close do not let the beginning of coppola's version confuse you, dracula the literary character has NO basis on the life and times of the real impaler. watch this movie for the unique artistic interpretation and wait for my graphic novel version of the origional book if i ever get it done and approved, for accurate descriptions. we all know hollywood will never do it. damn you langella! king's barlow is closer to dracula than anything else put out this century. watch 2004's salem's lot for the correct interpetation of dracula's personality. copola did well, but this is not stoker's dracula. nor was it fullt intended to be. attaching stokers name was only for copyright's sake. this was done to avoid a lawsuit from universal who owns the rights to the title \\"dracula\\". Dont look at movies literally. if you want the real dracula, read the damn book. if you want a story that resembles dracula, watch a hollywood/hammer movie.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Firstly I hate rap always have I say ROCK and ROLL baby. But this is different this guy is an artist, I mean he could just read his lyrics out loud without even having music in the background. I love it because he speaks the truth in a way most people don't these days. There are some tracks where I just can't stop laughing and others where I can actually relate.
B00005NWM3|5.0|..Cuz nickelback has returned with an epic release sure to blow both of those right out of the water. This is BY FAR nickelback's best release, with 10 stellar tracks sure to leave you speechless after first listen. A combination of factors play into silver side up's greatness, including flawless production and musical maturity...    Never Again...A great way to start the album. The chorus is unforgetable, and the combination of melody and aggression is near perfect. One of the better tracks 9/10    How you remind me...The melodic first single, very catchy and very well written. Not much else to say except that everyones probably heard it and its great 9/10    Woke up this morning...A VERY catchy chorus adds to this songs greatness. One of the most memorable songs on here, but I wasn't too fond of the lyrics 9/10    Too Bad...Pretty heavy stuff on this one, Lyrically though not Musically. The chorus is pretty good too, but the well constructed verses are what save this one from being just  average 8/10    Just for...Wow, this is a good song. Probably one of my favorites. The blend of aggression and melody come together so well for this band on \\"Just for\\", that it seems almost unreal. Best on the album BY FAR 10/10    Hollywood...I wasn't a big fan of this song at first, but it grew on me tremendously 8/10    Look at what your money bought...If i had to pick a least favorite, this would be it. On anyother album it would be good, but here, it just doesn't work 7/10    Where do I hide...Good song, I like the chorus expecially. One of the better songs on the album. One complaint, the intro is TOO long 8/10    Hangnail...Again, another great chorus, but I ususally skip over it to get to good times gone 8/10    Good times gone...My second favorite, a slower song than the rest, and a great way to end the album 9/10
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is an amazing film which, unlike CNN and Bush's presidential addresses, provides actual material to support the motivations our president's actions. <br /> <br />I suggest that those who can do nothing more than whine and yell about the film's content (incidentally, without even citing examples of what information they find inaccurate), are merely doing so out of newfound realization that perhaps they actually have been manipulated and brainwashed into believing the (FCC controlled) rhetoric that has been fed to us over the past 4 years. <br /> <br />To those passing on the thug-like mentality of the Bush administration in their review here, I say only that I proudly call myself American - and I will accept the challenge of anyone who says otherwise.
B00005JNEI|5.0|You know, I'm so sick and tired of conservatives crying about their man Bush. Did liberals cry when Clinton was raked over the coals? No. The truth is that Michael Moore is a brilliant filmmaker. Sure, he has a bias. If he didn't, you'd call him a spineless bimbo. I'm glad that liberals like he and Bill Maher are around. It seems to me that when intelligent, opinionated liberals are about, conservatives can't take it. <br /> <br />Now, with that being said, what is so difficult to believe about facts in this movie? I have read most of the reviews here and have yet to see anyone say exactly what Michael Moore is lying about in his movie. Even Condi Rice, when asked, couldn't provide proof of what Moore lied about in his film. <br /> <br />Let me pose this question: Is it really that difficult to believe that the President would NOT declare war on a man who he was in bed with financially? (although this man flew two planes into our buildings -- perhaps over said financial dealings, who knows?). Let's get it straight, people. When somenone punches you in the face, do you punch him back or the guy next to him? I haven't seen anything about us getting close to catching Bin-Laden, but we sure as hell have Saddam. When you think about it all together, it's really simple.    <br /> <br />I think the conservatives who have reviewed this film are so caught up in the way Moore tells his story (very tongue-in-cheek) that they are consumed by rage and immediately ready to dismiss the film as lies.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|OK, so the plot is absurd.  The science is dreadful.  This movie is so lame from a character and plot standpoint that I could have written it. <br /> <br />However, it is one cool movie.  Why. Unreal weather effects!!  Who among us does not love weather disasters?  Tornados ripping through Los Angeles, that was awesome!  The huge wall of water destroying New York City, simply amazing. <br /> <br />Wait a minute, the lib's keep telling us all about global warming, but the net of it is that if we do nothing New York City and LA, liberal havens, get destroyed?  What kind of motivation is this to sign the Kyoto treaty? <br /> <br />Dumb story, great effects!  Buy it for the extra's, laugh at Dennis Quaid.
B00005JNEI|5.0|For those who say this film is nothing but a bag of lies, please point out exactly where those lies are. We all know that Moore is a bit of a windbag and can exagerrate (for instance, the segment detailing pre-war Iraq as a child-friendly wonderland is too much to believe)- but behind all of the bluster there is a solid foundation in fact. And if you're going to claim that the film is nothing but lies, try actually... I don't know... WATCHING the film first.  <br /> <br />From Saudi oil friendships... to inattention in office... to corporate conventions to decide who gets what part of Iraq's remains... to the pain of parents whose child died for no good reason... to the manipulation of the American public by fear and terror... It's just a shame. It makes me embarrased and ashamed to be an American.  <br /> <br />The general sense I get about Bush is that he is out of touch with reality, while his admistration and family know *exactly* what they're doing and uses him as a mere figurehead. Whether Bush is a knowing conspirator playing dumb or an unwitting accomplice who is genuinely incompetent, I am not certain. What I am certain of is that this man does not deserve the presidency. <br /> <br />I am not a liberal. I am not a democrat. I am not a republican. I am simply a person who wants the best for my country, and that is not something that seems to be on Bush's mind.  <br /> <br />I voted for Bush in 2000. I will not make that mistake again - a decision not based on this film but definitely strengthened by it.
B00005JNJ7|3.0|As a staunch liberal, I was a little nervous about going to see \\"Team America\\" when I heard from some critics that it had a right-wing bias (that shocked me when I first heard it, considering the title of the movie).  However, since I loved \\"South Park\\", I decided to try and watch the movie with an open mind and, most importantly, try not to take anything seriously.  What I saw was an original, marginally offensive, and occasionally amusing comedy that was unfortunately well below the level of the \\"South Park\\" movie. <br /> <br />\\"Team America\\"'s best laughs come in the first couple minutes, when we see the puppets in action for the first time.  The Middle Eastern stereotypes are hilarious, as is the \\"patriotic\\" background music as Team America battles the terrorists.  In fact, the songs throughout the film are good.  There's an absolutely hilarious puppet sex scene, and the Kim Jong puppet is consistently funny (he resembles Cartman).  Most surprisingly, \\"Team America\\" works somewhat as a straight-ahead action picture, since it never takes itself seriously and has plenty of puppet-filled action. <br /> <br />However, I had qualms with the movie, and mostly with its satire.  The first time the movie made fun of the liberal Hollywood activists, it was funny, but to my disappointment this became a major plot point (by the end, the Hollywood liberals are basically in league with the terrorists).  I consider myself a good sport- I chuckled when puppet Michael Moore decided to suicide-bomb the Team America center- but the idea of Hollywood liberals actively working against the country is a joke that wears thin fast (exempting puppet Matt Damon, who is consistently funny).  Also, the film really bogs down in its final half hour; by that point, the novelty of the puppets had worn off, and more jokes were falling flat (although there is a funny speech at the end). <br /> <br />I myself had mixed feelings about \\"Team America\\".  It's funny, but not nearly enough.  I'm not sure what the audience for the film could be.  Conservatives will find it too raunchy, liberals will be downright offended, comedy fans may not find it funny enough, and action fans won't like how little it takes itself seriously.  I guess I could recommend it to curious \\"South Park\\" fans, but I think overall \\"Team America\\" is more deservant of a rental than a movie ticket price. <br /> <br />
0800141628|4.0|You've got all these terrible teen comedies lately with kids just trying to get some money with a movie of no integrity, and here comes River Phoenix who wants to be more than some lowly comedic actor, but an actual actor of integrity and talent. This movie is great. It is great for discovering how to be a kid , and how to deal with that. What's strange about this movie is you don't know why, but these guys have got to find the body. Heck, even they don't know why, but they've got to see it. Mayve it's for the fact of facing their fears and conquering whatever doubt is within themselves. They want to grow up, and they want to prove it.<br /><br />  It's a great movie!
B00005JLR8|4.0|Just when I thought Angela's Ashes was a tearjerker family film a few years ago, I was touched a great deal more when I saw In America last year. It's a very heartfelt movie about the struggles and hardship of immigration, redemption, and letting go of the death of an infant.<br /><br />I totally could relate to the aspects of a new life in a different country, so I was touched by many moments in this film. This is no doubt Samantha Morton's best performance since Sweet and Lowdown. She trully captures the essence of the character's pain and grief. It was compelling to see her confront her husband for causing the death of their baby. Both little girls are wonderful to watch, especially when they were making friends with their eccentric neighbor(Djimon Housou). Paddy C. may not have done a whole lot of American films, but he did a great job as a struggling actor who managed to used multiple accents in an auditiion scene. We've seen a lot of that from Meryl Streep, but not an Irish actor. I must say Djimon Housou was my choice to win the Oscar for best supporting actor, because his performance is so intense and powerful. His character is guardian angel in a way to Samantha Morton's family.
B00007GZR5|3.0|I love it when Robin Williams goes away from the norm and makes a movie that many can appreciate for its creativity, kind of like One Hour Photo. This movie, as original as it is, is a very strange, strange movie. Amazingly though, Williams craft grows, and continues too. His acting in this movie is superb, and even believable, even though it's totally unbelievable. Which makes it even better. What's also great about this movie is that anyone who has had a soul mate, maybe to the point of obsession, can appreciate this movie. It's a desire to keep your love, even if it means crossing over Hell to do it.<br /><br />  So, overall interesting. Maybe see it, but with caution.
0790701251|5.0|This movie is definitely one of the best war-related movies ever made. It is divided into two parts, the frist taking place at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot at Parris Island, SC, and the second, in Vietnam. <br /> <br />The first part focuses on the process of turning recruits into Marines. R. Lee Ermey gives a fantastic (and highly realistic) performance as Senior Drill Instructor GySgt Hartman, whose job is to motivate the recruits to learn and progress, and to change their way of thinking, behavior, and emotional responses to those that would be expected of Marines. The first part of the movie also depicts the effect this process has on the recruits-- little by little, they shift from the mindset of a civilian to that of a trained Marine. Vincent D'Onofrio (\\"Private Pyle\\") acts as the maladjusted recruit who is eventually pushed to his limits. <br /> <br />While the first part of the film details the process of turning civilians into Marines, the second part details the results of this process. The former recruits are now in Vietnam, where they must adapt to a reality of continuous war. As you watch their responses to the situations they find themselves in, as well as their general attitude toward the war, you can see that the second part of the film is a direct continuation of the first: these men are completely engrossed in their new mindset and the reality in which they are operating, and they are now far, far beyond the line that separates the real world from the hazy world of war. They are now the \\"killers\\" GySgt Hartman has tried to mold them into.  <br /> <br />The ending scene is stunning. It sums up the film wondefully. It signals that the former recruits have crossed the line for good. They are no longer afraid or worried or even caring. They simply go through a war that, for them, is a permanent, well-known reality. They are nw fully a part of the new world they have first been prepared for during the first part of the film. And watching that final scene, it is obvious to the viewers, that for these men, the war will never end.
B000002H33|5.0|Many of you may actually think that some reviewers tend to exaggerate by giving some songs on this album much more than a 10/10. As strange as it may seem, they are not exaggerating.  <br /> <br />Rarely do you come across an album without any 'throw-away' songs or tracks. A lot of metal bands these days can't sound heavy if they don't maintain the same \\"full-throttle\\" speed they usually play at, or if they don't use death metal vocals, or if they don't raise up all the volume for the guitars and drums to add an extra layer of \\"heaviness\\", or if they don't use satanic imagery in the deliverance of their music through lyrical content.  <br /> <br />With \\"Master of Puppets\\", Metallica didn't have any of these things, and yet sounded rib-crunchingly aggressive while still drawing you in with the sounds they produced.  <br /> <br />If the Beatles changed the way pop-rock was played, and if Nirvana changed the way modern rock was supposed to be played by making grunge famous, Metallica, with \\"Master of Puppets\\", changed the way metal was headed. During a period where metal was developing rapidly, this album not only influenced many other bands today, underground or mainstream, but it also paved an alternative path in metal. Metal in the mid-to-late 80s was becoming saturated with elements of 'death metal' and 'black metal'. This album strengthened the thrash metal that continued to combine hardcore punk (also achieved by various other bands: eg., Anthrax) with themes on social justice, society and the political, and personal issues. Metallica, with \\"Master of Puppets\\", and also with the influence of some other thrash metal and hardcore bands, helped influence and develop 'metalcore' and 'grindcore' (since grindcore has its roots in early 80s thrash).  <br /> <br />Leaving aside its influences, this album is indestructible. The opening track starts off by basically 'welcoming' the listener with an acoustic introduction. You can FEEL something coming around the one-minutemark, and out of no where, it erupts into a merciless, irreversible and unbreakable ball of energy - just think of it as something that can't be stopped, something that crushes everything out of its way. When you think it's gone around the 2.45 minute mark you can only stand there and wonder, \\"What IS this? Where did this come from?\\" You could say the 'breather' stops at minute 3.18 where the relentless attack returns, only this time the ultra-aggressive noise pounds harder - just leave aside Hammett's solo and listen to the insanity Hetfield and Burton unleash ... and then again on minute 3.48 ... and again at 4.45. Call it what you will, but just stop the cd before the second track and wonder why you feel so different.  <br /> <br />By the time you start playing the second track, you'll dismiss the earlier thought you had, \\"This surely can't get any better ...\\" How wrong you were. The raw energy hits back with riffs you thought weren't possible if they weren't backed with death vocals - it is as if the guitars speak to you and assure you they have full control of this blitzkrieg-freakshow. Your jaw has by now probably dropped to the ground while you stand there thinking, \\"How? How can this band exhibit a sound so extreme at only slightly faster than mid-tempo speeds on this song?\\" After the band has shown its musical abilities, you'll get to minute 5.10 and listen to Hetfield's chants of \\"Master! Master! ...\\" and be reminded of a madman leaving a useless asylum with a sickness that cannot be remedied. Like watching a classic, you've been taken to another place, except there is no going back.  <br /> <br />The third track demonstrates something different. This is just another thing that sets Metallica apart from its contemporaries - Megadeth, Anthrax, and especially Slayer. Before you play the third track ask yourself this question - Would any of the mentioned bands, particularly Slayer, sound as heavy if they played a really slow riff? Would they be able to pull it off? Have they ever achieved a level of heaviness so suffocating and extreme by slowing down to BELOW mid-tempo speeds? Now play 'The Thing That Should Not Be'. There is only one word to desribe this - unbelievable. It's as if you thank nature for giving you the gift of instinct - like an animal, you have the ability to sense danger when it lurks.  <br /> <br />There is no need to describe the rest of the album. The only thing left worth saying is that, unlike many other similar albums, it doesn't die once the first few tracks are over. The album maintains the same energy. It continues to surprise you and challenge you. Whether you begin to consider whether the world REALLY cares about the life and worth of a soldier after listening to 'Disposable Heroes', whether you think about Burton's true masterpiece in 'Orion' and what it actually sounds like to listen to pure energy without vocals or interruptions from minute 2.12 to 2.41, whether 'Welcome Home' and 'Leper Messiah' alter or reinforce your views on the abuse of power to dominate and control, or whether the closing track doesn't let you off easily by demonstrating why some say Metallica hasn't been Metallica in over a decade - like a psychotic and brutal assault, like the unleashing of fury, and like the release of negative energy that finally leaves you alone - this album stands alone as thrash metal's FINEST hour.   <br /> <br />
B000000OSE|5.0|I just got this one, after looking for it for months (I thought my brother had his copy somewhere between my dad's records, but just trying to find my dad's records was hard enough). Dah, here it goes. <br /> <br />Right Next Door To Hell - Not that bad, but still not good enough. I like the main riff and the chorus, and Axl's scream. 7/10 <br /> <br />Dust N' Bones - Nice Izzy song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Live And Let Die - This song is sexy, nice instrumental, and nice vocals. I give it high rating because there's nothing wrong with it. 9/10 <br /> <br />Don't Cry - Awesome song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Perfect Crime - Just Axl talking nosense about his Perfect Crime. Too bad the song isn't perfect. 7/10 <br /> <br />You Ain't The First - OMG THIS SUCKS 4/10 <br /> <br />Bad Obsession - Cool the first time, then it's meh. 7/10 <br /> <br />Back Off Bitch - I love this song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Double Talkin Jive - Nice... But a bit boring. 7/10 <br /> <br />November Rain - 10/10 Another perfect song!!! <br /> <br />The Garden - Niceeeee I love the chorus. 9/10 <br /> <br />Garden Of Eden - Really quick, catchy song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Don't Damn Me - I love this one too, but... 8/10 <br /> <br />Bad Apples - Nice scheme, not so nice song. 7/10 <br /> <br />Dead Horse - Sexy song oh yeah, the chorus sucks a bit (Sometimes I feel as if I'm beating a dead horse...) but Axl's melody rox. 8/10 <br /> <br />Coma - Ultimate GN'R epic, this song is scary, with the beats the first few seconds, then the doctors, the b*t*h*s and the operation taking place, and how this may happen to YOU. And Slash's solo may be a little short...Well, too short, but it cheers you up and makes you ready for the rest of the song. Kind of a roller coaster thing. 10/10
B00005JMUA|3.0|While I gave volume 1 a 4-star, this only gets a 3-star rating. Substandard for this director. Okay, it may be better than other directors, but if I am watching a movie largely based on the director, I don't want to be disappointed. Basically, if you happened on volume 1, you should watch volume 2. Otherwise, keep moving.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|Lifeless characters who walk in Burton's Oz didn't grab me, and the grotesque reliance on a real giant or Helene Bonham-Carter's gory eye were cliches.  When the cast resurfaces for the final scene, I expect to shed a nostalgic tear or feel a pang, but there's nothing but a wishful sense that I wish the film worked (metafiction is usually complex).  If you want a film that has heart, real characters, and a social conscience (rooted in real human dilemmas of a single family in Prague), then choose the Czech bittersweet comedy, AUTUMN SPRING, starring a charismatic 75-year old in believable situations where he attempts to enact what Albert Finney fails to bring to life in BIG FISH.  Watch the real implications of fish tales with a real storyline, not a rehashed version of OZ.
0800141849|5.0|As a rule, I ignore Streisand detractors among the critics.  Most movie critics don't have a clue as to what they're talking about anyway and, like music critics, no one really listens to them. <br /> <br />I liked the movie; in fact, it's one of my favorites.  Everything does not have to be deadly serious.  Some movies are intended to be escapist fare - where you suspend disbelief.  This is one of them. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm not a cinematic expert, but I know what I like - and I like this one!!
0783226837|5.0|In a contest for the perfect monster movie, 'Tremors' would be on top of the heap. 'Tremors' put several successful elements into one movie: characters that feel real and are easlily distinguished by their personality and uniqueness, you can really care about these people; a monster that is as frightening when it is seen as when it was not (so many monster movies disappoint when the monster is revealed, this does not disappoint): a story which is intelligent and well written: add liberal doses of humor: top it off with a pace that maintains itself from start to finish without a lag. If you are not familiar with this movie (shame on you), the story centers around the inhabitants of the small (about 2 dozen?) town of Perfection, Nevada and a college student doing tests for seismic activity. Their daily activities are interupted by what starts out as underground tremors, slaughtered sheep, and a farmer who was so frightened of something that he climbed up an electrical tower and stayed until he died of dehydration. It is soon discovered that there are undeground monsters and the townspeople must use their wits to escape or fight the monsters if escape is impossible. I have just given a teaser because I do not want to ruin it for anybody. The characters above anything are what makes this movie. They are enjoyable and well played. 'Tremors' is a fun and at times scary thrill ride that does not stop until the end; which is well worth repeated rides.-Bob
B000683VI4|4.0|I thought this movie would be terrible--like the book by Nicholas Sparks, or A Walk to Remember with Mandy Moore. However, I was pleasantly surprised! It was gorgeous--the breathtaking south carolina scenery, the costumes, the music, the acting, the love, the sweetness and most important of all--the innocence of this film, which relies on the simplicity of the story being told. Makes you believe, makes you optimistic, sniffle a bit and go starry-eyed, and its worth it.
0804106304|4.0|ive just finished reading this book and now have to write an essay discussing the effects of the past on the present in relation to two mother-daughter pairs in the book. but i find it hard to relate their past to the present, because i think amy tan didnt build up each person's own character strong enough (this is probably because i only read the shortened version). so i dont know how to show how the past changed or built up their character (except that i knew ying-ying behaved like a ghost because she had a bad husband, and rose lost her confidence after the death of her youngest brother). <br />so if anyone would like to help or discuss with me, please email to: firstkiss14@hotmail.com
B0000BWVCM|3.0|The first X-Men was a huge disappointment for me, the illustrious Marvel Comics characters rendered ultra-stylish but very flat because the film was spread out too thin over too many characters.  On X2, the story and writing became much tighter, but the characters are still a little more preoccupied with showing off their powers than developing emotional facets.  The result is another good-looking film, with good action sequences but not a great deal of emotional involvement.    I still can't accept a majority of the casting choices.  Given one of the main subplots of this film is the legendary Jean Grey-Wolverine-Cyclops romantic triangle, it was a mistake on the writers' part to make Cyclops even less of a character than the rest of the cast.  Wolverine is still our main character, taking up the most screentime and with the most important arc, so making his rival Cyclops such a shallow shadow of a character was a fatal misstep.  Halle Berry as Storm is a disaster, projecting no sense of power, leadership, or charisma, perpetually stuck on an oh-pity-me expression; and Anna Paquin sleepwalks her way through another role.  As a person who is doomed never to be able to have human contact, Rogue needs much more anger and fire in her emotional spectrum, and Paquin barely manages to give us just a sad pubescent look.  The character problem, however, is less glaring than in the first X-Men film.  Hugh Jackman remains a joy to watch, even if he's still too young for the role of Wolverine, and Alan Cumming deserves the accolades he got as new character Nightcrawler, giving this film some much-needed humour and eccentricity.    The story's been tightened this time, with a better script and dialogue, even though it still has the feel of a series of mutant-power (and CG-effects) showcases rather than a cohesive, progressive plot.  It's still a step up from the original in that this time I actually cared about what was going to happen next, whereas in the first one I just waited for the whole thing to be over.    The ending of this film will set off alarm bells in X-Men fans; if they are indeed about to invoke the fabled \\"Dark Phoenix\\" plot, the next installment has the promise of being either the greatest comic-book film ever made, or a colossal dud that flunks the expectations.  Bryan Singer sets it up well at the end here, though I fear that if the thin characterizations of the first two X-Men films persist, then the emotional punch of the Dark Phoenix story may fail to come through.  One can only hope, though:  The Jean Grey-Wolverine relationship in the original comics was heartbreaking, dark and endearing at the same time; I certainly wish they would nail it on the next film.  In the meantime, X2 is good enough as entertainment, even if it's not particularly deep -- once again, a disappointing treatment of the characters of the X-Men comics, some of the most troubled and fascinating characters in comic-book history.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had not seen Firefly when it aired, but my niece bought the set and my sister made sure I started watching it. My son and husband and I are now completely addicted and suffering serious withdrawal symptoms because there are only 14 episodes. The quality of the production, the interaction of the characters, the quirkiness of the sidetrips in the plots, all combine to make the show work. I am looking forward to the movie.  May it span a new life for the series.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Along with the winter wind came a mysterious foreigner and her six-year-old daughter. This is the start of our wonderful story with the arrival of Vianne (Juliette Binoche), Luc (Aurelien Parent Koenig) and Pantouffe - her the imaginary kangaroo -  on a small community full of exaggerations traditions and laws.

Nominated for 5 Academy Awards (Including Best Movie and Best Actress).  Everything you might wish for a good  session is on this all time movie.
B00005JNJ7|2.0|I agree with the person above who said that \\"Team America\\" was not very funny, especially compared to the creators' other movie, \\"The South Park Movie.\\"  Both feature vulgar dialouge and images, but only the latter is really witty.   <br /> <br />The first few moments of the movie seemed promising, but after the first fourth of the movie, things went downhill, relying on recycled crude jokes.  I expected the humor to be potty-level, but it never elevated above that.  Nor was their depth to the humor, as there is in the Simpsons or The Family Guy.  In fact, this movie is worth flushing down the toilet. <br /> <br />Good aspects of the movie: The set was creative, and it was an interesting and ambitious idea to use puppets instead of real actors or animation.   <br /> <br />I also recommend along with another comment-er that if you still desire to view this movie, that you rent the movie and not pay to see it at a theatre--and split the cost of the rental with friends, because otherwise you may still regret that you paid too much!
0312330529|5.0|This is the finest book I have read in ages. Not only do you (I!) fall in love with the tough-guy author, his wisdom, his guts, his learning and his heart of gold, but the action, romance and the truths the author expounds as a result of his experiences keep you entranced from beginning to end. Even after 900 pages the end came too soon. I had a smile on my face throughout, though sometimes through tears . Anyone who knows Bombay will  ache with nostalgia and recognition of  the finely drawn characters   and anyone who doesn't  know Bombay will do by the time they finish this novel. It is a love song to that city, its diversity, its kooky characters and  the philosophies and beliefs that keeps them going. <br /> I read it in three very enjoyable days and can't stop urging everyone around me to read it too. Gregory David Roberts is up there with the best!
0783226845|1.0|4 out of 4 stars.  The overwhelming character trait of Colonel Frank Slade (Pacino) is that he desperately wants to believe in the goodness of human nature again.  He wants it so bad, in fact, the he is desperately insecure that he will find out that it isn't true.  He doesn't want to be disappointed. So he is mean to everyone.  He doesn't want to give people a chance to let him down.  If someone is nice to him, his attitude is, \\"Don't toy with my emotions.\\"  But along comes student Charlie Simms, who is simply, a good guy.  Slade sits in almost disbelief when he learns Charlie is from the Pacific-Northwest instead of the big-shot East Coast.  To Slade, Simms is a Rockwellian character.  Slade has stopped believing that people like this even exist.  In their first meeting, Slade alternates between being touched by Simms' story, and becoming angry, believing that this is an act and Simms is making a fool out of him.  For Frank, it is within days of being too late.  He is plannning to commit suicide.  It will take a great deal of emotional adventure for Charlie to pull him back from the brink of death. (Ironically, though, their adventures consist of Frank teaching Charlie how to live.)  The main power of the movie is that all this happens in a single weekend.  A weekend is a not a long period of time, and the characters are not even the same people they were when it started.  It gives the movie a perceived density.  It is is a great movie, but perhaps does not belong in the category of the greatest movies, because of its contrived Dead Poets Society bookends.  They could be edited down to almost nothing, and the movie would be only the better for it.  The scene where Frank saves Charlie from expulsion might be needed, but it is done as a hollywood cliche. In fact, it falls into the worst of the bad-ending categories: The slow clap (or at least a form of it).  (Also, Pacino's \\"I'll take a flame-thrower to this is place\\" is not needed.  Apparently, he just feels the need to work a line like that into all of his movies. ) <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|In the review for the Special Edition, one writer compared Green Day's latest to The Who's \\"Tommy.\\" As a long-time 'classic rock' listener, though, I have to draw closer comparisons to Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" ... although not quite as epic as Pink's journey from childhood to stardom to self-actualization, a year in the life of St. Jimmy is eerily similar to Roger Waters' mind-trip, with similar motivations and outcomes. Green Day shows an amazing range of influences in this watershed album, building on the themes that shape the rest of their body of work in ways that may be unexpected by some. Perhaps only Green Day could have come up with such a risky project in this \\"age of paranoia,\\" but they do it with a style all their own, tounge firmly planted in cheek. Can't wait to see it performed live in a couple of weeks!
B000002UAX|5.0|I have never written a review before, but I had to after what I just read. Someone wrote that the cover of the white album could have been more original! If I had to critize that, I can't imagine where I would begin.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Filmed in Hebrew is the first major film about the last 12 hours of Jesus Of Nazerth life. Most films wont film the murder the way it was because of the media and many religions find this racist but Mel holds no stops to show the very brutal (i warned you) killing of Jesus. The brutal long torture sequence which includes putting a crown of spikes on Jesus head and numerous whip marks given to Jesus ( and it looks realistic)and of course the crucifixion of Jesus will give its audience the first real look at how Jesus died in all of its gory. <br />Even though this film is in hebrew the film's story is very strong and has a solid cast and a torture seqence which will make all of you think that the world needs to change. <br />Make sure you watch the last minutes of the film where there is a shock to the film. <br />There is also talks of the film returning in a sequal The passion of the ark which shows the ressurection of jesus. <br />Watch this to a see a movie experience like no other.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I was at the library one day, and I was getting a really dorky CD out..........so I grabbed a cool looking CD to put on top of it!! =) hehe  <br />When I got into the car, I started to listen to it out of curiosity- and it turned out that it was REALLY good! <br /> <br />This CD is awesome. I'm not sure which genre it really belongs in, but I think that it is kind of a mix of pop/kinda punk/rock/whatever. It has it's own category! This CD is especially good \\"cleaning your room music.\\" <br /> <br />American Idiot, and Wake Me Up When Summer Ends are probably my favorites- but every singles track on the CD is great-which doesn't happen all the time! <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this CD! It's awesome!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|All I have to say is Brad Pitt nudity scene!  Who cares if the writing is great or not?:)
B00005JMAH|4.0|I thought this movie was exceptable. I did expect it to be a little more faithful to the books. But some parts just threw me off. Like at the END of the movie is when Harry receives his Firebolt. That really threw me off. If they didn't mention it at the correct time, why throw it in at the end of the movie when it makes no sense? The acting was outstanding. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson do it again to captivate the viewers and make them believe that they are Harry, Ron and Hermione. Also, in this movie, Harry has that unstructured, rebel-without-a-cause kind of attitude in this movie, which Daniel has portrayed quite well (also, for all you girls in charge of the Daniel fan club, he's looks really hot in this movie!) One thing in this movie that I really didn't understand was was Alfonso Cuaron wanted to show a \\"romance\\" between Ron and Hermione so early in the movies? That has not showed up in the books at all and I thought that was a bit tacky, and gave away the result of their relationship. Another thing that I noticed is that in almost all of the movie, they are wearing normal clothes, which really takes away the magic of the book in my opinion. Once in a while, sure, but about 95 percent of the time they were wearing normal clothes. That caught my attention. Other than these mistakes and annoyances, I thought this movie was awesome. The chemistry between Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson is great, and I believe they did a fantastic job, and I hope they act in the rest of the movies, given that they are somewhat loyal the the books. More than this movie anyway. But if you are looking to see an exciting adventure and a taste of romance at its roots, this is the movie to see. But if you are a very loyal and faithful Harry Potter addict, I'd just say, be prepared to be a bit angry.
B00003CX5P|5.0|When I read all the negative reviews of this movie, it really surprised me. I went into it expecting a lot, having grown up with the originals, and it easily surpassed all of my expectations. I like it more every time I watch it. Honestly, I have to say I like it better than its counterpart in the original trilogy, A New Hope. There's just so much more to the plot in this movie, and in Attack of the Clones, too. Instead of the old good vs. evil, black and white storyline, we're presented here with a morally ambiguous, politically driven plot which is highly complex. I had to watch the movie several times before I felt I completely understood everything that was going on. Call me strange, but this kind of set-up appeals to me more than something more black-and-white. Seeing how Palpatine manipulates everyone to elevate himself into power is just great to see, especially when the Jedi and the Naboo all think they've won in the end, when really they haven't accomplished anything. Deliciously ironic.     I've heard some other people call it \\"heartless\\", but I don't see that either. For all its over-reliance on CGI and visual 'wow-factor', it is, for me, one of the most human of all the Star Wars movies. All the scenes between Anakin and Qui-Gon, and Anaking and his mother, are really touching, and really sad, given what we know about his character.     As for the people who think the movie is too childish, well, all the Star Wars movies are like this. Even Empire has a lot of pretty silly comic relief. Lucas really hasn't changed much in that vein. Sure, Jar Jar is a pretty superfluous character, but he's there to appeal to the kids, just like the droids did in the originals (since C-3P0 has a really tiny role in this one). I have to say, though, that I don't find Jar Jar annoying at all, and I still don't see how anyone else does, either. (Guess it's all a matter of taste.) And c'mon, how cool is Darth Maul? That lightsaber duel was just incredible to watch.     So inthe end, interesting characters, deep plot, great soundtrack and visual effects.. just a very good setup for the saga overall.
B00008DDXC|5.0|As an avid Harry Potter ADDICT, I thought this movie was truly...EXCELLENT!!! I could not of asked for more in this movie! Sure, they didn't stay completely faithful to the books, but if they did, this movie would be 4 hours long, literally. I thought Chris Columbus did an outstanding job trying to stay as close to the books as possible. Daniel Radcliffe comes back as that burly, underappreciated boy who tries to clear his good name with the help of his two best friends Ron Weasley(Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger(Emma Watson). I really thought they would have messed this movie up a bit, but they didn't. They got it dead on, and in the end, it turned out to hit a box office record! This movie is definetly more entertaining than the 1st only because the actors have developed as well, actors. In the 1st movie, Daniel, Emma and Rupert were a bit shy, a bit on the giddy side, and looked quite ammature. But in this, they looked like they knew what they were talking about, and knew how to make it work, and i'm very proud of them. I also admire them. They have the opportunity to be able to portray characters that are loved all over the world, and they're making good use of it. I thought this movie was one of the greatest I've ever seen. And even the the PoA(prisoner of askaban) was kind of a dissappointment, this movie can definetly make up for it.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|I don't dislike movies often. Most times, I'll see a movie and think either that I'd watch it again or I wouldn't, but I still enjoy it more or less either way. This movie, though, is an exception. To put it as bluntly as I can, it is simply the most God-awful piece of trash I have ever seen in my entire life. It's definately one of the three or four movies I've ever seen that I would consider actively bad.     First of all, it's boring. The movie drags on for hours and nothing particularly interesting happens. I didn't find any of the characters to be particularly interesting or sympathetic. They all just seemed flat and emotionless to me. About the scene where Achilles killed Hector, I was so bored I wanted to leave the theater, and would have if I hadn't been with other people. How they can turn one of the classics of western literature into a bloated sleeper is beyond me. That has to take real talent.    Secondly, the action is bad. Okay, so the whole Achilles taking the guy out with one hit was really cool the first time they showed it, but after a while it just got really annoying. Kind of like the \\"bullet-time\\" thing in the Matrix; really cool the first few times you see it, but it loses something with over-use. The battle sequences themselves are confusing, largely because it's very difficult to tell the Trojans from the Greeks. The battles also feel kind like a poor cross between Lord of the Rings and Gladiator, and it seems like this movie is just trying to ride their success and popularity. The only thing is, the director here obviously doesn't have the eye for this kind of thing the directors of those films did.    The story. This movie is supposed to be based on the Iliad. It even says it is in the credits, but the story has absolutely no resembelence to the original in any way. It takes place at the same location, with most of the same characters, and there's still the Trojan horse (with everything else they changed, I'm surprised they left this in). But everything else is different. The Greek gods not only figure into the original story, but are essential to it. There basically is no story without them, giving you this confused movie. The ten year siege is reduced to the period of about ten days or a week, making much of it not make sense (I guess the screen writers don't understand the concept of a SIEGE, which isn't a battle, but an attempt to starve out an enemy stronghold and force them to surrender.). Also, what's the deal with Patroclus being Achilles' cousin? They're not cousins in the original. Just kinda bugs me. The changes in general wouldn't bother me too much, except that the movie almost seems to be mocking the original at times, such as when the characters are made to look foolish for having faith in the gods, etc. Also, I have to say that I did not need to see that much of Brad Pitt.    There are a couple good points about the movie. Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean are very good as Priam and Oddyseus, respectively (although I prefer Armande Asante as Oddyseus in NBC's production of The Oddysey a few years ago), and there are a few times when the movie ties into the mythology. When Paris kills Achilles and shoots him in the heel, that was a nice touch, since in the poem, that was his one vulnerable spot. I also liked the end when Paris gave his sword to Aeneus(sp?) and tells him to lead the survivors away. This is a reference to Virgil's The Aeneid, essentially the Roman version of the story in which Virgil claims the Romans are decended from Aeneus and the Trojan refugees. However, these references to the mythology only make the parts where it is left out or seemingly disparaged all the more baffling and annoying. It's like the people making the film couldn't decide how far they wanted to deviate from the original.    If you're interested in the kind of movie, I'd suggest getting Gladiator, or even the old NBC version of the Oddysey, both of which are far superior and much more entertaining than thismess.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I saw this movie only on DVD, cause like most, I though the movie was going to lame as hell. But after viewing it and just falling in love with the karate and sword fighting that just got me so into, I was fooled, this movie was excellent.  Uma, Vivica, and Lucy should have gotten Oscar nods, cause it's not everyday you see women kick this much (...).  Good job, Q.T.!
B0000062GK|5.0|Rasberry Jam Delta-V, Up in the Sky, and House Full of Bullets are alone worth the price of admission.    The lead guitar in Rasberry is just so alluring that if it were the carrot, I would walk of a cliff in pursuit of it with no knowledge of my misstep.    The first time I heard House FoB, I really couldn't react to it because it was so new and powerful. And I have been listening to Satch for a long, long time. *Paralyzed*    Crystal Planet is clearly (to me) the lead-in for Engines of Creation. With that song, Joe leaves the planet and does not return until Strange Beautiful Music.    This album is what you would expect from the person who is responsible for The Extremist, only it's plainly obvious that his imagination grew by leaps and bounds over those years. This is Surfing's older brother (in the sense that it is defining), a bit directionless but with an attitude and clearly showing that Satch is capable of kicking ass at will.
B000060OFT|1.0|The Bard spins in his grave over this movie: the only thing I can think of that could rival the cringe-inducing factor of every scene involving either of the woefully miscast leads (when I say \\"miscast\\" it's with the underlying expectation that anyone performing in a work by the greatest writer in the history of the English language should be able to act) would be Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's laughable performances as romantic leads in Star Wars Episode II. <br /> <br />Run, don't walk, to pick up Zefferelli's 1968 version if you want to see how R & J can translate well to the big screen; avoid this version like the plague.
0374172897|5.0|If you are a fan of long rambling novels full of characters and scenes superfluous to the plot, then this is probably not the novel for you.  Multilayered and spanning the better part of the last century, \\"The Hours\\" is a beautifully articulated exercise in imagination and literary economy.  Author Michael Cunningham has fashioned a triptych of stories dealing with three women - a writer, a reader and a character - in a stunning hommage to his favorite writer, Virginia Woolf, and his favorite novel and literary character \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"<br /><br />This novel, a Pulitzer Prize winner, is a masterpiece of succinctly expressed thoughts and ideas - each absolutely subervient and germane to the plot.  \\"The Hours\\" is a uniquely rendered work, eloquent, compelling and compassionate.  Novels of this quality don't come along often, perhaps only once in a generation.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am a liberal.  I make no bones about it.  But I believe that the role of the press is to provide unbiased and accurate information about the political process.  Moore, though not unbiased, does give an accurate account of the current events surrounding the war on Iraq. <br /> <br />Even I, a self proclaimed liberal, was a little unsettled by the release of this film.  I feared that it might be a proganda film, filled with inaccuracies.  My fears were quickly quelled.  There is no doubt that Moore only exposed that which he wanted us to see.  In the opening seqence he showed Gore winning a variety of states but failed to show a single state (besides Florida) being called for Bush. <br /> <br />Everything he did show, however, was accurate to the best of my knowledge.  Moore did not engage in any of the silly accusations of the recently retired CIA agent that accused the administration of blackmailing the CIA into presenting false intelligence or any other wild accusatisions.  Intsead he focused on the Bush family's ties to the Saudis. <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 911 is also informative.  I watch and/or read some form of news media nearly every day but there still many facts presented that I did not know previous to watching this film.  Worth the learning experience.
B00005JMUA|5.0|WOW... is the only word that came out of my mouth after i saw this brilliant movie.... Uma did it again... she really did not kick as much butt in this movie but she still did her thang...  <br /> <br />I think i like this movie much more than the first one is because of the DEPTH... the acting in this one was some of the best i've seen ever... I like Daryl hannah as a villian... It answered tons of questions on everyones mind... \\"Elle vs. I\\" is the best chapter in the whole KILL BILL saga...PERIOD!!!! <br /> <br />I love the way they ended to movie... i did not want the fight between BIll and THE BRIDE to be so long and overdone... it was quick and to the point.... <br /> <br />The KILL BILL saga is the best series i have seen... the last good series was maybe AUSTIN POWERS or INDIANA JONES... to be completely honest way way way way way way better than the MATRIX series.... you will not waste your money if you like action, drama, depth, and gore....
B000002UB6|5.0|If you are a Beatle fan (and I'm assuming you are) buy this album and get Let It Be Naked and compare and contrast. Maybe Phil Spector was wrong. Maybe McCartney was wrong. Maybe you'll just love them both and Dig It. I'm no critic. The music is all that really matters.
B000062YAZ|5.0|For once the All Music Guide is right.  Somehow the critics at the AMG found their way out of the church of `60's rock and found a part of the modern world. Along with Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Kill `Em All,\\" Slayer's \\"Reign in Blood\\" also got a five star rating from the AMG.    Like Metallica and Sepultura, Slayer really can't be considered pure metal.  They were one of the first to walk the fine line between hardcore punk and heavy metal without falling into either classification easily.    \\"Reign in Blood\\" sounds like a heavy metal band who decided to do a punk album.  When they released this album in 1986, there weren't many bands who were willing to take the risk of mixing those two genres so blatantly.  Lyrically, this album marked the point where Slayer would move away from the typical Satan and black magic themes of heavy metal and start singing of real life horrors, such as the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele (\\"Angel of Death\\"), serial killers (\\"Criminally Insane\\"), and confronting the fear of death in general (\\"Necrophobic\\").  Just like a punk band, they wanted to confront reality that nobody else wanted to see.  Of course they still had a few songs about Satan (\\"Altar of Sacrifice,\\" \\"Raining Blood\\") and black magic (\\"Reborn\\").  In the 1980's, when the \\"moral majority\\" ruled and there were countless exposes (by such prestigious men like Geraldo Rivera) in the media feeding the hysteria around Satanism, and it was Slayer's duty to give the \\"moral majority\\" and the media the middle finger with the tributes to Satan.  It could be said, at that point in time, singing about Satan was very punk.  However, they are at their best when they directly attack the conformity and false promises of Christianity on \\"Jesus Saves.\\"  That song makes it clear that they're coming from an atheist point of view.  The cover of \\"Reign in Blood\\" was also a little different from the average metal band.  While most metal bands' Satanic cover art looked like a cartooish doodlingof some teenage stoner in his high school notebook, Slayer's art work looked more like a Mediaeval painting by Leonardo Da Vinci depicting hell.  The metal element of this mix comes through in the music.  All the musicians are skilled, but they don't get caught up in self-indulgent musical showmanship like most all other metal bands.  Being overly technical will drain the excitement right out of the music quicker than anything else.  Slayer avoids that pitfall but doesn't over simplify their music like hardcore bands.  The high speed of the record is absolutely exhilarating.  The way they race through songs is like being chased by the threatening characters they sing about.  It's a perfect match.  The solos sound as if they've lost control of their guitars.  They scream in a chaotic, uncontrolled way that sounded like nothing else in metal at the time.  Slayer reserves the heaviness for the parts where it can really stand out.  In \\"Angel of Death\\" speed along, hit a brick wall, and then let you feel it with an ultra heavy riff.  The same happens in \\"Raining Blood\\" they begin with an ultra heavy riff and then fly off into absolute chaos, then comeback to where they started.  Once again, Slayer steers clear of overkill.  Vocalist Tom Araya's vocals are purely hardcore punk shouts, which is a much better match for the music than some wannabe opera singer like most other metal bands had.  The only hint of traditional metal is the opening scream on the album.  Otherwise, he attacks in a no bullsh*t  manner, concentrating on content rather than delivery.   \\"Reign in Blood\\" will make most people uncomfortable because it doesn't fit into any neat category.  They were too technical to be punk, too reckless to be metal.  It's true art when musicians set out to please themselves and not a group of people with preconceived notions of what the band should do.  That seems what Slayer was doing here.
B00000K3G8|5.0|It's true, to really appreciate this album, you have to see the film. And that's no chore. Stop Making Sense is probably the best concert film ever made. It's hard to imagine just listening to the album without thinking of Byrne's amazing stage presence (in or out of the big suit). <br /> <br />The Special Edition is the entire film soundtrack (minus some stage banter and the cut performances of \\"Cities\\" and \\"I Zimbra\\"). Their imagination made Talking Heads one of the greatest live bands of all time. The songs are mostly from SPEAKING IN TONGUES, but they also include interesting and in some cases superior versions of songs from all of their albums prior to 1983 with the help of the Tom Tom Club. <br /> <br />In addition to STOP MAKING SENSE, I recommend the newly released CD version of THE NAME OF THIS BAND IS TALKING HEADS. Listening to both would map eight years of live performances and barely short of 4 hours of live material.
B00005JMX6|5.0|This became instantly one of my favorite, rented it two nights ago and bought it yesterday.  Every boys dream come true, but I found both Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert had great chemistry.  What a great story about growing as a person, about changing, about love.  Elisha Cuthbert was gorgeous and charming perfect in her role. Too bad that the critic didn't like it.  The squeeze was worth the juice.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I was never brought up on country or folk music. The fact that Trent Resnor wrote one of the songs piqued my interest. The whole album is great, whether or not you like country.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|First of all, you are probably wondering how such a great film could have flyed so long under the radar.  Unfortunately, 'Donnie Darko' is a victim of timing - the original release date was just 6 weeks after 9/11 and one of the majory plot points was eerily reminescent of another catastophe that happend immediately thereafter. <br /> <br />From the two separate commentary tracks, you learn that Drew Barrymore \\"god-mothered\\" the production of this first major film by writer and director, Richard Kelly, and because the budget was a measly $4 million, the project became a true labor of love incredible cast, which includes Jena Malone, Jake Gylennhal, and his sister Maggie (who would put in a tour de force a year later with 'Secretary'), Noel Wylie, Mary O'Donnell, and Patrick Swayze.  This odd combination of one part comedy, two parts sci-fi comic, and three parts drama, which one reviewer described as David Lynch meets John Hughes, works.  The plot is refreshingly subtle, refusing to hit you over the head like its Hollywood-ized counterpart, 'Butterfly Effect', which arrived almost two years later.   <br /> <br />From the 20 revealing deleted/extended scenes, you realize that the film could have been much less secular and a better movie as a \\"Director's Cut\\".  Also, a physical version of 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' book (which explains much of the underlying world in this thriller) should have included in the package, as the pages on the DVD on illegible.   <br /> <br />SPOILER BEGINNING:  The writing is fantastic for a first time director, but having viewed the DVD in its entirety, I do have a problem with one of the plot points:  we know Donnie is highly intelligent and sleepwalks, but the script never really reveals Donnie's \\"super powers\\" (aside from the implication in the facts surrounding the trashing of the school), and as such, the fact that he is ACTING telekinetically to pull down the jet engine into the portal (as indicated by the writer/director) is completely lost on the viewer. <br />SPOILER END.
0143034448|2.0|I very rarely put down a book before finishing it, even if I don't like it.  This one was impossible for me to read, though, and even though I tried, I could only get a quarter of the way through it (200 pages) before I decided life is just too short for such aggravation.      I wanted this to be one of those books that you can get lost in and sticks with you once it's over...it's very long, spans many years in the lives of the characters, interesting plot idea, definitely seemed to fit the bill of a pleasurable read.  It didn't turn out to be one of those books, however.  To begin with, it's slow.  On top of that, the story unfolds through a narrator (the author I suppose) who goes off on tangents unrelated to the story, making personal observations on people and life and society in general that last for paragraphs and even pages. Very frustrating!  The book would have been half as long if the author had stuck to what we wanted to read about...the story.    I gave this book 2 stars instead of one because I can see how the story itself would be an engaging one.  Too bad the author's own voice torpedoed it.    Edited: I finally picked up Vanity Fair again and forced myself to finish it.  I hate leaving anything undone and couldn't leave the book unfinished. I still love the actual story and I still have no patience for the interminable narrative.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This documentary should be mandatory for everyone going to the polls this year. Just to be fair, sure watch Fahrenhype also. The conservatives don't like this film because they have become so comfortable watching the republican owned biased news channels. News channels are classifed as \\"media\\", movies are classified as \\"entertainment\\". This film should not be your deciding factor on Nov. 2, there are tons and tons (more than for any other president) of other books, websites, debates, and news sources where you can find truthful information on the wrong doings of the very incompetent President Bush. Funny how one reviewer mentioned Clinton's affair! Ah I don't think this should-have-been-very-private act could possibly compare to the numerous massive mistakes done by the Bush Adminstration! Clinton may have lied, but nobody died! I recommend this film to anybody who is open-minded!
B00004T9VY|5.0|This album is steeped in nostalgia for me, but more important the songs on this particular album are so poinient and clear. I found the songs to be a combination of heart and strength, and possibly a catharsis for the inner turmoil he was experiencing at this juncture in his life, but then again, what authentic singer/songwriter doesn't use music to regain ground being surrounded by the constant internal and external pressures that come with being brilliant.  <br /> <br />This album really shows Cat's colors and they are soft and warm and bold all at once. Obviously, one of my favorites
B00000IL1K|5.0|The first song of this album is In Paradisium and that's where this lovely CD will take you! <br /> <br />I also really like the title trac!  It makes me think of someone who is very dear to me and is no longer a part of my life. <br /> <br />I also really like Dust In The Wind!  If you like Sarah, you should  love this CD!
B0000AQVCL|3.0|I really want to give this album 4 or 5 stars but I just can't. The thing is that I saw Jet at the Annandale Hotel in Sydney a few months before they started attracting all of the hype that now surrounds them. They were playing to about 50-100 people and the weren't even headlining - they were the second act on a bill of three. Anyway, halfway through their set, I looked over to my friend and we were both speechless. These guys were amazing - the energy of the show and the songs, what great tunes!! We didn't even stay for the last act - we left, knowing that we had seen a band that was going to be really special (probably the best gig I have ever been to where I didn't know what to expect). In the months that followed, anticipation grew for their debut album, but when it finally arrived it was kind of a let down. On the plus side, it's clear that \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\\" is one of the best and most exciting singles of the last five years, or even decade. There are some other great rockers like \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" and \\"Last Chance\\", but overall the album is weighed down too heavily by ballads. About half of the album is taken up by the slower songs and it simply doesn't work because these are not the band's strength. These guys are not the Rolling Stones and at this stage in their career they can't pull off a \\"Wild Horses\\" - songs like \\"Radio Song\\" and \\"Look What You've Done\\" are pale imitations. So ironically, the problem with this album is that it doesn't rock enough. When it does, it threatens to be spectacular and the potential of the band shines through. On that night at the Annandale, I don't remember them playing one ballad - if they did, they certainly didn't play more than one or two. This album should have been just all out, kick-arse rockers from start to finish and it would have been fantastic. Instead, they play too much to their weaknesses. Even on the rockers, they haven't quite captured the rush of seeing them live (with the exception of \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl?\\"). So, it's a good album, but ultimately a disappointment when I remember how blown away I was when I saw them live. I'll treasure that memory and hope that in the future they can capture that on record.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Notice that while a few Bush supporters complain in their typical vociferous, name-calling style, this DVD gets an overall rating of 4 stars. Do yourself a favor: watch this before Nov. 2 and make your own judgment. It's a powerful film.
B000005Z0E|4.0|When Tupac Shakur dropped his solo debut, \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" in 1991, he was far from the controversial media target that he would become during his final years. His biggest claim to fame at this point was his show-stealing verse on Digital Underground's \\"Same Song\\". Aiming to establish himself as his own identity outside of the group while still staying true to those who opened the door for his career, Pac teamed with Shock G to give people a taste of what he had to offer as a solo star.<br /><br />\\"2Pacalypse Now\\" isn't quite on the level of such classic debuts as Nas' \\"Illmatic\\" and Biggie's \\"Ready To Die\\" or even Pac's later work on \\"Me Against The World\\" but it is still a very overlooked album in its own right. Sure, Pac doesn't have the lyrical ability of someone like Nas or the tremendous flow of a Notorious B.I.G. but his gift for painting powerfully poetic pictures with his words is unmatched by even the most elite of his rapping peers. While \\"2Pacalypse\\" put Pac on the hit list of many angry politicians for his angry \\"f--k the system\\" approach, the same critics never bothered to look deeper at the social commentary he was providing. While tracks like \\"Souljah's Story\\" and \\"Trapped\\" are rooted in the rage of hungry ghetto youth, \\"If My Homie Calls\\" showcases Pac's undying loyalty for his comrades. Pac also dedicates a great deal of this album to talking about the problems facing black females with cuts like \\"Part Time Mutha\\" and \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\". The latter of which could be considered his most female-friendly song next to \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\".<br /><br />\\"2Pacalypse Now\\" did cause an outrage amongst white America. It may have scared politicans far worse than albums like Ice Cube's \\"Amerikka's Most Wanted\\" and N.W.A.'s \\"Straight Outta Compton\\" for the simple fact that it wasn't just screaming anti-authority anthems, it was detailing the problems in many poor urban communities and forcing people to deal with them. It challenged all of the hypocritical world leaders to look at what they created and account for it. While it might not go down as Pac's most beloved work, \\"2Pacalypse\\" is certainly groundbreaking in its own right.world leaders to look at what they created and account for it.

B00005JNEI|4.0|I can see why conservatives, especially religious right conservatives would be very angry at this film. Moore is clearly not playing by the rules.  He does ask some very good questions, even though he goes overboard on several issues like the possible Bush/Saudi connection, the congressmen who don't put their kids in the military or Bush's military friend who later represented the Bin Ladens.   <br /> <br />He does ask questions that many of us are afraid to ask and to ask those questions, I think, makes a democracy healthier and stronger.  Michael is clearly worried about the health of our democracy and what vision this president has in sending our troops to Iraq, when there may not be a solid plan in place, or a plan not based on solid evidence.   <br /> <br />The movie didn't always make logical sense but the movie made me feel, and that is what GREAT movies do, they make you feel deeply.   <br /> <br />
B00005AQGH|5.0|It's no secret that \\"Makaveli\\" was a pseudonym for controversial rapper Tupac Shakur and with his infamous alter ego, he crafted his final album while still breathing. Recorded in seven days and released less than two months after his death, \\"Don Killumanati\\" is very eery in that it almost seems like a premonition of Shakur's fatal downfall. As \\"Makaveli\\", Pac seems at his most powerful and poignant. While it is probably best remembered for its angry content with Pac taking violent retribution against his enemies on the opening track, \\"Bomb First\\" and subsequent outro, \\"Against All Odds\\", there is more to this album than nightmarish diss tracks. The ominious \\"Hail Mary\\" hits like a sack of bricks as Makaveli sounds like he's rhyming from beyond the grave complete with a chilling chorus. The more laid-back \\"Krazy\\" as a more peaceful and subdued Shakur flowing with Bad Azz over a much less hostile beat. \\"White Man'z World\\" is a return to the Tupac who charmed the ladies with \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" and \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\". We see more of this on \\"Hold Ya Head\\", his shout-out to all the incarcerated soldiers. As if to further showcase his versatility, Makaveli comes with some party cuts as well. He holds it down as the only rapper on the R&B-dominated single, \\"Toss It Up\\" and once again shows love for California on \\"To Live & Die In L.A.\\". Perhaps the biggest highlight on the LP however is \\"Me And My Girlfriend\\", a love ballad for guns with Shakur expressing his undying affection for said weapon. The song inspired Jay-Z to cover it poorly in a watered-down duet with Beyonce Knowles in 2002. Makaveli's \\"7 Day Theory\\" is Pac at his most raw and probably his finest work (with the possible exception of \\"Me Against The World\\").
0743216458|5.0|The Second World War lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved many nations in the world in so that we called it the Second World War. Also, it is the war which brought heavy destruction and causalities to the all mankind. This book, Band of Brothers, is talking about one small part of the history, the history of Second World War. It talks about the Easy Company of the 506th regiment, 101st Airborne. It talks about the history of this group of man. Compare to the amount of men who were participated in the Second World War, Easy Company were just the little part of them. However, by reading of this book, you will know about how close their relationship is. They suffered under the harsh training by Captain Sobel, got the paratrooper qualification, dropped in the dark zone and fought. They stand firm; they faced and fought under the worst condition that they never imagined before and the most important point is that, they done those stuffs together as a unit, Easy Company. I am totally impressed by all the things above and as we know, there are the TV series of this book. I watched it before I read this book. I found that the TV series is the compressed version of this book and I think that both of them are worth to read and watch. Though this book, I know how worse is the war. But, by this book, I can figure out how a group of man can work out the best performance. Maybe, such kind of performance only can be found during the war period. <br />
B000005Z0G|4.0|With his second LP, Tupac Shakur hit 'em where it hurt once again. Having been attacked both verbally and physically since his first solo, \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" was released, Pac used his sophomore project to express how he felt about how the media was portraying him. In typical Pac fashion, he wasn't holding his tounge for anyone. \\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.\\" opens with Pac's adrenaline-filled \\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\\" where the young Mr. Shakur calls for black youth to step up and fight back against its opposition. In another area of the album on \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\", Pac shows his tender side by givng it up for all of the sisters. This will probably be remembered as Pac's most sensitive track, next to \\"Dear Mama\\" which showed up on his next album, \\"Me Against The World\\". Just because Pac was showing love for the ladies didn't mean he wasn't gonna show his freaky side on tracks like \\"I Get Around\\" where he celebrated being a player and the lifestyle that came with it. Pac's anger came out quite a bit on \\"Strictly\\", whether it was straight-forward on \\"Souljah's Revenge\\" where he calls police \\"the biggest gang of niggaz in the city\\" or disguised in the sadness of an unwanted child on the emotional \\"Papa'z Song\\". While still young to the rap game, Pac showed he could hold his own next to veterans like Ice Cube and Ice-T on \\"Last Wordz\\" and with Treach of Naughty By Nature on \\"5 Deadly Venomz\\". \\"Strictly\\" wasn't exactly Pac's most complete album but a lot of it had less to do with Pac's writing and more to do with his choice of production.
B00005K9QP|5.0|This was the record that introduced many of us to the Les Paul + overdriven Marshall sound.  But there's even more here.  The solos, notes, phrasing, slight bends are simply perfect.  This was the sort of playing that earned EC the high ranking he enjoys to this day.<br /><br />How, I ask, can someone listen to this passionate, intense playing and reconcile it with You Look Wonderful Tonight or I Shot The Sheriff?  Of course artists need to evolve but what he does now is to me, inexcusable.  My friends say he's still got it and I hear an occasional flash of brilliance but not often.<br /><br />So enjoy it for what it was--but these days, Eric Johnson sounds more like Eric Clapton, than Eric Clapton.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Amidst one of the most controversial periods in his life and career, Tupac Shakur was bailed out of prison by Suge Knight and signed to Knight's legendary Death Row label. Within just a few weeks, he had finished a hard-hitting double-album (the first by a rap artist) and was ready to ride for Tha Row. With every major Death Row artist playing a part in its creation, \\"All Eyez\\" was an album of epic preportions.<br /><br />The first disc of \\"All Eyez\\" features all-star collaborations with Dr. Dre (\\"California Love\\" remix), Snoop Doggy Dogg (\\"2 Of Amerikka's Most Wanted\\"), Nate Dogg (\\"All About U\\", \\"Skadalous\\") and Tha Dogg Pound to name a few. Pac also showed love for underground artists from the Bay like Dru Down, Rappin' 4-Tay, and C-Bo. Pac showed his versatility as an artist by mixing hardcore anthems like \\"Ambitionz As A Ridah\\" with more laid-back tracks like \\"I Ain't Mad At Cha\\". Most of the well-known singles from \\"All Eyez\\" can be found on the first disc.<br /><br />The second half of \\"All Eyez\\" is the more universally slept-on side. Disc two features the introduction of the Outlawz on \\"When We Ride\\". \\"Holla At Me\\" is Pac speaking on those friends who abandoned him in his time of need. Many would say this one is directed at Notorious B.I.G. but is far more subtle than the explosive \\"Hit Em' Up\\" which he recorded shortly after finishing this album. Disc two opens with a hell of a gem. It's another Tupac-Dr. Dre collaboration but it never got the mainstream attention of their first duet, \\"California Love\\". Pac's explosive commentary seems to go well with Dre's funk-inspired production on \\"Can't C Me\\". Hearing this track makes me wish the two could have collaborated a bit more before Dre's falling out with Death Row. Tossing P-funk legend, George Clinton in the mix makes things all that much sweeter. Pac's \\"Wonder Why They Call U B--ch\\" is his answer to the critics who question his need to downplay females on wax. He uses his pen wisely to address the difference between the gold-diggers he disses and the real women he speaks on in songs like \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\" and \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\". \\"Check Out Time\\" is a fun little morning-after anthem with Kurupt and Big Syke contributed verses to some laid-back Johnny \\"J\\" production.<br /><br />\\"All Eyez On Me\\" is a star-studded blow-out. Even the songs that never became hit singles had the potential to be. While \\"disc one\\" is the more radio-friendly party stuff. \\"Disc two\\" caters more to the hardcore Pac fans. There is a little bit of something for everyone on here. While often regarded by fans as his best album, \\"All Eyez\\" doesn't quite match up with his previous \\"Me Against The World\\" or the proceeding \\"Makaveli\\" LP though it's still a classic in its own right.erence between the gold-diggers he disses and the real women he speaks on in songs like \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\" and \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\". \\"Check Out Time\\" is a fun little morning-after anthem with Kurupt and Big Syke contributed verses to some laid-back Johnny \\"J\\" production.  <br /> <br />\\"All Eyez On Me\\" is a star-studded blow-out.

B00006J3WH|5.0|I've been a fan of the series Buffy for a while now (and by extension Angel). It is a show that really grows on you, if you are willing to see under the surface of it.   When the episode \\"Once more with feeling\\" aired over here in sweden, I for one was very unsure about it. I've seen this before; musical episodes. It may or may not work.     But to be honest it took me with complete surprise. This ep. might be one of the best in all seven seasons. I do not buy soundtrack albums often, and even less often by the spur of a moment. But I did so in this case.     The CD is all that I expected. The cover booklet is very well made and consistent with the theme.   you get 23 tracks in total but only 19 are connected to the ep. in question. The rest are from other well chosen episodes (also good by the way).     There are many gems on this cd. Several of the cast can really sing well and over all both music and lyrics are well above good. But a few songs really shines bright. Tracks like: \\"Through the motions\\", \\"What you feel\\", \\"Under you spell\\", \\"walk through the fire\\" or \\"something to sing about\\" are super strong melodies.  Amber Bensons (as Tara to Willow) song is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time. It captures the emotions perfectly and it's all but impossible not to feel all warm and fuzzy inside...and it really gets stuck in your mind too. Brilliant!     I've played this cd many times now, as well as looked at the ep. on VCR too.   It has been said that Buffy is one of the best tv shows ever made, and you might agree or not, but this episode from season 6 and it't soundtrack will go down into the history of television - be sure of it! If nothing else in the eyes and ears of the many fans out there!     So in short: if you at all like the show you probably will love this cd. No question...
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are really that great in this movie, and no surprise there. Two of the best actors in the world today.  <br /> <br />But : <br /> <br />It doesn't take you long to reveal the plot, does it? In the beginning of the movie we hear two boys call 991, \\"Your name, son?\\" the police ask - \\"He wants to know her name\\" the boy tells \\"someone\\" - hmmm... <br /> <br />Wouldn't cops in the USA check out the anymonous call a little closer when they start their investigation. In the end (!) this call reveals it all, there is no grown man the police should be after. A major weakness to the story, and I realize I am not the only one to notice this, of course - or am I picky here? <br /> <br />Anyway : <br /> <br />Overall this movie is very, very well done - great camera-work, acting - and that behind a very tense and gripping story.
B00005JNEI|5.0|In several interviews, director Michael Moore has said that his main objective in making any movie is entertainment -- a film he would like to sit down and watch on a Saturday night.  He has overwhelmingly succeeded with F 9/11, a beautiful picture that is far more cinematic than the political hype gives it credit for.  The narrative is thoughtful, the music harrowing, the construction symbolic.  Every movie has a message -- be it about superheros, a dinosaur park, or aliens.  The fact that Moore's message is about the real world that we live in only makes it a more powerful cinematic experience.
B0000AUHPB|3.0|About 5 years ago the British Film Institute ran a poll of the greatest British films of all-time.  This film placed high in the poll, above the likes of \\"A Hard Days Night\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" to name a few. \\"Empire\\", the British film magazine, on the DVD release of the film called it a \\"bank holiday classic\\".  Let's just say that while this is far from a bad film, something must be lost in the translation.  This film concerns itself with an elaborate plot to steal gold bullion from a military convoy through the crowded streets of Turin, Italy during a football match between the U.K. and Italy.  The caper itself is amazingly well crafted.  The crew's escape through a traffic jam in British Mini Coopers is even more impressive.  What this film lacks in my mind is any characters that would give you some emotional attachment.  Michael Caine is the star here and leader of the crew and he is suave, but a little too detached for my liking.  The American remake that came out last year did a better job at crafting empathetic characters.  On a final note this film has a strange cliffhanger ending that will leave you scratching your head.

B000063UR1|3.0|I first saw this film at a repertory movie house in the early eighties and enjoyed it immensely.  Seeing it again for the first time in over twenty years my enthusiasm for \\"Silent Running\\" has waned some.  On the positive side, Bruce Dern, one of my favorite actors from the seventies, gives a compelling performance as Freeman Lowell, a botanist aboard a commercial space mission to preserve what remains of Earth's forest life.  The special effects, even some thirty years later, are still impressive.  My problem is the basic message of the film.  Are we to take the actions of Lowell to preserve the forest as the act of a sociopath or are they perfectly acceptable given the circumstances? The movie is not clear to me which position it takes.  This film was made in 1971 and the conservation movement, radical or otherwise, may not have been averse to prescribing murder as a means of preserving the ecology.  One of the characters in the movie, which I'm assuming takes place at the turn of our current century, states that everybody on Earth is content and the ecology is the least of anybody's concerns.  Did this film predict the current attitudes about the ecology(though we are far from content)?  On a final note look for a young Ron Rifkin (a.k.a Arvin Sloane from T.V.'s \\"Alias) as one of the doomed crew members.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Great movie for anyone who can sympathize with a boy who can't grow up.  Some dialog was not taken from Barrie's novel, but it fit in perfectly.  \\"Sir, you offend reason.  I should like to offend it with you!\\"  Its a heartwarming family film featuring several young, nearly undressed, athletic boys.  Some moments really layed the love story on thick, and even alluded to some inappropriate content (Peter and Wendy both look down, roughly in the area of Peter's midsection, then smile at each other).  Either way, the DVD has an alternate ending that is less sad than the theatrical ending, but I prefer the original.  Kids don't seem to appreciate as much as adults do, perhaps because a small amount of the language is complex (read: British).  Overall a great film that brings out the kid in everyone.
B0000CABBW|4.0|See this film if the only reason is to see the hertbeakingly luminous performance of young Keisha Castle-Hughes.  The film concerns a young Maori girl whose mother dies in childbirth and subsequently reared by her grandparents.  Her grandfather, who is steadfast in keeping to the tradition of male leadership, rejects her.  Desiring to be accepted by her grandfather, the young girl learns the tribal arts by her somewhat ne'erdowell uncle.  This still does not sit well with her grandfather and it is only when it is learned of her ability to commune with nature, particularly the whales, is she accepted as an equal among the men of her tribe.  As stated before, Castle-Hughes gave a performance that was deserving of the Oscar nomination that she received.  It's about time the Academy started a separate category for juveniles instead of having them compete with seasoned actors.  The story here is utterly engaging and the cinematography here is excellent, but then, the scenery is beautiful.
B00005JMUA|2.0|I wish more time was taken to improve this flick, becuase it fell short of the first in many regards.  I was somewhat disappointed, but I did go in to the movie without low expectations (it is a Tarantino film, after all).   <br />     First, I think we all remember what happened in the first movie, we don't need a whole cheesy explanation in the beginning.  You could have at least given us a seperate narrarator, we don't need Uma Therman talking to the camera, it detracts from the film.   <br />     Next, the style wasn't bad, black and white in some scenes works for me... to a limited extent, but some people (David Carrandine) don't have the face for such high detail.   <br />     Holy mother of God, did she just fly?  This was the first time I almost got up and left.  You'll know it when you see it, its just terrible. <br />     Pai Mei is the worst character ever.  I mean it, he is awful, he has some crazy magic powers, and this time I really stood up and started walking away, but my friends made me sit down and watch more.   <br />     Elle's other eye scene is hott.  Trust me on this one.  The Bride vs. Elle (Darryl Hannah) is the best fight in the movie.   <br />     The scene with the latino guy is pointless and serves no purpose other than filler. <br />     The end battle is totally anti-climactic and left me wanting more.  It was lame, and uneventful.  There was no twist, no shock, no excitement, and I consider it a cop-out.   <br />     Overall, I think the movie could have been better if a good 95% of it were just edited out.  I'm serious, it made me want to cry that it was soooo disappointing compared to the first.
B00005JKN9|4.0|This film should have been the one that delivered the Oscar gold to Martin Scorsese.  It has many of the elements in place.  Good ensemble acting(in one case, great), breathtaking art direction, costumes, and cinematography.  The one thing the film lacked was a cohesive script and ultimately that was the heart of this film.  The screenplay is credited to multiple contributors which usually is not a good sign.  Ostensibly the film concerns itself with the turf wars between the \\"natives\\" and the recent Irish emigres in New York in the mid-nineteenth century.  One of the Irish, Amsterdam Vallon, vows revenge against one of the natives, William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Cutting for the murder of his father.  To do so he has to first gain the confidence of Bill and infiltrate his gang.  There is also a love triangle involving Amsterdam, Bill, and Jenny, a pickpocket.  Interspersed  throughout the film various historical figures pop up(Boss Tweed, Horace Greeley,P.T. Barnum) as well as allusions to historical events (Tammany Hall scandals, the Civil War draft riots).  The film probably should have focused more on the central conflict between Amsterdam and Bill and less so on these peripheral issues.  As Amsterdam and Jenny, Leonardo DiCaprio give adequate performances.  The revelation here is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher.  Lewis embodies the villainy and brutality of Bill completely.  One chilling scene in the film is one where Bill relates how he gouged out his own eye after losing to a superior opponent in a turf fight.
B00006FDCJ|1.0|Did not enjoy
B00005JMAH|5.0|Cuaron was definitely in the right when making the changes he did!  Columbus himself said he was too big a fan of the book, so he struggled to stuff as much material as he could into the movie.  As a result, Chamber of Secrets especially, the films had to move at a breathless, hurried pace, with the actors themselves even seeming out of breath.  Cuaron takes an objective approach to the film; he only wants to make a great movie, not to faithfully filmize the books.  I am as big a fan of the books as anyone (i've read each book at least twice) but theres a line as to how faithful a movie can be before its not a good movie anymore.<br /><br />As for the \\"normal clothes\\" issue, I thought that made the characters more emotionally accessible, as Rowlings books are more about coming of age and friendship than the magic itself, which just serves as a humorous and interesting backdrop. I know the ending was a bit silly, but it was unexpected! exciting! You remember the end of COS!  It was awful! Very sappy and misleading  (about the harry/hermione thing).  I thought the Ron/Hermione touches were great fan service and foreshadowing, though perhaps a little to obvious lol.  The one complaint:  even though she isn't more prevalent in the story until later books, Cho Chang first appeared in book 3, so I think she should have at least appeared as a cameo or something. But alas! of all the great things about this movie thats a minor gripe.<br /><br />People!  The purpose of a film is to give a new take on a book; to make new people interested in the story.  I know this film did that for me; when I didn't care about HP as much as I did like right after the first film.  Columbus's films had at least as many changes as this one did, so get off Cuaron's back!<br /><br />I can't wait to see how Goblet of Fire turns out, under the helm of Mike Newell.
B00005ATQ9|3.0|Here is Stanley Kubrick's most beautiful and eloquent film, taken from the novel by Thackery, of an 18th century slacker turned hustler turned wealthy denizen who ends up the same way he started -- poor, uneducated and living in squalor. It is a morality tale to compete with those of that other great English novelist, Dickens.<br /><br />The story involves Barry's attempts at romance, which tend to backfire, his departure from home, travels, involvement in European wars, involvement with a thief and, finally, his marriage to the Duchess of Lyndon, from whom he gets his name. This is where his life begins to go backward in a never ending spiral of betrayal, promiscuity, brutality and overspending.<br /><br />Filmed in natural lighting in fine European settings, this is Kubrick's most opulent and staggeringly beautiful film. Its story is so eloquently told it is difficult to find fault. Two things, in my mind, separate this film from a typically great film: casting and the use of music.<br /><br />To this day I still don't understand why Kubrick cast Ryan O'Neal in the lead. Here is a one-dimensional actor that could not find a second dimiension even with this wonderful script and when being directed by the world's greatest filmmaking genius. Even though I enjoy this flim enormously, I always wonder what it could have been had an actor the stature of Jack Nicholson or Robert DeNiro played Barry.<br /><br />My second complaint is the way the music is done in this film. People that have seen \\"Dr Strangelove\\", \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\" or \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" know Kubrick has an odd sense of humor with music in his films. Until this movie, he used this music in natural arrangements.<br /><br />However, in \\"Barry Lyndon\\", Kubrick allowed a music producer to rearrange the music as a way to affect the on screen action. In particular, Schubert's andante theme from his Piano Trio No. 2 was used as Barry's theme of failure in the latter portions of the movie.<br /><br />The music was performed in trio form for the movie but taken at a slower pace than was prevailing at the time. The effect was to deaden the film. It added futility, not drama or despair. Kubrick understands music and its effects and still allowed this to happen thoroughout this otherwise splendid movie.<br /><br />I will never be long between viewings of this movie, for it is a work of art rare in moviemaking. But I also will never forgive the two major shortcomings that keep it from ascending to the summit of Kubrick films. Instead, this one is grounded in the middle drawer of his movie cabinet./>The music was performed in trio form for the movie but taken at a slower pace than was prevailing at the time.

B0000C9ZLD|4.0|My first exposure to The Strokes was on the pathetic wasteland that is hard rock radio.  While I normally pay no attention to what is playing (mostly due to the fact that 98% of these bands aren't worth hearing), one band that constantly catches my interest is The Strokes.  \\"Last Nite\\" and \\"Someday\\" were infectious, irresistably snappy tunes with a comfortably straightforward, though hardly simplistic, approach to songwriting, and \\"Hard To Explain\\", decidedly one of the best singles of recent memory, reveals a particular nostalgic sound that - in spite of the recent barrage of basic, low-grade cash-cows of \\"lo-fi\\" (here I am thinking specifically of Jet) - is still distinctively their own.  This meat-and-potatoes approach continues with the excellent Room On Fire, a terse and consistently winning collection of 11 songs spanning 33 minutes.  While there is nothing that quite recaptures the genius of \\"Hard To Explain\\", the majority of these songs obtain a remarkably high level of quality.  While I must admit I have not heard Is This It in its entirety, the overall sound on this one is a wee bit slower and slightly more complex than the aforementioned singles from their debut.  The vocals are still distorted and somewhat non-chalant, the guitars alternate between propulsive and jangly, and the bass guitar is laid on nice and thick.  It doesn't just sound good, it FEELS just right. <br /> <br />The many criticisms around media circles stating that the Strokes \\"ouevre\\" lacks variety from track to track are, in my humble opinion, unfounded.  There is a hint of reggae on \\"Automatic Stop\\", a strong new-wave sensibility on first single \\"12:51\\", some unconventional yet still effective song structure on \\"Between Love and Hate\\" and even a ballad in the form of \\"Under Control\\", which in my opinion is the strongest track on this disc.  Despite these many little touches, all 11 songs are all clearly and distinctively \\"Strokes\\".  This isn't so much experimentation as it is minor tweaking of their unmistakable sound.  The ultimate consequence of this is that despite it's immediate ability to grab you, Room On Fire holds surprisingly well to repeat listens. <br /> <br />Quality-wise, Room On Fire is remarkably consistent.  I don't think this band is capable of writing a song that isn't immediately endearing.  You can pick any song at random and there's the possibility it will be your favourite.  I feel that the uber-catchy \\"Reptilia\\", the aforementioned \\"Automatic Stop\\" and \\"Under Control\\", the more prototypical \\"Meet Me In The Bathroom\\" and the closing \\"I Can't Win\\" are the strongest tracks, but they don't stand out as they would if the rest of the tunes were filler.  I never find myself skipping forward to these tracks. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an especially addictive and enjoyable work, and I suspect that their debut is just as good.  I'm not going to put Room On Fire on the same shelf as the true classics any time soon, but if you like what you hear on the radio (and really, what's not to like?), this is as foolproof a purchase as you'll find.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This film set out to portray the historical reality of the death of Jesus, and it does just that. As a student of history, i was impressed and relieved at the sheer realism and historical detail of the film, it is almost thoroughly accurate.  <br />Some artisic license has been employed in the film, such as the scenes of Judas' regret and vexation and a minor creative element with the crucified tormentor, but these are fine and are really quite clever and should not offend purists.  <br />For those among us who believe in Jesus Christ and want to reaffirm their faith by witnessing the Passion, Mel Gibson's film is as close as you're going to get to the real thing. Critics complain about the gore but if anything it still falls short of what really would have happened. <br />Overall, this film is an artistic triumph, a historical success, and a religious achievement.  <br />
0780622650|3.0|I was very excited when it was announced that a big-screen version of Lost in Space would be made.  Unfortunately, its realization did not live up to my expectations. <br /> <br />The basic story remains the same with family Robinson attempting to journey to Alpha Centauri in the quest to colonize a new world.  The casting and characters, however, were altered to appeal to a newer generation.  In the lead role is William Hurt, as the aloof and work-driven Professor John Robinson.  His wife Maureen, played by the buxom Mimi Rogers, is the glue that continually tries to hold an increasingly dysfunctional family together.  Judy Robinson, played by Heather Graham, is an ice queen who is as work-driven as her father.  Lacey Chabert and Jack Johnson play Penny and Will Robinson, respectively, with the former embodying something of a punk rocker image and the latter of an egg-head who yearns for an expression of love from his father more than any scientific achievement.  As an aside, I would say that Johnson's Will Robinson character probably comes closest to a parallel of the TV series' character. <br /> <br />Rounding out the cast is Matt LeBlanc, or TV's \\"Friends,\\" as the Major Don West, a battle-hardened soldier who resents being sent on what he terms \\"a baby-sitting mission,\\" and Gary Oldman as Dr. Zachary Smith.  In the case of Oldman's Smith character, gone is the pretense of a cowardly schoolyard, know-it-all bully.  In its place you have a genuinely despicable sociopath who has no qualms about murdering the entire Jupiter 2 crew. <br /> <br />I love the scene where Oldman tries to convince LeBlanc to join him in a mutiny and LeBlanc responds:  \\"How could I have been so blind, Smith?  Why don't I just go get you a weapon, that way we can take over the ship.\\"  Oldman's response (scowling):  \\"Sarcasm is the tool of a small mind.\\" <br /> <br />The frequent bantering between West and Smith, not unlike it was in the series, is one of the few high points of the film. <br/> <br />The special effects are simply awesome, particularly the launch sequence.  Unfortunately, the storyline gets bogged down in an alternate-future, time-traveling melange.  There is no real sense of family in the storytelling, despite a heavy-handed effort at the end, and you never really care about the characters. <br /> <br />Still, the movie is worth viewing at least once.  It's a shame that the makers didn't decide to film a sequel.  With the right script, a follow-up could have been quite entertaining.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The most difficult part about getting people to watch this series is that any one who realizes it is about Superman may not want to watch a show about a comic book hero.  Second, the more dedicated fans of The Man of Steel may realize that Smallville is Clark's home town.  Getting past that, this show will appeal to the typical WB fans because of the teenage melodrama.  It will appeal to Superman nerds because, well, to be honest I don't think they have very high standards, I mean, it's a show about Superman, I think they will watch it on principle.   <br />The acting may not be that great, but they mix up the story lines from week to week with new bad guys, so it stays fresh.

B000089RVX|5.0|I loved the way that this album started.  In the beginning of the first song you are fooled into believing that it will a little slower, however in listening past the first few seconds of the song you realize that she a ROCKER.  Upon hearing the two songs in Daredevil I was only mildly intrigued, when my best friend made me listen to the whole CD I was in love.  Amy Lee has a beautiful voice and unlike some women who rock, she showcases her talent instead of screaming.  That alone made this album worth listening to.  Her voice won't make your ears bleed and dark, poetic lyrics are a much needed change from the mind numbing Britneys in the world.  Everytime that I hear the song \\"My Immortal\\" I am moved to tears and the song is about her little sister that died very young.  I will agree with some of the other reviews that stated that most of the songs sound the same, but is that really a terrible thing?  The woman knows what she likes and I know that their mix of classical music, haunting vocals and electric guitar are killer.  So many of the songs on this album warrant mentioning that it would be easier to just recommend that you buy this album.  If you liked \\"Bring me to Life\\" then you will adore the whole album.  However I must warn you, \\"My Immortal\\" is the only ballad on the album.  My fav on this album is definitely \\"Tourniquet\\", an awesome song about God...but don't let that keep you away.<br /><br />Tootles
0060930349|4.0|\\"A History of the American People\\" by British historian Paul Johnson is a comprehensive coverage of the subject in an anecdotal style, highly readable and liberally seasoned with the author's opinions. Among the high points are descriptions of relatively obscure events which appear to have had more significance than their obscurity would indicate. A few examples, taken from the eight periods covered in the book:<br /><br />1. Colonial America (1580-1750): South Carolina was settled by a large number of emigrants from the British colony of Barbados where slavery was already established on a massive scale. This heritage led to South Carolina's preeminent role in defending slavery and precipitating the Civil War.<br />2. Revolutionary America (1750-1815): George Washington almost single handedly started the French and Indian War when colonial soldiers under his command surprised a camp of French troops who, taken unawares, instinctively ran for their muskets. Not waiting to see what would ensue, Washington ordered his troops to open fire, killing ten of the French including their commander. In the early years of the republic, the roles of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton and Chief Justice John Marshall were especially instrumental in paving the way for the development of capitalism.<br />3. Democratic America (1815-1850): This is the age of Andrew Jackson who greatly broadened participation in American democracy, abolished the Second Bank of the United States (partially undoing Hamilton's legacy), and decisively defeated the Indians in the old Southwest (Florida to Louisiana). Jackson's other contribution to history was in facing down South Carolina when that state attempted to nullify the tariffs adopted by the federal government and threatened secession. Jackson retorted that secession was unconstitutional in that the constitution forms a government, not a league. The United States is a single nation and the states have no right of secession. Thus, Jackson, a southern president, born in South Carolina, set the precedent for Lincoln's position in the Civil War.<br />4. Civil War America (1850-1870): The Confederacy never seemed to realize that the power of its national government, perhaps its legitimacy, and ultimately its existence were compromised by its position on states rights. Holding to the belief that the states are the ultimate sovereign entities prevented the Confederacy from effectively marshalling its forces in the war with the North.<br />5. Industrial America (1870-1912): This was the era of weak presidents and the development of Industrial America. Lacking heroes in government, the heroes of this era were the industrialists and bankers who vastly improved the economic condition of the common citizen. There were scoundrels (Jim Fisk and Jay Gould) but the big names (including Andrew Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford) were not among them. Interestingly, when Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust was eventually broken up, it was on the verge of losing its monopoly status by the rapidly expanding market for oil and the subsequent rise of competition from Gulf and Texaco.<br />6. Melting Pot America (1912-1929): The election of Woodrow Wilson in 1912 changed the scope of American government tremendously, laying the foundations for the subsequent emergence of the New Deal and Great Society welfare systems. The failure of the US to join the League of Nations following WW I was not the recalcitrance of an isolationist congress but Wilson's unwillingness to accept any change to HIS treaty, even though the European allies had indicated their acceptance of the proposed changes.<br />7. Superpower America (1929-1960): This is the era of the Great Depression, WW II, and the Cold War. The Depression was triggered by the long run of easy money supplied by the Federal Reserve, especially by Benjamin Strong of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the regional bank which still acts as the agent for the Fed inconducting open market transactions.  Near the end of the bubble, when the stock market failed to continue hitting new highs in 1928, Strong observed that he would give the market a \\"shot of whiskey\\" in the form of another interest rate cut. When the bubble evernually burst, rather than allow the long over due correction to take place, President Hoover attempted to pump up the economy by direct government intervention. The ideas that Hoover failed to act out of devotion to laissez faire and that Roosevelt saved the country by instituting the first large scale government intervention in the economy are both myths. Their programs differed little in either content of effectiveness. Furthermore, the enactment of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff effectively exported the recession to Europe and was probably a significant factor in the subsequent rise of Hitler.<br />8. 1960-1997: The author's opinions seem most pronounced in the modern era, perhaps because many of us remember living through these years and perhaps because it is here that he is most at odds with the conventional \\"wisdom\\". He identifies the leading characteristics of this era as the radicalization of the press and the undermining of all authority. The press is cited for its unquestioning support for the inept crusading of Kennedy and Johnson (until it dropped its support of the Vietnam War late in the Johnson administration). Their \\"pay any price, bear any burden\\" rhetoric produced the Bay of Pigs fiasco, massive but ineffective increases in welfare spending, and the Vietnam War. Curiously, the author holds up Richard Nixon as the hero of the era, the statesman who extricated us from Vietnam, abolished the draft, and laid the groundwork for the ultimate defeat of communism by his opening to China. He views Ronald Reagan (somewhat undeservedly) as the light weight partner of Margaret Thatcher. (She was the greatest western leader of the second half of the 20th century and deserves the primary credit for the roll-back of socialism in the west and the defeat of communism. In her shadow, even Washington and  Churchill might not shine as brightly.)<br /><br />Overall, this book was a delight to read, beautifully written, absorbing and thought provoking. I differ with a few of Johnson's opinions and note a few omissions. In particular, in his attempt to rehabilitate Nixon's reputation, he fails to cite Nixon's imposition of wage and price controls as a major contribution to the subsequent inflation and recession of the late 1970s. He correctly notes that the prestige and authority of the presidency reached a nadir after Nixon resigned and congress attempted to fill the power vacuum during the weak presidencies of Ford and Carter. It's curious that he does not credit Reagan for restoring the presidency to its former prestige and authority, as that would seem to be a logical conclusion to his theme of the diminished presidency. However, even in 1000 pages, one can not deal with every aspect of American history.ions.

B0002858YS|5.0|I love this CD, it's so much fun. It's like 80's rock with killer beats and modernized for todays sound. Not a bad tune on the album.  I can't stop listening to it. If you like what you hear on the radio you'll like the entire CD. All though I'm a hard rock fan, I have to admit, this is really good! Buy it, you won't be disappointed. Keep those electric guitars humming guys! Sounds great!
B00005JL78|4.0|By the year 2054, humanity--or at least the population living in and around Washington D.C.--has implemented a novel idea regarding crime (murder) prevention.  Making use of the abilities a trio of \\"precogs,\\" individuals who, as a result of a prenatal drug program, have acquired the precognitive ability to see murders in advance (and provide the date and time of the crime), D.C. has formed a Pre-Crime Police Unit headed by Detective John Anderton, played by Tom Cruise. <br /> <br />Upon receiving any notification of an impending murder (called either a \\"red ball\\" [a unplanned, heat-of-the-moment murder] or a \\"brown ball\\" [one with forethought to it], the unit springs into action to arrest the perpetrator.  Summary judgment results in the \\"guilty\\" being immediately placed in biological stasis and sent to a storage facility.  There is no discussion as to length of sentence, so one can only assume those being incarcerated are done so for the remainder of their lives. <br /> <br />All is going smoothly for pre-crime until Anderton begins to investigate a years-old precog case involving the drowning murder of a woman.  He quickly finds himself caught up in a web of intrigue after he is accused by the precogs of a brown ball murder set to take place in three days hence.  Convinced that he is being framed, and being pursued by every pre-crime cop in the city, Cruise attempts to expose a fatal flaw in the system that he had so avidly supported. <br /> <br />The movie title is a reference to the report generated when at least one of the precogs sees a murder a little \\"differently\\" than the others.  Anderton tries to prove the existence of a Minority Report for the murder he has been projected to commit in the hope that it will exonerate him. <br /> <br />Cruise ably plays Anderton, a drug-addicted cop wracked with guilt over the mysterious disappearance of his young son from a community swimming pool (an event that comes to play a crucial role in the story).  Pursuing him isColin Farrell in the role of Detective Danny Witwer, a smarmy federal agent who has his doubts about the concept of pre-crime but has been tasked to oversee the bureau's transfer to federal authority.  Max Von Sydow is Director of Pre-Crime Lamar Burgess, a man with some very dark secrets who is willing to protect pre-crime and those secrets at any cost. <br /> <br />The story, although a tad long, runs smoothly, and the special effects are simply superb.  The acting is well-done all-around.  <br /> <br />Overall, a highly recommended movie about the perils of short-circuiting constitution protections in the criminal justice system. <br /> <br />
B00005JM02|5.0|OMG this is such a great movie. The whole family will enjoy. We watch it over and over again and the youngest member of our family is 11. Has great humor and so heart warming. A must see.
B00006879E|5.0|I was very happy with this CD.  I had never bought a Maroon 5 CD before, so when I picked this up based only on the songs on the radio it was pleasantly surprised.  The songs were \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"This Love\\" and I loved them both, so as you can imagine I was very pleased when the whole CD was just as catchy as the songs on the radio.  Several songs stood out to me then and they still do; \\"Shiver\\" is awesome, interesting beats and melody make this one a winner; \\"She Will Be Loved\\" was one of my favorites on this disc, long before the song was on the radio, it really makes you tap your feet.  This Album is a little of everything, a little rock and roll, and a little pop-like, a CD full of catchy rythms and beats.  The obvious standouts were \\"Harder to Breathe\\", \\"This Love\\" and two others that are not out there yet; \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"Not COming Home\\" are GRRREAT!!!  All in all I would have to give 5 stars to this one.
B00000583F|4.0|and that's quite what it is, but with a bigger sounds that leans more towards the metal spectrum than rock in terms of rock and heavyness. <br /> <br />the vocals are real gruff but intelligible like a rough bellow or a strong shout there's a fair amount of 'singing' which sounds great as well. the lyrics are spacey and stick with the themes of the songs(flying into the sun, riding dragons, stoner caravans, etc.)  both fit the music very well. <br /> <br />the music sounds like black sabbath, but with a stronger emphasis on their heavier nature.  if you liked volume four, and like a lot of fans of heavy music, you probably want more.  this album takes what vol.4 did and runs with it, and as a huge fan of sabbath, i couldn't be happier.   <br /> <br />sometimes i think it would be nice if the music had a bigger production, like that of high on fire's art of self-defense(matt pike's new band, if you like sleep and venom go check them out) or dopesmoker.  it would be absolutely killer. <br /> <br />as it is, the sound isn't horrible, you can hear everything fine and it doesn't really detract from the experience, it just makes me wonder how much better it could've been with a 'proper' sound.
B00002DEQQ|4.0|Each track on \\"Reload\\" pairs the legendary Tom Jones with a different collaborator on a different cover song, spanning a variety of styles from ballads to techno-ish dance type tracks to driving hard rock.  Not a single bad song on the album, but some definately take precedence over others.  Among the highlights are the lightening power rock track \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way?\\" with Robbie Williams; the honeymoon-ready and rhythmically-mesmerising \\"Sexbomb\\" with Mousse T.; percussiony rocker \\"You're Right, I'm Left, She's Gone\\" with James Dean Bradfield, the fast-paced \\"You Need Love Like I Do\\" with the unique, husky vocals of Heather Small; and the album's great opener, \\"Burnin' Down The House\\" with the Cardigans.  And is it just me, or does anybody else out there think \\"Mama Told Me Not To Come\\" (with the Stereophonics) should be retroactively included on the \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" soundtrack?  And tying everything together, the inimitable soaring baritone vocals of Tom Jones himself. <br /> <br />    One of the better albums of Jones's career; a solid nine out of ten.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I, Robot is a ok movie. Its not worth buying. Its about in the future robots do human stuff like make things, clan dishes and stuff like that. And then thay come out with a new type robot that everyone gets and the robots try to take over. The main character knows what is happening with the robots but no one believes him. Dont buy it. It might be cool the first couple of times you see it but after that it gets really boring.
B00000J2SO|1.0|I just can't stand hearing Graham Bonnett growl out these songs!  I have no complaints with the rest of the band - the rest are (or were, in the case of the deceased Cozy Powell) great musicians.  If you're going to take the band in a more commercial direction, it would make sense to hire a decent vocalist, correct?  Blackmore got it wrong here...but he made up for it in the following Rainbow albums.  If you want to hear a more commercially-oriented Rainbow WITH a good vocalist, pick up any one of the Rainbow albums featuring Joe Lynn Turner on vocals.
1572814349|5.0|This was my first Tarot deck, and it is definitely my favorite.  The cards follow the Rider Waite symbolism, but I find them much richer and informative than a Rider Waite deck.  Each card is a meticulous collage of medieval and renaissance art.  That necessarily means that there is some heavy Christian symbolism.  For some people, that will be a big selling point; for others, it's not so appealing.  For me personally, the art itself is so opulent and compelling that the Christian overtones are very secondary.  The cards themselves are a nice size on heavy cardstock and feel good in your hand.   <br /> <br />The guide that comes with the deck is brief but very instructional.  My major complaint is that it lists the minor arcana out of order - swords, wands, cups coins?  Reversals are barely addressed.   <br /> <br />
0780626966|4.0|It took me awhile to get \\"The Nightmare on Elm Street\\" DVD collection because, well, uhm, I'm a pretty cheap, nay, broke, individual and I all ready had the entire series on VHS. Well, as VHS' will do they eventually fell apart, and I saw this sitting on the shelf of my local video retailer for the relativly affordable forty two dollars and decided what the Hell, time to splurge. I mean, if I could rationalize paying just three dollars less for \\"Ran\\", which is just one picture, albeit a great one, then this would be a fairly simple buy. <br />I was all of eight when the eighties crashed into the ninties so i wasn't around for the better part of Freddy's stranglehold on pop culture, but as a young child I loved wathcing his films on basic cable. And even as I grew older and into a more, well, restrictive film watcher I still enjoyed this film series immensly. These are pure popcorn movies, midnight monster movies at their best, for the most part. <br />So, what of this DVD boxset, enough of your rambling, right? Well, this is as good as any \\"Nightmare\\" fan can hope for. And I mean that as an utmost compliment. <br />New Line many have been the house that Freddy built, but they seemed to want to distance themselves from that comment since the origanel was released really, but here they show their love for this film series and it's fan. <br />All seven movies(more on them later) look better than they ever have in nice widescreen transfers. The special features, mostly relegated to an eighth disc called \\"The Nightmare Encyclepedia\\", are all excellent looks at the making of each film as well as some bits on the whole Freddy phenomonon(my only flaw is the \\"Labyrynth\\" feature that holds many clips, but you have to go through a lot of nonesense to get to them sometimes, but this a fairly small complaint). It comes with an excellent booklet that features photos and the origanel press notes for each film, and two sets of 3D glasses for the final of \\"Freddy's Dead\\". Everythinghere is top notch. <br />And how are the films you might ask if you have only seen a few of them? Well, here's a helpful little primer for those new to this film series: <br />Nightmare 1: Obviously the best of the series by far. One of the greatest horror pics of all time. 10/10. <br />Nightmare 2: Most fans hate this movie. I agree with them one hundred percent. 2/10. <br />Nightmare 3: A more psychological entry after the dreck that is numero dos, \\"Nightmare 3\\" is a strong sequel with some excellent effects and squirmy moments. 8/10. <br />Nightmare 4: Not a popular one, more camp than horror, but I love Lisa Wilcox and her charactor, Alice, is the series' best herione. So I'm prejudice. 7/10. <br />Nightmare 5: A little rushed and pieced together, but hey, Lisa Wilcox is back! 6/10. <br />Nightmare 6: Freddy's dead? Come on, you could've given him a better send off than this, couldn't ya New Line? Oh wait... (4/10) <br />Nightmare 7:...You did! \\"New Nightmare\\" is a great conclusion to the series, even if the last fifteen minutes or so feel a little forced. 8/10. <br />There ya go. If you like the series, you will dig this boxset immensely. If you are new to the series, or have only seen a few of the pictures, you may want to rent the series first. But I'm pretty sure if you like monster movies like those Universal made in the thirties and forties, as well as the slasher films of the seventies to today, you will really enjoy this series and this immaculate boxset. <br />
B000062Y98|5.0|Soaring, majestic and emotional power metal with some of the best songwriting and lyrics to ever grace the genre.  In my opinion Blind Guardian is in the top 1 per cent of the hundreds (perhaps thousands) of bands playing under the Power Metal banner, bringing an originality and ever-evolving progression to a musical form where many quality bands often re-tread the same territory a bit too often.  Guardian, on the other hand, continues to expand the parameters of power metal and perhaps even the possibilities within music itself. <br /> <br />  On \\"A Night At The Opera\\" - unjustly bashed by some both for its humorous cover art and for venturing further into spiritual territory on songs like 'Precious Jerusalem' than many bands do - the complexity and epic grandeur reach new heights, necessitating the need for multiple listens to get the full impact.  'The Maiden And The Minstrel Knight' and bonus track 'Mies Del Delor' are great ballads without sounding anything like the 2 or 3 'typical' metal ballad forms, the often misinterpreted 'Wait For An Answer' sparkles with radiant, rapid-fire energy; 'Sadly Sings Destiny' mines brand new territory both musically and lyrically, with some of the greatest, most unusual bass work I've ever heard, and 'And Then There Was Silence' joins the ranks of songs like Iron Maiden's 'Rime Of The Ancient Mariner' as one of the best long songs out there (in this case around 13-14 minutes, I believe).  Plus 'Battlefield', 'Precious Jerusalem',...really, there's not a weak song on here, and there's impeccable vocals and musicianship throughout. <br /> <br />   As for the cover art debate, I love the cover.  Music could use a bit more comedy; how many artists other than Alice Cooper are there that have done more than a couple of songs that are actually Funny?  I'd love to see Blind Guardian do a song on a future album that captures the feel of this cover art.  And having heard 'Mies Del Delor' I'd love to hear them do more non-English songs.  Something in German, perhaps? <br /> <br />   Essential Metal Art.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Van Helsing is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. All Van Helsing does is try to kill a vampire. He stabs it, shows it a cross, puts holy water on it and tries to beat it up. I have never been a fan of scary vampire movies but this was horrible. Frankenstien was even in the movie. What does Frankenstien have to do with Vampires? Van Helsing is a serial killer that gets hired to kill monsters. I saw it in a movie thearter for a birthday and I wanted to leave but I couldnt. There was also a girl in the movie that tries to help Van Helsing kill the Vampire because her whole family got killed trying to kill the Vampire. In the end Van Helsing ends up killing her. Dont watch Van Helsing.
B00005JKHN|5.0|SLEEPING BEAUTY is a beautifully made film.  It takes the grace of the ballet and shows it in a form that makes it easy to watch, easy to listen to and easy to own.  This is the story of the Princess Aurora, cursed by an evil witch upon her first royal event.  In an effort to save the Princess from her fate, the three good fairies (also excellently done as comic relief) raise her deep in the forest without the use of magic to help them out.  Upon her 16th birthday, Aurora is told the truth of her past and the tale takes off from there.  While I'm sure that most of you have already seen this wonderful film, I will not spoil any more of the details of the movie. <br /> <br />The singing in this is truly amazing.  The girl voicing Aurora is a beautiful, clear soprano, hitting notes that amazed me as a child and still amaze me today.  Prince Phillip is all a prince should be.  Malificient is truly the most wicked villan ever put on a Disney screen.  She still gives me some chills into my adulthood. <br /> <br />I highly recommend SLEEPING BEAUTY, not just for your children, but for you as well.
B00004VVNB|4.0|Logan's Run was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and the qualities that made it so haven't changed...it is certainly true that the miniatures are not convincing, but the whole 'look' of the film has a certain 'Tommorowland' quality that I found (and find) appealing.  Then there are the two principals, the fine English actor and actress Michael York and Jenny Agutter (lovely and sexy as always).  Basically, though, it's just the whole concept of a world of only the young and beautiful that struck me then and now as an appropriate vision of the future given our culture's shallow emphasis on looks, fame, and money.
B000002OR4|5.0|I still haven't seen the movie, but I now would see it because of the music. This soundtrack has some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard. I play the violin and to hear this music is so inspiring. John Williams uses the violin in very moving ways. The music also has a jewish flavor, which in my opinion, is very necessary element. In conclusion, it is a masterpiece, buy it!!!
B00005JMJG|4.0|What procedure is this?  By now you know, I'm sure.  Jim Carrey plays Joel, a quiet, reserved man who is most unsure of himself.  He is at a small lab called Lacuna, a company which specializes in removing the memories of someone you love so they don't hurt you anymore.  Joel's ex girlfriend, Clementine (Kate Winslet) has already had the procedure performed and so Joel is there partly for spite and partly to let go of the pain. <br /> <br />The movie, around 100 minutes in length, spends the majority of this time on Joel's procedure.  The lab is staffed by a main doctor (Tom Wilkenson), an assistant who does the all night erasing work (Mark Ruffalo), a pretty receptionist (Kirsten Dunst) and a kid who assists Ruffalo in the erasure (Elijah Wood).  About halfway through the erasure of Clementine from his memory, Joel decides there are some memories too good to let go of, and decides that the pain of loving and losing her is better than thinking he never knew her and he tries to abort the procedure.  This leads us into a strange journey into Joel's subconscious, where he tries to outwit the doctors he has hired to cleanse his brain of his ex girlfriend. <br /> <br />The film is a brilliant idea and is very well executed.  Visually it is stunning, as Joel's memories are erased, we see his surroundings changing around him.  Charlie Kaufman, the writer, has already shown us his ability to think outside the box with his movies, with films like \\"Being John Malkovich\\" and \\"Adaptation\\".  Here, he once again takes a simple concept like love lost and takes a totally different angle on it--What if you could go back to before you ever met this person and start from scratch?   <br /> <br />The film actually answers this question--or it tries to.  The one weakness of the movie is that there are a couple of side plots which tie the whole story together, but are not really necessary and we don't care about them.  This is a movie about Joel and Clementine, not anyone else.  I found these other storylines, which come toward the end of the film, tiresome and distracting.   <br /> <br />The DVD itself is okay, but nothing superb.  There is a conversation between the French director, Michel Gondry and star Jim Carrey which is interesting, a commentary with screenwriter Kaufman and Gondry, and a brief \\"look\\" at the film with snipit interviews with the whole cast.  It's basically a long trailer of the movie.  There are 4 deleted scenes which add nothing to the story and were wisely left out, and finally a short commercial to the fictional company \\"Lacuna\\" which is funny.  The film's transfer is very good, and the sound (DTS) is great.  Overall this is a DVD you will enjoy.  Highly recommended.
0316666343|4.0|Susie Salmon's life ends on the second page of the novel, The Lovely Bones, but she forges ahead to tell her story from the unsettling circumstances of heaven and the silent shadows surrounding her family and friends. Brutally murdered at the age of 14, Susie can only observe life on earth and the impact her death has on those who knew her.  Susie sees and explains, but strangely, is not compelled to judge from her point of view. She watches as the tragedy takes its toll on her family, as her boyfriend seeks out a new companion, and her killer eludes the police.  <br /> Alice Sebold's novel explores \\"The Sixth Sense\\" notion that the dead are among us, longing to be acknowledged and loved again, longing for basic human experiences. But that strand is secondary to the story of the emotional dismemberment of the family left behind.  The Lovely Bones is a gently told tale of suspense that will have a lingering effect on any reader. <br />  <br />
B0000033P2|5.0|From the beginning strains of \\"The Endless Enigma\\", to the final blaring notes of \\"Abaddon's Bolero\\", this album is truly a gem. I never tire of listening to this musical masterpiece. Technically brilliant and masterfully crafted. ELP knew no peer. Granted YES, Gentle Giant, Genesis, etc were and are great bands, ELP has that something extra that keeps them ahead of the pack. It's a shame that Greg has relegated his waking time to eating bon bons and lounging on the couch, but that's another story. Buy this, and your place in Heaven will be assured. At least Heaven on Earth. And Greg, put down that bacon grease sandwich and pickup your bass.

When this young girl, Trisha, is lost in the woods as she, her mother and brother  decide to hike the Appalachian trail ,as her veering off the path to pee becomes to her a  matter of life and death, you are there with her, you feel her sweat, her cold, her hunger, her thirst, and her fear. You feel everything she feels.  This is a great Stephen King novel with nothing supernatural, although you are left wondering throughout.. I turned down a date to keep reading this, it's wonderful!You won't be disappointed!
B0000584V3|5.0|As others have said this is one amazing cd by the brilliant Opeth and in my opinion music doesn't get much better than this. Every song is a masterpiece that will have you listening until the end and even though most of the songs are around the 10 minute length, I think it helps give them a chance to add in all those transitional pieces which really enhance the songs.    Although this is was the first Opeth cd I had gotten, I still think it is one of their best. Rarely have I heard bands create such amazing melodies all within such an amazing atmosphere. Everything sounds fantastic on here, especially the vocals which sound great both clean and when growling. Anyways this is one cd that every metal fan should own and it is definately one of my favorites of all time, and if you don't own it you are truly missing out.
068987474X|4.0|This entertaining book made perfect sense to me.  After reading it, I was much better able to put in perspective the excuses I have made for men in my life.  As a single female who has wondered why this guy did this or that one didn't do that, it's nice to get an answer that is real, but also not insulting or sugar-coated.  This is a book I will pass along to each of my female friends, and never again sit for tear-soaked hours trying to excuse the poor behavior one or all of us is trying to figure out.
B0000024K1|5.0|This album set the tone for the hip hop concept album. A lot of great albums were influenced from this recording (The Chronic, Ready to Die). The most influential hip hop album ever released. <br />Even though The Chronic is my personal favorite this album is a close second.
0553582445|4.0|I literally recommend that the reader skip to page 200 (chapter ten)to begin reading this book!  If you have already read the Farseer trilogy, this is all review for you and it is told in a rather dry format.  It is just him sitting around remembering things, so you get the details without any emotions or real action...  Stuff like, \\"Then so-and-so did such-and-such and I was sad.\\" <br /> <br />If you have NOT read the Farseer books, this is a real spoiler.  I'd recommend reading those books first and then these.  I have not yet read the Farseer books and I know how they end, who lives, who dies and how a lot of events unfold.  Plus I will know a lot about characters that I'm probably not supposed to know. <br /> <br />Without the long intro this would be five stars.
0792841344|5.0|this movie is very scary and entertaining. it is so out there and weird it makes you want to watch it over and over again. there are some parts that are so scary that they stick with you and(good luck trying to go to sleep) you're f**ked for the rest of the night. there are also parts that are so entertaining and just terrific that you just laugh out loud, not from humor, but just because you are having so much fun. though i was skeptical upon renting it, i used my free rental card on this and i am really glad i did. i have watched it once, am about to go watch it again, and plan on either buying it now or getting it for christmas. the ending is actually one of the best i have ever seen, and look out for a tall man who doesn't say much, except for(...).
B0001I561E|5.0|I admit that I purchased Aladdin because of Clay singing POYB.  He did an awesome job of singing it.  I can't stop watching Clay sing the song. <br /> <br />Okay, now to Aladdin the movie. The animated movie is brilliant!  The comedy and wit-excellent.  Makes watching the show just so much more enjoyable.  Robin Williams never fail to entertain, even if it is through hearing his voice in different characters. <br /> <br />I loved the Beauty and the Best best but now Aladdin is my favourite and it is because I get to watch Clay sing POYB.  Excellent choice Disney!!!!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple returns in rare form in \\"When the Pawn...\\" (plus about ninety more words), her sophomore album -- and one of the rare ones that actually improves on the first. Her passionate bluesy-jazzy sound is blended with her strong, sensitive vocals and one soul-baring song after another.<br /><br />\\"Hell don't know my fury.\\" You said it, Fiona. Anger and melancholy permeate her songs, including the rage of \\"Limp\\" (\\"But no matter what I try/You'll beat me with your bitter lies\\") and the restrained quality of piano-bombast \\"The Way Things Are.\\" Even the musically gentle \\"I Know\\" has a deep sadness, starting to move past some of the bitterness and anger coming before it, and early on Apple seems to apologize for her romantic shortcomings.<br /><br />Female singer-songwriters are a dime a dozen today, but few of them do much more than set basic pop songs to acoustic guitar and piano. But Fiona Apple forges ahead with a noncomformist attitude and strong songs. In a nutshell, she comes across as an excellent musician, with all the power you'd expect from such a singer. And every song is a winner, gut-wrenching and beautiful in its intensity.<br /><br />Musically, it has almost as much impact as her writing does. The music is often led by Apple's piano -- not tinkly piano, but dark, fast melodies that match her songs in rhythm and intensity. Percussion booms in songs like \\"Limp,\\" as if giving vent to Apple's feelings. And cropping up from time to time are odd gurgles and squiggles, as well as some well-blended horn arrangements in the background.<br /><br />Apple's voice is strong and assured, but it also has that rare quality of expressing vast amounts of emotion. Without, I might add, sounding overwrought. Which, since the mood is that of an Angry Young Woman, is a hard thing to pull off, but Apple's richly poetic lyrics (\\"And you can use my skin/to bury secrets in\\") make her songs seem intensely personal.<br /><br />\\"When the Pawn...\\" is an almost exhausting experience -- just try listening to the whole thing without getting your heart rate up. From rotten lovers to personal pain, Fiona Apple explores the bitter side of love... and despite its bitterness, it's a gem.ng without getting your heart rate up.

B00005JNEI|5.0|A lot of the negative reviews here tell people to check facts about the middle east and Saddam and Osama and our governemt's role in the middle east, but I don't think they should really want the average American to do so because that would only cause more doubt in people regarding our international affairs.<br /><br />This movie was really good, but I think it's wrong to blame George Bush and his administration for deceiving America.  Like most people in the world today, Americans want things to be simple, and in order for that to happen, they close their eyes and stick their head in the sands.  It's a little too easy to deceive people in this country, but the people in this country are a little too eager to be deceived, just as long as for the moment, they can feel a sense, though false, of security.<br /><br />George Bush represents the worst in this country, and if he gets elected again, that might be a good thing.  That way, Americans can't claim to be some city on a shining Hill, because the whole world will be able to see our true hideous face in the smirking vsage of George W. Bush.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore does what he does best in his latest effort.  Each of his films has shown a greater degree of skill at obfuscation, distortion, and deliberate misinterpreting to make his point. <br />Make no mistake, this IS an entertaining film.  But it is also less credible as a documentary than John Wayne in 'Sands of Iwo Jima'. <br />If you favor rational and logical thought, avoid this film, as it has none of those qualities.  If you just want to be entertained while encouraging your irrational beliefs, this film is for you.

I'm sure republicans believe it is all lies and dems say it's the truth. <br />But what you cannot ignore are the words of the families and the soldiers.

B000000H64|5.0|When I first bought this cd, I wasn't too crazy about it. But the more I listened to it, the more I started to like it. And a cd that grows on me is considerably notable, as I play them till just hearing the name of the artist makes me consider suicide. That being said, this is easily the best FF cd I own, containing heaviness that compliments the vocal stylings more than it does in any of the other FF cds (that I have anyway). Anyways, this cd does well in combining technotronic (that's not really the word, but I don't know what to call 'em) sounds to enhance the songs. The sounds are most prominent in Zero Signal, New Breed, and the intro of Pisschrist(favorite song). That being said, there's not much else that can be said that can't be said any other FF cd save for those little details. It kicks @$$, plain and simple. If you're trying to choose between FF cds, this is the one to pick. If you don't have it yet, go pick it up, the   H-K compels you!
B00005JNEU|5.0|Ever wonder why those midwestern universities - Texas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, etc -  seem to be so obsessed with football? Watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, based on the book of the same title by H.G. Bissinger about the 1988 season of the Odessa  (Texas) Permian Panthers high school team, we learn that the fixation is acquired early in life, especially if the town has nothing else going for it but prairie grass or, in the case of Odessa, stinky oil wells.<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton, as the Panthers' head coach Gary Gaines, gives what may be the first Oscar-worthy performance of the 2004 film season. Odessa expects the Panthers to win the state championship, and no excuses for failure are acceptable. As Coach Gaines admonishes his players:<br /><br />\\"You have the responsibility of protecting this team and this school and this town.\\"<br /><br />Yes, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is about football (and contains some of the best gridiron action you'll ever see outside of the real thing), but, in a larger arena, it's a commentary on the almost crushing pressure on teenage athletes to win the Big One for town, school, friends, and family. It could just as well be about baseball, basketball, or ice hockey.<br /><br />At the outset, Gaines builds his offense around a single, star running back, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke). But after Miles is seriously injured early on and lost to the team for the season, the burden falls on senior quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) and the fumble-prone running back, Don Billingsley (Garret Hedlund). Winchell's focus is hindered by the realization that going off to college will force him to leave behind his dependent mother. On the other hand, the hapless Billingsley is constantly browbeaten by his abusive father Charles (CW singer Tim McGraw), once himself a player on a champion Panther squad, who can't understand why Don is so inept and fears that his son may squander the only chance he'll ever have for the memory of a fleeting glory in an otherwise unremarkable life. However, Derek Luke provides the film's undeniably most powerful scene - worthy a Best Supporting nod by itself - when he emotionally breaks down under the realization that he can no longer do the only thing he's good at, i.e. play football.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is undoubtedly a Guy Flick. While my wife wasn't exactly bored in the cinema seat, she can't understand why I'm rating the film so highly. It's partly because of Billy Bob's superb performance, but also because it's lean and hard-hitting film about boys being shoved into manhood by pressures beyond their control. In another era, the film would have been about young men forged in the hell of armed combat. Here, it's just west Texas.otherwise unremarkable life.

B0002Y4TTC|5.0|I have been waiting impatiently for this DVD to come out for well over a year. I traveled to Germany to see this show and it was amazing to be there, so I was very anxious to see how all the film work that was being done during the concert would be assembled. <br /> <br />Blind Guardian is a band with fabulous attention to quality and detail. The packaging and artwork on the DVD are lovely and set the tone for what really is a magical experience. The DVD finally allows me to see what I could not from the crush of the crowd: the stellar guitarwork, the details of the light show and the stage, the antics (well as much antics as BG is capable of) of the musicians. It's a perfect compliment to my memory. <br /> <br />I think any BG fan who was unable to attend this show should get the DVD. The picture and sound quality are excellent. They look to have blended both nights to make one long \\"show,\\" but it doesnt matter - you'll get a solid dose of BG from disc one! Disc two has some fun short pieces of the making of the concert and if you're looking to brush up on your German, there's plenty of conversation between the band members to listen to. All in all a solid film that captures the magic and camaraderie of the best Euro fest I have ever attended. <br /> <br />\\"Valhalla! Deliverance! Why've you ever forgotten me...\\" (repeat 100 times)!
0345440900|1.0|I was disappointed with this book.  The advice regarding breastfeeding is an excellent way to have a decreased milk supply.  Tracy Hogg's approach sounds like a child's needs are a big hassle.  I think the title of the book should be changed to \\"The Baby Ignorer\\".
B00005JNJ7|4.0|I'm a fan of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I really liked South Park The Movie and BaseketBall but think this film was just not as funny as the reviews here seemed to me to indicate it would be.  <br /> <br />The story is a political satire similar to what you might find with South Park TV shows. Team America is a special operations unit that goes around the world fighting evil in general and terrorists in particular. Stringed puppets act the entire film. Marionettes. You know, like Pinocchio. Like I said, this movie is a political satire and I'm thinking Stone and Parker chose puppets over cartoon characters for a reason. <br /> <br />If you follow Talk Radio (like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity) you'll be better able to understand what this film is talking about. If you only get your viewpoints from TV \\"news\\" shows then you might miss some of the references or be left wondering why certain groups/people are portrayed as they are (like politically outspoken Hollywood actors of the Film Actors Guild - F.A.G.). By the way, if you're a Communist/Socialist/Liberal you probably aren't going to like how the Left is exposed in this film. On the other hand if you're a Communist/Socialist/Liberal you probably aren't going to go see a movie called Team America. This is not Fahrenheit 9/11. <br /> <br />Pros: <br />No Token Black Actors. (I get tired of seeing Blacks thrown into a film just to placate racist special interest groups. Kudos to these guys for not knuckling under to Political Correctness.) <br />Great Puppet Animation. The sets are detailed and the action is smooth. <br />Good Story and Moral (as usual with these guys). If you watch alot of South Park you know what I mean. <br />Some Good Chuckles. There was even applause in the theater at some points during the film.  <br /> <br />Cons: <br />None really except that it wasn't \\"as funny\\" as South Park or BaseketBall were to me.  <br /> <br />Here's how I'd rate it: <br />No token Blacks: 5 Stars <br />Puppet animation: 5 Stars <br />Story/Moral: 4 Stars <br />Laughs: 3 Stars <br /> <br />If you like South Park then you'll like this too. But I'd see it more for it's refreshingly pro-America point of view (rare in a Hollywood film these days) then for the laughs. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|1.0|I absolutely cannot believe how bad this movie is! Can't wait till the Mystery 3000 guys get it - now that will be fun (of which nothing in this movie is). Mel - get a life man!

B000050XEI|5.0|I first began listening to Enya about two years ago, during a particularly trying time in my life.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that Enya has helped me grieve through her haunting voice.  I have not been disappointed yet with anything I have heard from her.  I look forward to much more enjoyment in the future. <br /> <br />This release, in addition to \\"The Celts\\" is one of the most haunting I have ever heard.  Tracks four and five of this particular CD stir the soul to heights and depths of emotion, with each hearing, in some different way.  Couple that with some of the most beautiful piano ballads ever made, in my opinion, and you have a timeless classic.  Just as she is--a timeless classic beauty. <br /> <br />In listening to her music I have cried, I have felt peace of soul, and been taken to other times and places through its melodies.  <br /> <br />She and her ballads have won a permanent place on my CD shelf.  I will never grow tired of them. <br /> <br />In an era where much of music is \\"more of the same, different day\\", Enya stands out as a giant.  Nothing in her music says boring, bland or otherwise off-putting.  As I said before, in my opinion, it is simply timeless, ghostly, and dare I say..perfect? <br /> <br />It's as close to perfect as music may ever come.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000AGWJ7|2.0|These guys aren't bad. They're a talented bunch of musicians, but they can't decide if they want to be a metal band, a hardcore band, or a punk band, so they throw elements of each in their songs. For a metal fan like myself, hearing an awesome opening riff and ripping guitar solo is awesome. I like the heavy Pantera-like breakdowns they do sometimes, but then they stick in punk choruses and punk sounding progressions and vocal harmonizations that just don't follow the form of the music. You might make a stretch and say that they are integrating melodic metal styles, but its very different. The clean vocalist doesnt have a powerful or deep enough voice for that and his voice actually reminds me of older Offspring. <br />Avenged Sevenfold is NOT a metal band even if they have some metal sounding aspects of their music. If you want to hear current bands that are closer to real metal check out Shadows Fall, God Forbid, All That Remains, Lamb of God, and Unearth.

B00005V9HH|5.0|ok ok i know that people rave and rave about this movie...don't get me wrong..I LOVED it but...it was predictable...the only part that wasn't predictable. The only thing that I was suprised one was the uh..well not to ruin anythign \\"suspected first ending\\"...people who have seen the movie understand what I'm sayign there I hope. This was not a bad movie by any means, contrary to what the title of this review suggest, I will show you how i analyzed it. I tryed watching it one time and I only got to Komayashi, then I watched it again in enterity and there was just something odd about that first scene with the burning and all that I predicated which charcter it was. Though it is a deffinatly a top 200 film on IMdB and well should be, Spaceys performace was great...deffinalty rent or buy.
0375422889|2.0|Having been a big fan of Marjane's first offering, I've been impatiently waiting for the second (and last) volume in her graphic autobiography.  The second volume retains the clever drawings, the excellent sense of humor, the witty observations, and shows that the knack Marjane had for good storytelling in the first book was no accident. <br /> <br />However, two problems in this book have greatly reduced my enjoyment of the above qualities.  First, it seems that Marjane thinks that everybody is out to get her.  Nuns lie to cover up racial slurs they directed towards her, her landlady wrongly accuses her of theft, her classmates look down on her because she's Iranian, etc.  And all the while, she can do no wrong towards anyone (except for an incident in the second half of the book,) she's always speaking out against oppression, speaking out for her classmates, etc.  In short, she is almost an unqualified hero.  This has made the story much less believable to me.  She might very well be all of these things, but I found the way she portrays herself to be very off-putting. <br /> <br />The second problem is one that left me bewildered. <br /> <br />Near the very end of the book, Marjane, after some incident with a Kuwaiti guy comments, \\"my uncle has told me that its like this with Arabs in all Arab countries.  If you go out on the street dressed like that (she was wearing a headscarf) and drinking a coke, they think you're a prostitute.\\" <br /> <br />I had to read this sentence about 20 times before I moved on to the next frame.  I wasnt sure that what I understood was what she was implying, for two reasons.  First, The very big umbrella of 'Arab countries' include countries like Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon (among others, I'm sure.)  where women have rights that far outweigh those of their Iranian counterparts.  In the very least, no woman is supposed to adhere to any religious dress code while being outside, so I'm not sure where did her uncle get this idea from.  Moreimportantly, I was disturbed by this comment because it seems to be doing the exact same thing that Marjane was trying to resist throughout the whole book:  She was stereotyping a group of people and painting them with a very large brush.  The same thing she was complaning was happening to her while she was in Europe.  I think those who suffer as a result of falling into a stereotyped group can be divided into those who would be overly sensitive about it because they realize how unjust and hurtful it could be to others, and those who would stereotype another group to feel good about themselves.  I dont know where Marjane falls, and i wont judge her based on one sentence in her book, but this comment made me feel like I wasted my time reading about all her struggles as a victim of stereotyping. <br /> <br />In any case, there is no question that Marjane is ridiculously talented.  I will be looking forward to her next book, despite the shortcomings of this one.

B000002KKC|5.0|I had never actually listened to the Fleetwood Mac version of this, but when I went to see Camper at the Middle East in Boston a couple years ago, I bought their version and started listening to it. <br /> <br />However, the highlight was visiting some friends in Maine who have the original LP.  We listened to the two versions of each track one after another and laughed our butts off.  The strange thing is that the Camper versions weren't always that much weirder than the Fleetwood Mac ones.  It was a strange album in the first place.  We often liked the Camper renditions better.  The \\"ghost in the fog\\" sequence from Angel is a highlight, as is the title track. <br /> <br />This is not particularly hi-fi, and not for everyone, but I love it.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Wow, I just saw this movie yesterday with my friend and boy was I impressed. I thought, going into this movie, that I would be horribly offended by Matt and Trey but funny enough I wasn't. I had read an article in Newsweek proclaiming that Matt and Trey were more Republican than Democrat which suprissed me, mainly because seeing South Park and that I'm a Democract. This movie really isn't that offensive though, I suggest anyone who can take a joke but is still a leaner to the left or right deffinalty check out this movie. Also check out there other movies Baseketball and Orgazmo are really fun.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|This is one of the most terrible movies of all time.  It could have been better, but with Kutcher as the lead, not bloody likely.  I fail to understand the obsession with this brain-dead moron.  He can't act and he's not even that hot.  He never convinced me that he was the character he was supposed to be playing.  He never stopped being Ashton Kutcher to me. <br />Also, the plot was really dumb and kind of boring.  I didn't really care about all the time-travelling crap or the supposedly scientific theories behind it. <br />I went to see this movie for a date and all I can say is I am glad that my boyfriend paid for me to see this atrocious movie, otherwise i'd be wanting my money back.
0385508417|5.0|Reading a witty, funny, book by John Grisham was indeed an experience.  We couldn't put it down after events began to unfold.  Haven't we all at one time or another \\"just wanted to skip Christmas\\" because of the commercial hassle.  We both wanted to see this book made into a movie.  Just the other night, we discovered our wish came true.  We had picked Kevin Spacey to play Mr. Krank, and Judy Davis to play his wife, but Tim Allen will do. We are fans of \\"The Ref\\".  We recommend this for a lighthearted quick read.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Wow.  This movie is really great.  There is no bad acting in it and I was never bored during the whole thing.   <br />This is a movie to see over and over again.
B000002HO3|5.0|\\"Holding back the years\\" is a beautiful soulful sound of a young man losing his innocence when he finds the older woman of his young boy's heart involved with another, which works extraordinary well with the singer's clear and high pitch melodic sound that is beautiful yet in pain and the music itself truly matches the power of the voice and the words. This song and \\"Money Too Tight to Mention\\" dominate the CD. \\"Money too tight\\" is a powerful song with a jumping beat about the econimic turmoil during \\"Reganomics\\" and it's so dynamic that I can hear it over and over again. I love the lyrics and virtual shouting of \\"money\\" that suddenly transcends to a soulful beat towards the end with the lyrics \\"Did the earth move for you Nancy?\\" that seemingly moves from one song to another within the same set with that great beat. These songs just dominate the CD that although there are some very good songs, I havbe a tendency to flip back to these two. Half the songs I would say are very good others remind me of Art Garfunkle's more classic and lyrical sound since the lead is so talented. But the first two from their first album drive the CD to a 5 star rating.
B0002MB7QW|5.0|The Day after Tomorrow is a outstanding movie.  The special effects are awesome.  I was not sure about the movie at first but after I rented it from blockbuster and viewed it, I definitely will buy it on dvd fullscreen.  There have been a few movies made involving natural diasters but this one is the best.  If you have not seen it yet, definitely watch it.  The director did a fantastic job, the cast members put a outstanding job.  It's one of those movies you'll want to watch again and again.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Yes, global warming is a problem and, if we don't do anything, what happens in the movie will actually happen. <br /> <br />However, that's about all that's scientifically accurate in this movie.  Yes, these things will happen if we don't do something, but it'll take quite a lot longer than two weeks.  Say, at least a few thousand years. <br /> <br />However, if you can dismiss your disbelief long enough to sit back and enjoy the movie, you won't be disappointed.  Ignore the badly written script, ignore the poorly developed characters.  In fact, you could go as far as to say that the characters really aren't developed at all. <br /> <br />But, man, what's better than seeing LA just completely demolished by a super outbreak of tornados? <br /> <br />Very entertaining if you can ignore the scientific problems and complete lack of character development.  An excellent popcorn flick.
0618001905|3.0|King Leopold's Ghost is more a review of the protest movements against Belgian cruelty in the Congo than a history of the colony itself. If you are a student of protest against social repression this book is worth reading. Otherwise, the book falls short. It gives only a sketch of the colony's operation, enough information to document crimes against humanity such as  murder, pillaging, and torture in order to set the scene for the protest movements. Worse, there is only superficial description of the mentality of colonialists. They are painted merely as euro-centric chauvinists, and greedy self serving adventurers. They come across basically as thugs. This sort of boring moralizing does not inform us about history but rather about Hochschild's personal moral standards.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|See, here's the deal.  Michael Moore is a liberal, as am I.  This means that we're blamed for everything the government does wrong--and the people doing the blaming are always Republicans.  I love Republicans.  It's amazing how so many people can be so stupid all about the same thing.    Anyway, the movie.    \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", I'll admit, wasn't as engrossing as \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" because it was filled with stuff I already knew.  I didn't even really plan on seeing it at all until I learned that my school's library obtained a copy of it, which I promptly rented to see what all of the fuss was all about.    Well, I couldn't finish it.  I watched about an hour, became too disgusted to watch any more, and didn't finish it until the next day.  It's just one thing after another; if you weren't already angry at the US government, you will be after you see this.    Republicans like to say that this film is nothing but lies and \\"liberal propeganda\\".  Ah, again with the L-word.  Naturally it's biased, as Moore himself is a liberal; however, there is not one falsehood in the entire movie.  Even I, a fellow liberal, found it hard to believe everything that was being thrown at me, so after finishing it I did some extensive research on the points that Moore makes throughout the film.    Everything was dead-on accurate.  Republicans, if this thing is as packed with lies as you say it is, then PLEASE show them to me because I don't see them.  Read your news, people (FOX doesn't count).  Do your research.  It's not as though you have to dig through endless obscure records to find the proof of these things; it's RIGHT IN YOUR FACE and all you have to do is take off your conservative blinders to see them.    However, I wouldn't be surprised if, even after the conservatives do their fact-checking, they used their favorite excuse for what happened:    It's, uh, Clinton's fault.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|What happened, Slipknot?  I wil ltell you, you let Corey Taylor right your songs.  This cd goes from great to awful, and makes me want ot hurl.  It cannot compare to Iowa, or S/T.  Slipknot is not the type of band that goes from Surfacing to Vermillion.  It saddens me to see this happen.  The great parts are The Blister Exists, Three Nil, Duality, and Opium of the People.  Everything from this point...collapses.  Vermillion?  Now with a music video that is fully equipped with crap.  Slipknot is dead, unless they can make a good cd after this, but since I really did like them at one point, I'll buy it.
0385474547|3.0|The first 3/4 of the book served to describe the culture of the people of Umuofia. The reader feels a sense of unity and family yet at the same time is horrifed by some of their practices. This part of the novel was very informative yet at times it read like a history textbook- I didnt find myself getting that much into it. There should have been more character analysis. The book starts to climax at the time the colonials arrive and bring their teachings of Christianity. I felt around this part Achebe should have focused more on the conversion of Okonkwo's son- Nwoye. I would be interested to know what made him convert and how he felt about the white man's treatment of his tribe. I felt Achebe could have covered the more complicated issues concerning this issue; it is not simply a black and white issue. The book focused too much on soely Okonkwo and ignored many of the other characters with very contrasted personality traits; it would have been interesting to do more of a character cross-anaylsis on the women in the tribe and those that decided to follow Christinaity instead of focusing just on one character. Overall though, a thought-provoking book dealing with a very difficult issue.
B000002J09|5.0|Exalted as Led Zeppelin's best. Rightfully so? Maybe, but not in this reviewer's opinion.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin Untitled (which will be referred to as IV) was, by far, the biggest album that Led Zeppelin ever released. Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica) Jimmy Page (guitars) John Paul Jones (bass, piano, organ) and John Bonham (drums) give us their fourth album, which was never titled. They did this because people were mad at them because of Led Zeppelin III. They were expecting another Led Zeppelin II, but it was nothing like it. But, enough history,  I will break this review up into parts, represented by the songs.<br /><br />Black Dog<br /><br />Who hasn't heard this one? Well, maybe not everyone has, but my classic rock station plays it all the time. A very energetic performance, and it is different from Led Zeppelin's other songs.  Robert Plant's vocals are good in this song, Jimmy Page is good, although he has had better performances. The Johns perform well as usual. Overall, a good rock track to open up the album, but I personally think Led Zeppelin has better to offer.<br /><br />92/100<br /><br />Rock and Roll<br /><br />If you ever watch TV, you are bound to have heard this song on the ever famous Cadillac commercial. A great intro by Bonham, another energetic performance. Robert shines on this song, he gets really into the song. The guitar solo is pretty good, too. You even get some piano in the second half of the song. One of Led Zeppelin's cathiest songs, and a damn fine song.<br /><br />97/100<br /><br />The Battle of Evermore<br /><br />Very underrated song. This song is about a battle in Lord of the Rings. You hear many references that are very clear. (Ring Wraith anyone? There is also a female back up vocalist accompanying Robert. (Sandy is her first name, her last escapes me at the moment) They both give a great performance. Also, this song is the first acoustic song, and has a folk feel. It reminds me of Led Zeppelin III. A great song, very underrated.<br /><br />96/100<br /><br />Stairway to Heaven<br /><br />\\"The\\" rock classic. Many people say its overplayed, overrated, ect. They also dock this song points because of that. I do not, however. This is a great song that really builds up. While I do not think it is as good as some people make it out to be, it is still a worth while listen. Jimmy Page gives a great solo (not the most technical, but it sounds great) and Robert's vocals at the end are just stunning. Awesome song, although not Led Zeppelin's best.<br /><br />97/100<br /><br />Misty Mountain Hop<br /><br />If you ask me, this is Led Zeppelin's most overrated song. I mean, while it is good, I hear it at least once a day on the radio, and I don't even listen to that much radio. That being said, it is still a good song, with a catchy riff. The vocals range from weird to awesome, heh. Overall, a good song, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />85/100<br /><br />Four Sticks<br /><br />I'm not overly fond of this song. Its not bad, by any means, but it is not that good. I won't even get into this song much, but say that John Bonham actually used four drum sticks (two in each hand) for this song.<br /><br />75/100<br /><br />Going to California<br /><br />Awesomeness. That sums this song up nicely. Most people do not appreciate this great song at first. Hell, I didn't care for it much the first few listens. But after a while, this song grew on me, and became one of my favorite songs. It is an acoustic beauty, and you have to actually hear the song to understand it.<br /><br />100/100<br /><br />When the Levee Breaks (...Mama you got to move)<br /><br />The only song on the album that is able to surpass Going to California. This is my kind of song, I love it. Robert breaks out his harmonica, and gives a great performance. The drums are awesome, the bass is above average, vocals are great. This is the one Led Zeppelin song where I completely forget about Jimmy and guitar. The vocals are awesome as well, as are the lyrics. This is a hard rock blues song, be warned.<br /><br />Overall, a great album. The last two songs are, by far, the best songs on the album. If you are just starting Led Zeppelin, I would recommend Led Zeppelin I and II instead. If you start at those two, and then proceed to III and IV, you can see how they changed their style. Houses of the Holy and beyond is a whole different story, though. It shall be told at a differet time. Thank you for reading this, and I hope you found it helpful. (I tried to make a quality review, instead of just blindly bashing it, or saying its the best ever because of Stairway.)
0380733358|5.0|This was the novel that made me a Ken Follett fan.  An incredible tale weaving the lives of the characters together and tying them all to the possible outcome of WWII.   <br /> <br />Follett creates a story that is completely plausible and believable.  He lets us into the lives and minds of incredible characters.  They are brought to life through Follett's stylish writing and thoughtful analysis of the human pysche.  He is truly a master at painting the circumstances that shape the characters lives.   <br /> <br />He builds a suspense tale and concludes with a dramatic finish.  This book set the tone for future works by Follett - and he set the mark high.
B0002VL0KQ|2.0|I applaud the sentiment that Celine Dion is going for here,but on a whole the songs are still just kinda there&it's been a while since She has truly had material or even a Song that reminded of where She once was during Her Run.Her voice is still good but not quite where she was.
B00005J6T1|5.0|I think \\"Madonna\\" is her best album ever!!! It's just pure 80's dance pop, which takes us back when she made no controversy and was just a great singer. Any true madonna fan should own this album, not just because it's a great album to collect and is her first one, but also because it's her best album ever!!!
B0002VKZL6|5.0|well, first thing to notice is Mark's improved voice and singing. Now he is a true singer, no doubt!!! <br />second, the musical direction has changed a bit but so subtly that you just feel it is perfect bliss (or shangri-la). <br />to be serious, this album present us with a fantastic story telling style, Mark is a great writer, no question!!! (5.15 AM, BOOM LIKE THAT, STAND UP GUY, DONT CRASH THE AMBULANCE, SONG FOR SONNY LISTON...) These songs tell stories, sometimes in a sarcastic way, but it's so refine!!! wow! <br />Listen and enjoy the magic of POSTCARDS FROM PARAGUAY, 5.15 AM, TRAWLERMANS SONG, SUCKER ROW, DONT CRASH THE AMBULANCE, STAND UP GUY... <br />This album is an invitation to simple life, there is a true philosophic thread throughout, which means it cannot bring you to be jaded. <br />Mark is one of the last geniuses in pop rock music, so let yourself be taken away by this cool wave of enjoyment.
B00004S6GL|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already?  This album is frickin amazing!!  I can't stop listening to it.  Beautifully sad and intimately honest lyrics, against the backdrop of some of the most amazing pop music recently made.  These songs will get caught in your head and go round and round for days, if not longer.  It's very haunting.  Why do the good ones always leave us?  RIP Elliot.
0446605409|4.0|But the facts uncovered about what goes on at Plum Island are interesting and scary enough to make this book well worth reading.   Just like John Irving has a thing for dismemberment, Demille has a thing for middle aged law enforcers who attract beautiful younger women with daddy complexes.  He waters down great research and great stories by throwing in sex for the sake of sex.  Maybe he's pandering to the romance novel set for cross-over sales. <br /> <br />The story is very interesting and compelling however.  Not just for  the Plum Island \\"exposee\\", but also for his traetment of \\"what may be\\" concerning pirate hunter Captain Kidd's treasure.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|'Donnie Darko' marks the excellent (and promising) directorial debut of Richard Kelly, a relatively un-heard-of director that has struck gold with this outstanding tale of belonging and exploring the complexities of time travel. <br /> <br />Set in 1988; disturbed teenager Donnie Darko begins to experience bizarre visions in which he is greeted by 'Frank', a mysterious entity dressed in an evil-looking bunny suit. 'Frank' instructs Donnie that only 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds remain until the tangent universe will collapse, and begins to ask him to carry out his increasingly destructive commands. An un-stable Donnie wilfully complies, uncovering some of the darkest secrets humanly imaginable about his, and the worlds, existence. But with a universal collapse nearing by the hour, is there a way Donnie can stop the inevitable and save the ones he loves? <br /> <br />Everything about 'Donnie Darko' was portrayed to the highest quality. The acting, direction, and special effects were outstanding, and not to forget the beautifully composed soundtrack featuring Gary Jules' heartfelt cover of 'Mad World'. <br /> <br />Rather than sticking to one genre, the movie instead explores many, easily succeeding with each. An unforgettable discussion about how Smurf's have sex is hilarious, as is Donnie's sister repeating the vulgarity she hears from her siblings at the dinner table. And the dramatic elements are not to be forgotten, but would be easily spoilt if I mentioned them here. <br /> <br />I highly recommend 'Donnie Darko'; one of the most generously original, and instantly memorable, movies to hit our screens in years. Utterly outstanding.
B0006213WG|5.0|The 4th album by Sum 41 is a great CD, lemme say that first. However, this has no impact on what I feel about the album, but I don't really think this is their hardest. They say, \\"If you liked the last one, you'll like this one.\\" But I don't think this is like \\"Does this look infected?\\" I believe that that was their hardest, they've sort of blended their third album with \\"All Killer No Filler\\" and \\"Half Hour of Power\\" What may make it harder is the occasional scream, but the melodies are similar to that of their sophomore album. Anyway, the CD is no doubt their best yet. Here's what I think about each song: <br /> <br />Intro: I'm not sure why they have an intro in this, they really don't need it and next to their other songs it's not too impressive. 2/5 <br />No Reason: Very good, but like I said, the first verse reminds me of \\"All Killer No Filler\\" Love the chorus, it's an all around awesome song. 5/5 <br />We're All to Blame: Good song, this is where it starts to sound like \\"Does this look infected?\\" The chorus is kinda soft, but I love the verses and screaming. 4/5 <br />Angels With Dirty Faces: This no doubt has the BEST chorus of any song on the CD. A hard, fast song and an amazing one as well. 5/5 <br />Some Say: This song is like a trip down memory lane. It sounds just like the stuff from their first 2 albums. Very good soft song. 5/5 <br />The Bitter End: Not my favorite, it's good and all, but it seems to have kinda boring lyrics. 3/5 <br />Open Your Eyes: Amazing song, second favorite on the album, it's very catchy, even thought the lyrics are shallow. 5/5 <br />Slipping Away: My least favorite song. It's like a softer version of \\"The Bitter End\\" 3/5 <br />I'm Not The One: The by far greatest song on the album, from the intro to the screaming verses and the chorus. 5/5 <br />Welcome to Hell: A great song, but it's a little short, not even 2 minutes. Besides that it's kickass! 5/5 <br />Pieces: The second soft song, but unlike the last, I love this one. The lyrics, unlike the rest of the song, are deeper, and they leave you thinking, like Story of the Year and Linkin Park do on their CDs. <br />There's No Solution: Not great but I listen to it, it's a good song. Kinda reminds me of \\"No reason\\" <br />88: Awesome song to close with, they end on a great note, getting very hard and very soft in the same song. 5/5 <br /> <br />All in all, it's amazing, I recomend anyone who has ever liked Sum 41 to get this CD.
6305313687|5.0|This, along with Fight Club, is my favorite Edward Norton movie.  Classic movie.  Derek (Norton) and his little brother Danny (Furlong) are both part of a group called the D.O.C., who are a basically a group of neo-Nazi skinheads.  Derek is incarcerated for 3 years for killing 2 black guys, including smashing one's jaw on a gutter and attempting to kill a third after they were breaking into his car during the night.  When he gets out, it is to everyone's astonishment that he has changed and no longer wants to be a part of what he once created.  He explains to Danny what happened during his time in jail.  He is raped by a group of also neo-Nazi's, who he was friends with at the start of his time in prison, however the main leader was doing shady dealings, which Derek did not like.  After he is raped, he is in immense pain, and realises his hate and actions towards black people is wrong, and didn't help him at all.  He becomes friends with the black people in the jail, and when his time is up, he is ready to to move on with his life.  The ending was totally unexpected for me, and the final scenes were very powerful.  Watch it for yourself. <br />What i liked most about this movie was how it would go back in time when Derek was writing his Essay (what the whole movie is based on) in black and white, and he would explain instances of what happened between them and black people. <br />The acting here is terrific, Edward Norton is spot on.  A must-see for everyone.  Top 100 Movie of all time.
B000003TA4|3.0|'Nevermind' was a good album, & Nirvana was a talented band, Kurt Cobain was a good song-writer <br /> <br />Pearl Jam & Eddie Vedder were simply better much better, made much better albums, & were much more talented, interesting, & intelligent <br /> <br />& im happy the guys from Pearl Jam influenced Nirvana enough to the point that Kurt Cobain could write this album because of his inspiration from them
B00005ATQF|5.0|The best war movie ever, you don't get bored here, unlike other war movies where the whole movie practically is just shooting, bombing, etc.  The first 40 or 50mins, is set at bootcamp.  Gunnery Sargent Hartman (played by R. Lee Erney), the Senior Drill Instructor, trains them for war.  The opening scene is absolutely hilarious.  Hartman bags the crap through them all, and his insults towards them are a crack up.  The main characters that develop in bootcamp are Hartman, Private Joker, Private Pyle, and Private Cowboy, however Pyle and Hartman are eliminated at the end, as Pyle is given so much crap from everyone else, he shots himself and Hartman.  After the bootcamp part finishes, the movie develops into just Joker, who is now a combat correspondant, with his new group of people.  He finally reunites with Cowboy, who work together in Vietnam.  In the final scene it is there whole group vs one sniper, but the question is, who will come out alive?  Will they find the sniper? <br />This is a classic movie, my favorite war movie.  I recommend it pretty much to everyone, unless you are offended by strong language.  It's a great movie, ignore the people saying it should have stopped after the bootcamp finished.  That's garbage, the movie would have gone for 50minutes, and it would be pointless if it was just bootcamp and no continuation to where the main character's went after.  Get this DVD, because you will not be disappointed.
B0006213WG|5.0|Chuck is exactly what I was expecting from these guys after the Congo incident. We're All To Blame is amazing and is supported by a cast of other great songs all of which are worthy of being singles!
B00028HBKM|5.0|It was almost like being there. Some have said it was too bloody. I think that in the current social climate, people are so desensitized by gore in the media, movies, television, etc. that the sanitized versions of the passion are inadequate. People today are very visual, so I thank Gibson for giving us a more realistic version. I look forward to more films with this vision of detail and accuracy.  <br /> <br />And for those people who think it was a bad movie because you didn't get more of what Jesus was all about or His teachings, you really missed the point of the movie. It's about Jesus' LAST 12 HOURS of life on earth. During that time, He really wasn't preaching to the general public. He did that before those last hours. Gibson is a Catholic. He knows the teachings of Jesus. I am a Catholic and grew up being taught those teachings as well. I have an understanding of Jesus and His teachings. For those lacking that knowledge and wanting it, I suggest picking up a book. <br />

B00005JN4F|5.0|I wasn't sure about Taxi.  I hate to admit I have been very disappointed at most of the comedy genre this summer.  Taxi however was a refreshing change a new take on the buddy genre with Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon I was quickly involved in the laughs.  The two of them play so well off of each other and the jokes were just silly enough to keep me laughing out loud.  It was refreshing and Ann Margaret is hilarious as Jimmy's drunk mother.<br /><br />So this is well worth a check out whether at the matinee or once it hits the cheaper seats.  It was a very funny ride.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|I had high expectations for this movie and was thoroughly disappointed especially with zellweger's performance (who i usually love)as she was over the top and nauseating with an accent which grated on my nerves. The message throughout the movie of 'war is bad' was repeated about a million times and there was no subtlety. Characters seemed to appear out of nowhere with no explanation and many seemed to have no purpose, I don't know if the book is any better but I have been put off even approaching it.
0688163173|5.0|Is there a book that you possibly read 10, 15, maybe 20 years ago that is still ingrained in your memory today? When you think about the book, perhaps you won't be able to recall passages from the book; what most stands out in your memory is THE ENDING?<br /><br />I picked up this book after reading the inside front pages that contained praises from renown sources. I mean, after all, would you read a book that got 5 stars from the Ridgemont High School Monthly, or some similar obscure media source? Neither would I. But this book had reputable names, and they all spoke about the ending. So I took the bait and began reading.<br /><br />I was not disappointed; on the contrary, I was deeply affected by this book. I can honestly say, this book will still be a vivid memory 20 years from now, when I am recalling great books I have read. Yes, its that good.<br /><br />The book begins with two federal marshals investigating the disappearance of a violent criminal from a high security hospital located on a remote island. To say any more about the plot would be to ruin the surprise that awaits the uninitiated.<br /><br />I can say this: as the story progresses, the author throws in such a wicked twist and pulls out the rug from under you that you will be tempted to reread the entire book. Trying to guess what all the hype and acclaim is about is futile. Surrender yourself to this book and enjoy the ride.
B00005JNEI|3.0|This movie would be so much better if Michael Moore would learn how to present his opinion through sometimes questionable information subjectively rather than objectively.  The movie has some good parts.  The most moving parts for me were when he was interviewing the woman whos son died over in Iraq.  I think the reason that this was the best part of the movie was because it couldn't be argued, it was one woman's opinion and presented as such.  It was very moving.  Some of the parts were borderline ridiculous, like when it showed the kids playing with their kites in Iraq before we invaded it.  I think it is safe to say that Iraq was not some sort of utopia as it appeared to be in this scene before we invaded.  Another unfair part of the movie was when Michael Moore asked the politicians in DC to sign up their kids to go to war.  I think he should focus more on whether or not the actual politician was in the military, as it is certainly not the parents' decision to send their kid to war in most cases.  Some of the connections with the Saudi family might not be outright lies and Moore has sources for them, but its definately not a well-proven, matter-of-fact idea as this movie presented it. <br />That said, I wish Michael Moore wasn't the hero of the Left in this country as he apparently is.  I think the reason that he has become so popular is because the Left needs something to cling onto because the Right has so many figures like Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, FOX NEWS.  The Left needs some form of propaganda for people too lazy to read a book or listen to the radio to find out what is actually happening.  If the Left's hero were some other figure such as Eric Alterman or even Al Franken, I think that we would be a lot better off; the reason they aren't is because since they deal with more real issues and more real information many people find them boring.  While clearly biased, at least they deal with facts and more objective information than emotional appeal.  That being said, I guess it is better to have Michael Moore than no one to present propaganda for us. <br />Don't get me wrong, I'm a Liberal Democrat and agree with Moore that Bush needs to go, but I don't think that this movie is fair.  Watch it, let it sink in, but don't take the movie too seriously. <br /> <br />Just my 2 cents :)
B000062XM7|3.0|This movie wasn't too awful.  Danial Day-Lewis is good, as always.  There seemed to be some sloppiness toward the end of the movie, however, in the editing department.  When Danial Day-Lewis runs through this \\"cave\\" type thing on the mountain you'll notice that the rock he runs past appears to wobble when he bumps into it as if it were actually something hollow covered with grey cloth.  That's it I suppose.  I would give a lengthier review but, I saw this awhile ago so I can't remember all the specifics.
B00002E233|3.0|DEEP BLUE SEA is an extremely silly film about scientists trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease by experimenting with the brain capacity of sharks (shark brains apparently never deteriorate as they age.)  Naturally, something goes wrong, and a handful of stock characters spend the rest of the film trying to escape a trio of super-predators that may actually be smarter than they are. <br /> <br />Everything is pure formula from start to finish, and the plot totally implausible, with lots of bad acting, but that doesn't mean it's not kind of fun anyway.  The action scenes are exciting, and the sharks - be they animatronics or computer generated - look 100% real.  The death scenes are well-done.  You aren't going to care about the characters; in fact you'll probably wish most of them would get offed.  However, there are some nice surprises regarding that.  I almost wish I'd seen it on the big screen; no doubt the impact is diminished on a standard TV. <br /> <br />The DVD is of high quality with a great picture and sounds great in surround.  It includes running commentary from director Renny Harlin and star Samuel L. Jackson.  There are also two featurettes: one on the making of the film and one on the making of the sharks in particular.  Deleted scenes, a trailer, and a stills gallery round out the extras. <br /> <br />In short, it's a dumb popcorn flick, but if you're interested in sharks or aquatics in general it's worth a rental.
B00005JMXX|4.0|The special effects are marvelous!! The story is important but I wish we didn't have to think about it, global warming. Anyway, I bought it and I enjoy watching it.
B0002TSZK6|5.0|A truly great movie. Full of facts every American should know. <br />Michael Moore is a great patriot and a brave man. He is wealthy and doesn't need to care about anyone else but he cares enough to tell us the truth. He has backed everything in the movie up with facts that can't be disputed. I am deeply grateful to him. <br />I recommend this to everyone who loves their country and wants to know the truth.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Thank you Mr. George Lucas. Next to my computer is a 13 inch flat panel display. I'm watching these three movies over and over and over. I was sixteen when the first movie came out in May 1997 and I got to wait in the long lines to watch it in the theater. I'm so happy these DVDs finally came out.
0375507256|5.0|Mitchell is the current wunderkind of British fiction and in Cloud Atlas it is not hard to see why. An interlocking blend of six terrific studies of hope in the face of opression is presented in an ingenious and entertaining manner. Some of the links may be less convincing than others, and certainly the storytelling is a tad uneven. And yet one cannot but admire and enjoy the sheer boldness and talent that unfolds on the page. Not to be missed.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|There's only one word I can use to describe this new CD from the worlds greatest female vocalist. <br /> <br />\\"OUTSTANDING\\"
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Wow, This is a hilarious movie, probably one of the funniest   American movies I have ever seen. Bringing in the use of puppets as used by other series like \\"The Thunderbirds\\" , Matt Stone  and Trey Parker have hit gold with this movie. Wow where do I start.    Originally Trey Park and Matt Stone were set to direct a spoof  of \\"The Day After Tommorow\\" but that plan was soon removed.    They then decided to make \\"Team America World Police\\" released  by Paramount.      This is a movie that is undergoing such buzz in Hollywood and has gotten worldwide attention among movie fans, clearly this is a movie that is unique.    Matt Stone and Trey Parker have done what other directors have failed to do in the last few years, used a funny movie to create great satire centering on todays corrupt politics, and worldview ,not to mention our  over emphasis fear on \\"Terrorism\\" and American ideals.    The movie main plot is that a group of Americans are part of a secret police that well polices the world under the name \\"Team America\\" lol Well they hunt down terrorist like Osama Bin  Laden and others while acting as diplomatically incorrect as possible.    The scene which spoofs Hans Blitzer a weapons inspector against Korean Dictaor Mr. Cho is hilarious. While Matt and Trey obviously are not trying to make a political movie,  they obviously gives us their interpretation of what not only goes on in the mind of a terrorist, but the corrupt and often   nonexistent plans that the US has in getting these terrorist.    Speaking of which the first frame of the movie is pure comedy as the Team America within a span of five minutes are able to track down Osama Bin Laden, something the poor and disorganized Administration of George Bush and the military has failed to do since September 11    Of course theirs spoofs of movies like the Matrix with the Team America often battling with hilarous, over the top martial arts kicks and punches, but its all done with such lack of precision that you cant help but die laughing at the screen.      The movie while undergoing tremendous success at the box office and praise from fans, has gotten many cheapshots from many so called professional critics who are anything but professional.    Roger Ebert said the movie was nihilistic , lame and that Trey and  Matt'ss attempt was to make fun of \\"anyone who cares about the war\\" like Sean Penn.    Yet Ebert doesnt mention that spoiled celebrities like Sean Penn and Alec  Baldwin  who say they \\"care\\" about the war have an agenda and are using the war to clean their image.    Richard Roper on the other hand, gave a great review, calling it a  great piece of satire and that he enjoyed the jokes.     However, Trey and Matt also give a nice ode to the troops  in America by the song delivered \\"Freedom isn't Free\\".  Freedom is not free many Americans died for our Freedom  and we should never forget that, if it wasn't for the sacrifices  of others, we wouldn't have the world we have today.      Overall though , \\"Team America World Police\\" from the creators of South Park is absolutely  funny that has to be seen over and over again.     I can see a couple of months down the line that DVD release of this movie like Fahrenheit 911 is sure to be a huge hit, so see this funny movie now.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest films of all time. It is very moving film that can make you laugh and make you cry. Its realism is what makes it so good. The film shows very negative things but makes you see the world in a very positive way and makes you appreciate life so much more.It shows how the little things in life can stand out and be beutiful if you look closer. This is the best performance of Kevin Spacey's career.I think alot of peole can relate to his charecter because he is sick of being a nobody and wants to take risks and live life to the fullest. Its a movie about finding your place in life and doing what you want because life is to short to worry about the little things. American Beauty is simply beautiful in everway.
0739313118|3.0|Because of the hype and the amount of people who loved The DaVinci Code, I decided that I had to read it -- I needed to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I would be lying if I said that this book wasn't hard to put down, because it definately was gripping.  This is why I gave it 3 stars.  However, his writing was far from up to par.  My favorite authors are people like Tom Wolfe and other intelligent FSG writers who know how to tell a story but also manage to write really well.  Brown really needs to work on this.  I also felt like at times he was just pulling facts out of a hat and throwing them at the reader, maybe to show off, but who knows?<br /><br />This is a good book for an airplane ride, or a vacation where you want something light and enjoyable.  Look for nothing else in this book.
B00005JMEW|5.0|What can I say about Kill BILL vol 1? It is simply the best Quentin Tarrintiono film ever made. It is a film that shall be remembered for a long time. Uma Thurman plays the bride who is out for blood and revenge on her former partners in crime after they beat her senseless and leave her for dead on her wedding day.Luckly the bride survives and wakes from a coma four years later and will not rest until her former partners are dead. The movie has awsome dialogue and Uma's performance is spectacular. The action sequences are brilliant and just plain cool. The film has a very martial arts syle feel to it. If you are a fan of the action genre than this is a must have DVD.
0345350499|5.0|Morgaine, a complex creature takes the stage, retelling in her own words what was the goings on behind the throne of King Arthur.  Out of all the Arthurian books that I have read, I loved this one the most.  The Mists of Avalon is more about the females then the males in the story, it goes from Igraine to Morgaine, to Viviane, to Gwenhyfar, and Morgause.  There is so much romance in this story, must of it tender and loving, some of it forced.  This is not a book for younger audiences.  It is an excellent refrence to the priestesses of Avalon, and the druids, not to mention Britain becoming a whole christian land, and the fight to make it not so.  It's a long read, about 900 pages, but a good one. Definate good one.

B00003CXCT|5.0|After years of waiting \\"Star Wars,\\" the epic space opera George Lucas first unleashed to the world in 1977, makes its debut on DVD. Lucas is of course known to be a techno freak, obsessed with the concept of digital visual effects or just visual effects in general. Anyone hoping for the original \\"Star Wars\\" prints will be disappointed, but at the end of the day it is Lucas's film and if you're open-minded you can at least appreciate that the re-touching makes the original trilogy connect better with the current prequels. On DVD the trilogy looks stunning, now we can truly appreciate the scope and colors of one of the great unique visions of modern movies. The genius of Lucas, aside from the technical credits, was the way he mingled ancient mythmaking with futuristic science fiction to create what is essentially a modern fairy tale, \\"Star Wars\\" is like Homer's \\"The Odyssey,\\" an epic adventure full of romance, colorful worlds, characters and dashing heroism. The first film, \\"A New Hope,\\" introduces us to the timeless characters of Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 with operatic flare and a stunning sense of visual artistry. It is amazing to watch this film and then hear Lucas speak about low budget problems. The score by John Williams sets the tone for what became one of his most famous works, he hits us with splashing colors of sound and elegant, romantic strings. \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" continues the saga with an even wider angle, a love story develops and we are taken to worlds as diverse as the inside of an asteroid field and a planet composed of clouds. This is also the first showdown between Luke and Vader, and a shocking secret is revealed (is there anyone out there who doesn't know it?!). \\"Return Of The Jedi\\" finishes things with more imaginative flare and a memorable, exciting showdown between good and evil. Lucas deserves credit for delivering his masterpiece in a worthy DVD set, we get the films with commentary and a special fourth disc that not only contains a fascinating documentary, TV spots, trailers and featurettes, but also a small glance into what we'll be seeing in 2005's \\"Episode 3.\\" And yes, there are few re-touches. The scene where Vader speaks with the Emperor in \\"Empire\\" has been re-done a bit, Hayden Christensen of the prequels also makes a surprise appearance in \\"Jedi,\\" so in fact, the re-touching isn't as devastating as some try to make it out to be. \\"Star Wars\\" remains so popular because like Greek mythology it appeals to our basic human feelings and ideas. It is simple and romantic yet deep and meaningful. Consider that people who can't stand \\"Star Trek\\" are easily entertained by \\"Star Wars.\\" And even if you don't care much for myths and philosophy, this is good movie fun. These films contain precisely what great storytelling is all about. Sure you can argue that the acting isn't first rate or that some of the plot threads are hokey, but you can't deny that \\"Star Wars\\" has a heart. This is a must-have in any film collection.

B00005JNEI|5.0|A few words that come to mind... Amazing, enlightening, disturbing, moving, incredible. You get the idea...    Don't be another naive person and say \\"I already know what's in this film, I don't need to see it\\".    You DO NOT know what is in this film...

B000062YAZ|1.0|oh man, what is this? Every song sounds exactly the smae, dededededede blah blah blah, the smae speed everything. The vocals are bad, and so are the lyrics. Fine, ok, its admirable that they can play fast and well, and have talented solos, but that doesn't sasve this from being a piece of crap. I'm sick of you people comparing this to slipknot, different genres and those  who say this is better, maybe faster but less aggressive. Less of a punc, less creativity, (slipknot dj, sampler, rapping, singing, and screaming.) Yes, I know slayer is such an influence and a pioneer I guess, but this just sounds like garbage, most important, every song sounds the same!
B00009P1O2|5.0|This DVD has two discs for under $20 - don't be a cheapskate!  Get it for that reason alone!  The entire Wembley concert is here and more.  Disk 2 contains test camera footage from the Friday night concert, bootleg footage of Queen rehearsing for the \\"Magic\\" tour and interviews with Roger and Brian.  There's close to four hours of \\"stuff\\" on this DVD not counting the complete concert.  I've seen Queen numerous times and unlike some comments made below; Queen concerts are 50% music and 50% party.  The crowd and group are definately in a party mood.  The musicianship is top notch.  There are those who will knock the DVD solely on the basis of oldies \\"Tutti Frutti,\\" \\"Hello Marylou,\\" etc, but I think maybe that's being too picky.  There's close to two hours of classic killer music here.  Best bits would be \\"In The Lap Of The Gods (Revisited),\\" \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" and \\"Now I'm Here.\\"
B00005JMXX|3.0|STORY: Due to \\"environmental abuse\\" by mankind, the Earth reacts by making the shift into a new ice age<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1)Disappointed in some of the special effects. Some of them looked pretty cheesy for today's technology. Some scenes, on the other hand, were pretty cool...more in their concept vs. their delivery.<br /><br />2) Not the same emotional pull as with Deep Impact, but better than Armegeddon. Made me care about the characters a bit<br /><br />3) I personally don't like movies like War of the Worlds where there is very little mankind does (or can do) to fight back. This misses the heroic element in the face of the overwhelming odds.<br /><br />This movie falls into that realm for me. It is just a matter of mankind \\"riding out the storm\\" vs. with Deep Impact and Armegeddon (two recent disaster flicks) where mankind actually tried to fight back. But...they try and make up for it with the character played by Dennis Quaid, which didn't leave me totally feeling jipped as a viewer.<br /><br />4) As with most Hollywoodish disaster flicks, there are definite breaks in the logic or continuity of the story. This movie is no exception, but the mishaps are somewhat forgiveable<br /><br />5) Content was clean as far as no rememberable profanity, no sex or nudity and very low key violence. Most of the deaths are left for you to fill in the blanks even though there was about three where bodies are being crushed or destroyed by some other force of nature<br /><br />OVERALL: Glad I watched it. Don't feel like I need to own it.
B00005JNJ7|1.0|All the mean-spirited creators of this film did was substitute liberal, anti-war movie stars & film makers as America's most deadly enemies. Didn't the Germans do something similar to a different group of people during World War 2? This is truly the most disgusting, violent, liberal-hating, (way beyond bashing), stupid movies I hope to ever see in my lifetime! It's certainly beyond satire or cathartic violence! What's so amusing about a bunch of American fools blowing up some of the world's most important cultural landmarks, or showing scenes of torture in prison? <br /> <br />The gruesome violence at the end of this movie, where every liberal actor and actress in Hollywood is brutally killed, with guts flying every which way, makes it extremely inappropriate for children, or anyone who is not sadistic! I'm a middle-aged adult, and I had to look away from the screen! <br /> <br />Forget about the sex scene, its less than 30-seconds, and certainly not worth the price of admission. Nor has it anything to do with the story line! It's just a ploy for the curious to shell out their hard earned money to purchase a movie ticket. <br /> <br />I felt like walking out towards the end to make a political statement to the audience, but instead I resisted in order to write a thorough review. If you destest being exploited by two guys who are quoted as saying, \\"We have no political agenda,\\" or by gratuitous violence, constant foul language, or sheer boredom, then consider spending your money elsewhere!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JN4F|5.0|If you are in the mood for a fun movie that gives you some laugh out loud moments, this is a great one!  Jimmy (playing cop) and Queen Latifah (taxi driver) are great together!  (they even sing good together?)    If you enjoy Jimmy on SNL, and don't look too closely at the movie's plausibility, but just go to have a good time, like most people in the audience you will be laughing out loud.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  The people rating it low don't like it because it makes fun of hollywood's left... if they even saw it at all.  This blew away South Park: Bigger, Badder, Uncut, which I thought was also hilarious.  The sex scene alone was worth the price of admission.  It's also better if you have a basic knowledge of the political landscape so you can better appreciate the humor. The songs will also leave you singing on the way home from the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this after hearing all the references to Firefly in the bonus material on the Angel season 4 DVD, where I first saw the fabulous Gina Torres, who plays the executive officer on Firefly.    Firefly is worth buying and watching.  It is an sf western with a few brave rogue heroes in a spaceship fighting an evil empire (\\"the alliance\\").  The music and sets are extremely multicultural, and any cussing or expletives are in Chinese, which adds a wonderful flavor to the dialog.  How does such an impossible combination fantasy world work?  I'm not sure exactly, but it does work.  Kudos to Joss Whedon.  Having amazing sets and special effects certainly helps, and the dialog and acting are well done.    However, the (English) dialog lacked quite the same humour and depth of literary reference we know and love from Buffy.  I would have appreciated the DVD's more if the DVD subtitles were to translate the Chinese slang rather than just saying \\"(speaks in Chinese)\\".  And unlike Buffy, where dialog was at a college grade level, Firefly uses a simpler subset of English language, at more of an advanced high school level.    Nathan Fillion, who plays Mal, the captain of Firefly did not work for me as a convincing leadership figure.  His natural character is quite different from the part he plays, and to me he never completely seems to get in character.  There always seems to be a detached and ironic mein that does not seem compatible with the leadership role he tries to play.    Lastly, there is not much season arc.  Each episode story stands (quite well) alone.  This was fine with me, but if you need a season arc, or you need more than the 14 episodes in this set, you will be disappointed.    In summary, despite a few failings, this was a great series which died prematurely.  It is worth buying, and taking the time to watch on DVD.

B0006213WG|5.0|Well I'd been waiting for this cd for a long time. DTLI was awesome and I wanted more. Does this cd live up to it? Yes and no. The best songs on here are in order: <br />1. No Reason <br />2. The Bitter End <br />3. Angels with Dirty Faces <br />4. We're All To Blame <br />5. Welcome To Hell <br />6. I'm Not The One <br />7. 88 <br />8. Open Your Eyes <br /> <br />Now with That said this cd has some even harder stuff than DTLI ,but unfortunately there are also a few mellow songs that stop the flow of the cd. Some Say is good though, the chorus sounds like Handle This from AKNF. Pieces is a good song but can get kind of boring. Theres No Solution is also a good song but not one of the best because again its a little slow. Then theres Slipping Away, ok i'm just gonna say i skip this one every time because its so boring and Derycks voice isnt made for emo crap i wish they had put Noots or Subject To Change on in its place, but oh well. Anyways this is a good disc but some of the more mellow parts are kind of annoying especially if you're a huge fan of DTLI like me. Either way get it for the other 12 good songs and skip slipping away. And No Reason is probably one of Sum's best songs ever.
B00005JMX6|5.0|If you're looking for the hilarious one-liners from American Pie or the steamy-greater-than-your-imagination trains scenes from Risky Business, then you're bound to be disappointed.  <br /> <br />This movie stands on its own merits. It's a telling look at growing up as a confused adolescent. It's a wild ride from start to finish. Perhaps the audience has to use its imagination to bridge some of the scenes, but it triggers deeper intellect to convey the ultimate adventure in finding out who we really are and how much effort we all take in getting to find \\"it.\\"  (Whatever \\"It\\" is...love, companionship, a chance in life.) <br /> <br />Is the juice worth the squeeze?  Yes, definitely. Rent this movie when you think life is in \\"cruise control\\" mode.  We could all benefit from having a 'girl next door' in our lives.
B00005JNEI|4.0|but who cares? Considering how much BS propaganda is out there for republicans in our \\"liberally biased\\" media, its nice to see a democrat who is actually willing to fight (ALMOST) as dirty as republicans do. Of course, no one could ever fight that dirty or lie that much, so its still unbalanced. It also makes me laugh out loud how so many of the one star reviews from republicans are from texas. HA, classic. Anyway, if you are liberal you will probably like this film, if you are conservative, you probably wont. Personally, Im a green, and while republicans are an abomination to our environment, I dont particularly love democrats either. So basically Im prone to enjoy this movie. Ok the politics part is out of the way. <br /> <br />I used to be a film student, and Im still an ardent film buff, and love or hate his politics, Moore is an EXCELLENT filmmaker. You can hate the point he is making, but the way in which he makes is amazing. I have seen some great documentaries. Haxan, nanook of the north, american movie, etc etc; and moore is a great filmmaker, period. so if you are liberal, see this movie, if you are conservative, dont. If you dont care either way, and you want to see a powerful well made documentary, i reccommend this one, and definitely see American Movie...few movies are so heartfelt as that one.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|You can't say enough about this masterpiece of film-making. With enough fantasy to keep you in suspense and enough emotion to fill your eyes with tears, this movie will forever remain a classic with the likes of The Wizard of Oz. A definite must own movie for any movie fan.
0790731002|5.0|A neon change for Batman. Keaton isn't in this movie which makes a small impact on the movie for people who were expecting him. Val was okay. The Riddler stole the show just like catwoman did in RETURNS. Two-Face was a side show.
0790729652|5.0|Batman is one of the best super hero films I've ever seen. Michael Keaton portrays the role of Bruce Wayne and Batman very convincingly as well as Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The story remains kind of vague at the beggining regarding Batman's origin, but as the film goes on it becomes more clear. The direction was really great for this film; I thought that Tim Burton really did a great job adapting the character for the big screen. The special effects are definitely the best I've seen so far for any super hero movie. Jack Nicholson a.k.a. the Joker is the best comic book villain to grace the big screen; I really can't see anyone portraying a better villain. Overall, the movie offers a very deep story about the Dark Knight and offers many action sequences to compliment the plot. I feel many Batman fans will love this movie as well as everyone else. Unfortunately, the last Batman film killed the franchise though.
6301773551|5.0|First things first, buy this film on laserdisc.<br /><br />Skip the DVD box set.<br /><br />Folks, there's a lot of things I could say about this film, but I'm pretty sure most of you reading this site have already seen this movie. The special effects are fantastic for this film even by today's standards, and the character development in this film is one of the best I've seen in years. The story will have you on an epic adventure of many proportions, so it's no wonder this film is still remembered even today. Although there are certain story elements that aren't really original and the story can get predictable at times, it doesn't ruin this film. George Lucas does a great job directing this film and has the story and special effects work together beautifully; the soundtrack for this film is superb. With so many great memorable scenes like the showdown between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader or the classic flight scene with Luke Skywalker. This movie will have you cheering and begging for more after it's finished. Overall, it's a great film for the ages.
0790730960|5.0|This is good for a sequel. It made more movie than the first one and still had a good plot. The story to this one HOWEVER is more centered on the villan than batman. Who doesn't want to see more of Catwoman and the Penguin? The costumes were wonderful, and the acting was overly well.
B000286S8S|4.0|I remember Dick Clark having a quote from years ago that, to paraphase, said something to the effect that music is the soundtrack of our lives, and that's why it's so important.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this is what Top 40 rock used to sound like. Talk about a bygone era. When I was in middle school, Van Halen was starting to reach the pinnacle of their success with \\"1984\\". I remember being electrified by \\"Jump\\"--still am today. A couple years later the whole new iteration of the band came along with \\"5150\\"--a line-up taking me all the way through college with \\"Top Of The World\\". I never really cared about whether it was David Lee Roth or the Red Rocker fronting the band. Van Halen was still Van Halen as far as I was concerned. If that's the way you feel, you'll probably enjoy this collection quite a bit. The soap opera is just part of the scenery.<br /><br />I can't really think of anything that's missing from this double CD. It's the best collection I've ever come across for Van Halen. From \\"Eruption\\" to \\"Love Walks In\\" both eras are well-represented. The Sammy Hagar years seemed to have more power ballads--at least that's my perception. You'll find those here. The flamboyant David Lee Roth rockers like \\"Hot For Teacher\\" and \\"Panama\\" are also here.<br /><br />So, why not a full five stars? First, while Roth and the band can't play nicely together, it would still be nice to have seen some vintage photos of the original line-up. He helped put them on the map with both his powerful vocals and his antics. He's briefly mentioned in the liner notes and that's it.<br /><br />Second, the new songs are largely forgettable. Why bother slapping them on a collection that can sell just fine without new junk material?<br /><br />Third, I'm a little disappointed that the \\"Oh Pretty Woman\\" guitar solo which leads into the song has been chopped off. We get the barebones radio single here. Ironically, at my radio station, we play the album version.<br /><br />Finally, the live versions of \\"Panama\\" and \\"Jump\\" are pretty lackluster--and performed by Sammy Hagar. That borders on sacrilege! They come off as album filler. The worst is \\"Panama\\", which has Sammy doing an embarrassing foul-mouthed diatribe mid-song, partly lamenting the fact that instead of joining the rest of the band to party with a congregation of hot girls the night before, he had been in his room watching TV. It would have been funny were it not for the fact that Sammy qualifies for the senior menu at Denny's. Instead, it sounds contrived and somewhat pathetic--not unlike David Lee Roth's buttless pants from the 80's.<br /><br />These thoughts aside, I'm happy because my favorite material (from both eras) is on the double CD. Since that includes all their major hits and then some, I feel I can recommend the collection. You'll enjoy the edgy, dangerous beginnings to the safe but still solid later years.he live versions of \\"Panama\\" and \\"Jump\\" are pretty lackluster--and performed by Sammy Hagar.

Instead, it sounds contrived and somewhat pathetic--not unlike David Lee Roth's buttless pants from the 80's.<br /><br />These thoughts aside, I'm happy because my favorite material (from both eras) is on the double CD. Since that includes all their major hits and then some, I feel I can recommend the collection. You'll enjoy the edgy, dangerous beginnings to the safe but still solid later years.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|I have never been a South Park fan, and have watched about 5 minutes of it total, but Team America just drew me in.  Throughout the movie, I was constantly amused by the humor.  Supposedly everyone should be offended by this movie.  But aside from the overuse of the f-word, and the very odd sex scene, the only conservatives who will be offended by this movie will be the church ladies.  The skewering of Hollywood celebrities and their silly pacifist views will offend liberals; the more leftist, the mroe offended they will be.<br /><br />I could only rate this 4 stars as I have little interest in watching it again.  I loved it the first time, but I have no desire to see it again, save for maybe adding the unedited DVD to my collection when it is released.  A 5-star movie should be one I can watch over and over again.
B00005UW9T|4.0|After Prince of Egypt, this is perhaps the most realistically animated movie of all time<br />It is beautiful, with the voices perfectly in sync with the animation, and some beautiful songs like the exquisite Once Upon a December.<br />Meg Ryan really puts a cute voice to Anya, and Hank Azaria is really funny as the albino bat, in fact better than the much-overrated Robin Williams, in his similar roles in other animated movies.<br />The scene of the Christmas in the palace, with Kirsten Dunst reading the young Anastasia was really enchanting, and the whole adventure is a compelling epic. Kelsey Grammar and John Cusack play their roles also with aplomb, as the adventure across Europe to re-unite the  Anastasia (the orphan Anya)  with the Grand Duchess unfolds , all the while believing that they are just passing off a con!<br /> It is once of the best animated movies of all times, along with Prince of Egypt (1998) and Alice in Wonderland (1952) except... Why was Rasputin the chief villain? I mean I know that you can't expect too much historical accuracy from an animated movie, but there really was a Prime Evil in the story of Anastasia, the Romanovs and Russia:  and his name was Vladimir Illyich Lenin.<br /><br />Rasputin had nothing to do with the murder of the Romanov family, but the Bolsheviks certainly where brutal and evil, beyond anything in any fairy tale, and their acolytes (eg Noam `Wormtongue' Chomsky, the apologist of tyranny and terror). So why where such perfect villains almost completely left out of the movie?<br /><br />Put in Lenin instead of Rasputin as the chief villain/devil role and now you have a classic! Or is it just not PC these days to go too hard on the Commies?
0345347951|4.0|Arthur C. Clarke is the quintessential writer of science fiction. Few writers of our modern age of space stations, clones, and the information superhighway can approach the depth and knowledge of Clarke, who wrote long before such things were dreamed of as reality. Clarke blends two things to make his writings classic: an intimate knowledge of both science (Clarke was a true scientist; he invented the first communications satellite) and the human condition. He taps the depths of science to touch the human desire for a world beyond the world, and attempts to answer religious questions from a totally secular viewpoint. The opening scene of this story was directly copied in the movie \\"Independence Day\\": gigantic alien ships appearing over every major city of the world. But instead of destroying humanity as in the movie, the aliens begin a social program that eventually creates a utopian human society, which is only the starting point for their true motives. The aliens themselves remain hidden, at least for part of their rule over Earth, and the revelation of their physical form is one of the great moments of the book. Clarke's annoying refusal to focus on a single protagonist is understandable, given that he is tracing an alien social engineering program that spans centuries. \\"Childhood's End\\" is not Clarke's best - I give that title to \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" - but it is vintage Clark: a classic work of science fiction that grips both the mind and the heart.
B0000029AL|5.0|Aerosmith has made great albums... Rocks, Toys in the Attic, Draw the Line, etc. They're all great... no doubt about that, but without their debut album, they might not have recieved that push they needed to be stars. This is a very raw and gritty album. If you want proof, listen to Steven Tyler's vocals. He never sounded like that again after Get Your Wings. Along with its importance, their debut album provides the listener with a barrage of catchy, bluesey rock. Aerosmith doesn't give up until you reach the end of the album. <br /> <br />1. Make It: Great opener, period. There is truly nothing wrong with this song. It's catchy and it rocks. 8.5 stars (out of ten.) <br />2. Somebody: The opening riff is original, the vocals soar above the istrumentals, and the guitar is killer. 8.5 stars. <br />3. Dream On: The only song that gains enough recognition it deserves. This is the second-definitive Aerosmith song, next to Walk This Way. Perfect. 10 stars. <br />4. One Way Street: An epic blues-rock bonanza. Love the guitar Love the harmonica. Love the vocals. Aw, heck, I love it all. 9 stars. <br />5. Mama Kin: Some of the best riffs Joe Perry ever made are displayed on this track. I'm so glad they added it to the latest greatest hits album (Oh Yeah!) 10 stars. <br />6. Write Me: One of their most underrated songs ever. The beat is rocking, and there isn't any better harmonica-wailing anywhere. It's a personal favorite of mine. 9 stars. <br />7. Movin Out: This is a very moody and out-of-place song here. It's not bad by a long shot. It just doesn't fit with all of the fast paced flurries the preceed it. It's still a keeper that I think would have been better on Get Your Wings. 8 stars. <br />8. Walkin' The Dog: One of their best cover songs. The only thing that falters is the odd opening, but once you get through it, it's such a great song. The guitars rock, and so do the vocals. What a way to close it. 9.5 stars. <br /> <br />Tha comes to a grand total of 9 stars.In short: What are you waiting for, an invitation? Get this if you like music PERIOD.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The classic trilogy finally comes to DVD with a crystal clear transfer and booming 5.1 digital surround sound. Watching these again brought back my childhood. Lucas has made even more changes to the DVD versions of the films (after he already changed them with the 1997 Special Editions), and most of them are positive. Lucas has even changed a few things back from the '97 editions, most notably the now-infamous \\"Greedo shoots first\\" scene in the cantina. In the new version, Greedo and Han Solo shoot at the same time, but Han's dodge still looks fake. There are also prequel-related changes, such as Hayden Christensen's appearing at the end of Return of the Jedi as Vader's ghost instead of Sebastian Shaw, who appeared as the unmasked Vader in the original 1983 version of ROTJ. On one of the DVD documentaries, Bill Moyers says that with these films George Lucas \\"enhanced the entire cultural imagination.\\" Even though I'm 26 years old, I still dream of being a Jedi Knight every now and then, just like when I was a kid. Moyers is right.  <br /> <br />
B00005K3NR|4.0|Ok there is a girl in high school that is the outcast and gets picked on all the time and when she has her first period the other girls really pick on her hard. Carrie grew up in a very religious house where her mom thought that all men are evil and that women are always weak. Her mom is a but of a nut and when Carrie does wrong (not her fault, or knowing she has) Carrie is locked in a closet in the kitchen and is made to ask for forgiveness. Carrie later learns that she has telekinesis powers and is able to move things. Well one of the girls that picked on Carrie has her boyfriend take Carrie to the prom and then they get voted king and queen (obviously) and then when it all takes place a bucket of pig blood (reminding her of her period) falls on her when Kris(Nancy Allen, who hates her with a passion, along with her boyfriend Billy Nolan, John Travolta) pull the rope and Carrie goes ballistic and pretty much kills everyone there and then burns the place down. On her way home she see's Kris and Billy and flips their car and it bursts into flames. Carrie goes home and her mom is waiting on her to of course kill her because she thinks her daughter is a witch but the tables are turned and Carrie uses her powers to impale kitchen utensils into her mother. Then Carrie brings down the house on them and it seems to be all over. One special note in this film is watch the camera, things in the foreground are in focus also with things in the background in focus this is done with a special lenses. Also the camera shot of the girl collecting the ballots is one continuous shot, when they were shooting they were moving tables and people to get the camera through then they would have to move them all back. It's really cool. What does hurt this movie is the split screen at the prom scene. And Brian DePalma(The Director) also did not like it but it kind of grew on him so he left it. I think it could have been done a little better. But still a pretty good film to have. One of my favorites.
B00004R9A4|5.0|As a kid, I watched this movie over and over!  I loved witches and still do!  I also loved Mary Poppins but this is my favorite!  I used to recite all the spells and try to get my broom off the ground with Nekipo Nekrifs Crumpic Leach and try to perform Substitutiary Locamotion! I'd also sing along to all the songs until my mother wanted to kill me!  I still have my old Vhs version (the 3rd I had to buy becuase I had all but worn out the previous two) I didn't even know it was released on DVD until my mother got it for me two Christmases ago.  I started reading the back and when I found out it was restored, I was plotzing! I now enjoy it even more than I did as a kid!  So give it a try!  It's fabulous! The only thing I was so sad about was that \\"Step In The Right Direction\\" was destroyed.  Maybe one day they'll find a print and we'll get to see it!  Another great thing is that Angela Lansbury is fresh from \\"Mame\\" and this is one of her better musical roles!  So if you're an Angie fan, as I am, this is the movie for you!
B00005JKG7|4.0|This is a pretty good movie to have in any collection. It does move a bit slow at times but it makes up for it by having a pretty good, well directed cast. The basis is a small town called Antonio Bay, CA and 100 years ago a ship hit the shore that carried a leaper colony, it was guided there by a small campfire that was set by 6 of the original townsfolk in order to crash the ship and not have them live close to them. Father Malone(Hal Holbrook) finds a book from his father in the church and it explains that the 100 year celebration is doomed for that town for the dead will rise from their watery grave in the sea and come back to find the 6 people that lit that campfire. It has some good 'sit on the edge of the seat' moments, and it has it's bad ones. In a nutshell when the fog rolls in the killing begins, and when it rolls out then it's safe. There are a few good climatic moments, this film when made was not quite scary enough to make it so they had to go back and reshoot some 60% of it to make it where they thought it'd get off the ground. I'd give it 5 stars if the 'ghosts' were more then just arms, and they actually kind of ganged up on the folks instead of one ghost per kill. Good movie though, make sure ya watch the start of it when they are all around the campfire, it's a pretty good story.  <br />
B000000OPW|5.0|Siouxsie & The Banshees - Tinderbox (1986)<br /><br />On TINDERBOX, surely one of S&B's finest records, Siouxsie and co. continue to mine their dark, lush soundscapes with poetic verve. While far from the post-punk bite of their earliest days, TINDERBOX has a hard-edge to match its sophisticated beauty, thanks in no small way to new member John Valentine Carruthers, yet another talented guitarist whose days as a Banshee were all too brief.<br /><br />Every song here is top-drawer Siouxsie. Sioux's trademark gothic creepiness pervades on cuts like \\"92degrees\\" and the blistering \\"This Unrest,\\" while the gorgeous \\"Party's Fall\\" (one of my favorites) and \\"Cities In Dust\\" prove to be irresistibly catchy, the later becoming an unlikely underground dance-club hit at the time. The last cut on the original album, \\"Land's End,\\" features mind-blowingly hypnotic drum patterns from the amazingly talented Budgie which perfectly compliment the eerie guitars and ominous vocals. It's a strong contender for one of S&B's all-time best songs.<br /><br />5 additional tracks have been added, probably because 8 songs makes for a pretty short album by today's standards. While \\"The Quarterdrawing of the Dog\\" is enjoyable if clearly B-quality material, \\"An Execution,\\" \\"Lullaby,\\" and \\"Umbrella\\" are unusual and reveal S&B's boundless creativity along with some intriguing percussion from Budgie. The extended \\"Cities In Dust\\" dissects and expands on the original without really adding much, but it's quite useful for the fan who just can't get enough.<br /><br />This is the first Banshees album I ever heard, way back in the day when it was first released. It is quintessential S&B and I would recommend it to anyone just starting to get into the group.
074325144X|5.0|First of all, I'm a publisher of children's books (Bollix Books.) I see no reason why a friend of the author can't write a review, especially if they're enthusiastic about the book. I've had friends who have read the books I publish (I'm not the author) to their children and expressed enthusiasm, write a review of the book here on Amazon. What's the big deal? It'd be one thing of these friends were misleading the public into purchasing a lemon.  <br /> <br />But this book is NOT a lemon! It's amazing. I've read the book and used the method on my last 2 runs. It's incredible. You can relax your legs AND run at the same time. Who would have ever thought? I just love everything about this method. Though I've slowed my runs down considerably to focus on the form (I naturally have terrible posture which is a fundamental element of the form) I did my long run yesterday with astonishing ease, and ZERO soreness today. Because I've had a difficult couple of years of injuries (a stress fracture to my hip, and Plantars) I became interested in this method. I have great confidence in what's to come...
B000003TA4|1.0|A thoroughly rockin' album I have listened to over and over. But they severely lost credibility in my book when I found out \\"Come As You Are\\" ripped off Killing Joke's \\"Eighties.\\" Ripping off other peoples' music is inexecusibly sleezy. \\"Come As You Are\\" was key to propelling Nirvana into the realm of fame and fortune and it was nothing but a lie. For shame! I'll still listen and love it though. Shame on me!

McNair \\"Zarathustra\\"  (Santa Cruz, ca United States) - See all my reviews    This films is perhaps the only example of a film based on a book, that is actully slightly better than the book (novella really but who's counting hehe). I saw this one in the theaters years ago, and loved it. It's an inspiring story about redemption, but it is *not* the greatest movie of all time, sorry.     Top 100, no doubt, top 10, no chance. Either way, you should love this film, almost as much as the 700+ fanatics that posted below me, so go out and buy this fine film and add it to your DvD library.\\"    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++    I found this comment quite interesting.

B000002LQR|4.0|Many refer to BSSM as the semenal release from the Chili Peppers and it probably is if you want to know the average Chili Peppers. This album is a perfect example of what the Chilis are but not their best. This album still contains too many flaws to top By The Way.  <br />1)Power of Equality: Very Good Song. Also politically powerful. <br />2)If You Have to Ask: another pretty good song. The guitar solo outro hits the mark and the deep rap verses are perfect. <br />3)Breaking the Girl: Great song. The acoustic rhythm is flawless and the vocals are extremely heartfelt. The garbage can drums are a nice touch. <br />4)Funky Monks: The opening funk riff is amazing but the song drags a little long. The guitar solo saves it and keeps it alive. <br />5)Suck My Kiss: Power!! The bass line is rollicking, the guitar is off-time but that only adds to the essence, and the vocals and drums accent the song. <br />6)I Could Have Lied: This song is just beautiful. Every aspect is perfect and the solo is def. Frusciante's best. <br />7)Mellowship Slinky in B Major: So Far so good. The album hasn't hit a rut yet and the win streak doesn't end wih this song. Good funky song. <br />8)The Righteous and the Wicked: This song is okay. The verses are sort of annoying and the guitar is a little too overbearing in the chrous. Otherwise good. <br />9)Give It Away: Does this need an explanation? <br />10)Blood Sugar Sex Magik: The title track, originally too close to Track 2 but the chrous is definitely a saving grace. <br />11)Under the Bridge: Instant classic. <br />12)Naked in the Rain: Amusing but quickly loses its novelty. <br />13)Apache Rose Peacock: A funk classic, no one does it better. Good song no questions asked. <br />14)The Greeting Song: Again, this song has original charm but that wears off quickly. <br />15)My Lovely Man: Anthony's ode to Hillel. It's alright. Nothing special. <br />16)Sir Psycho Sexy: Whoo. You don't go around singing these lyrics at school. The extremely aggressive lyrics might keep some people from reaching the beautiful outro jam <br />17)They're Red Hot: A robert johnson cover, its just a goof to end the album.
0783232039|5.0|Even after seeing this a million times, it still is creepy. Jennifer Tilly and Brad Dourif do a great job with the voices of the dolls.
B00005JMH2|3.0|Not particularly moving or life-changing but an alright way I suppose to pass two hours of your life. Well-acted (especially Stanley Tucci), but Jennifer Lopez's mysterious sadness act was sort of hokey. John Clark's (Gere)fourteen year old daughter is an annoying self-centered brat whose completely unnecessary actions bring embarrassment to her dad's dancing partner, and they could have done the film without her.  Maybe he took up ballroom dancing to get away from this kid, not his wife.<br /><br />One of those \\"all's well that ends well\\" type movies.
B00000K19E|3.0|does anyone else think this movie was seriously boring?  i mean, the action parts were rad, how cool was the whole security building shootout?  very cool, thats how cool.  but other than that, seriously, is the rest of that movie interesting?  the only part anyone points to whenever i say i think its boring is the shootout!  5 minutes out of 2 1/2 doesn't make a movie!  <br /> <br />i do get it, obviously the movie completely broke open a world of possibilities (though i'm suprised at how few movies have ripped them off.  no one would mind!  is it just to expensive? c'mon, who doesn't want to see people flying around and shooting each other at a million miles an hour upside down?  especially with ninja swords!  thats just my idea hollywood, feel free to steal it.) <br /> <br />and its not like the movie is terrible, but people love this movie to an extreme degree, and i just think...i mean, c'mon, its boring!  here is some sample dialogue.  these scences make up a good 7/8s of the movie.  \\"are we in the matrix?\\"  \\"no.\\"  \\"now we're in the matrix\\" \\"oh, i though we were not in the matrix\\" \\"no, we are, and we all wear crumby clothes.\\" \\"i think we're in the matrix\\" \\"well, we're not\\"  \\"i'm you're arch nemisis and i'll talk reeeaallly sllllooooowwwwwwwwwww[...]\\" <br />see?  boring.   <br /> <br />and i've got to admit that the second movie was rad, no story, lots of people shooting each other.  and its cartoon violence as well, i mean, no one feels bad about shooting robot/ghost things.  or that guy that talks slow.  (though, i mean, it was cool to have him come out a thousand times, but we could get a few different options for enemies, couldn't we?  did he get an acadamy award for portraying the same character  a lot in one movie?  because i think it would get old if i were him)  what cracks me up is that everyone i talked to thought it needed more story!  no!  thats what ruined the first one!  oh!  and it totatlly ruined the third one!  (here's how bad.  i was on a planefor like, another 12 hours.  i just stopped watching it and stared at the wall.  its so boring!  well, the kung fu fight was rad.)   <br /> <br />the matrix had some pretty amazing and original ideas, and it was groundbreaking, but its just so over rated i couldn't help myself but to write this!  and of course, i already checked, about 2,304 plus peope disagree, but that's my point.   <br /> <br />ok, ok, you disagree completely, you can have your opinion, i can have mine, but here, can we agree on this?  whichever movie where they all had that freaky chemimcal brothers rave in a cave and bumped and ground and made out and were trying to look all sexy with these metal dots all over them and were all rubbing the dots and going all crazy, that was pretty weird.  you've got to at least admit that.
B000001EKX|5.0|Where do I begin? This CD has it all. Great front & back cover and the songs are AWESOME!!!!     \\"Got to Choose\\" Great opener with great vocals from the 1 & only Paul Stanley. I give this song 3 stars.     \\"Parasite\\" Great lyrics, great guitar work from Ace Frehley & the riff is PERFECT! Definitely 5 stars.     \\"Goin' Blind\\" Awesome track from Gene with great lyrics. Ace's solo in this song is one of my favorites. 4 stars.     \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" Another kick A** song from the MASTER himself Paul Stanley. This song should have NEVER been dropped from ANY KISS set-list. 5 Stars.     \\"Let Me Go, Rock 'N Roll\\" Original anthem before RARAN came along. This song is so catchy, you'll be singing along everytime you hear it, trust me. 5 stars.     \\"All the Way\\" Another forgotten classic IMO, it was FINALLY brought out for their latest tour this year & it sounded great! This song is also very catchy. 5 stars.     \\"Watchin' You\\" Great, great, great song! I love this one. Excellent Guitars & one of the best Drum outro's from my IDOL Peter Criss. 5 stars.     \\"Mainline\\" Paul wrote this song but Peter sings it & does a great job. Can't help but sing this one as well when I hear it :) 4 stars.     \\"Comin' Home\\" my 5th favorite KISS song. This song is so good, I can NEVER get enough of it! Paul & Ace wrote it & it just RULES! Only 2:38 long but it delivers. DEFINITELY 5 stars!     \\"Strange Ways\\" Ace wrote this one but Peter sings lead & it delivers as well. Some say it features Ace's best Guitar solo. It definitely ROCKS! 3 stars.     My review of the GREATEST CD EVER MADE! You must be NUTS if you don't own this one yet.
B00000FCBC|4.0|I know guys, its been seven long years but now its time for the bold return of the REAL Metallica...even though they would die the following year with S&M and then go to hell in 2003 with St. Agony. After the Black Album it was like Satan emerged out of nowhere to take the souls of these once mighty metalheads and then use replacements that had no talent at all. Okay, with that theory aside all I can say is that this is going to be required for any die-gard, but also keep in mind that, although this is covers its still Metallica and IS good. But be warned, this is the last good Metallica album... <br />Metallica albums: <br />Kill 'Em All - 9/10 <br />Ride the Lightning - 11/10 <br />Master of Puppets - 12/10 <br />Garage Days Re-revisisted - 10/10 <br />...And Justice for All - 9.5/10 <br />The Black Album - 7/10 <br />Binge and Purge - 7/10 <br />Garage Incorporated - 8/10 <br />'Tallica Albums: <br />Load - 4/10 <br />Reload - 2/10 <br />S&M - 1.5/10 <br />St. Anger (more like St. Ass) - [-6/10]
B000001EL3|5.0|Words just can not describe how F'N GREAT this CD is! My 2nd favorite KISS CD. Let's take a trip to \\"Detroit Rock City\\"     #1: \\"Detroit Rock City\\" From the opening report of the youth that had lost his life to the starting of the car with RARAN playing in the back ground this song was about to take off. One of the best KISS openers for any concert, this song simply kicks major A**!!!! 4 stars.    #2: \\"King of the Night Time World\\" My 2nd favorite KISS song. With the BIG explosion of the crash leading into the awesome guitar intro from Ace this song just get's you goin'! 5 stars.     #3: \\"God of Thunder\\" is an ok song but it never was that exciting to me, I give it 2 stars.     #4: \\"Great Expectations\\" Great song sung by Gene. The choir is just FANTASTIC! even makes me cry ;( 5 stars.     #5: \\"Flaming Youth\\" Great anthem written by Paul, Gene & Ace. The  opening is awesome! 3 stars.     #6: \\"Sweet Pain\\" Classic song from Gene with very cathy lyrics. Gotta love the line \\"My Leather's fit tight around me, whip is always beside me\\" I LOVE it! 4 stars.     #7: \\"Shout it Out Loud\\" Good anthem song but never really cared that much for it. I give it 2 stars.     #8: \\"Beth\\" the single GREATEST SONG EVER WRITTEN!!! And my #1 favorite song of all-time! Peter's vocals are SUPURB & the Symphony music is just BEAUTIFUL! 10 STARS!     #9: \\"Do You Love Me\\" Another KISS classic. One of Paul's best IMO. The opening is KILLER! 5 stars.     Just about everyone that I know own this INCREDIBLE CD but if YOU, yes YOU don't... GO BUY IT NOW!!!!
0446677450|5.0|It`s finances for Dummies, you read it and goes through your mind slowly, but once you catch the main idea, it`s done. Many of the things in the book came to my mind in my late 20`s and 30`s, so it`s worthwhile taking advantage of time and reading it before it`s too late.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I'll have to admit I was awed by this film.  Director Peter Weir and the producers of this masterpiece are to be commended for their audacity in creating and releasing a film of this genre in the first place-it just doesn't fit in with the formula age we now live in (just look at some of the mindless reviews this film has received here on amazon).<br /><br />The fictional, though clearly fact-based story takes a snippet of a voyage of the HMS Surprise, an English warship assigned to capture or destroy the Archeron, a French vessel of superior armament and design.  From the very beginning of the film one is assaulted with the idea of just what it was like to be a crewmember on a naval sailing vessel in 1805.  Napoleon Bonaparte was at his zenith on the European Continent; the only place he was not able to dominate was the sea.<br /><br />This film has a realism matched by only the best of the modern war genre; 'Black Hawk Down' and 'Saving Private Ryan' come to mind.  Capt. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) must make decisions that literally mean life and death to his crewmen, some of whom are mere children.  Painful consequences are written all over the actor's battleworn faces.<br /><br />The incredible battle sequences and the amazing navigation of Cape Horn (the southern tip of South America) are a tour de force of cinematography, CGI effects, and the simply magnificent soundtrack.  I can honestly say the DTS format on this film is among the best sound I have heard in any DVD-it is that good.<br /><br />I have watched this film three times now, and am still as impressed as the first time I saw it.  There is nothing else in the sailing-era genre of naval warfare film that compares with Master and Commander.  I thus give it an unequivocal 5 stars.
6303402348|5.0|Ok, so it's not Mean Streets or some other REALISM-based story that you can watch and be like \\"oh, I can see how that could happen\\".  Has half the population been deprived of a pleasure that us daydreamers like to call \\"fantasy\\"?  Sure, you might expect a film in the drama section of your video store to not be so idealistic and goofy, but it's not the filmmakers' fault this film is in the drama section.  You COULD put this in the comedy section, the fantasy section (if your video store has one), the FAMILY section, or even the ACTION/adventure section. <br />  The fact of the matter is that if you can stop nitpicking at the film while you're supposed to be enjoying it (in other words, commit the \\"horrendeous\\" deed of \\"suspending belief\\" which I think is a stupid term 'cause movies are almost always dramatised to the extent of fantasy and they shouldn't be taken seriously, since even the most realistic films are quite trivial when you look at the big scheme of life), you will find that this film is the most extreme tearjerker b/c of its heart-pounding idealism and romance.  All throughout the film I couldn't keep from shedding a tear of...well, I don't know why I cried through so much of the film...I guess the previous statement would explain it better. <br />  The simple fact of the matter is if you loved Mean Streets (the Scorsese film that pre-dates Taxi Driver) you probably won't like this film.  If you've never seen Mean Streets, then whatever.  I personally wasn't able to watch the majority of Mean Streets, so I think it makes sense that I liked this film.  The visuals are creative and lushious, and the story brings to mind a gigantic field of flowers.  In lamen's terms, it's pure fantasy! <br />  Also, on a little bit of a different note, I should say that in all scientificness (unless your view of science is based on cynicism), the story COULD happen!!!  It is not entirely impossible for a simple-minded man to experience several pieces of history and become amultiply-talented celebrity.  It doesn't happen most of the time, if at all, but it COULD happen!!!  Also, Tom Hanks is not \\"going for the cheese\\".  He simply recognizes good screenwriting when he sees it.  IF you don't like idealism, then there's no need to misrepresent the filmmakers for doing the best they could with this particular KIND of story/film. <br />  That's all I have to say about that.
0446608955|4.0|This was a very sweet novel. It was so simple and I loved the voice of the main character.  The writing was very conversational.  This was the second Nicholas Sparks book I've read and it's amazing how he's captured a totally different feel. It's a familiar story of the nerdy girl and the more popular kid falling in love but some how it feels a little fresh. The story made me laugh and the end I've got to admit the main characters decision did make me close to crying. It was a very sweet decision. I highly recommend this book if you want a quick, sweet read.  (Author of Forever My Lady: A Novel) [...]
B0001O3YD0|5.0|I suspect that much of the commercial appeal for this film comes from Vin Diesel's presence; which is sad since this film has some great ideas, and a great monster design, done by the consistently cool Patrick Tatopoulos. <br />However, since Vin has gone on to bigger and better films ( Like XXX ) more power to him. <br />The bad points, IMO, are the Australian actors who can't even pull off decent accents of any kind ( should have overdubbed the lot), and the \\"process\\" that was decided on to \\"hyper\\"-light the  daylight portions of the film. <br />This film  bears no relation to Aliens or the other film mentioned in the editorial. Not even if you compare them to the re-edits that come out in Quadrilogy. <br />Anyways, the film is quick to start, and races at a great pace. Don't be fooled by the reviews panning Vin's work ... he does a great job, and conveys a superb feeling as the hero ( or \\"anti-hero\\" if you wish). <br />As it is, the film is a great watch. If only some of the stylistic film stock changes could be reversed ... <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|This film has alot of good special effects but the dumb plot seems like an afterthought. The whole story centers around global warming triggering a new Ice Age. There are scenes where people are instantly frozen to death, tornados and hurricans flooding and tearing up cities. <br /> <br />The movie fails to depict the true ramifications of such a climate upheaval: Society would end and a new \\"Dark Age\\" would ensue. Billions of people would die, not just from the weather but from starvation and the wars that would follow. The movie softballs the whole story, especially the subplot about the father who travels through the tundra on foot to rescue his son (simply ridiculous). <br /> <br />Just like Independence Day, the movie works if you don't think too much.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First to clear this up.  The next time I hear somebody call this a Bush bashing album, in either a good way or a bad way, I'm going to punch them in the face.  This album is not about Bush, it's about drugs, depression, and the soul-crushing monotony of everyday life, to name a few...certainly problems we'll have regardless of who wins the bloody election.  Sure there's that part in \\"Holiday\\"...to tell you the truth, I'm not really sure why they threw it in, but who cares?  That's not the main thrust of the album, so shut up about it. <br /> <br />Now on to the actual album.  It's amazing, is really all I can say.  I consider it to be a really emotional album, and call me weird, but I have a lot of fun trying to piece together the plot and characters.  (I was so proud of myself for discovering that Jesus and Jimmy were the same character, only to find that others interperted it this way too)  The 9-minute songs, especially \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" are done brilliantly, and the whole album flows together perfectly (except \\"American Idiot\\" feels like the obligitory-single)   <br /> <br />Green Day has been my favorite band ever since shortly after \\"Warning\\" when I actually started listening to music.  This is my first opportunity to hear a Green Day album right at its release, and they didn't disappoint me in the slightest.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I was so disappointed. What happened to the trilogy? The ending left most people hanging...The matrix was a build to basically nothing, that really sucks.The matrix revolution movie was better than reloaded in that it actually had a storyline and there were the deep moments. When the general was fighting and when Trinity died. It was so sad....sorry for those who haven't seen it, the end fight scene with agent smith was good but appeared very fake at times.And there were way to many machines...It was a technological breakthrough but dang, enough is enough. Overall the Matrix Revolutions was better than Reloaded but a disappointment.
B00005JMH2|5.0|Anyone who has ever had anything at all to do with the world of dance will absolutely love this movie. I'm going to go see it at least two more times.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|Ironic that it's from guys who make fun of Christians. The movie is funny, but it's also propaganda. There's no Bush or Kerry, which would've made it funny. The music is funny and for the most part it's a funny movie. A really great wooden sex scene. Team America goes over the top, but what do you expect from South Park guys.
B0002CX4RM|4.0|This DVD of Saint-Saens Samson ET Dalila is more than just a tape of an operatic performance.  At the end of the performance that was taped in 1998 Placido Domingo was honored for his 30 years at \\"the Met\\" plus  for his 17th opening night at that company.  The well deserved praises were delivered by various \\"big wigs\\" of opera and by the then mayor of New York City, Giulani (SP ?) who embarrassingly mispronounces Domingo's first name in his presentation (he must not be too much of an opera fan because, I feel that anyone that knows anything about opera would know how to pronounce Placido Domingo's name.)  Anyway, it was a very moving, well-deserved tribute to a singer that has given so much to the operatic world and has to be one of the hardest working performers in the profession.  I, as well as Placido, was moved to tears.   Now about the performance.      It is obvious when currently hearing/viewing Domingo that time has slipped by-more girth, some jowls and some difficulty getting up from a semi-recumbent position with Dalila. Vocally, however, time has not, too much taken its toll.  Granted he dodges some of the high notes and the ones he sings are approached carefully.  Nevertheless, he sing Samson like no body else can singing the role wonderfully and knowingly mainly due to his many years of experience.  He still is truly an amazing artist!  By no stretch of the imagination would, (at least in this performance), anyone think of Olga Borodina as a seductress (I think she was pregnant at the time) no more than they would  think that she could really dance in the first act; however, vocally she pours out marvelous sounds producing a singular column of sound with no register breaks all the way up to the ferocious, pin them to the wall,  high B flat in act two.  All  that I can say is Brava.    Sergei Leiferkus (really not at home in French opera) does the nasty High Priest very well.  Rene Pape as the old Hebrew is truly (once his voice warms up) luxury casting.The production is one of those \\"minimum stagings\\" that I am beginning to like more and more-I'm afraid that I really don't get all of the symbolism (i.e., hand prints on the costumes and wild hair styles) however, I enjoyed it.  (I have to agree with a previous reviewer that the set does resemble a volcano.)  James Levine conducts the score knowingly taking it from a mere oratorio to an opera at its most exciting.    In closing, I truly am glad that I have added this well-sung performance of Samson ET Dalila to my collection-it wonderfully pays homage to one of opera's true legends.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Van Helsing is a fun movie released theatrically at the right time.  the story here is that Dracula has recruited Dr. Frakenstein to create his creature in order to fullfill some dark prupose.  It is up to the Catholic Warrior Van Helsing to stop him.  Along the way he battles Werewolves and evil female Vampire's (who look more like Harpies) and teams with Kate Bekinsale to stop them.<br /><br />This movie is roller coaster ride of action and adventure much like the mummy movies were.  So if you were a fan of those movies, you will love this one.

B0002MB7QW|4.0|Let me begin this review by saying one thing, The Day After Tomorrow is an excellent movie. I loved it. The special effects were outstanding. It's good fun for a date movie.<br /><br />But,....trying to take this movie seriously is actually hard. The story revolving around global warming and the world being hit hard within a week is a bit too hard to swallow. Too, there's just some things in the movie that I just don't see happening quite the same way if they were to happen in real life. I'm not saying that we shouldn't take the threat of global warming seriously but the way it is presented in this movie is ridiculous. If the writer of the film took more time to research the material on global warming, I think he(and Roland Emmerich) could have made an even better film. As much as I love disaster flicks(having collected the majority of them that has come out in recent memory), I really don't know if I could recommend this one for people to buy.<br /><br />However, if you're hankering for a disaster flick to watch on a Friday night with family and friends eating pizza and popcorn, then- this is a rental that's sure to please.

B00006EXDM|5.0|Best song on the cd, maybe the stones best ever.  Made me a fan!!! <br />
6304118392|5.0|i have  watched this movie repeatedly and love it.the story is that theres these 2 people,mickey and mallorey knox.they were both abused as children very badly and fate brought them together.then they killed malloreys dad and mom,got married and went on a mass murdering rampage.woody harrelson is mickey.his last movie before this one was white men cant jump.he had to put on 80 pounds to play this part so hed look like a hard [case] instead of a chump.juliette lewis is my favorite actress.she plays mallorey knox.i heard that she did a video for melissa ethridge and she had to play like she was having a nervous breakdown.she was so convincing the directors stopped the tape to see if vshe was ok.theres also tommy lee jones as...........youll never guess...........an authority figure!hes the warden at the prison where they end up.theres tom sizemore who director oliver stone called his 5th leg as a hot shot cop gunning for mickey and hot for mallorey.who was the 4th leg?maybe rodney dangerfield who raped mallorey as a child.that we could have done without.oliver stone has his crowning achievment here.hed done the doors,apocalypse now and jfk previously.jfk totaly sucked.apocalypse now was alright.the doors was cool.but this is my favorite movie ever!on tape one theres the movie with like an hour of new footage put back in.some of the scenes include malloreys longer fight in the bar,a reporter getting a hole shot through his hand,a far more brutal riot in the prison,woody raping a hostage,a longer rodney king style beating of mickey,a longer fight between mallorey and tom sizemore in jail,mickey breaking all of a cops fingers at once and the warden being beheaded and made into a trophy.[to name a few].the second tape is full of interviews and scenes that werent cut so much as they didnt fit into the movie.theres a longer talk with the psyciatrist about them,the trial,a longer desert scene,an alternate ending where the bad guys lose,a special guest appearance by dennis leary and a extended mushroom-rattlesnake scene.love and a .45 came out about the same time but its not as good.it is good though.road killers also had the same basic idea.it was ok at best.theres something for almost everybody.theres a woman who kicks butt for the fems,action,violence,romance,poetry,vivid pictures,nudity,sex,humor,cool cars,hot babes,cop killing,artistic parts,showdowns,old sitcom style scenes,western type scenes and all kinds of other cool stuff.the only part that wasnt good was when rodney dangerfield was after his daughters booty.the scene is unforgivable but passes quickly.the idiot gets brutaly murdered a few moments later too.the person who really needs to be brutaly murdered in a movie so seldom ever gets it. [...] i think the marriage part is the best marriage part in motion pictures history.there are 2 people who knew they were in love from the moment they meant like all true love is.shes beautiful.it doesnt matter that theyre just in thier street clothes or that theyre along side the new river gorge.all that matters to them is that theyre there together.the background song is very pretty too.however,its not on the soundtrack.thats crappy.however,it on the cowboy junkies album\\"black eyed man\\" and its called \\"if you were the woman and i was the man\\".its not what it sounds like and is a very romantic song.then they make it official by making a very painful blood oath.oh yeah!right before he proposes he throws all thier old stuff into the gorge and says\\"the past is behind us now.we got the road to hell in front of us.............................................dramatic pause.........................mal,will you marry me\\"...........what a set up line!it was released in 1994.10 years later its stil my favorite movie.the chick in this movie is mallorey.shes abselutely heavenly.she has a pretty smile.she looks even better with her long blonde wig and trashy skirts on.mickeys rape victim is kinda sexy too,but its hard to see because shes all tied upand gagged for a lot of it.tom sizemores character is a real pain in the butt.hes just nasty.he sniffs malloreys panties,wears bikini style underwear when he strangles a hooker and even cuts mallorey very badly to get mickey to surrender.tommy lee jones is a mouthy idiot who needs some down time.theyre both very obnoxious.theres a book out there somewhere that this was adapted from.i forget what its called but its in the credits.the soundtrack has music for everybody with patsy cline,bob dylan,nine inch nails,leonard cohen,rap and even muslim chanting!mallorey knox is in my top 5 favorite characters from a movie of all time.in at 4th.the second if you only count human characters.the entire movie is really intense but if i had to pick out THE abselute most intense part,id say when they cook a cop during the riot.this is easily better than any other woody movie like cheers,white men cant jump and play it to the bone.its better than any juliette lewis movies too.shes really underutilized for as good as she is.all rodney dangerfield movies ive ever seen are substandard.tommy lee jones should thank whoever got him this role because the way hes going itll be the only good one he ever has.all his movies suck.except this one,of course.the special effects are cool.theres a lot of images floating about  and symbolism and stuff.it adds to the chaotic nature.oliver stone hints in the second tape about a possible nbk2,but says nothing definate.and lastly id like tomention that the great quenten tarantino helped out too,so you know this one is guaranteed to be two things.GOOD AND MESSY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B0002DB52M|5.0|I knew nothing about this film when my girlfriend rented it for us to watch.  She heard something - somewhere.  At first I was disappointed by the slowness of the action due to the lack of props or significant background movement.   <br /> <br />     However after about 30 minutes or so I was hooked.  This is definitely a movie that's a lot like reading a book.  You have to start out slow and invest in the characters before you can draw anything from them. <br /> <br />     Throughout the movie I found myself emotionally tied to the characters and their struggles.  The character development was so good that I began to get the feeling that I knew these people and that I could predict their next move.  Quite often I was right.  And that is where this movie shines.  There is no set, there are no props and the story line is fairly simple.  The strength of the film rests on its extraordinary character development. <br /> <br />     Above it being a simply great movie for the aforementioned reasons, Dogville was deeply philosophical.  Many of the conversations - particularly those at the culmination of the film - explore important issues of humanity and morality with a multifaceted approach.   <br /> <br />     It would be impossible to explain the lessons the film teaches without spoiling it so I won't try.  I will only recommend that you go out and rent this movie, get a bottle of wine or a good six-pack, throw on some comfy clothes and settle in.  It may be a long film but don't worry - the bedsores are worth it! <br />
0553579908|5.0|I will assume if your reading this review you have already read the first book. If you aren't and are just making sure the series doesn't tank after the first book don't worry. <br /> <br />Every bit as good as the original (A Song of Fire and Ice novel). It shows the same excellent writing seen in the first novel. New characters are introduced and old fall by the wayside, sometimes in rivers of blood but with Martin these things happen so learn to live with it. There is not much more to say because; if you've read and loved the first book you're getting more of the same that you loved in a series that has the potential of rising to the top next to Tolkein and if you read the first book and hated it and are waiting for a kinder, gentler on his characters Martin: go buy Harry Potter instead. No insult intended to Harry Potter, I like those books.
0375507256|1.0|I hate this book with a passion! <br /> <br />I've forced myself to get to page 100, but I dislike the disjointed six short-story style so much that I don't care if any of the characters / themes ever link together later in the book. <br /> <br />I found the mannered vocabulary and writing style of the first 'hawaiian' theme especially annoying, and have not recovered! <br /> <br />Although an unpopular view, I felt it should be expressed! <br />I have no doubt it will win the booker! <br /> <br />
0553573403|5.0|I first was introduced to Martin's writing when I purchased the book of short stories \\"Legends\\" which had a few of my favorite authors, Goodkind, Jordan, Feist, Card, etc., writing short stories based in the universes they had created. I was so impressed with the story \\"Hedge Knight\\" I ran out and bought this book and was astounded.<br /><br />He has very interesting, very rounded characters. You never can take it for granted that a character is good or evil like you do in other books. His characters are true to life in that they are rarely good or evil but only acting life based on their own observations.<br /><br />His use of politics and house alliances are to me reminescent of Frank Herbert's Dune series. The world itself while a world of magic doesn't hit you over the head repeatedly with magical happenings. The magic is nicely understated, opposite of most Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms books where items and beings of immense and almost unstoppable magic are a dime a dozen. The magic thickens the plot but doesn't move it.<br /><br />The only 'but' I will add is that this is not a happy go lucky book where the good guy is always saved at the last minute and evil always cast down. Be warned, he will strike characters down with ease anytime he chooses. Some people don't like having characters,good or evil, they are interested killed. I like it because he does it well. Character deaths always advance the storyline. I think it brakes the mold and is good, other people hate it, mostly I think because Martin has the skill to make his throw away characters interesting and important, he doesn't skimp on a character just because he plans to kill it nor is he afraid to use the soon to be departed in major important story roles.<br /><br />The world of \\"A song of Fire & Ice\\" is full of sex, death, and violence in all its gory detail. If you don't like that I suggest reading Harry Potter: I'm being serious.
B00005JLK1|3.0|The ocean and her countless waves have always provided excellent fodder for storytellers throughout all time.  There are more tales about ghosts, ghouls, and monsters on ships and under the water than we can ever dream of.  For that reason, \\"Ghost Ship\\" was tested hard to give any originality to it's story.  \\"Ghost Ship\\" does manage to dig up a little originality, but in the end, it's just another ghost flick where one bad apple spoils the whole tree.<br /><br />It is a very slick film to watch.  The opening sequence is morbidly fun to watch.  The acting was hit and miss.  I don't buy Julianna Marguiles as a tough seadog, but she suffices in her role as heroine.  Gabriel Byrne does pretty good considering the stock character he plays.  Isaiah Washington took a weightless character and gave it a little depth.  I actually pulled for his character...a little.  Ron Eldard was okay, and the rest of the cast did a pretty convincing job. The ship was one of the best characters in the whole film.  It's look and feel gave the movie the dark tone it needed to stay above water.<br /><br />The special effects were fun.  Nothing came across too fake.  The ghosts were believable, especially the creepy songstress who Isaiah Washington's character \\"falls\\" in love with.  Overall, not much to complain about in the FX department.<br /><br />The storyline is a little punchy.  There are a couple of things that don't quite add up in the movie.  The ending left me wanting more.  It looks as if a sequel might have been hinted at, but if such a sequel should come along, it will be nothing but more of the same.<br /><br />I didn't go into much detail about the plot, because if you've seen any of the other Dark Castle productions(\\"The House on Haunted Hill,\\" \\"Thirteen Ghosts\\"), you've pretty much seen them all.  Much like the other films, there is a little bit of nudity, a lot of curse words, and pretty good-looking theatrical gore.  In the end, \\"Ghost Ship\\" isn't that scary, but it is a fun film to look over once or twice just for the atmosphere set up by the ship and the little girl who is trying to help our hapless crew.  Moderately recommended.s a fun film to look over once or twice just for the atmosphere set up by the ship and the little girl who is trying to help our hapless crew.  Moderately recommended.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I had a sociology professor ask my class that question on our first day in college.  The class fumbled along, attempting to please him with their answers.  \\"When you're able to repeat it.\\" one said.  \\"When you can use it to understand other concepts,\\" was another response.  I want to address the fundamental controversy behind Fahrenheit 9/11 using this very question I was asked back in college.  The fundamental controversy behind this film, is that it portrays our government as motivated by the potential to make huge profits at the expense of innocent lives.  The innuendo boldly set forth by Michael Moore is that we invaded Iraq to gain strategic control of the Mid-East oil supply. Moore outlines this point very well: he shows Hamid Karzai, a Bush connection from his oil company days being appointed leader of Afghanistan, and shows how shortly thereafter a pipeline began to be built in that country.  These are facts. If you watch the special features to this DVD, (and I hope you did) than you saw the lengthy interview with former Marine Abdul Henderson, who told Michael Moore that their first duty in Iraq was to secure the oil supply, and then go about \\"liberating\\" the country. <br /> <br />Why is it hard for the film's detractors to accept that our government is greedy and disingenuous? We all know we were told this war was to find WMDs, but it only takes a little research to see what the bigger picture is. <br /> <br />So I return to my original point.  How do you know something? How do we as Americans know the government invaded Iraq for control of the second largest oil supply in the world? For some people, they would only know it if President Bush admitted it in a state of the union address. <br /> <br />It's time to be active Americans.  We can't rely on the spin that we get from the White House.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a good first step for a lot of people to wake up to what's going on.  If documentaries are your thing, there's a whole slew of them that deal withthese kinds of issues coming out. Hijacking Catastrophe is one that I will see this week.  If you're angry after seeing Fahrenheit 9/11, (at the content, not the presentation) then I stand with you.  We know what's going on because all the pieces are adding up...
B00005JNEI|5.0|When Moore doesn't grandstand and lets his subjects speak directly, the result is deeply moving.  This film was by far the most nuanced, compelling, and evocative documentary made by Moore, whose work I've followed since the late 1980s.  When Robert Frost wrote about having a lovers' quarrel with his country, he was describing the kind of patriotism demonstrated in this film:  Moore wants America to be the best version of itself it can be.
B000268QB2|4.0|While Radiohead is out on tour and Coldplay is recording their new album, some might be jonesing for a Brit-rock fix.  Luckily, Keane's major-label debut \\"Hopes and Fears\\" will easily satisfy their appetites. <br /> <br />The UK trio (piano, vocals and drums) models its sound after piano-pounding rock forefathers like Coldplay on soaring beams of song (`Somewhere Only We Know') and slow epics (`Bedshaped').  The band also shows other influences on the ambience-infused chillout `Untitled 1' and the 80s pop breeze of `Sunshine.'  The album's songs all have one common denominator: addictive hooks.  With Tom Chaplin's tantalizing tenor the rooftop of a solid melodic foundation, they build by far the catchiest pop-rock album of the year. <br /> <br />While \\"Hopes and Fears\\" is full of earworms, there are still some aspects that make the band lack musical intrigue.  The lack of a guitar leaves a duller edge than their predecessors and while their sound is more straightforward, it is lacks experimental abstraction and is less dynamic as a result.  Nevertheless, Keane leave quite an impressive dent in the pop landscape with an album that leaves more to hope for and less to fear. <br /> <br />
B000006MS3|5.0|This is less polished and comforting than Hounds of Love - where she's a tad more mature and a tad less willing to use abrasiveness as part of her art. <br /> <br />But this is the best Kate record. It's full of energy, word play, imagery, and complex music. <br /> <br />I used to listen to this thing daily on headphones, on a long pleasant bike ride along Lake Ponchartrain, and the nuances and delicacies make it one of my favorite, most appreciated albums. This is one of those albums where you can tell she put a hell of a lot of work into it, and every little bit of it shows.
B000056JYC|5.0|The Deluxe 25th Anniversary Edition of \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" gets my highest rating and recommendation IF you are a devoted Peter Frampton fan or someone who is interested in the history of this remarkable recording. However, if you're merely a casual fan trying to choose the \\"best\\" version of this historic album you may be more satisfied with the original \\"Comes Alive\\".  Here's why...<br /><br />Back in 1976 Peter Frampton's niche market position coupled with the time limitations of the old 12\\" LP forced the original production team to make choices that resulted in a tight, well crafted, energy-filled, labor-of-love. The result was a breakthrough product that captured the attention of the mass market - the rest is history.<br /><br />As a devoted Peter Frampton fan I find the 25th Anniversary repackaged album absolutely intriguing and very, very  enjoyable.  I like how they worked hard to maintain the original play lists/song sequence of the original performances.  I love the new lengthy and enlightening liner notes.  I'm impressed at how faithfully they translated that beloved old album cover to a very cool CD sized format. I am fascinated by the added songs that didn't make the first cut.<br /><br />However I am looking all these things through nearly thirty-years of listening to, loving, and obsessing over the original aren't I? Frankly, if this album were the released in 1976 I'm not sure that I would even be a Peter Frampton fan today due to it's slower pace and addition of some less than top notch songs.<br /><br />So my advice to the reader is this.  First determine if you're \\"devoted\\" or just \\"casual\\" and then, \\"Emptor Caveat\\".  Choose wisely, but whatever you do make sure that you have at least ONE copy of \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" in your music library!
B00006M183|4.0|As Pearl Jam settles into a more low-key career than they had in the grunge heyday, they continue to turn out high quality albums. No big hits off this one but lots of should have beens. This terrific record rocks, one of their best.
B000002X1O|5.0|At the time of its release (1973), this was regarded as yet another solo project from the splintering Jefferson Airplane.Today it stands out as one of Grace and Pauls (and David Freibergs) tightest and well written collection of material from their solo years.You can hear Jefferson Starship (formed in 74) starting to come together with show-stoppers like Grace Slicks \\"Across the Board\\" and Paul Kantners haunting \\"White Boy\\".Be sure to check out the Pointer Sisters backing up Grace on the nearly Gospel sounding \\"Fat\\". An excellent addition to the prolific collection of spooky-beautiful anthems from the Baron and the Chrome Nun.
B00005JMH2|3.0|I had very low expectations with movie, which is probably why I thought it ok.  <br /> <br />The good thing is that Richard Gere and Susan Surandon are excellent in there roles. I'm not a Gere fan, but he was very believable in his role. The supporting characters are good. A bit \\"sitcomy\\" but entertaining. The ending is actually very touching. <br /> <br />The bad news is: Jennifer Lopez. While not the worst actress out there (we'll leave that to Mariah Carey and Madonna), she's not very good. She was very distracting to the film. It's very hard to seperate Jennifer Lopez the \\"actress\\" and Jennifer Lopez the person. I think someone else in this role would have been better.   Lopez fans will eat this up. She dances and wears tight clothes. The whole back story of her character is rather lame, not her fault. <br /> <br />We saw the matinee so we didn't waste that much money on it. It's a decent rental.
B00005JMXX|2.0|This movie is BOOO! AWEFUL!  The basic plot about global warming and catastrophic climate changes is very plausible and then the movie just goes to hell in a hand basket.  Just one preposterous thing after another.  Fuel freezing instantaneouly at 150 degrees below zero, cold fronts with no wind,  walking from Washington to New York in sub zero temperatures, medicine bottles sitting unfrozen on glass shelves in a cabinet on a freighter (rough seas?), evacuating the entire country below the Mason Dixon line to Mexico.  It just goes on and on.  Save your money and take a nap instead.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I've been a casual Nightwish fan for the past 4 years or so and have most of their albums.  I really liked \\"Wishmaster\\", even though the songwriting was somewhat weak and inconsistent.  Still, it had a certain charm to it.  I didn't even know \\"Once\\" was out until I saw a video on Headbangers Ball, so I went out and bought the album.  This one took me by surprise!<br /><br />Nightwish has come a LONG way since \\"Wishmaster\\", and its an improvement over \\"Oceanborn\\".  Tarja's voice is even more amazing, and the songwriting has come leaps and bounds closer to greatness.  The orchestral and choir arrangment are simply stunning, rivaling even the mighty Therion.  On the metal side, the guitars are much heavier, but they do not drown out the vocals or instruments.  Production is top notch.  The fifth track, \\"Creek Mary's Blood\\" is about the plight of Native Americans, and is arguably the most powerful song on the album.  Its a little difficult to pick out the stand-out tracks since every song on this album holds its own weight.  \\"Once\\" is a no-brainer for true music lovers.  The music is beautiful, epic, and thought-provoking without being too cheesy, and that is a first for Nightwish or many other bands in a similar genre.
0780622553|5.0|Personally, I am sufficiently interested in style that should a film have plenty of visual flair, I don't care really care much if it hasn't got a great plot or interesting and/or likable characters.  Of course, it's best to have both, and 'Dark City' does a better job of combining bravura style with compelling plot and characters than almost anything else that I've seen.  This is a truly great flm, and at only 10 bucks you've simply gotta check this out.<br /><br />The film opens with a monologue by Dr.Schreber, which reveals the basic premise: aliens with fabulous telekinetic powers, referred to as the Strangers, have abducted numerous humans, and conduct experiments on them in the dark city, where they mix and match their memories while altering the design of the city in hopes of understanding humanity.  Shortly thereafter, John Murdoch, an experimetee who is revealed to have powers similar to the Strangers', awakes in a hotel bathtub, without any clear memories, and a dead hooker on the floor.  Natrually, the rest of the film involves his flight from both the cops and the Strangers, and his attampts to learn who he is, and the nature of the city he inhabits.  Other than those 2 there are only 3 other main characters- Emma, his supposed wife, Bumsted, the cop assigned to John's case and Mr. Hand, the Stranger who leads the search for Murdoch.  As you may imagine, there isn't all that much actual plot.  For the most part we simply have the main plot fleshed out with more details and specifics.  This may not sound terribly exciting, but they work a lot of good stuff out of this setup, and it allows for a number of revelations which I found quite effective.(though more astute viewers will likely see them coming)  Perhaps most significantly, I find it quite personally involving, and think the major positive characters to be extremely symphathetic.  This is largely because I find the major thematics elements behind the film to be quite important.  At the risk of becoming too philosophical, I feel that the loss of a sense of reality or self is just about the most terrifying notion there is, which makes me naturally symphathetic to these characters, as this loss is precisely what they're dealing with.  Though what it says about humanity isn't necessarily profound (though not much ever is) and perhaps a bit heavy-handed at times,  but it's significant enough to me that I don't mnd much.<br /><br />The acting is generally excellent, and those who may suggest that some of the characters are a bit to cliched are missing the point entirely.(though I will say that I think Kiefer Sutherland's performance as Schreber a bit too affected, but the film is strong in general.)  Also, the casting is absolutely perfect, particularly Connelly, Hurt and O'Brien as Emma, Bumsted and Mr. Hand respectively.  They look exactly the way they should.(and give fine performances, too) While there really isn't all that much too them, I think the bald, pale Strangers make fine villains.  I'm particularly fond of the sadistic Mr. Hand, and the creepy little kid stranger, Mr. Sleep.<br /><br />Visually, 'Dark City' is like little else your likely to see in modern film.  Stylistically, it is what is commonly referred to as 'tech-noir', naturally combining science fiction elements with extreme grittiness, darkness and urban decay of the noir film.  Obviously, it's a very dark film, all black and brown and bronze or faded, sickly green, the indoors bathed in shadow, the outdoors dank and wet, lit by little more than the neon lights.  Visually, the city itself it manages to fall in an area where things don't necessarily look utterly phony, but they don't really look real either.(And this is exactly as it should look)  The shots are beautifully composed, with a strong sense of harmony and balance.  It is very frantically edited, frequently cutting between a few static shots repeatedly, but in a way that isn't annoying, and is decidedly appropriate thematically.<br/><br />The film fails slightly during the climax.  It goes a bit too far over the top, and goes on too long.  Still it's a minor failing.  Fortunately, the denoumont is quite strong. (spoliers ahead)  I have only a slight streak of sentimentality in me, and this is one of the few films that can exploit it.  But what can I say, I want things to turn out well for John, and it's just an absolutely great moment when  the sun finally rises over the city.<br /><br />Well, you just have to see it.  Do so.ically. <br /> <br />The film fails slightly during the climax.  It goes a bit too far over the top, and goes on too long.  Still it's a minor failing.

B00005JNJ7|5.0|Well, I took all three of my kids to see both \\"Team America\\" and \\"Shark's Tale\\".    \\"Team America\\" was the better movie by far!  The kids loved the movie!  Shark's Tale was dull and banal by comparison.    Team America is not getting a great box office so far, probably for the same reason that \\"Office Space\\" missed the mark when it first came out.  People like to see comedy movies with their families, and most people are just going to be really squeamish about taking kids to an \\"R\\" rated comedy, especially one with an openly advertised excess of gratuitous sex, bloodshed, and profanity, albeit with puppets.    Nevertheless, the movie is hilarious.      I came to the realization at the end of this movie that the producers of \\"Team America\\" didn't really bash both liberals and conservatives equally, as many critics' reviews have stated.   In fact, the movie, whether intentionally or not, could almost be a recruiting film for the neo-con philosophy (an earlier review here already picked up on this fact).      Remember, in our wacky two party system, single-issue groups are forced to join either one party or the other, or risk becoming irrelevant.  Just because the Republican Party generally encompasses both neo-cons and Christian conservatives doesn't mean that the two philosophies actually have anything to do with each other.  Stomping all over the sensibilities of one segment of the Republican Party (the Christian conservatives) doesn't mean that the neo-cons are also getting their just deserts.    Yes, in the process of fighting terrorism, Team America accidentally send a rocket exploding into the Eiffel Tower (which then falls over and crushes the Arc d'Triomphe), deliberately blow up the Louvre with another rocket (a terrorist ran in to hide), and later also manage to unintentionally demolish several of the most famous Egyptian landmarks - the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Sphinx, and the Great Temple of Ramses II at Abu Simbel.  All, but who cares, it's just some collateral damage; the good news is that the terrorists are wiped out!    A Michael Moore puppet appears as a suicide bomber working for the terrorists, and blows up Team America's headquarters at Mount Rushmore.  The movie ends in a blood fest, as puppet versions of every one of the major Hollywood liberals who spoke out against the war in Iraq get shot, eaten by cats, burned to a crisp, or cut in half.  All the while, the theme music \\"America,... (...), YEAH!\\" is blaring away.      I suppose you could say that on a higher intellectual level, all of this is just so over the top that it's really a terrific satire of the neo-con philosophy, but it sure is really, really hard to distinguish such high level satire from pure and simple fulfillment of the ultimate in neo-con fantasies.    Another reviewer mentioned that this was a pretty shallow movie.  Actually not, if you look, you can spot numerous takeoffs of various Hollywood movies and other entertainment moments.  There's the Cantina sequence from the first Star Wars movie (\\"A New Hope\\"), the opening Jedi Knight scene from \\"Phantom Menace\\", bits of the huge swordfight from \\"Kill Bill Vol.1\\", the bug crawling out of the Kim Jong Il puppet from \\"MIB\\".  Not to mention an entire song devoted to trashing the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\".  I'm sure there are more that I've missed.  Can you spot them?!!    There's plenty of making fun of gays too!  Gary, the actor puppet sings a song \\"Everybody has AIDS\\" during a Broadway play.  An Alec Baldwin puppet is in charge of F.A.G. (Film Actors' Guild - the real life version is the Screen Actor's Guild) and there is one sequence where he and his liberal Hollywood cohorts are chanting, \\"F.A.G.'s can save the world!\\" (or something like that).  There are those scenes where Spottswood makes Gary give him oral sex before he will let him come back to Team America, and then repeatedly announces this happening every chance he can get.      I won't mention the puppet sex and extended puppet vomitscenes, since they've already been mentioned extensively. Oh, yes, there were two extended treatments of explaining Global Politics and the Meaning of Life (...)   Come to think of it, it turned out to be a pretty dead-on summary of the neo-con philosophy.      Anyway, I don't generally have any problems with talking about issues of profanity and sex with my kids, nor do I have concerns about them being able to keep these issues under control.  I realize that's not true for everybody, so you should think about it before you take them.  I sure thought about it.   The more unfortunate aspect about this movie is that I actually had to explain to the kids afterwards that all this business of Kim Jong Il and nuclear weapons and terrorists wasn't just a joke, it was for real.  But at least now they know.
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard about The Killers when they performed their single, Somebody Told Me, on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  The following day, after listening to the short samples on Amazon, I made an impulse decision to buy the cd, and it was one of the better choices I've made.  All of the tracks on this album blend well from one to the other and all are excellent in a time where there are usually only 2 or 3 worthwhile tracks and the rest are fillers.  The last time I encountered an album of this caliber was a year ago when Josh Groban released his Sophomore album, Closer.  And like Groban, The Killers have created and excellent album. <br /> <br />Granted, their name is a bit misleading as far as their particular genre, but they have alot of talent.  I hope they can avoid the Sophomore Album Curse.
B00067BBQE|5.0|For those of you wondering whether this DVD is worth ordering/pre-ordering, wonder no more -- this DVD is more than worth the hype! Directed by Hamish Hamilton of U2 fame, this DVD is a live recording of Evanescence's most recent concert at The Zenith in Paris, France. If you've never seen Evanescence perform live then you'll be blown away -- they channel an energy and power you have to see to believe. The band performs songs from Fallen such as the hits \\"Going Under\\", \\"My Immortal\\", and \\"Bring Me To Life\\", as well as lesser known tunes and one unbelievalbe cover of \\"Thoughtless\\" by Korn. The DVD will also feature behind-the-scenes video and comes with a CD of the concert, which will also feature the studio recording of \\"Missing\\" (which has not been made available in the US before now) I've been a fan of Evanescence since the beginning, and I have to say how incredibly excited I am for this release.  Evanescence has matured so much since they started, and this DVD captures them at the pinnacle of their success and provides a vivid, breathtaking snapshot of their ever-evolving sound.  Skip a few lattes at Starbucks and get this instead -- you'll be happy you did! :)
B00003CXCT|3.0|I played Star Wars 4 last night on my home theater system.  The audio mix for the Digital EX track was really poor. Why would one put laser fire through the center speaker???  Also, there are points where the variance in sound (from characters speaking to fight scenes) is enormous. To hear the characters, I have to turn up the sound..until a cruiser somes into the scene.   <br /> <br />So when will Lucas and company provide us with a replacement disk??
0743454529|2.0|This is the second book by Picoult that I have read--both because my book discussion group made the choice. Both books grabbed me at the beginning and I liked it and then the ENDING. I know she is popular with many (including my book group) but I am like so many others that think the author takes the reader so far with exiting and grabbing stories and then! OPPS! We need an ending. I know that life isn't fair, but this ending! I loved the lawyer and his dog. I would ask the author to write about him but I wouldn't like the ending! The concept of concieving a child to help another child is current and worth while reading about. So read the book ---but skip the ending.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|The UPSIDE: This movie has got to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my life! Hilarious! I never had such a fun time being politically incorrect as I did watching `Team America'! I laughed until I cried, throughout the film. With one-liners that you'll quote everywhere you go & songs that are so funny...it will make you want to buy the soundtrack twice! You feel stupid walking into the theater to see this movie, but you'll walk out feeling like a patriot.  <br />The DOWNSIDE: There are some jokes that drag on too long, like the puppet sex scene. But you can't expect a movie to be PERFECT...that's just stupid. Many jokes go into great details about 'the birds & the bees'. So don't bring any child into 'Team America', that doesnt know about sex. (Unless you feel like answering a LOT of questions after the movie.) This movie was made for teens, but written for adults. And sometimes vice versa. Before taking anyone under the age of 15 to this movie...remember this: it's R for a reason. <br />SUMMED UP: If you're looking for a good time at the movie theaters...see it! You won't regret it. After seeing it, if you don't think this film is funny at all...then you have no sense of humor! <br />

B0002KVUKW|4.0|Here's the plot short and simple.  Valarious the elder made a vow that either he or his progeny would kill Dracula in exchange for eternal salvation because Valarious is, in this case, Dracula's father. The Valarious Clan has helped protect Eastern Europe from evil and monsters through the centuries. Dracula has managed to kill most of the family off except Princess Anna which means the entire line is in danger of slipping into purgatory. Van Helsing is sent by the Holy Order to A) Keep Anna alive and B) Kill dracula.    Frankenstein's monster is involved because Dracula needs Dr. Frankenstein's Machine to bring his children to life. Turns out when vampires reproduce the children are born dead. The Monster is the key to the machine because he is the only thing powerful enough to provide enough electricity to run the thing.    I'm sure the issues concerning right to life and what is true evil are unintentional because it IS an action movie and a very good one at that.     Friar Carl(same actor who played Faramir in LTR) steals the movie. For me, the best line is when on a stormy night, Warewolf has broken into Anna's home and is consequently scared off by Van Helsing, Carl runs into the room stops and says \\"Why does it smell like wet dog in here?\\"    I am also happy to say that this is the only movie in recent memory that the sidekick gets a little bedroom time and the hero doesn't! Woo hoo go Friar Carl!    Now for the bad parts: It annoyed me to no end that Van Helsing has lost his memory and turns into a Warewolf. Just to ice the cake there's a scene where the warewolf pops his claws and rakes them across stone. It may have worked if the same actor hadn't played Wolverine and Van Helsing. As It is it's a little to cute. That's why it gets four stars instead of five.
B000002I99|3.0|This is probably my least favorite album of his just for the fact that I don't really care for Funk. But man his visuals he has for the Welcome to My Nightmare tour are just amazing and makes the songs come alive, literally. After buying and watching the tour, it made me appreciate this album even more. For those who don't really care for this record, give the concert DVD a try, it will blow you away!

B00003CXCT|3.0|I'm pleased with the clean up of picture quality of this set. The effects are better from the original Special Edition. However, ROTJ would look better if acid was on the film where the Jabba's Palace dance routine takes place. There's this ridiculous song, Animaniacs-styled animation and added actors who are clearly shot in another room. It ruins that film and one of the its best scenes far more than Yoda/Ewoks/GunGuns ever could have. It's the only added scene that blows it all and frankly, Jesus wept. <br /> <br />The extras include one great 2 hour+ documentary (which looks like WWII propaganda for George Lucas as a great dictator) and some dull trailers and ads for game systems and ILM.  <br />On the commentary, Monotone voices repeatedly stress on each disc how things have never been done before, how it's like music, how high off coke Carrie Fisher was at the time, the inspiration and useless information like how sounds were taken from a California freeway. I lose respect when the people behind the curtain want to come out from behind it, for whatever reason.  <br /> <br />The only shot that still needs work is the Jabba's Palace scene. <br /> <br />

SOG 4 LIFE!
B0002TT0NW|4.0|While I am a great fan of the Harry Potter Series, and while I will definitely purchase the 3rd movie on DVD, I was somewhat disappointed with the director's treatment of the story. Some  crucial parts were missing, making it more difficult for those who haven't read the books to follow the story (i.e. the information as to why Professor Lupin knew the Marauder's Map) while other scenes were needlessly extended (i.e. the Werewolf scene). I also wonder why this movie was the shortest of the three, when the 3rd book is longer than the previous two. Also, the mood of the film, while darker than the previous two, was already quite dark. Given that Harry's life becomes even more threatened in the next books, how much darker can you go? I hope that the following HP movies will follow the original story more closely and include important information instead of artificially extending certain scenes to show off computer wizardry. Having said this, I thought that the cast of characters chosen for this film was very good. I particularly liked the director's choice for the roles of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. They were excellent. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, even though it didn't fit my expectations.
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|compared to devils night this is an upset. i think eminem and d12 are goin into that mainstream way which is pissing me off with most rap artist. these days any rapper can make it into the game like no talent rappers like chingy and nelly. this album is ok there are only like 3 good songs on it unlike devils night which all the songs were good. this album is only worth listening to 40oz, how come, and good die young.
B00028HBKM|5.0|A lot of anti-religious hype and media biases could not damper the brilliance of this truly phenomenal cinematic masterpiece. The violence was not as graphic as advertised by the press, however, the violence did have an impact on me. Seeing what the Lord went through for ALL of us, touched me beyond any words that I could possibly type. Even though the film is subtitled in English, I found myself understanding it completely without reading the subtitles. Thank you to Mel Gibson for having the courage to bring this powerful depiction of our Lord to film. I hope and pray that this film touches all of you reading this as much as it has touched me and the millions of people around the world.

0385659806|5.0|When looking for a new book to buy, I try and search out something different.  Books like THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB or the novel THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD---books that have some unusual premise and structure.  So it was only a matter of time before I came to this one.  And talk about your unusual structures!  The book is written through the eyes of an autistic teenager and we're taken into his bizarre world by author Mark Haddon.  This is not a complex book and the chapters are short, but it fits right into my definition of &quot;completely different.&quot;
B00000253N|5.0|First, I have to say that I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan.  I know a lot of people don't like his voice, but if that's keeping you from listening to his music this is the disc you want to buy.  His voice was better than ever on this disc.  The disc is full of love songs he wrote for his wife.  He had a small band on the disc, giving it a nice clean sound.   <br /> <br />Most of the time, when I hear a cd and like it the first time I hear it, I get tired of it over time.  The discs that take a while to grow on me are normally the ones I end up loving for a long time.  This disc is an exception to that rule.  If I had to give up every cd I own except one, this would be the one I'd keep.
0380002930|4.0|I remembered this book from 5th grade reading.  Someone mentioned it to me recently, so I went back and revisited it after over 20 years.  I read it over a 24 hour period. <br /> <br />The story reads like a very long bed time story, very exciting and thrilling.  The most exciting part of the book is the last third in my opinion, but most of the book is fascinating.  In today's age of short attention span, it's hard to feel the tension of rabbit squaring up against a rat, so things need to be put in perspective.  But, the author definitely gets points for the metaphors and symbolism of the various rabbit warrens and what they mean to a human society.  Also, a wonderful good vs. evil showdown in the end. <br /> <br />As a pure story, it is very exciting and worth a read.  From the point of view of a literary masterpiece, I do not think I could go that far.  Other than a handful of characters (which are developed nicely), there isn't much development on the sub characters.  Many of the transitions are abrupt, the dialogue is sometimes redundant, The narrators POV constantly changes from 3rd person Hazel, to Omniscient, to third person Bigwig. <br /> <br />Adam's is a wonderful story teller.  His strengths are concept, orginality, and adventure.  The book is perfect for a 9-16 year old and maybe for some old timers looking to be nostalgic.  Also recommend the movie if you liked the book.
B0000584V3|5.0|This is not only Opeth's best album ever, it is also the greatest album I own! Every song is fantastic, especially \\"The drapery falls\\", \\"Dirge for November\\", \\"The funeral portrait\\" and (a real masterpiece) \\"Blackwater park\\". BUY IT! There is no way you can, or will be disappointed!
B0000VAFNQ|3.0|This movie was really pretty good, but there were a few things about it that I really didnt like. Pretty much, the vampires and the werewolves are having a war that has lasted for centuries. The werewolves have a plot to create a hybrid species between the vampires and werewolves, which will be stronger than both. Although the real plot is more complicated than that, thats it in a nutshell. I really thought the storyline was interesting all the way through, and the acting was pretty good. But the thing that really aggravates me about this movie, are the guns they use. This really had the potential to be a really great action movie, but when the action sequences come and the vampires and werewolves are just shooting eachother, that kind of defeats the purpose of making them vampires and werewolves, they might as well be humans. Overall, Id say this movie is worth a rental for 3.99, but nothing more.

140003180X|4.0|This is the fourth book in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Novel series, featuring the only private detective in Gabarone, Botswana, a woman named Precious Ramotswe. Mma (Mrs. in the local language, Motswana) Ramotswe is a \\"traditionally-built\\" woman with an extra helping of common sense who decided to be a private detective, and bought a textbook which taught her how. She's now hired a secretary, Mma Makutsi, who's also traditionally-built, and somewhat disappointed that she doesn't get high-paying work because, though she scored a 97% score on the graduation test at the secretarial college, she's not glamorous-looking. Mma Ramotswe is engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, who is a reliable chap if a bit dull.<br /><br />In the first two installments of this series, there were several detective plots in each book. Each of the plots involved someone who had a difficulty and hired Mma Ramotswe to deal with it somehow. In the third book, there was less mystery, and more about the characters and their lives. This fourth book involves more mystery than the third, but there's also a good deal about the characters, as Mma Makutsi decides to teach typing in her spare time (hence the title) and dates one of her students, and Mma Ramotswe has to deal with rebelliousness from her foster children. The mysteries that are in the plot are the usual thing: typical human-interest problems that Mma Ramotswe can deal with by giving some sage advice.<br /><br />This whole series, so far, is wonderful. The books aren't lengthy or over-written, and the characters are refreshingly unsophisticated and sincere. The author has a wonderful ability to convey the citizens of a former British colony in terms of their nature and character. They're simple country people, proud and intelligent, with a simple dignity that's at times faintly ridiculous, and they're unconcerned with other people in other lands of whom they know little. It's a wonderful series, and this book fits right in after the first three.this book fits right in after the first three.
B000000IRY|5.0|Although everyone is entitled to their opinions, for me Clapton just doesn't get any better that with what you hear on this album. It is as heart felt as they come. Many Fine ballads such as \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" & We're All The Way\\" & some GREAT rockers like \\"The Core\\" & \\"Cocaine\\".  When I was a teenager and this came out, I intitally bought all the single's from the record, then finally saved up for the album and I wore that sucker out!  Aside from Clapton's well known hit's that most people are familar with, if you truly want to dive into EC, you simply can't find a better record to do it with than Slow Hand. (...) Without question 5 STARS!!
B00003000M|4.0|THIS CD, WHICH IS A COMPILATION OF UPDATED BOB MARLEY CLASSICS WITH GUEST STARS LENDING VERSES OF THEIR OWN, IS AN EFFECTIVE TRIBUTE TO BOB MARLEY. JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE SONGS WERE REDONE WELL. AMONG THE BEST REMAKES ARE ''JOHNNY WAS'' [WHICH FEATURES A GREAT VERSE FROM GURU OF GANG STARR], ''SURVIVAL'' [WHICH FEATURES A VERSE FROM CHUCK D OF PUBLIC ENEMY], ''REBEL MUSIC'' [WHICH FEATURES A STELLAR VERSE FROM KRAYZIE BONE OF BONE THUGS N HARMONY], AND OF COURSE ''RASTAMAN CHANT'' [WHICH FEATURES VERSES FROM BUSTA RHYMES AND SPLIFF STAR]. WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, BOB MARLEY WAS THE GREATEST REGGAE SINGER OF ALL TIME. AND I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IF ANYONE WHO CAME BEFORE OR AFTER HIS TIME COULD TOP HIM. R.I.P. BOB MARLEY
1559409010|3.0|Coming on the heels of the wildly popular and iconic \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" \\"Life of Brian\\" was bound to suffer by comparison. Still, even after compensating for inflated expectations, this film is a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />Purporting to follow the life of Brian Cohen, born in Bethlehem on the same night as a more illustrious son of Judea, \\"Life of Brian\\" lampoons human nature mercilessly. And by putting Brian in situations that parallel the life of Christ, the film gets to comment on the absurdities of pious religious practice, all while keeping a respectful distance from Christ himself. Brian is mistaken for a Messiah by credulous crowds and is literally chased out of town by wannabe disciples. There are some funny moments as the believers immediately split into factions based on which of Brian's belongings -- his shoe or his gourd -- they wish to worship. Unfortunately, many of the gags fall somewhat flat. A scene at the Jerusalem coliseum, in which members of a Jewish resistance groups debate their political agenda, goes on much too long, replacing humor with profanity. It's hard to escape the conclusion that after \\"Holy Grail\\" the Python troupe spent too little time on this film, preferring to rely on absurdist humor that lacked satirical edge. Without incisive insights into human behavior, the jokes tend toward \\"Benny Hill\\" slapstick rather than Pythonesque exquisiteness.<br /><br />That said, there are some moments of near-genius that make the film enjoyable. The Centurion's public school style raking of Brian for misspelling Latin graffiti is hilarious. And depicting Pontius Pilate as an effete lisper was inspired. (\\"Fwoh him to the gwound...and woughwy!\\"). The opening scene, in which distant listeners misunderstand Christ's Sermon on the Mount (\\"Blessed are the cheese makers!\\"), is nearly perfect, and says much about the sorry lot of humanity that Christ came to save. The rest of the film struggles to maintain even a middling standard of hilarity. Sometimes, the jokes completely bomb, such as Terry Gilliam's animated and pointless (Ha! Ha! It has nothing to do with the film!) outer space sequence. Sometimes the movie positively offends, such as the crucifixion sequence in which the victims sing about the meaninglessness of life. If any sentiment is insulting to Christ, it is that one.<br /><br />Still, \\"Life of Brian\\" is worth pulling out from time to time, if just to enjoy the film's occasional moments of brilliance.ometimes, the jokes completely bomb, such as Terry Gilliam's animated and pointless (Ha!

B00005JMUA|3.0|I found this one, went too much into detail.  Finally we get to see Bill, Pai Mai, Elle, and Budd.  But I was so use to her kicking so much tail in the last one, this one had me so hyped for this one, and I couldn't get too much into it.  I found the ending to be kinding wack in a way.  I think the western style setting just wasn't good to me.  But when Black Mamba found her daugher and her fight with Elle was cool.  But anyways, if you wanna rent it, watch it on DEMAND, or wait til STARTZ be my guest.
B000002PCS|5.0|What can be added to what has already been said about THIS music? Mr. Barry has surely out-done himself with this one. Granted the movie didn't do well (a bit of a sleeper), but I can assure you that from the beginning it has haunted me, and still does. The music has hummed thru my bloody head almost constantly. JOHN BARRY --- my hat is off to you.
B00001QEG5|3.0|Success really is a double edged sword. Twisted Sister was putting out some great music on albums like \\"Under the Blade\\", and then when \\"Stay Hungry\\" hit it so big with \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\" the band found themselves in the world of music's Top 10. They tried to capitalize on their success with \\"Come Out And Play\\", an album that was made for FM airplay, lots of pop-metal including a remake of Leader of the Pack. Unfortunately for Twisted Sister, the videos and antics seemed too cartoonish for most of the base demo, the metalheads. So after \\"Come Out and Play\\" fizzled they hit the studio and came out with \\"Love is for Suckers\\", which takes the band to new heights of pop-metal. The songs are pretty good, and the entire album is a paint-by-numbers hair-metal cd, but...it's not really a Twisted Sister album. The opening track \\"Wake up the Sleeping Giant\\" and the closed track \\"Yeah Right\\" are the only two tracks that differentiate themselves and sound like original Twisted Sister tracks, the rest of the album is a good KISS album, and I swear it's almost like Dee Snyder channeled Gene Simmons vocals on some of these tunes. But the album is worth picking up for \\"Sleeping Giant\\" alone. It's almost uncanny how the song parallels the feelings most Americans are dealing with after Sept. 11, 2001. This song was written years before the attacks, yet could still be the anthem for American sentiment in the time that has followed. It's a shame Twisted Sister packed it in after this album, but I guess with the death of the hair metal scene there wasn't much left for them to do.
0393035158|5.0|This book is anything but \\"simplistic and miguided\\" (as quoted from Publishers Weekly).  It is well written, interesting, and thought-provoking.  It challenges everyone to question what they believe, and why.   <br /> <br />If your faith is so fragile that it cannot withstand questioning, then this book isn't for you.  If you want a quick, light read, then it's not for you, either.  However, if you're interested in reading a excellent book that's relevant to our current times, you will quickly become absorbed in \\"The End of Faith.\\"  I certainly did.   <br /> <br />This one will definitely be shared with my husband, parents, sisters and brother--all who are open-minded enough to examine their respective beliefs and myths and honor differing opinions.  I'm sure it'll make for several lively discussions!
B000002LK1|5.0|That's like saying Bach was heavily influenced by german late baroque...c'mon! Depeche Mode had already been there for a decade when this album came out! They ARE techno pop!! <br /> <br />This album is, along Some Great Reward and Music for the Masses, one of my favourite Depeche Mode records. Mind you, there are songs I don't listen to much, but Gahan's vocals alone make this an outstanding album. I give it 5 stars basically for that reason. Just listen to Enjoy the Silence and you'll see.
0385507755|5.0|I have never read a book that moved me as much as this one.  I think I was crying by page 5 and didn't stop much in between.  The author makes you understand the world that an addict lives in.  He puts you in his world and you can't get out nor do you want to. And he achieves this not through long, dull, narrative description but through succinct, powerful words and images that give readers the five senses that James is experiencing.  The writing style is so unique and so refreshing.  I loved this book so much that I immediately bought it for several people. Most highly recommended!
B00005JNJ7|5.0|If you are a fan of \\"South Park\\" you shouldn't even be reading this review, you should be watching this movie as we speak. This is the funniest movie of the year. There were multiple times throughout the course of this movie where I missed some stretches of dialogue because I was on the floor weeping (because of the laughter mind you, not deep seeded emotional problems). This is the most spot on action satire I have ever seen. There are also very catchy songs in this movie as well. I should tell you that this is not a movie you bring the whole family to, but once again if you watch \\"South Park\\" you should know that. If you are a fan of puppet swearing, violence, and sex then run to the local cineplex and enjoy. If you are very uptight and love America......... I don't know watch the presidential debates or something.
B00005JMH2|5.0|People who have given poor reviews to \\"Shall We Dance?\\" seem not to have gotten the point of the film:  \\"Shall We Dance?\\" is primarily a romantic fantasy and on that level it works like a dream.  Do not come to the film expecting a serious true-to-life docudrama of the dance world; that notion should be dropped immediately. Never mind the supposedly illogical premise that Richard Gere's bored, dissatisfied businessman cannot tell his wife and his daughter that he is taking ballroom dancing lessons.  In this macho world of ours it is considered an absolute no-no for men to take dance lessons.  Stanley Tucci's hillarious turn as Gere's co-worker, a lover of Latin dancing, also takes lessons on the sly, and proves that real men do the tango.  Jennifer Lopez is fine (and you can quote me) as the sad, wistful dance instructor who inspires Gere to take lessons in the first place.  The supporting characters are funny and loveable, including the ascebic, charmingly obnoxious waitress who is Gere's partner in the dance competition.  I could not help but connect with the secret yearnings of each and every one of them.  Anita Gillette as the slightly dipsomaniacal owner of Miss Mitzi's Dance School is the heart and soul of the film as she is at the school.  The dance numbers at the competition are great and the clips of Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse from \\"The Band Wagon\\" dancing up a storm are a beautiful homage to what \\"Shall We Dance?\\" is all about.  So forget the negativity of the critics and come and enjoy \\"Shall We Dance?\\"
B000006TRV|5.0|I am constantly telling people who have grown up in the \\"post-rock era\\" or who have never been Pink Floyd fans because they were scared away by subliminal messages and drug references like I still am turned off by them, that this is by far the best album ever made in the rock era.  I am a huge Beatles fan but I would still tell anyone to this day that this album is so head and shoulders over Seargent Pepper that it's pitiful and that to me Seargent Pepper may have been \\"The Wall\\" of it's time but in my opinion only paved the way for the concept, artistry, and awesome studio production and musicianship of this masterpiece called \\"The Wall\\" (oh, and by the way I always thought Magical Mystery Tour was always a better album than Seargent Pepper anyway).  I actually started off hating Pink Floyd as I was growing up because my older brother kept hitting me over the head with constant, constant playings of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" coming out of his room, and coupled with the fact that Pink Floyd released probably the most lame song on the album \\"Money\\" as it's main single which has always been played ad nauseum for 30 years on classic rock stations didn't help either.  The sound of that album even did begin to grow on me as I got older but it wasn't until high school when a fellow student and huge fan of Pink Floyd would hijack the huge high school choir room's awesome high fidelity stereo system and blast \\"The Wall\\"  throughout the halls of the music department that I really began to like that album.  I wasn't wild about it at first but I would see the (future Minnesota State Senator)'s enthusiasm while he cranked up the wall, especially on the part which goes \\"when we grew up and went to school, there were certain teachers who..... with it's great bass guitar and helicopter sound effects that I began to like the album, and it wasn't until after I graduated and looked back to the \\"Floyd\\" lunch hours as some of the \\"happiest days of our lives\\" that I began to really see how awesome that album really was and enjoyed all of the classic rock airplay of the hits on that album over the years, many until later I didn't even realize were all on \\"The Wall\\".  Because of this album I became a major Gilmour-guitar fan and was lucky enough to see the Floyd in concert before they went dormant, and I even developed an appreciation for Roger Waters' musical concept of the world and although he doesn't have the greatest voice and that a lot of people hate his \\"concept\\"  I think some people's voices and perspectives absolutely fit the unique kind of music that they do perfectly.  I've only found 2 other albums that have the same effect on me musically as \\"The Wall\\" because they have the same type of somewhat dark, etherial, conceptual, and sophisticated studio production and feel as The Wall, and that is \\"Hounds of Love\\" by Kate Bush and \\"So\\" by Peter Gabriel and parts of \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" by Alan Parsons Project,  if you haven't heard these albums and are a big \\"Wall\\" fan it would be definitely worth a listen to you.  And finally I want to give props to a Floyd man who I think was so instrumental in making the wall and some other Floyd albums so awesome is Michael Kamen who died this past year.  If you don't know who he is just listen to Gilmour's great guitar solos over the violin/orchestral parts of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and you'll hear the orchestral arranging genious of Michael Kamen.
B000001ESJ|5.0|A Farewell To Kings is to me Rush's most mature and enduring work.  It remains as emotionally powerful today as it was back when I was a stoned teenager listening to Cygnus X-1 late at night in my headphones.  Its a masterpiece, no filler, all killer.  Simply said this album contains some of Rushs' finest performances both musically and lyrically.  Xanadu is perhaps the best song they've ever done.  Combine that with Farewell to Kings, Closer to the Heart, the beautiful ballad Madrigal, the excellent acoustic guitar driven Cinderella Man and the science fiction epic Cygnus X-1 and you've got yourself an amazing album. It rocks, its emotional, its complex, its moving.  The synths which came to dominate the sound after Moving Pictures are used to good effect here, i.e. they're not overdone.  AFTK is still essentially a guitar album filled with great electric and acoustic playing not to mention the virtuoso level bass and drums.  70 stars.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|I find myself amused when I see these teenagers, not even born when this film was originally released, sporting these Tony Montana T-shirts.  Usually these kids are a little gawky and not a little overweight.  My first thought is \\"please don't look at that dude the wrong way or he might menace me with his gat.\\"  To all the young gangstas, real or wannabe, who take this film seriously I say this  film is one large surreal joke.  This collaboration between director Brian DePalma, screenwriter Oliver Stone, and actor Al Pacino is a beautiful ballet of blood, bullets,blow, and bad language (bad acting?).  Given Pacino's track record for being over-the-top when the situation called for it, I would say he was in on the joke.  Given the earnestness that Stone approaches some of his worst work, I'm not sure he was.  That said, this film is flat-out entertaining.  Whether Pacino is spouting out a geiser of obscenity, blowing away his adversaries, incestuously protecting his sister(Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio), or ingesting massive quantities of the white powder he's a hoot.  I also liked Michelle Pfeiffer as his space cadet coke-addled trophy wife.  It should also be noted that this \\"serious\\" exploration of the Cuban underworld does not contain hardly any actors of Latino descent(Robert Loggia? F. Murray Abraham? Cubans?).  In a nutshell, this film is a classic of overindulgence and should not be taken that seriously.
0393035158|4.0|This book compares rational thought based on empirical evidence to irrational beliefs grounded in ignorance ,superstition , and fear.The author states his case in clear, concise language with even a dash of humour here and there . He makes a compelling case [in my view] that our religious traditions are \\"intellectually defunct and politically ruinous ...\\" and suggests that either \\"The days of our religious identities are clearly numbered....\\"or the days of our civilization soon will be . Strong stuff , but well documented  and supported by irrefutable evidence . <br /> <br />I found this book to be engrossing, informative and provocative and recommend it to any reader who enjoys reading authors who challenge the so-called conventional wisdom . <br />
B000244EMO|4.0|Adam Waldron's review is completely wrong.  He's got to be referring to one of the previous releases of Predator, because this baby is full (its a 2-disc) of great extras.  The movie is most certainly fun, and when i watch it, i don't even realize how long it is.  Its so much of a ride that you don't ever get tired.<br /><br />The disc is not a new transfer, but it is a new compression of the same film.  Which, as far as most people have reported is a plus (though, admittedly not as much as a brand new transfer would have been).  Anyway.  I think people should get this for the complete package, and not get too down on the fact that the picture and sound aren't brand new (though they aren't complete rehashes either.)<br /><br />Great extras that you just have to watch, there's plenty of good feelings from the crew and cast, and you really respect the work that went in to creating the Predator. Also has a lively commentary track.<br /><br />One of the things I continually enjoy about the movie is that it starts out with this very direct guerilla war action adventure.  Then the fact that they now must battle a superior alien being changes the momentum of the film and the characters have to deal with the completely unexpected.  An original way about telling what could have been a dull story.
B0002VC924|5.0|PLEASE SEE THIS FILM BEFORE THE US ELECTION.  I have seen it and it is a very good and well documented documentary.  You will learn of the very close relationships between George W. Bush and the Ben Laden family with the oil.  You will also learn the reel reasons why US troops are in Irak and Afghanistan.  You will probably see the US politic from a very different point of view.
B000000OF6|5.0|Although it would be impossible to tie this band down to a simple two discs of their \\"greatest\\" material, the Queen - Greatest Hits, Volumes 1 & 2 packages in all of their familiar, and chart successful singles, throughout their illustrious two decade reign. <br /> <br />It all makes for an effective introduction to the band, and after hearing the sheer diversity and quality of their hits, it goes without saying, that looking into their vast catalogue of albums is a must immediately afterwards.
B00000I14Z|5.0|If you want to buy a jazz album this is one of the best places to start. Mingus is one of the truly great composers of the 20th century - and this album demonstrates the spectrum of his personality as composer, band-leader, master bass player. The recording is remastered beautifully - you are able to hear all the textures like never before.<br /><br />This is not my favorite Mingus album (I am a die-hard fan of 'Blues and Roots') but it is a classic and it is indespensible. It is my wish that Mingus will start to get more attention - I think people are exposed more to Miles Davis (who was good) and Mingus and Monk get the short-end of the stick. But can any other jazz artist meet his talents at composing - maybe Ellington or Monk - but that is about it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I, along with so many others, have waited and waited for Lucas to finally release these movies on DVD.  I was going to wait until Christmas to get it, but I decided I just couldn't wait anymore.  So now that I own it and have had it for a few days, I'm here to tell all of you to buy these DVDs.  Now. <br /> <br />Let's start with the most basic - how are the movies themselves?  I doubt anybody really needs me to tell them that all three of these are fantastic movies (although \\"Return of the Jedi\\" could have been better).  The stories, characters, music, sound effects, and visual effects (for their time) are simply fantastic.  There are very few reasons to not like these movies, they should appeal to just about everybody. <br /> <br />So what about the fact that these are the special editions, and not the original movies?  Well, I'll be completely honest - I've never seen the original versions.  I wasn't introduced to Star Wars until the special editions were re-releasted in the theaters, so I can't compare these with the originals.  I have noticed a few scenes in the movies where things just don't look quite right, where something looks too \\"digital\\" or looks like it's too complicated for late-70s or early-80s visual effects.  And while these things are noticeable at times, in my opinion they don't take anything away from the enjoyment of watching these movies. <br /> <br />The special features are nice.  The documentary about Star Wars, \\"Empire of Dreams,\\" is one of the most impressive things I've seen on a bonus materials disc - it's two and a half hours long!  There are a few other documentaries that I haven't gotten a chance to watch yet, along with a nice preview of episode III (but if you're looking for something with a lot of scenes from the upcoming movie, you'll be disappointed), some bonus material about Star Wars video games, trailers and TV spots, and still photos. <br /> <br />The sound and picture are spectacular, much better than I expected and just as good as I hoped.  This is getting long and you're probably getting bored of reading this, so I'll stop now.  In short, this is a must-have for anybody with a remote interest in Star Wars.  Or for that matter, for anybody with a remote interest in good movies.
0140177396|3.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a story of friendship and survival against the odds. Most things that could go wrong do go wrong.   <br />This book is set in the 1930's, during the Great Depression, a few miles south of Soledad. Lennie and George are in search of work. They are fired from a previous job because of Lennie. He is much stronger than he thinks he is. To himself he seems harmless, but to other people, he seems to be monster. <br />When you read the book, it's almost like you're there with the characters. The setting and physical traits of the characters are described so vividly that you can see where they are and the people they're with. \\"A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too, for it had slipped twinkling over the yellow sands on the sunlight before reaching the narrow pool.\\" It's almost like a little play in your own head. You can see George and Lennie walking down the path onto the bank of the river, or in the barn with the puppies. <br />The most important characters in the book are Lennie and George by far. Without them there wouldn't be a story. Lennie is the one who gets them in trouble. You feel bad for Lennie at times. He gets confused and forgets things, and George gives him a scornful look, or yells at him. Lennie can't help it, and that's when you start to feel bad for him. Some other characters in the book are Curley, the Boss's son who's offended by tall people, Old Candy, the old sweeper with no hand who just wants to live in peace, Slim, the slim-line jerker who is very understanding and Curley's wife, who is very sleazy and desperate. Lennie and George's dream is to own a house on a farm and have rabbits and animals, but they need enough money to get the house. The theme of this book is this; the tale of two lonely men in search of their own home. <br />This book made me feel very uncomfortable. Many of the topics discussed, for example, killing a lame dog, or killing unwanted puppies, made me feel very depressed. None of the events in this book were positive. They were all about killing of people or animals, or getting into fights. Maybe I am too young for a book with such deep meaning, because I do not understand why people are so infatuated with it. It was very saddening, and I do not think I would enjoy reading it again.  <br />Overall, I rate Of Mice and Men a C+. If you like shocking endings, you'll like the ending of Of Mice and Men. Do they get the house? Do they live happily ever after? Does something go horribly wrong that smashes their dreams? I guess you'll have to find that out for yourself.

B00005JN0T|4.0|After suffering through Will Smith's sleepwalk performance in MIB II, I was pleased by the energy level he brings to this fast paced fun movie.  Smith lives in a world where robots are commonplace, serving humans (reminicent of the 4th Planet of the Apes movie) as nannies, butlers, and general servants.  He is called to solve the murder of a scientist, who was his friend.  The only possible suspect seems to be a robot.  The only problem is that robots are subject to Isaac Asimov's 3 laws, meaning that it is impossible for a robot to harm a human. <br /> <br />As things progress we also learn that Smith, a robot hater, is part robot himself, with some bionic parts.  As things progress we find out that there maybe the three laws are not absolute and there may be some ways around it. <br /> <br />There are some fast paced tense scenes and there are some enjoyable supporting characters such as Smith's mother and the lady robot scientist that Smith seems to like.
0671027387|3.0|If I were affiliated with Delta Force in any way, I'd sue Dan Brown, and I'd win. He depicts this elite special forces unit as psychopathic killers, and boldly claims they \\"answer to no one.\\" Unfortunately, the document he cites as proof of their immunity from prosecution doesn't even mention Delta Force, or even special forces.<br /><br />Aside from this hole, there are plenty of others. The plot is imaginative, but Brown seems to have no sense of responsibility to the truth as a writer.<br /><br />It's a good story. It would be better if Brown cared about things like facts and credibility.
B00005JMUA|2.0|people say this is supposed to be much more emotional but I find that the plot is actually much weaker than in the first one.I liked Bill as a character but something was inconsistent about him, it wasn' t the \\"Bill\\" in the first movie.Also, I think the buried alive scene is not credible.There are too many scenes which waste time. I hated Kill Bill 1 because of its lack of depth and sadistic violence but believe it or not, the best part is the gory fight between Elle and the Bride. <br />And where is Tarantino's \\"dialogue\\"? Really, not much interesting dialogue at all. <br />Overall, maybe worth it if you adored Kill Bill 1 but absolutely pointless otherwise.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Greetings,  (...) For all the death, destruction, and anger in the world today, it's easy to get caught up in a propaganda film like Fahrenheit 9/11 and place blame on the current president.     Moore's anti-Bush / anti-American film is flawed in many aspects. I recommend watching the other propaganda film FahrenHYPE 9/11. In this film, they interview the soldiers and families that were used in Moore's movie. It is interesting to hear them talk about how most of the footage was used without authorization and edited to fit Moore's anti-message. Needless to say that they were angry that their words were edited into something that was never intended to be heard the way it was portrayed.    Anyway, watch both films, and if you are at all intelligent, make your own mind up, don't rely on the Moore's of America to give creditable information. There is a lot out there that is easy to review. As bad is Bush is to some, look into Kerrys past and tell me he is a sure thing for a better replacement. I find it sad that we have these two to choose from. :(
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am not sure that Star Wars is the best movie trilogy ever, but it definitely ranks in the top 5.  This box set is an excellent presentation of three movies with a bonus DVD that is actually worth watching (in other words, it is not just for hard core SW fans).  The quality of the DVDs I bought is perfect (to be expected).  However, I was surprised at how much the individual movies were cleaned up.  I saw the original releases in the theatres when I was a kid.  I then saw the updated versions when I was in my 20s.  Now I have seen these new versions and the differences from the originals are dramatic.  Some reviewers have critisized this release because the DVDs do not contain the original, theatrical versions of the films.  I do not find this a problem.  How many of us already own the original theatrical versions on VHS or Laser Disc.  Adding the original versions onto this DVD series would have only increased the costs to the consumer.  At only $41.99 a set I find this to be very reasonable.   <br /> <br />As mentioned above, the difference between the updated versions of the movies and these new versions are not so dramatic, but the difference between the theatrical and the new releases is astounding.  All three films have been cleaned and reformated for THX sound and modern special effects.  The explosions are more crisp, the colors more vibrant and the space background more polished.  Very impressive and much appreciated. <br /> <br />Unlike a lot of \\"special\\" DVD releases, this DVD series contains bonus material which actually adds to the whole and is worth any extra costs we are paying for the set.  I had seen many of the vinnetes regarding the making of Star Wars at different times from different programs.  To see it all together in documentary format was incredible. <br /> <br />This series is a true tribute to the fans and welcome departure from the typical \\"rake the consumer for every penny\\" mentallity which seems prevelant in the industry today.
0793563836|4.0|I looked through several books before I chose this one.  I chose this book because it was similar to the book I was given when I started learning the flute many years ago.  The book teaches with short song exercises and focuses on learning notes instead of TAB.  several reviews below say the opposite but I think they are referring to an earlier edition because the current Hal leonard electric bass method does not introduce tabulature almost the end of part 1 of the 3 part set, forcing you to learn the notes. Even after the introduction of tabs the book only includes them for part of the songs.  For me, I think this book was the best choice as a beginner's bass method but I would not recommend this book to someone who is not already familiar with musical theory or prefers to learn by TAB.  This is because the book does not spend much time explaining notation and, as I mentioned, does not use tabs all the time.  This book probably would work best in combination with private lessons for students not familiar with theory.  This book really heaps on the accidentals within the first half of book one which is very frustrating to true beginners (and even some of us that aren't).      I also recommend you get a supplementary book with songs that you actually enjoy playing.  The songs in this method are original creations of the author and it gets tedious playing a bunch of melodies you don't know or care for.

B0001Z52RU|2.0|This is a bold movie but it doesn't really work.  The fundamental problem with \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" is that it takes the usually lighthearted time-shifting / alternate lives premise and asks it to carry the weight of a dramatic thriller involving mental illness, paedophilia, dead kids, amputations, the sexual vagaries of prison life, and an incinerated puppy.  The premise never allows you to take any of these things quite seriously, which is why it's much better suited to comedy - films like the Bill & Ted movies, \\"Groundhog Day\\", \\"Back To The Future\\", or even \\"Bedazzled\\".  This variation might have worked with more imaginative scripting, a spookier look, and some classier direction - something akin to \\"Vanilla Sky\\" or \\"Donnie Darko\\" - but this was clearly aimed at the mall crowd, and probably nothing could've overcome the impediment of casting the possibly bankable but irrepressibly comedic Ashton Kutcher in the lead.  It's momentarily redeemed by a bravely downbeat Director's Cut ending, which I'd be stunned to hear didn't poll better at the test screenings than the conventional, sappy theatrical alternatives included on the DVD.  If only what came before it had been more engaging, more moving and more logically consistent (how can Evan remember everything that happened in the alternate lifetimes, when by the theory of the movie, once he changes something, it didn't happen?), then we'd be able to interpret Evan's fatal decision unambiguously as a redemptive sacrifice: \\"I'll gladly give my life for the happiness of the girl I love.\\"  But given the relentless chaos with which the lives surrounding Evan's have proceeded DESPITE everything he's done, and the unrelieved cheesy perfection of their lives after he removes himself from the equation, his decision betrays a curious strain of solipsistic nihilism: \\"I am the centre of the universe, and yet it all would have been better had I never been born.\\"  Yeah, whatever.  I can guarantee you one thing, though: your life will be no worse for not having seen this movie.will be no worse for not having seen this movie.
0767821769|5.0|This was an excellent movie, perhaps a tad unrealistic, yet amazing and give The \\" DIVORCED \\" some hope. <br /> <br />Now, on to the viewers, that want to attack this movie and the actress' is so very sad, even if one doesn't like an actress; .... WELL...... Get over it, don't watch their movies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />Honestly, to attack a movie and the acting (which was amazing) is so sad and pathetic. People with your harsh words, you should THINK Before you save your reviews. Readers may not know who you are, yet in you lonely and bitter reviews, you can see just how jaded you must truly be. It's sad, and ugly. <br /> <br />This is an amazing movie and extremely touching. People get divorced and they do die. Reality, coping and life. Great movie, even better acting. A must See!
078322611X|5.0|Ray Kinsella hears a voice telling him to build something.  He makes a leap of faith, supported by his wife, and builds a baseball field.  Lo and behold, none other than Joe Jackson appears and brings some of the other tarnished 1919 \\"black sox\\" with him.  Eight in all, to be exact.  Ray continues on his trip, following the mysterious voice, trying to figure out what to do.  He may lose everything, yet he still continues. <br /> <br />Kevin Costner was at his finest in this movie, and the supporting cast is nothing short of astonishing.  It is one of the most moving sports stories ever told and one of the most moving father/son movies ever told.
B0000028MA|3.0|The person below me said that the only downside to this record are the Paul Westerburg songs. <br />I just wanted to put in my two cents. <br />I actually think that they are the ONLY reason to own this. <br />They are great,  <br />whereas the other songs are pretty much 90s grunge crap.
B00005JLSE|3.0|CHICAGO won the best picture oscar a couple of years ago, and at the time, I had not seen it, but being a fan of movie musicals over the years, I was happy for its success.  Also, one can't fault a movie with a cast like this one.  However, after finally seeing it, I am disappointed.  Several reasons:  the show has no real showstopping, hummable songs---even ALL THAT JAZZ doesn't carry the movie like DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE, OH WHAT  BEAUTIFUL MORNING and HELLO DOLLY.  The deleted \\"Class\\" is an awful, foul-mouthed attempt at humor, but it certainly showcased the vocal abilities of Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah.  Also, the leading ladies were murderesses:  how could one want either of them to be successful?  Latifah, though Oscar nominated, is playing the same shtick she does in any of her movies, and in my opinion, didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.  The revelations, of course, were Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly's vocal deliveries.  Gere truly took a chance as a singing, dancing Billy Flynn, but he is marvelous and he DID deserve an Oscar nod.  Reilly too is revealing in his CELLOPHANE MAN number; he has a richly nuanced voice and it's one of the best numbers in the film.  Zeta-Jones also had much more pizzazz and energy than Zellwegger.  I've read where the transfer to film brought Roxie's character to the front, and minimized Velma's.  Who knows how great it would have been if Velma and Zeta-Jones had more screen time.  I do think Catherine deserved her Oscar, though.  This beautiful actress is talented and has shown diversity in her many roles.  Zellwegger always seems to be playing the same Nurse Betty and Cold Mountain characters in all of her films.<br /><br />CHICAGO is big, blustery and well conceived, but it's just not fun nor moving, and if a movie musical is neither of those, then why add music at all?
B00004STPT|5.0|This is by far Hans Zimmer's masterpiece. I loved this soundtrack. The music is fantastic. There have only been a handful of soundtracks that are better than this one.
0385508417|5.0|I picked up this book after hearing that it's going to be made into a movie but had no idea what to expect.  The only other Grisham book I have read is \\"Bleachers,\\" so I was anticipating a drama-filled story....<br /><br />Instead I was plesantly surprised to find a light-hearted tale with a great message about love, family, friends, neighbors, traditions and surprises.  I laughed out loud several times and could personally relate to several of the characters.  This is a great book to read now with the holiday season moving quickly upon us.  I can imagine myself reading it again in the middle of the summer when I'm looking to beat the heat and have a good laugh.<br /><br />If you are in search of a quick read that will make your inner holiday spirit chuckle then I recommend this one!
6305744793|5.0|this movie roxx my soxx! its so funny!! anjelica huston and raul julia make a stunning pair as gomez and morticia. its so funny seeing the to totally in love, they can barely keep their hands off each other. wednesday and pugsley have balls torturing each other, which is half the fun. this movie will have you laughing your pants off.  <br />personally, i think wednesday stole the show. the fight scene in the play had me laughing for eternity. the blood kept gooshing out and spraying the front row...lol.  <br />mind you, this movie was originally based for the original cartoons mde by charles addams, which is why the movie's a bit darker. but, they still kept some elements from the 1960s tv show. the french, the passion, and cousin itt. but, fester becomes gomez's brother (he was originally morticia's uncle). although it can never rekindle the flame between carolyn jones and jown astin, i still loved the movie. in a different sense, its still funny. u gotta see this!!
0440224764|3.0|What do you do when you have a hero who is as antiheroic as you can get?  Patrick Lanergan has stolen ninety million dollars, possibly burned someone else up in a car that was supposed to be his fiery death; hidden away for four years; and used a lovely lawyer to help him achieve his ends?<br /><br />Of course as the novel unwinds (and Grisham keeps your interest in spite of this quandary), we find that perhaps Patrick's motives are a lot more noble than one could imagine.  Grisham populates his book with some interesting and likeable people (Sandy for instance) and some that aren't fleshed out enough to feel anything about (unfortunately this includes Eva, whose actions at the book's close are rather devastating and one couldn't see it coming).<br /><br />Patrick's brilliance in his scheme is to be admired, as is Grisham for concocting the whole thing.  But it's soulless hero and it's rather unfair ending keep it from being a book it should have been.
B00005JNJ7|2.0|Team America is missable, not that funny and more than a little homophobic. \\"But we make fun of everybody, like Janeane Garofalo!\\" the filmmakers use as their defense. Yeah, but it's still homophobic. And not in a good way. Or a funny way. Or even in an outrageous way - it's just tired. Funniest bits are the songs and when they play up the limitations of using marionettes. The average South Park episode is a lot funnier. <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|The buzz around this film when it hit the big screen was awesome special effects. That was not enough for me to head to the theatre. I waited and rented the DVD instead. I really didn't see any reviews before I watched it, so I did not know what to expect.<br /><br />Well, the special effects did not disappoint, but they were not enough to carry this movie into the blockbuster area and my DVD collection. In this technology age, there are plenty of movies with special effects accessibility. But budgets can cut into the writer's script research. Special effects should enhance the believability of a movie script.  It should not try to carry a movie.  The movie must have at least a good plot. The Day After Tomorrow disappointed me in this must do area. Can we believe that global warming will dive us into the ice age within a week? (Days) Is an instant freeze within a hurricane like storm that rotates and then dissipates into nothing possible? Would this only affect North America?  This movie does nothing to answer any scientific questions. There are so many loopholes in this movie it could become a trivia question on How not to write a movie script. Can you count them?<br /><br />This movie's budget is all special effects.  If you want to see Los Angeles/Hollywood sign destroyed on purpose by tornadoes and New York in a hell freeze rent this DVD. I think there is a hidden message behind those chosen cities. Does Roland Emmerich hate the Hollywood scene? Or that New Yorkers are cold! Maybe.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Ok, are you telling me that this is the same guy who directed \\"The Mummy\\"? How can that be? \\"The Mummy\\" was actually enjoyable, unlike it's Transylanian counterpart. Apart from it's weak storyline, poor direction and mediocre effects Van Helsing also manages to be downright boring! This movie made me feel like a kid...and not in a good way! The directors adolescent attempts to frighten me with mythic monsters was ungrounded; he should have just let me read the script! Woefully bad characterizations of Hollywood horror standards left me feeling drained and baying at the moon. There was no bolt of lightning that could have broken the spell of boredom woven by this forgettable flick. If you decide to get this movie I want you to think less frightening and more fromage, less action and more assinine.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|I must tell you that as a trek fan I am very dedicated and unfortunately, VERY CHEAP!!! When season one came out I not only pawned my previous season one collection (first 14 DVD's of the 40 DVD set) I also took the time to do some \\"spring cleaning\\".  Long story short I pawned enough money to the point that I purchased SEASON 1 for less than 20 dollars (I pawned almost 100 dollars worth of my own useless junk to do this).     Now that season 2 is going to be released guess what? I did some more spring cleaning along with my season 2 dvd \\"singles\\" and now I have more than 105 dollars to purchase season 2!!!!!  It wasn't the singles of trek alone that made this possible but it did give me pause for thought as to what else I could get rid of. So if you're worried about the price take a lesson from me as well as Mr. Spock---\\"There are always possibilities\\"    Have fun on november 2nd when this second season is released!!
B0001AP12G|2.0|Yeah Kanye, take credit for what all the underground and old-school Hiphop artists have been expressing in their music all these years. So people look at Kanye and say Oh My Gosh, here's a rapper who actually has faith and doesn't talk about cars and jewelry! There have been so many artists that have done this over the last 20 years and are dedicated to it, and now Kanye comes in the media spotlight and flaunts that attitude for exposure. <br />Many non-rap listeners look at him as the only good apple out of the bunch. Well, if they took the time to dig to the bottom of the bushel(underground), they would find much better ones. Plus, Kanye's core is not so enticing. Yeah, \\"Jesus Walks\\" talks about Jesus, but you can tell that he did it just for attention and to make money, he actually talks about the fact that mentioning Jesus may not be profitable and radio-friendly, but he knew this song would cause controversy and get millions to look his way. This song ain't that good, De La Soul's \\"Church\\" is much better, because they offer real-life advise and don't explicitly worry whether it makes them money or not. Real artists just go ahead and make whetever music they feel in their hearts, not sit there and question if is profitable or not. <br />I give two stars just because he somehow hypnotized good artists like Talib Kweli, Mos Def, and Common to join him on this album, although I nearly lost respect for those three for participating in this swindle. Yes, Kanye may offer more than Nelly and Lil' Jon (which says nothing), but y'all need to realize that this is just an exceptional mainstream rap release, not an exceptional album in the whole spectrum of Hiphop. Stop giving credit where it's not due! <br />And can you believe he glorifies the fact that he doesn't dress up like the party thug rappers. And I bet the media just went Awwwww! Yes, he just placed his image ahead of the music, while real Hiphop artists have always dressed normally and never flaunt that for media adoration. Kanye is laughing right now because of how he tricked millions to buy his album. They let their lyrics and music do the talking, not the image. Kanye knows there are so many more that deserve the props and money that he made off this. Please stop making music Kanye, you've made enough money and manipulated more than enough haven't you?
B00005JMXX|2.0|After scores of glowing reviews from Mr & Mrs Everyday Moviewatcher I decided, against my better judgement, to watch the movie. I figured, \\"What could possibly go wrong with Dennis Quaid, Ian Holme and Jake Gyllenhal as stars in this picture?\\" What started out as a great white hope ended up as a snow white mess! The dialogue had me wishing I hadn't bought the supersize popcorn and soda. The movie had no convincing drama and the characterization was tired and worn. I was hoping for the next big special fx sequence to freeze everyone to death just to end the movie. This lame horse of digital wizadry was not thoughtful or provocative. In fact, it left me as cold and blank as.....New York in an ice age.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It's obvious that there were hundreds of thousands of people eagerly awaiting to see if Green Day could meet their fans expectations.  Not only did they meet expectations, but probably exceeded many, and shut up several negative critics. <br /> <br />In this album you will see a true musical growth in Green Day that showcases the true talent they possess in songwriting.  Of course, many people think back to \\"Dookie\\" and will always consider that to be the pinnacle, but, although this album is much different from other Green Day, it stays true to their usual attitude and sincerity, only with a new flavor in musical composition. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, and Homecoming are certainly some of the popout tracks on this album.  On the airwaves you've probably heard American Idiot the single, but to be honest, there are several tracks on here that far exceed that song. <br /> <br />A couple songs on here aren't particularly interesting, but I don't think any of them aren't worth listening to.  We Are The Waiting and St. Jimmi are perhaps my least favorite, but I still don't mind listening to all the songs on the album. <br /> <br />If you are expecting an album with a progressive punkish flow, I should tell you that it probably won't be what you expect.  Most of the song flows are varying and thematic, with changing rhythms and evolving melodies.  A couple of the longer songs are almost like changing seasons in music form. <br /> <br />If you are willing accept a new Green Day sound, by all means pick this album up as soon as possible.  I think every band has the right to experiment with new sounds, and Green Day has shown us why experimentation can be worthwhile.
0060516402|5.0|Howdy All, <br /> <br />An excellent book, highly recommended to all those in business (or starting a business) who really want to make a difference (not just make a quick buck). <br /> <br />Now here's my question: <br /> <br />I remember reading a section in the book where it explained how a hotel or motel CEO would get all new hires into his office on their first day and explain to them how they should see each day at work as a challenge to them.   <br /> <br />I'd like to find that section again to reread (and quote it) but no matter how much I browse the book I can't seem to find it.  I believe it was in the second half (or even more towards the end) of the book. <br /> <br />I've tried on-line searching (of the book) but that's not been successful (since I don't believe the whole thing is indexed. If anyone's starting out reading the book, or has just read it, or knows it like the back of their hand, perhaps you can help? <br /> <br />Any pointers (page number, chapters() would be most appreciated. <br /> <br />Please email mrhatken@mac.com <br /> <br />Thanks in advance, <br />Ashley Aitken.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I first heard Franz on the raido this summer: great energy and wonderful dance floor aesthetic. Recently however, I went to their concert. Awsome. It made me go out and get this disc but I also realized that there is something a little too homogeneous and dark about the production. That is to say, if there's potential to capture some of the feeling they create in a live show then I can't wait for the second album.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This release of the Star wars trilogy has been wanted for along time. It is never going to please the die hard fanboys who want the orginal release, however in my opinion it is a brilliant boxset worth anyones money and shows Mr. Lucas's films as close to what he wanted than ever before. Superb quality and restoration of what are over 20 year old films and a brilliant bonus disc have kept me and my family entertained in september and will be a long term oart of our DVD collection
B00004Z459|5.0|3 and a half years ago, I popped into a Sanity music store and bought this album. I had just started listening to music, and \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was the first album I had ever bought.  <br /> <br />Now, in 2004, after trying out hundreds upon hundreds of artists of almost all genres, \\"Hybrid THeory\\" remains the most played album in my stereo.  <br /> <br />WHy? Because Linkin Park was once unique. Their mixture of pop, rock, metal, hip-hop, and techno really revolutionised mainstream music, bringing together the commendable qualities from all realms of music. Each song is clear in delivering a message, whilst maintaining a heavy, melodic, depressing/psychedelic, and emotional tone.  <br /> <br />Truly, in my opinion, one of the greatest albums of all time. If you consider Linkin Park \\"nu-metal\\", then the only competitors in that arena would be Papa Roach and Staind.
0345404475|5.0|\\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" raises questions <br />about religion and man's fear of the future. The religion <br />of Mercer draws many paralles with most relegions today.  <br />From the androids oppostion to a philiosphy they cannot  <br />understand and their attempts to destroy it, to the bounty <br />hunters who protect it despite themselves, the book raises <br />questions about our faith and what is more important, the  <br />man or the message.
B00028HBKM|2.0|This is an interested piece of work--definitely made with a lot of dedication and, well, passion for its subject. But people should be aware that Mel Gibson has based his vision on 19th century understandings about the life of Christ. After a hundred years of Jesus scholarship, we actually know more now about the circumstances of his life, including the politics, the religious background, etc., than we've ever known before. But Gibson ignores it all to present his own idiosyncratic conception (again, no pun intended). This is NOT the way it was. If it provokes viewers to learn more about the subject, that's the best we can say for the film.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This IS the best movie I've seen in years. It is the kind of movie that after you watch you realize how much most mainstream movies are concieved with no heart. This movie really hits you.  <br />I've never been a fan of Jim Carrey but he makes you forget that he was once the Fire Marshall.... give this movie a chance it deserves it.
B00005JMXX|1.0|As usual, someone needed a vehicle for some special effects.  Hence this silly pieace of nonsense.  We are asked to believe that certain weather conditions cause instant havoc on the planet.  Twisters, snow, rain, floods, and yes, let's not forget the instant ice age.<br /><br />In the film, a news crew flying in a helicopter reports on the twisters that are popping up all over town.  Mind you, there flying amidst the twisters instead of wathing them from a safe distance away.  Not even storm chasers would do something so looney.<br /><br />Dennis Qaid gives the finest performance a piece of driftwood can give.  Emotionless and expressionless is what I would call him here.  He's got all the excitement of a hangnail.  Of course he's the smartest man on the planet but the President of the United States doesn't listen to him.<br /><br />This is your usual, my dad never spends time with me, I'm a teenager feeling sorry for myself, I'm so misunderstood, I don't have any friends, oh no my kid's in trouble I've got to rescue him because I can do what no other man in the world can do becasue I'm so brave story, (yawn).<br /><br />Of course at the end we get the \\"we better take care of the planet or else\\" speech.  Borrrrring!<br /><br />If it's sleep you want go get some sleep aids.  This thing isn't even good at putting you to sleep because it's just so darn annoying.  Run, do not walk, away from this movie.<br /><br />GOOD GRIEF!!!
B00023B1LC|4.0|I was expecting an Extended Edition of the movie. All I got was an alternate ending & beginning. That's it - nothing else in between. Fortunately, great special features made up for the \\"lack\\".<br /><br />Overall, a plus in anybody's DVD collection!
0140177396|3.0|The book is about two guys, George and Lennie, traveling through California to get a job on a farm. Their plan is only prevented by Lennie's mentally retardation, which runs them into a lot of trouble. <br /> <br />This book differs from other books, read in class, not only by the colloquial English, but also by the story in itself. <br />Most of all I like the way Lennie is described in the book although there are certain passages in which the description becomes untrustworthy. Some of his statements don't fit to his behavior and the other way around. In my view the ending is not chosen very well. There must be other, better possibilities for them, except .... ! <br /> <br />All in all it is an interesting and entertaining book, which gives you the opportunity, among the entertainment, to gain more information about the social circumstances during the time of the depression in the United States.  <br /> <br />
B00008973A|5.0|A Chorus Line is my favorite musical.  The opening dance sequence and Suprise numbers were full of energy and passion.  All of the songs were catchy and I think the film acurately portrayed the struggle and desperation of dancers/dreamers trying to make it on Broadway. <br /> <br />I agree that many of the flashback scenes with Cassie were distracting, but overall, I enjoyed every moment of this film. <br /> <br />Rest in peace Gregg Burge!   <br /> <br />

B0006213WG|4.0|It was surprising to see the supposedly immature Sum 41 venture off to Congo to help with economy, and things like it. More surprising is the fact the trip inspired new material for their latest album, Chuck. Named after Chuck Pelletier, the U.N. representative that helped the band and many other people escape the hotel they were trapped in. Leading them through gunfire and eventually to safety, Sum 41 were ever grateful, and therefore made this album in his honor. If Mr. Pelletier is still in Congo, I doubt he even knows this. <br /> <br />All that aside, this album, musically, is a step up. Lyrically, it's more of the same. You'll find Deryck repeating the word delusions in at least four songs. But what do you expect from these guys lyrically, anyway? However, the diversity in musical styles on this album is much more evident here than it was on any of their previous releases. There are traces of ballad on the preceding release, Does This Look Infected?, but only on one song. On this, you can find ballad on the single, We're All To Blame, at the end of 88, Some Say, Pieces, and Slipping Away, which is an acoustic number. Definitely more incorporated this time. Another definitely noticeable feature is the nu-metal feel in a few of the songs. Take a good listen to I'm Not The One or There's No Solution. On a blind listening test, without vocals, you would think it's Linkin Park right away. The happy-go-lucky pop punk has been completely eliminated. The closest they'll get to some upbeat stuff is obviously Slipping, but Some Say, also. <br /> <br />Greig Nori was at the producer's board for this one again. His band, Treble Charger, looks like they injected a bit of influence into this one. Compare their \\"Don't Believe It All\\" and Sum's \\"Some Say.\\" There's a pretty good comparison. However, with the pop-punk gone, you will still find songs reminiscent of the DTLI days. Angels With Dirty Faces and Welcome To Hell are good examples of this. Another band that HEAVILY influenced one particular song on this disc is Metallica. Listen to to The Bitter End. If that doesn't sound like Metallica to you, I don't know what does. <br /> <br />Their choice for single, \\"We're All To Blame,\\" was a little off, I'd say. It's probably appropriate, but I still think the loud, catchy \\"No Reason\\" would have done better. We'll see if they release that. <br /> <br />Sum 41 have matured, and it's a good thing. The guitar solo in The Bitter End is something you'll listen to over and over and over again. <br /> <br />On the other hand, Good Charlotte still suck. Don't even go near that album. Ugh.
B00L8QOZK6|3.0|Again, Universal release this film virtually in BLACK AND WHITE! The cover clearly says color but they give us a blu-ray transfer with most of the color drained out! Disgusting! It's also a shame as the transfer is quite a good, clear HD one & if we had the lovely color which the film was made in and released originally on VHS in we would have the ultimate blu-ray! And this happened because the director had to go and mess up his own film! I've just asked for a refund.

B0000640SA|5.0|I really enjoy this movie, every time I watch it. This movie is very thought-provoking and it is presented in such a cool and original way. The directors did a great job in modeling the sequence of the movie (backwards) after his memory problem. It is one of those movies you can't really figure out until it's over and then you can sit with your friends and put all the pieces together for a few minutes, which I've done every time I show it to one of my friends.  <br /> <br />I am surprised that not many people have even heard of this movie. I remember when my cousin asked me if I'd seen it and I had no clue. Then I finally watched it and I was very impressed. I think I watched it again the next day. Then two days later...I'm trying to do my part to get this great movie known, because just about everyone I ask has never seen it.  <br /> <br />These days there are so few options for plots that it makes making a good movie difficult. (Ideas are just getting ridiculous). But they were on to something when they conceived this one. I just loved how after the first scene he shoots the dude and immediately you think, \\"well he must be the bad guy\\", and you think that for the whole movie...but...is he?  <br /> <br />If you like movies that are hard to predict and keep you thinking right up to the end, here's your movie. So take my word for it, check it out, enjoy it, and tell your friends about it.
B00005JNEU|4.0|I live in Minnesota, where high school hockey is the state religion and the right of passage for seniors is to go to the State Tournament, even if there school does not make it that far.  Parents (not just fathers) send their sons to live in other school districts so they can get more playing time or play with a better team.  Everyone who has seen \\"Hoosiers\\" know that in Indiana it is high school basketball that is the subject of such devotion, but if you needed to see \\"Friday Night Lights\\" to know that neither of those state religions holds a candle to high school football in Texas, then you are just not a true sports fan.  Even before H.G. Bissinger's Pulitzer Prize winning book, \\"Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team and a Dream,\\" I knew the people of West Texas took their high school football seriously (I lived in New Mexico when I went to high school, so it would have been hard not to notice).<br /><br />Director Peter Berg's film version of \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is based on the true story of the Odessa-Permian Panthers and their 1988 season.  What \\"true\\" means in this case is that the name of the coach and the key players are accurate, as are the number of losses the Panthers had that year (although the scores are different, as is one of the opponents).  Overall, the film avoids going Hollywood until the final game, which does manage to be true to the spirit of the film even if it requires a stupid play call to help things along (I am sorry, but if it is 4th down and half the length of a football to go, and your offensive line outweighs the defense by at least 50 pounds a person, you call a quarterback sneak and get a least a yard more than you need just by firing off the ball; at least, that is what my father has always told me and since he played college football for an undefeated team, Trinity in Connecticut, I tend to listen to him).<br /><br />This film affirms, for the upteenth time, that the main thing wrong with sports involving kids are the adults, either in the form of the parents, or the concerned citizens whose support of coach is based primarily on the score of the last game.  The prototypical parent in this story is Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), who has his state championship ring and makes it clear that his son, Don (Garrett Hedlund), will be a failure if he does not do the same.  Unfortunately, Don has a tendency to fumble, so Charles has no problem going down onto the field during practice to set the boy straight.  Is Don playing football for his dad or despite his dad?  There is no easy answer to that question, because life, family, and football are all wrapped up together in Odessa, Texas.  The town might be mired in an economic depression, but that does not stop them from having a football stadium bigger than what some colleges and universities enjoy.<br /><br />Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is supposed to go undefeated and win the state championship.  Perham has done this four times before, in 1965, 1976, 1980, and 1984.  Apparently they have a four year crop rotation program going and everybody in town can do the math to figure out 1988 is going to be the year.  When the Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) the star running back gets hurt the coach gets the blame even though it is clear, like in a classic Greek tragedy, that the Fates are punishing the sin of hubris.  Boobie is all ready to spend his money for playing in the NFL and he has not even picked a college yet.  Basking in his stardom, Boobie gladly admits to reporters that he gets straight A's because he is an athlete and as he leaves defenders in the wake of his sweet moves you can understand why he is the most important play for Permian.  But the goddess of mischief hides the helmet of his backup Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young), and everybody knows that when you are running the score up and keep your superstar in the game, somebody is going to go gunning for him.<br /><br />There are several key factors that make \\"Friday Night Lights\\" work.  The first is Thornton's performance, which is yet another reminder that he is one of the finest film actors around today.  His Coach Gaines goes between moments of screaming at his players in the grand tradition of football coaches going back to Knute Rockne and beyond and measured silences as he endures another rabid fan excoriating him on talk radio or the \\"For Sale\\" signs that have sprung up in his front yard after a loss.  But there are also moments when the speaks from the heart, whether it is to his quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) in the squalid home the kid shares with his mentally disturbed mother (Connie Cooper), or the final halftime speech to his team.  What distinguishes Gaines from every other man in the story is that he knows that in the end, football is just a game.  He just has to be careful about who he shares this particular bit of wisdom with during the season.<br /><br />Berg makes a brilliant decision to shoot this story as if it were a documentary.  This works well in the extended game sequences, but suits the rest of the film as well, which is important because the most important moments in \\"Friday Night Lights\\" come at other times.  Some of the best scenes take place away from the lighted field as Boobie and his uncle (Grover Coulson) deal with the disappearance of the dream during a visit to a doctor, when the garbage truck makes it rounds, and when the kid cleans out his locker.  This leads to the third key factor, which is that we care about the kids that the story focuses on, including the silent \\"Preacher\\" (Lee Jackson) and the kid who is going to Harvard to become a lawyer, Brain Chavez (Jay Hernandez).  We do not care about the fans or the families or the rest of the town, just the kids, and their performances match those of Thornton in providing a realism that we just do not get in most of the films in the sports genre.<br /><br />I really liked this movie until the end, where the action and the emotions smack too much of Hollywood, not to mention David versus Goliath, than what had been established up to that point.  Still, in the end Berg focuses exactly where he should, on the kids who have finished their high school football careers and the coach who has to immediately start planning for next year, when Odessa-Permian would again undertake the sacred quest for perfection.Lights\\" work.

B00025ETIW|5.0|I picked up this CD this summer and I must say that it gets better every time I listen to it. There are few cds that I can say will never get old and this is deffinitely one of them. There are many CDs that you have to be in the mood for to listen to them but \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" will put you in the mood the second you put it in. I say, \\"three cheers for My Chemical Romance\\". It is really too bad that this band is going to be getting huge in the near future, that always puts a damper on the bond you have with their music. It's never the same when 12 year old girls are walking down the street singing \\"Hallelujah, lock and load,\\" (Thank You For The Venom, track 9). But if it must happen, it must. There's not a song on this album you could say something bad about. It is truly a masterful job.     Here are the three songs that stand out to be my favorites  1. You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison (#4) - I try to listen to this song at least once a day, just to get me by. This is my favorite one to listen to while driving and just scream out the lyrics as loud as I can.  2. Thank you For The Venom (#9) - I love the guitar in this song, and the lead up to it in track 8 is simply perfect. \\"Sister, I'm not much a poet but a criminal, and you never had a chance\\"=great song.  3. Cemetary drive (#12) - I can't say how much I enjoy this one. I love the contrast between the verses and the chorus, and the drums at the beginning are a great start. Also, the lyrics are grand. Probably my favorite on the CD.    Those are just three of my favorites but I could say something about every song. I like to keep things short and to the point though.     Also, I was fortunate enough to see My Chemical Romance open for Face to Face on their farewell tour. They put on an amazing show my friends. So much energy, you can't leave with your voice after seeing them. One of the best live shows I've seen. Very very very fun. So see them if you get the chance.    This band has some real talent. They have some very original music on a lot of their songs and his voice can do some incredible things. There is nothing I can say bad about this CD or band. So check it out, it is great stuff. And please, let's stop judging bands by the videos we see on MTV, this band had a lot going on way before that stuff ever started.     \\"Love it, or leave it, you can't understand...\\"
B000002HRE|4.0|This cd gets slated all the time, i can understand why, and i wouldn't recommend any early metallica fan to buy it. Metallica were stadium rock cheese, although awesome songwriters the content was only ever going to appeal to...how can i put this? Halfwits including me ha ha! Look at reload from the point of view of being a debut album from an unknown band, everyone would be raving about them! I certainly was it has some kind of coolness to it, like getting in your car on a hot summers day and putting your shades on type thing! Fuel really does make you drive faster and harder!. Jaymz voice sounds more accomplished and matured, while the group as a whole are as tight as ever. If you drive a lot in the heat buy it ha ha!
B00014K5TQ|3.0|I love Seth Green's performance, he was great. Compared to the Shockumentary, Culkin's interpretation of Alig was horrible and did no just to the actual Party Monster, Also The guy who played Angel was really good, glad to see him since \\"My So Called Life\\".I would only recommend watching this only if you really wanted to compare to the real stuff.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Three years ago, Rammstein set forth on a voyage.  Until then, they had been my one love, faithful and true, and they were missed.  Eventually I came to miss them too much, and sought comfort in other German bands, Megaherz and the like.  I feel shamed, dirtied, to have betrayed these musical geniuses with my infidelities.  When their ship returned with the long-awaited \\"Reise, Reise\\" not only were my musical indiscretions forgiven, but they proved their love to me all over again with a triumphant album that literally sounds like nothing I have ever heard before.      The progressive sound of Mutter is here, but taken to an entirely new level.  With the exception of the heavier \\"Mein Teil\\" it's hard to believe that this is the same Till Lindemann that simply growled out lyrics on Herzeleid.  Till's voice has become both powerful and beautiful in a way you won't believe.  The lyrical imagery is dark, but no longer in a way that evokes the idea of some personal grudge against Heaven itself.  The album stands in heavy contrast to itself, alternating beauty and tension.  Not one of these songs is less than amazing.  I simply can't describe the experience of \\"Reise, Reise\\" adequately, but I would be deprived without it.    Reise, Reise: 5/5  Beautiful.  Till's voice is amazing.  My favorite song on the album.    Mein Teil: 5/5  Clever but twisted lyrics, extremely heavy music.  Most like their previous work.    Dalai Lama: 4/5  After reading the lyrics on the internet, I expected this song to be a real disappointment.  It wasn't.  A very well executed take-off on Goethe's poem \\"Erlkoenig,\\" this song has a personality greater than the sum of its parts.  The lyrics are enhanced by the music, and the music couldn't stand without the lyrics.  A captivating result.    Keine Lust: 4/5  Who would've thought debilitating depression would rock so hard?  An interesting contrast between the fatalistic lyrics and driving beat on this song.    Los: 4/5  I think of this as the photographic negative of \\"Ich Will\\".  This song seems to describe the various negative and disbelieving reactions to Rammstein the media and some people have had over the years.  There's a strange feel to this song, too, almost a blues riff.    Amerika: 5/5  Rather than risk a flame war, let me just say that this is one of my favorite songs on the album.    Moskau: 5/5  Till is joined by a woman singing in Russian, for one of those songs that really gets your blood moving.  This is allegedly Flake's current favorite.    Morgenstern: 5/5  Another fine example of Till's new vocal prowess.  Combining a heavenly choir with a positively military beat, herein is the familiar idea of monstrous deformity.  I think of this song as a thematic reprise of \\"Schwarzes Glas\\".    Stein um Stein: 5/5  Rather like the lyrics of this song, Till carries innocent little melodies into dark places where they shouldn't be and can't escape.  Prior to editing this review, \\"Stein um Stein\\" was at the bottom of my list for this album, though still well liked.  With repeated listening, the delightfully perverse lyrics have really grown on me and taken a spot among my all-time favorites.    Ohne Dich: 5/5  The clearest example of Till's beautiful voice.  Beautiful melody.  Beautiful lyrics.  I can't find a single flaw in this song.  Not one.    Amour: 4/5  Even more extremely clever lyrics.  Ever felt torn apart by love?  I sure have, and the metaphor of love as an aggressive wild animal makes perfect sense to me.  And oh, look, Till can still hit those low notes that you feel down in your boots!    If you have any interest at all in Rammstein, you must, absolutely must, buy this NOW.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This film illustrates how so-called rational people can make such incredibly irrational and dangerous decisions, by examining the thought processes of America's leaders responsible for the Vietnam War.    <br />It is amazing to me how much of this film is relevant to our current actions in Iraq.  One would think that America would have learned some valuable lessons in Vietnam; yet here we are 30 years later caught in another overseas quagmire in a third world country thousands of miles away. <br />I would encourage anyone to see Fog of War, especially those too young to have experienced the Vietnam War era.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I loved the movie. My mother and I went to see it on the first day it was out. Then about two weeks later, we went to see another movie. When we got there, My mother chose to see The Day After Tomorrow. I saw that Van Helsing was still playing so I went and saw it for the second time. Today is Monday th 18th. The movie comes out tomorrow and I am going to go and get it!
B00005JNJ7|4.0|I watched TEAM AMERICA more out of curiousity than anything else.  I had heard that the movie made fun of everything from the war on terror to the Hollywood establishment. I had also heard about a puppet sex scene (which almost garnered the film a NC-17 rating) and that the film was full of foul language. I must say I was kind of surprised about how funny the movie actually is.<br /><br />TEAM AMERICA is about a group of five warriors from different parts of the country joined together to fight the War on Terror. The movie opens in Paris, France as we see much of the carefree happiness that the city has to offer.  A young French boy skipping along while eating a chocolate popsicle bumps into a Middle Eastern-looking man carrying a briefcase with flashing lights. The man stares him down and the child runs to his mother and tells her what he sees. They turn to leave and moments later Team America bursts onto the scene.  Team America succeeds in killing the terrorists and capturing the WMDs, but they also knock down the Eiffel Tower and have one of their own killed.<br /><br />Team America learns from I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E. (the group's super-duper computer) that terrorists are plotting a major world-wide attack 1,000 times the size of 9/11.  Their mentor, Spottswoode, knows they don't have a chance unless they can get an actor to join their team (that's right, an actor). So, he sets forth and finds the best actor in the world, Gary Johnston.  He brings Gary to the Team's hideout in Mt. Rushmore and tells him what's at stake. Gary joins the team, but upon learning after a successful mission that his involvement with the team possibly caused other people to be killed, Gary quits the Team and hits rock bottom (literally, after passing out in his own vomit).  With Gary's departure, the Team is left without an actor and they don't have a chance.  Michael Moore and all the members of F.A.G. (Film Actors' Guild) unknowingly assist the leader of the massive terrorist takeover, Kim Jong Il, as he prepares for world domination.  Only Gary Johnston can save the day, but only if he proves to Spottswoode that he is dedicated to the team.<br /><br />I was suprised at how humorous TEAM AMERICA is.  I was a little offended by all the foul language and felt it was overdone, but like the unnecessary sex scene that might have been the whole point. TEAM AMERICA has two major targets in the movie:  the war on terror and the Hollywood establishment.  The humorous jabs at the War on Terror are evident from the movie's opening scene in Paris and don't let up until the very end of the film.  As the only superpower in the world and the leader of democracy, we have a duty to \\"police\\" the world persay. However, no matter who we help (because we can't help everybody) somebody else is going to hate us because we didn't help them or because we helped their enemy.  Sometimes we overstep our duty and are careless. This is parodied in the movie and in a hilarious way.<br /><br />The second biggest target in the movie is the Hollywood establishment.  Hollywood is a powerful place and having been the center of the dream factory for almost a century, it's no wonder that many of the people who become stars think they are the kings and queens of the world.  As Bruce Campbell wrote about in CHINS THAT KILL, Hollywood is a land filled with spores. The spores cause people to not think logically and normally.  Even the most innocent and well-guarded can fall victim to the spores.  The spores destroy all that is good, right, and true. Anyway, it's amazing that people who dropped out of high school and just because they make a few movies, think they have the right to \\"rule\\" the world.  This mentality is parodied to perfection in TEAM AMERICA.  Alec Baldwin (who recently chastised his younger brother Stephen for becoming a Christian and Republican) is perhaps made fun of the most as the leader of F.A.G., but Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Michael Moore, Liv Tyler, Matt Damon, and a handful of others are also parodied.  All of the actors who actually make it into the film are people that have made political statements over the past several years, but really aren't that knowledgeable about anything.  Like the unnecessary foul language and sex scene, much of what Hollywood does is useless and pointless.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn't a movie for kids. It isn't a political movie either, making fun of two extremes on both sides. However, it is interesting that there are more conservatives who seem to enjoy the film than liberals. If you're looking for something that's crude, but hilarious and is a little different, TEAM AMERICA is for you.att Damon, and a handful of others are also parodied.

B00005JMXX|4.0|Although the message of the film is unrealistic as it is based on the fictitious global warming hype which is a weird theory by a number of scientists and greenpeace fanatics to get government grants and so forth, the special effects in this flick are very well done. The plot is the age-old, but usually always interesting father saves son story. And the dad (Dennis Quaid) who is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, does a great job in making this film more interesting despite a soso script. But the humanistic message in this movie is good and encouraging. This flick makes for a nice popcorn crunching evening at the fireplace with warm blankets all around. And once you see this movie you probably won't look forward to the winter anymore. But as mentioned before, the special effects are great as these show us unrealistic scenarios in this well-done disaster flick and it's fun to stimulate our imagination once in a while.
0684852756|3.0|Ok i am a woman! And the reason im giving this 0 stars for concept is NOT cause i got scared or because i got upset of the REALITY of this book. <br />I thought the book was VERY well written and the character was very nicely drown out and very real and as i was reading this book i was SURE that most men would identify themselves with it. <br /> <br />The thing that irritated me the most is that the writter was trying to make me feel bad about this 'struggle' of a man that isnt sattisfied anymore with HIS decision to get married to a woman he NOW realises he's maybe never been inlove with at the first place! And decides to leave 'like a COMPLETE coward' without telling his wife or kids (which is the LEAST he can possibly do, if he's going to leave he should leave like a man, have some BA**S and face the music). This is a man who cant face the concequences of his action (to get married AND have kids and decides to leave them all) and then, cant face the conceqences of his action to leave (and leaves without telling anyone). <br /> <br />What? Dont women ever find themselves in this situation? Especually women who most men say are never sattisfied with sex alone (while this guy at some point catches himself thinking that if she has sex with him at that specific time, he wont leave). If a woman was in this situation would that be worth writting a book about? Probably not because a woman would probably take the kids with her and not ababdon them as well.  <br /> <br />I liked reading this book but after it was over i just felt i just waisted my time reading about the most selfish and egocentric 'little' man who wants everything and cares about nobody but himself. His 'struggle' to leave? Boo- hoo! He does what he wants at the end right? Whether he's happy or not it was his decision to get married and his decision to leave, so he always does what he wants. At least he gets to leave with the concequences his OWN decisions. His wife and kids are just left to deal with somebody elses decision.
B000063DIR|1.0|Whoop-la... I think Amazon.com mistitled this remaster. NOW THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SCANDAL (or shame).
B00005JNJ7|4.0|I got some advance tickets to see this film and I threw them away.  I thought it looked really dumb and decided not to see it.  A friend of mine (through a lot of convincing) got me to see the film and I'm glad I did.  Crude humor, politically incorrect and puppet sex----what more could you ask for!  The film is send up of all those patriotic action films with tired formulas and horrible dialogue.  But the writers also skewer pretty much everyone else---actors, dictators and more.  If you are looking for a lot of laughs from a very guilty pleasure, this film is for you!  Not for everyone but recommended!!!

There are eleven tracks on the album: \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", \\"With or Without You\\", \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", \\"Running To Stand Still\\", \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\", \\"In God's Country\\", \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\", \\"One Tree Hill\\", \\"Exit\\", and \\"Mothers of the Disappeared.\\"  The album is powerful, uplifting, and beautiful. Bono's amazing voice has a passion and soul that comes to life in every song as he cries of powerful themes concerning religion, love, and politics. In addition The Edge's legendary guitar sound and Adam's pulsing bass lines add to the album's incredible sound. The album begins with the song \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" where Bono sings, \\"I want to feel sunlight on my face, I feel the dust cloud disappear without a trace, I want to take shelter from the poisoned rain, where the streets have no name\\". These words are an influential and powerful way to begin an album, setting the tone for the rest of the musical journey. One of my personal favorite songs on the album, a song of self-reflection and discovery, is \\"I Still Haven't Found What I am Looking For\\". It is amazing when a song can speak to you in a different way every time you listen to it and still always relate to your life in some manner. Many of the songs on The Joshua Tree are able to do that because they are so substantial. Bono talks of being \\"one with the night\\" and \\"speaking to eternal angels\\" but yet he \\"still hasn't found what he is looking for.\\" The poetry of U2's lyrics is unsettling. <br />                It is difficult to compare The Joshua Tree to any records of today's times because it is in a whole other field. Each song on The Joshua Tree has a history and meaning. For example, the song \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" is about the political relationship between America and Central America. Also, \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" refers to 1970's Chile when it was ruled by Pinochet, who killed thousands of innocent people in Santiago's National Stadium, a soccer stadium in Chile. The Joshua Tree is a far cry from today's music which consists of violence, swearing, and an image to sell records. Any person can find meaning in the music.  <br />
B00005JMXX|2.0|For me, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\", a doomsday epic about the sudden onset of a new Ice Age in the present day, is a disappointment from writer/director Roland Emmerich. His 1994 sci-fi epic, \\"Stargate\\" is one of my favorite flicks in that genre. His 1996 effort, \\"Independence Day\\" is immensely entertaining.  <br /> <br />The special effects in \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" rival [and sometimes outdo] Emmerich's previous efforts. The problems are in the story. \\"Stargate\\" and \\"Independence Day\\" were both about mankind's doing battle with alien beings. Since the vast majority of us have never met an alien being, the logic of stories of such encounters is acceptable. What proof do we have to the contrary? The adversary in \\"Tomorrow\\" is Mother Nature, a force we are all familiar with. Suddenly, she has decided to unleash her full fury on us. Unlike alien invasions, though, we are all aware of Nature's wrath, albeit on a smaller scale. <br /> <br />As the movie moves a long, the scenario gets less and less plausible. For example, the movie blames our leaders for ignoring global warming [a position that is likely true], thus igniting a sudden Ice Age, yet fails to resolve why this event has occurred countless times in the past, with no human intervention.  <br /> <br />The other problem with the script is that Emmerich seems to have lost his tongue-in-cheek humor. \\"Tomorrow\\" is relentlessly earnest. This is essentially the story of a dour-faced father [Dennis Quaid] determined to rescue his equally sullen son [Jake Gyllenhaal], who is trapped in a super-blizzard of epic proportions in New York City. The triumph of love over adversity is a time-honored one in movies, but here it plays out as hollow and predictable, as well as a bit boring. <br /> <br />The movie is another example of modern special effects playing a disproportionate role. Early in the movie, Los Angeles is devastated by a hurricane that spawns a series of devastating tornadoes. Visually, this is by far the movie's best segment. The story never once returns to this catastrophe, instead concentrating only on the New York story. So, why was the LA portion even in the movie? Because highly sophisticated computer special effects deemed that it could be?    <br />
0140187650|3.0|Hannah Arendt is one of the great political thinkers of the twentieth century. Her understanding of the concept of totalitarianism which analyzed together the Nazi and Soviet terror worlds is a major achievement. Her philosophical works are deep and rich, and provide a sense of the greatness and dignity of human life and thought.<br /><br />But in this work she fails morally, and exposes her own personal frailty. In writing about the executioner of what is arguably the greatest crime done in human history , she makes the terrible moral slip of in some way demeaning the victims further, and in some way finding , if not excuse, then 'alleviation' for the executioneer. She does the first not only by her indictment of the leaders of the Jewish councils, but even more severely by the tone she often takes to the victims. It is a German superiority and contempt , the tone of the foremost pupil of Nazi- sympathizer Heidegger. Her alleviation of evil of the evildoers is by this time well- known argument that the man in the box represented the ' banality of evil' He was no Faust or Satan but rather a little clerk looking out for his own little end, and trying to climb up a bit in the heirarchy. And while it is true that he was no great genius or hero, in fact he was very ideologically committed to the program of the Nazis. And that program and that ideology and its execution were the heart of the Evil. Arendt many believe did mankind a moral service by showing us just what ordinary people are capable of. And subsequent genocides in Cambodia or Rwanda and now in Darfur many argue show that is the case. But that point , however well taken i.e. the point that the ordinary human being can be not simply the passive witness,but the active participant in evil by no means excuses those particular individuals and that particular people who committed this crime. The ordinary man become a monster is still a monster.<br /><br />But to repeat and above all, Arendt's great moral failing here was in her coldness , her lack of sympathy, compassion and human understanding for the victims.<br /><br />No intelligence and no superior intellect and even no greatness , can excuse for wanton cruelty to other human beings, especially those who have suffered so much.n her coldness , her lack of sympathy, compassion and human understanding for the victims.  <br />No intelligence and no superior intellect and even no greatness , can excuse for wanton cruelty to other human beings, especially those who have suffered so much.

This was one of my favorite groups of the 70's - even though I was a metal head/classical freak.  The harmonies and arrangements show EW&F to be so original and miles ahead of most of even their best imitators.   <br /> <br />To this day, I can put this on and friends - young and old - can't help but sing along and turn every room into a dance floor. <br /> <br />For anyone who's wondered what the fuss was all about - check it out nice and cheap here.

B0002IU988|4.0|I just want to start this review off by saying I am a Creed fan. I enjoyed the majority of their music and I admit to being a bit sad when the break up was announced. But, alas, just a few months after the break up was announced, Mark Tremonti, Scott Philips and the rest of the guys released a new album, totally different from Creed, which is good because this should prevent all of the critics from claiming this is just another Creed. My review format is a bit different then all the rest, I'm grading four things that I think are very important in reviewing a CD:the vocals, the lyrics, the music and an overall grade. So I'll be grading it with As, Bs, Cs, and so on. <br /> <br />Lets start off with the vocals. <br /> <br />Vocals:Scott Stapp's vocals were a big part of Creed. There's no denying it. His vocals fit Creed's style perfectly. Now that Creed has broken up, and Alter Bridge has formed, a new vocalist has teamed up with Mark, Scott and Brian. Myles Kennedy was the vocalist for the Mayfield Four, in case you didn't know. His vocals are vastly different from Stapps, no question. He hits higher notes than Stapp did and he probably has more range than him, too. But, that does not make him better. While he does a beautiful job singing In Loving Memory, on the rest of the songs, I found myself a bit annoyed with his voice. He just sounded a bit whinny. Not to mention, he also says oh way too much. But he's not a terrible singer by any stretch. <br /> <br />Grade:C+ <br /> <br />Lyrics:In Creed, a majority of the lyrics were written by Scott Stapp. You can definitely tell that when listening to this album. These lyrics are so much different from anything Stapp wrote for Creed. I believe Tremonti wrote the majority of these lyrics while Myles wrote some here and there. The lyrics on this album are very good. They're catchy and have a deep meaning. The lyrics on In Loving Memory are very touching, and anyone who has lost someone important to them can relate to theselyrics. I especially like the lyrics to the lead off track, Find the Real. The lyrics convey many different emotions and like I said, have deep meanings. <br /> <br />Grade:B- <br /> <br />Music:The music on this album, in my honest opinion, is excellent. I would say this is as good or perhaps even better than Creed's music. Tremonti sounds great on this album and finally gets to do some soloing, which is something he's extremely talented at. The drumming on this album is very good as well. Having Brian Marshall back in the fold at Bass really helps the music, and it's something Creed lacked on Weathered. Kennedy's vocals fit this music pretty good, too. Tremonti has an awesome solo on the first single, Open Your Eyes. And he has some other good solos, too. <br /> <br />Grade:A <br /> <br />Overall:Overall, this album is a rock solid debut for Alter Bridge. While not all Creed fans will like this(namely the ones who appreciated Stapp's vocals more than the music) the majority should find something to like about this. The only bad song I can think of on this album is Burn it Down, and that's because it's so long. While I miss Stapp's vocals, I can appreciate Kennedy's at times. Is this album better than My Own Prison, Creed's debut? No. But it's close. If you want to hear solid music, with decent vocals and good lyrics, get this album. You won't regret it. <br /> <br />Overall grade:B <br /> <br />Standout Tracks:Find the Real, Metalingus, Broken Wings, In Loving Memory and Down to My Last.
B000002NE4|4.0|Nick Cave does it again.  With chamber-music like efficiency Cave offers up the aural equivalent of an artists palette of paints.  The songs spring forth with an immediacy and richness at once recognizable as Cave's own, but with another, spare quality that might, at first, unsettle some.  Starting off with the lyrical, sinewy \\"Into my arms\\" through \\"There is a kingdom\\" and beyond, Cave imparts this set of songs with a quality not unlike the great classical song cycles of Schumann and Wolf.  In my opinion, it's up there with them.  A remarkable achievement.
B00000099Y|5.0|For starters, I'll say I love this cd and it's a true masterpiece in the rock genre even today. This cd starts off good, builds on itself, and eventually grows on you (which is saying something for me. see my review for Demanufacture). If you don't like this cd, or Tool, for that matter, I'm okay with you having your own opinion, but do NOT say that Tool sucks. There's a difference between a band you don't like and a band that has no idea what they're doing when they pick up their instruments. Tool is a finely developed band, and even if you don't like them, to say they suck is purely for the sake of talking trash.  <br /> <br />Secondly, if you DO think they suck, at least explain why instead of yelling \\"I HATE TOOL!\\", because that doesn't tell us diddly-squat about the product or why you disliked it. Anyways, this cd has some strange little tidbits, such as Useful Idiot and Cesaro Summability (neither of which are actual songs)that although senseless, compliment the songs that come after them. Some of the strange tidbits, such as Message to Harry Manback and Die Eier Von Satan, sound like they were made purely for fun, which is cool, because it shows Tool wants fans to get something more out of a cd.  <br /> <br />The actual songs on this cd are awesome, using really cool guitar riffs combined with excellent, excellent, excellent (I'd keep going if I could) drums to emphasize the anger and frustration in Maynard's almost hypnotic vocals. Some of the songs (like Hooker With A Penis and Eulogy) stress his anger towards different people. Other songs (like Jimmy and Third Eye) make no sense at all, but still make for a great listen. If you're interested in Tool and would like to check them out but do not know which cd to start with, this is definitely it. Take it from a true rocker: this cd is going to be in your cd player until it shatters. Go pick it up as soon as you can.
B000002GYR|5.0|This is the album for all those who think they hate Tom Waits.  Perhaps his most easily accessible album, Closing Time is a tour-de-force for anyone who's had their heart broken and lived the ensuing days (months, years . . . ) in a bar.  The lyrics display Waits' way with words (too many \\"w's\\" there, I know) and wedding them (whoops!) together with music that is as perfect a fit as Goethe is to Schubert.  Anyone who doesn't get a bit teary at \\"I hope that I don't fall in love with you\\" - or \\"Rosie\\" must have ice coursing through their veins.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|This film has been at our local independent theater for about six months now.  I could be exaggerating, but I do not know the exact time.  All I do know is that it has been there for a very long extended period of time.  I have heard from several kids (children between the ages of 10 and 15) that this was a very funny movie and it seemed like the parents were in agreement.  Normally, this would turn me off a film, but since it was a \\"independent\\" film, I thought that perhaps we had stumbled onto a goldmine and I was the last to reap the benefits.  So, without delay, I gathered up some friends and sat (with cackling girls behind us) as nearly two hours of my life was drained from my soul.  Between the inconsistent story, the jumbled themes, the off-beat pacing, the teenage girls laughing before the joke happened, and the \\"must-seem-independent\\" feel Napoleon Dynamite just didn't work.<br /><br />I know, I know, let the gasping of air commence.  I have trouble seeing what everyone has loved about this film.  To begin with, why were we laughing at this character?  I remember the audience similarly laughing hysterically at Sandler's character in Punch-Drunk Love.  Is this character made to be laughed at?  Didn't anyone in the audience feel sorry for this underprivileged teenager?  While others were laughing hysterically at the overused and uncreative words that vomited from Napoleon's mouth, I was feeling sad for this guy.  He was constantly getting pushed around in school, he had a disorder of some kind that nobody seemed concerned about, and at first he had no friends.  He was a product of a dysfunctional family that we found funny.  It wasn't funny.  This film wasn't funny.  This film was sad, with some elements of humor mixed in to cover up the inhumanity.<br /><br />Perhaps I am being too harsh on this film.  Perhaps I should just take it as a light comedy that speaks to the insecure teenager in all of us.  Sadly, I cannot.  Even if you look past the characters, which all seemed forced by the actors playing them, the cinematography and story was not very strong.  Napoleon did things that made no sense to me.  At first I thought he was a very intelligent person, just misunderstood in school, but later I discovered that he was just an idiot.  Education came last behind tetherball, girls, tots, and Pedro.  I never once understood the time frame of this film.  Were we watching a film set today, but seemingly still lost in the 80s or were we watching an 80s film?  Was the director paying homage to the 80s, or simply making fun of them?  These were key issues that needed to be explained that never were developed.  The music and costume pointed to the 80s, yet the music and calendars pointed to 2004.  There needed to be a set time for this film and it needed to be released so that we, the audience, were not confused by this idea.  Even the dancing seemed dated.<br /><br />Next, while we were outside watching Napoleon create more insecurity for those unlike others, his family also co-existed with him.  This meant that while we were watching Napoleon at school, his family was continuing with life whether we knew what was going on or not.  This was a major downfall to this film.  I wanted to see more of a story with Kip and LaFawnduh.  I wanted to know more about Uncle Rico and the life that he led. I can honestly say that Uncle Rico's character was the least developed character that I have encountered in film in a long time.  I wanted to know more about Deb.  There was so much exploring that could have happened with this film that I felt cheated when the film was finally over.  Napoleon's world was huge, and maybe if we did more than just scratch the surface of his life I would have enjoyed this film much more.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very poor film.  I could not relate or get involved with the characters in any way.  I felt the director was trying too hard to make the film seem independent with amateur shots and oddball antics.  Near the middle of this film I began seeing images that other directors have used especially like Wes Anderson (see Bottle Rocket) and Sophia Coppola (see Virgin Suicides).  But instead of actual creativity and some smart and witty writing, this film just fell short by substituting lines like \\"sweet\\" and \\"GOSH\\".  This was a sad excuse for character development.  I felt like I was watching a high school project that felt (and was) plagiarized and uncreative.  This was not the film that everyone spoke of, this was a petty excuse for a film by cheating us into thinking it could be more by having low budgets and a seriously challenged main character.  This is not a comedy.  While I did grin a brief moment during the FFA testing, the rest of the time I was counting the minutes until it was over.  I do not recommend this film to children unless you are suggesting that they laugh at those that are less fortunate.  If this is your goal, then Napoleon Dynamite is the film for you.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****oddball antics.

B000003Z4C|5.0|One of Nick's best.  This is one of my favorite albums by anyone and therefore, one of my favorite by Mr. Cave.   Opening and closing the album by asking the question \\"Do you love me?\\" gives chilling perspective into what this album is supposed to mean.  From the deceptive delicacy of \\"Nobody's baby now\\" to the rage of \\"Red Right Hand\\" Cave takes us on a roller coaster of emotions and his unique voice and style never fail to entertain . . . and perplex.  A true gem of the 90's.
B00028HBKM|1.0|As many reviews have focused on the quality of this movie as a film, I am going to examine the content of the movie as it pertains to Protestant beliefs.<br /><br />Mariolatry<br /><br />Naturally when I heard that this movie was being made by a devout Catholic I became concerned with his portrayal of Mary. It seems my fears were well-founded. In the Biblical accounts Mary appears only in the book of John where Jesus tells John that Mary is now to be his mother and tells Mary that John is now to be her son. In this movie she is present in almost every scene and her role is elevated far above what the Bible teaches. She is presented as being Jesus' support and strength during His trials. Many times Jesus falls and is unable to get up, but after looking at His mother He finds the strength to carry on. The disciples all call Mary \\"mother.\\" Mary is shown submitting her will to God's, saying \\"so be it\\" as if her consent was necessary. The movie shows Mary as the suffering servant, suffering along with Jesus. This, of course, stems from Gibson's Catholic theology and is foreign to the Bible.<br /><br />Emphasis on Jesus' Suffering<br /><br />The movie chronicles Jesus' physical suffering. He is beaten time and time again and each beating is shown with graphic brutality. After two hours of suffering we see only ten or twelve seconds of Jesus' triumphing over death. There is really no attempt made to humanize Jesus or to display His divinity and power. There is no attempt made to explain that His physical suffering was nothing when compared to the suffering He experienced by being forsaken by God as the full wrath of God for sin was poured out upon Him. One would assume from the movie that the pain He felt was one and the same as His forsakenness.<br /><br />Would this movie look the same if it was made by a Protestant?<br /><br />The answer to this question is unequivocally \\"no!\\" The movie espouses Catholic theology, Mariology and interpretation. It is clear this movie has a strong Catholic bias. The Catholic bias is simply too strong to deny or downplay.<br /><br />Context<br /><br />This movie is almost completely free from context. Any serious student of the Bible knows that context is king and studying the Bible outside of its context is dangerous and leads to erroneous beliefs. Though flashbacks provide snippets of context, on the whole this movie shows only the events of the suffering of Jesus. Without context these events can make no sense to people who are not familiar with Jesus' history. There is no explanation as to why He has to suffer or even what His suffering and death accomplishes.<br /><br />Idolatry?<br /><br />I found it very troublesome that people identify Jim the actor with Jesus. My mind and emotions never made the transition to actually believing that Jim was Jesus. At one time I began to feel emotion as Jesus, nailed to the cross, cried out for God to forgive His murderers. Interestingly, my mind immediately intervened and kept me from seeing Jim as Jesus. I simply could not and ultimately did not want to see the real Jesus in this movie. I could not identify with this human playing my Lord and my Savior. My mind told me that making such a leap would be to succumb to idolatry.<br /><br />The Script<br /><br />On a macro level this movie succeeds in presenting the story of Jesus' arrest, trial and death. It covers all the major points from the Garden of Gethsemane to Jesus' death. On a micro level it is a terrible failure. Errors on this level abound and erroneous theology and interpretation is evident in almost every scene. On the macro level it is the gospel, for it simply follows the Biblical outline. On the micro level it is not the Bible and thus not Christianity. The micro level is mysticism, tradition and poor interpretation.<br /><br />Gibson drew heavily from Sister Anne Emmerich's devotional book entitled The Dolorous Passion of Christ. Emmerich is known as being a Mystic, Stigmatist, Visionary, andProphet. She apparently received many visions in which God provided her details about Jesus' last days that are not contained in the Bible. This extra-Biblical account of Jesus' suffering provided many of the smaller details in the movie such as Pilate's wife providing the cloth to Mary as well as Simon and Jesus linking arms as they held the cross. It also provided inspiration for some of the words Peter spoke, such as his expression of unworthiness before Mary. Most troubling is that it provided many of the words Jesus spoke. A great number of Jesus' words from the movie are drawn not from the Bible but from Emmerich. The movie makes no attempt to show what was drawn directly from the Bible and what was drawn from extra-Biblical writing. I am reminded of Revelation 22:18 which reads \\"I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\" To add to the Words of the Bible is a grave sin.<br /><br />Reading through The Dolorous Passion of Christ after seeing the movie I was shocked by how closely the script of The Passion of the Christ follows this book. So much of what I assumed was artistic license was actually drawn from supposed extra-Biblical revelation.<br /><br />Conclusions<br /><br />I found this movie to be very disappointing and disheartening. Though I had read many reviews for and against it, I was convinced when I began to watch that I would be pleasantly surprised. I believed this especially based on the multitudes of Protestant leaders who provided their support for the movie. The list of these men (on one of the Passion Web sites) reads like a who's who of Christian leaders and they described the movie as being \\"factually accurate,\\" \\"very accurate [in the details],\\" \\"realistic,\\" \\"biblical,\\" \\"an accurate account,\\" \\"a true representation of Jesus\\" and \\"close to the Scriptures.\\" Alas, it was not to be. Error is abundant to such a degree that I was shocked that so many Protestant pastors and theologians could give it their full, unequivocal approval. How little they must think of Protestant theology to ignore the pervasive Roman Catholic influence in this movie. My greatest disappointment was not in the movie but in the Protestant leaders and theologians who gave it their recommendation. Gibson made a movie that expresses his faith, but his faith is not the Protestant faith. It seems that so many people in the Protestant world simply do not know enough to discern the difference or they just do not care.<br /><br />It sickens me to hear people expressing that this movie brings the gospels to life and expresses the story of Jesus' suffering in a new and relevant way. I only wish that people would be so enthusiastic about the Bible! God has ordained that the primary means of reaching the world would be through the faithful preaching of His Word. That is not to say that He cannot and will not use other means, but we must guard ourselves against believing that other methods can surpass the Bible. This movie, full of flaws and error, has made me realize even more why God has given us His living, breathing Word as the primary means of reaching the world. Oh how I wish the church would turn to the Bible as they have turned to this movie! How I wish we would feel the same level of excitement for God's words to us given in the Scripture. How I wish we would have faith to believe that God can do so much more through the Bible than can ever be done through a movie.<br /><br />I will leave you with this thought: As my wife left the theatre last night she heard a member of a Protestant church say \\"I didn't remember the part in the Bible where Mary wipes up Jesus' blood. That was so beautiful.\\" This movie blurs Catholicism and Protestantism, Bible and Tradition, Scripture and mysticism.

B000001FSR|5.0|One of the greatest - maybe the greatest - album Mr. Waits has given us. Scratch that, one of the best albums anyone has given us.   <br /> <br />A harrowing, modern opera with a pathetic Everyman for a hero, Frank's Wild Years has been burnt into many of our musical memories for almost 20 years.  From initial desperate disappearing act to the giddy leave taking of one's senses, helpless resignation and ultimately tragic denouement this album has haunted me from its first, nearly incomprehensible hearing to today.  A remarkable achievement that has not lost a drop of its power or relevance.  You're innocent when you dream . . .

The title track is a wonderful new recording, as is the island flavored remake of \\"Beautiful Boy\\". This album also includes the previously released \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" and \\"Brahms Lullaby\\".  And of course there's even a song in French.  And the photography of Celine with several babies (representing flowers) is beautiful.  There's also a beautiful companion book out that includes the album as well. This is the perfect album to play for your baby.  An excellent album from a first rate chanteuse.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who writes that this punk rock opera resembles the style of Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" album. With American Idiot the band Green Day has really produced something incredibly special: a punk rock opera using rapid and unexpected changes in beat and melodies to make great music! It's about one young man's experiences in today's America. (I won't spoil the plot for you.) The lyrics don't mention current president Bush; but the CD is also a way Green Day protests the Bush administration. (If you're a major fan of George Bush, you might want to skip this CD unless you don't mind their lyrics with the obvious political references. You'll need to decide for yourself.)<br /><br />The set of songs is strong and really ROCKS! all the way through. The rock opera is embellished by the mini-operas of \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming.\\" The lyrics are provided complete which is a plus even though they sing so damn well you won't need written lyrics to figure out what they're singing! It's tough for me to say if I have any favorite songs on this CD--they're all so damn good--but \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Holiday\\" are especially solid pieces.<br /><br />I recommend this album for GD fans as well as fans of rock opera. It's also great to see an album that fits together well instead of being the type of album that has only one or two songs that people like. BUY IT AND ENJOY! THESE GUYS NEED TO ROCK ON!!!
0064409422|4.0|If you're looking to read a book that's a mix between Star Wars and old movies of King Arthur then pick up The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. It is a fantastic work of fantasy by the author C.S. Lewis that follows four children into another world. <br />From England, come to an alternate world of mystery, adventure, and fantastic manners. Sent away from London because of the war, four children, two brothers and their two sisters find another world while playing hide and go seek. Hiding in a wardrobe full of fur coats the smallest child, Lucy, pushes them aside to discover a whole other world full of gigantic forests with talking trees and majestic mountains that touch the sky. A world which seems centuries behind our own where an evil queen rules and an old prophecy is about to be fulfilled.  <br />By leading her two older brothers' and her older sister into the wardrobe, Lucy doesn't know that they will soon be fighting for their lives in a war against a cruel witch to save the world of Narnia. <br />The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" Series is a book about the crucifixion of Christ. It explains the biblical story but is set in a renaissance-like time. Christ, portrayed as a massive lion named Aslan, sweeps in from a country across the sea to help. The White Witch, as they call her, seems to have some fear of and a grudge against Aslan himself. <br />This book may seem serious but it is actually pretty funny. Unfortunately it's not mean to be, the time period in which it is written is understandable but so different then ours. When a situation occurs, such as treason, lies, and deception, you would expect it to turn out one way but it usually ends with no fights and amazingly good manners. The four children Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are so polite even if they have \\"evil thoughts,\\" they are soon reminded to show good manners. Moral values are highly incorporated in this book which makes it even more humorous since you would not expect normal people to be this nice.  <br />After Lucy finds the wardrobe her siblings think she has taken a joke to far but soon her older, but not oldest, brother Edmund follows her into the wardrobe.  However, when Lucy runs to tell her older sister Susan and her oldest brother Peter, Edmund lies about going into Narnia. \\"Oh, yes, Lucy and I have been playing - pretending that all her story about the country in the wardrobe is true...\\" Later in the story Edmund apologizes by hugging her. Edmund in this book is not the reliable one and deceives his siblings more than once which isn't even to his advantage since the witch already has dark plans for him even as he serves her.   <br />The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe may seem dull, since the dialogue is slow at the beginning, but after a while the book will suck you deeper and deeper into the story. Finding yourself in another world in another time, you will feel you've entered a fight to rid Narnia of the witch and return it to the rightful kings and queens the children themselves.  <br />To this book I give a low B but a B which is above average. Now I say this book was very enjoyable to me but I will not lie not everyone will like it. Some may read the first page and throw it away but like some books it does have a slow start. Keep reading grit your teeth through the first few pages and then you won't be able to put it down.  <br />
B0002S94OS|5.0|11th Hour was the first Lamb Of God song i heard of the Freddy Vs Jason OST.That was it i was baptizied. Here was a band doing something never heard in a longtime .Cutting thru the entire crop of nu age rap bands and just destroying them all.Over the past few years with 3 albums here s a band that has evolved continuously.From the sheer raw brilliance of the Steve Austin produced \\"New American Gospel\\" to a band taking music to the limits of tightness within a band format(Something not done since Holy wars and F*cking hostile) and mixing all of the bands influences in Devin Townsend produced \\"As the palaces burn \\".So here we are with \\"The Ashes of the Wake\\".The first listen what grips you is that this is pure metal at its primitive  roots not metalcore or anything else.The musicmanship is top notch.Adler and morton chug and grind out riffs and shred all over the place.The lyrics a lot easily decipherable and the guitars are just cutting thru the mix.But the helm of this amazing album is the diversity and dynamics of the vocals.From spoken words guttaral screams shrieks Randy Blythe has just stamped his impression on the metal world without doubt .Chris Adler's flawless drumming is just brilliant keeping odd timed signature songs like laid to rest in place.Plus the production values have taken things up a notch .The sound of the band can be heard in full spectrum something missing in the previous 2 albums.Coming to the songs each song has its own identity.This is one of those albums which you have to sit and listen thru completely and not have to pick at a single song.A true modern classic.The x-factor that makes Lamb of god stand out is having the guts and balls to not stick to the same success formula unlike Shadows Fall and a billion other bands.This is the sound of evolution of a band at its best.Heres a toast to the album of the year.
B0000541AM|3.0|this movie was amazingly good. i really liked the old subway and coney island scenes. I'm not sure that gangs actually dressed like some of the people in the movie ie. clowns? pink taffeta shirts? I was surprised to see one of samantha's boyfriends from sex and the city in it. i was particularly impressed by how absolutely crazy the actor who said come out to play was and i would really like to know who he is and what else he's done. can anyone help? the movie is definitely worth watching. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This is the new DVD from Dream, and yes, we all had great expectations about the incredible quality of this concert. First of all, I want to say, the image quality is amazing, the sound, you can't get better from any live from them, the most important, they all playing very well! But, nothing is perfect, so I have one complain, that frustrating me, cause I'm a drummer. The camera takes over Portnoy are really bad. All the guys are very good focused. But Portnoy, you can't never see his drums completely. Just behind, by the left, or in front, by one side. And if the camera is really at the center of the stage,it's too far, behind the public. I was waiting a good take in the 3 hours of the concert, and I just can find it in one part. In the 2nd DVD, when you can see the &quot;instrumedley&quot; by 4 differents angles. (It's one of the best idea of this DVD, if they can do it the entire DVD like this). I finally see a good take of the drums, but in the Myung angle only (#2). That proves the camera can take a better angle.But just for 4 seconds. Instead of that, I can't say to somebody, look at his drums, because you can't see him,  playing in front. But if you're not a drummer, you will not care. So, the highlight goes to Petrucci, who has the better camera takes. Long live to Dream Theater!
B00008EY65|4.0|I had almost zero good expectations for Hellboy. I had never read the comic. When I saw the preview, I thought this movie looked like the dumbest flick this side of \\"Wild, Wild West\\". I had no plans on seeing it whatsoever. At least not in the theaters. Then it came out and reviewers were giving it very positive remarks. So, I was intrigued. I bought the movie the day it came out and I am happy to say I am not disappointed.<br /><br />Hellboy is based on a comic book, as many of you already know. The movie stays true to the comic, but takes some liberties that actually improve the movie version, in my opinion. The background of Hellboy is an interesting one. Back in WWII, Hitler was researching the paranormal. He then sent Rasputin (the badguy) to try to capture a beast from another dimension (hell) who would come to our world and start the apocolypse. Rasputin builds this portal-like device and was in the process of bringing Hellboy to our world when a scientist, accompanied by the US Marines, interfere and end up screwing it all up. Hellboy still comes through the portal, but he is in the hands of good not evil. Hellboy then lives with other humans and adapts some of our bad habits, emotions, etc. He now fights on our side against monsters and helps humanity. Of course, Rasputin (still alive, can't be killed) has other ideas. That is where the conflict comes in.<br /><br />Hellboy is not just a regular comic book movie. Sure it has a hero, villain, lots of action, lots of special effects, etc. But, it also has the constant struggle of the Hellboy character trying to be normal in a world of humans. He fights for humanity, even though most of the world would call him a monster and want him dead. I know it sounds like the X-men mutants, but it's not quite like that. The story has a deeper, more emotional side that I didn't expect at all. That's what seperates it from the Spidermans of the industry. Not that I didn't like the Spiderman movies, it's just nice to see something more unique.<br /><br />Ron Pearlman plays the character Hellboy and does it absolutely perfect. I don't think there was another actor that could have played this part. He has the right look and has no trouble spouting off the one-liners that the character has. He likes beer, cigars, women and other stuff that any other man would like. He just happens to be tall, strong, blood red, and has horns coming out of his forehead. Pearlman was the perfect choice to play the lead here.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does a very good job, as well. Karel Roden plays the villain, and does a great job. Selma Blair plays the love interest here. I haven't really liked her much in any of her movies, but she impressed me here. John Hurt, a classic actor, takes on the role of the scientist that discovers Hellboy. He then basically raises him like a father & is very close to him. Do I even had to say if Hurt was a good choice for this part? He is a great actor. Overall the acting was solid all around. The movie was directed by Guillermo Del Toro (Blade 2). I think this is his best work to date and if there is a sequal, I hope he is heading that one, as well.<br /><br />If you like comic book movies, I think you should check this out. It's not your typical one, but if you can look past the goofy looking lead character and strange story, you will find a very surprising movie. I can highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />Special Features: Where do I start? This 2-disc set is LOADED. There are 2 different commentaries, set visits, storyboard track and recommendations. And that's just the first disc. On disc two, you get a two hour documentary on the making of the movie. The way the documentary was made, it kinda makes me think of the ones on the Lord Of The Rings extended edition sets. Very well done, and worth the price of admission itself. You get a few deleted & extended scenes, all with audio commentary if you so choose. There are character bios, animatics, trailers, film bios and more. Like I said, this movie is aboslutely crammed with special features. I almost gave this DVD a fifth start just for the supplements alone.lers, film bios and more.

B00000373U|5.0|His best album by far. The songs seem so simple but they are perfect in every way imaginable. Smith's voice is captivating, he leads you on an amazing journey through indie heaven.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|This film and the performances are outstanding. The director really captures the \\"feel\\" of a Philip Roth novel. But, although Gary Sinise is excellent, Nathan Zuckerman is supposed to be around 70 years old. I wonder why the director chose a much younger actor?
B00005JM02|5.0|Though I would say I am not exactly the right demographic for this film, this was a thoroughly entertaining film. I found that Pixar was able to seamlessly use technology with a well-written story, so that I was totally drawn into the tale. I think this would be a great impetus for kids to learn about undersea life and would greatly be complemented by any of the Captain Jon series in particular the newest one Capt Jon's Island Adventure

0812932293|5.0|If you intend to be self-employed and have big ambitions about it, then this book will definitely prove to you that what one man can do another can do.  Richard Branson details how he was achieved what many people in society believe to be impossible: Improved his position on life and reached the top by working hard and by having a good instinct for what the people want based on his down-to-earth way of life.  On the other hand the story also reads, in places, like the story of a gambler who happened to get lucky, reminding me of something my father said about gambling on horses and how you only hear about the people who win.  There were a lot of incidents, in both business and in the ballooning expeditions, where he has survived by the slimmest of margins of luck.  On the other hand, parts like the postal strike almost wiping out his mail-order business and forcing him to start up the lucrative high-street retailing business show that he has an uncanny ability to turn a bad situation to his advantage. <br /> <br />On the technical side I will criticise the editing of this book.  It reads a little bit disjointed.  For example he goes into great depth about the early days of the Virgin record label for a chapter, and then in the next chapter he digresses to a record-breaking attempt.  Then in the next chapter he tells us that he was 'attempting to start a record label' as if this was the first time he had mentioned it in the book. <br /> <br />But this did not detract from the enjoyment of this incredible story of an incredible man and who's exploits get more and more audacious.  I look forward to reading the updated version when he gets around to chronicling his experiences with Virgin Rail and Virgin Galactic!

B00028HBKM|5.0|Bravo to Mel Gibson for standing up to the criticism of Hollywood, and all of the non-believers out there! This is honestly the BEST film I have ever seen. Taken right out of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John this is a truly eye-opening visual for all of us who are familiar with the crucifixion according to the Bible. It allows you to use your visual sense to understand the pain and agony Jesus suffered for us hopefully impacting your walk with Him. Again, bravo Mel! I hope everyone gets the chance to see this movie.
B00005JMX6|2.0|There's nothing in the \\"unrated\\" version to justify the salacious marketing on its cover. The movie itself is far less substantial than it should be, as well.

B000088E6D|3.0|Michale Buble is the 30something guy spotted at every karaoke bar who can sing respectably all the Frank Sinatra/Bobby Darin/Dean Martin material.  His voice is decent, but nothing special.  Buble's success is a result of promotion and impeccable selection of \\"can't miss\\" standards.  He really adds nothing in the way of personality or interpretation of the lyric.  Much of his phrasing is exactly that of Sinatra and he obviously is trying to sound like ol' Blue Eyes (listen and hear it, \\"for once in my life I have someone who needs meeeeeee...\\"), but of course, falls short of the original. <br /> <br />The \\"cabaret crooner\\" animal has been relatively extinct from the pop music scene in recent years, and the success of a mildly talented standard singer like Buble is evidence that there is a demand in the market for a return of this timeless music. <br /> <br />The renewed recent interest in the life of the greatest cabaret singer of all time, Bobby Darin, makes you wish someone like him would burst on the scene and electrify us again.   <br /> <br />Alas, it appears we'll just have to settle for milktoast Sinatra mimics like Buble in the meantime...
B00005JMXX|2.0|Disaster films have always been popular movie fare and the Day After tomorrow\\" really shows off the ultimate in disaters...total global climate change.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall a climatologist who predicts the devastating effects of global warming which he thinks ist still hundreds of years away.  Nope...try days.  The Atlantic tides have a drastic increase in temperature with immediately start causing catastrophic weather around the world including baseball sized hail in Japan and tornados in LA, and New York hit first with torrential rains and then a huge tidal wave which floods the city so much that freighters go floating down the street....yeah right.<br /><br />Any way, Hall's son Sam just happens to be in NY for an academic competition and he along with several friends takes refuge from the storm in the NYC public Library.  Why the Library is picked over much taller buildings is anyone's guess but of course with all the books, it makes great fuel for the fireplace as the sole means of warmth.<br /><br />The eye of the storm causes the temperature to drop to -150 degrees...freezing people where they stand.  Jack decides to set out from Washington DC to rescue his son and two collegues join him.  Their van crashes outside of Philadelphia...so they decide to walk...to NY....from Philadelphia...in sub-zero temps...and sleep at night in a tent...OK....<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich is the same guy who brought us Independence Day a few years back.  Another spectacular looking but ridiculous film.  Emmerich sure does love destroying LA though.<br /><br />The effects are pretty cool to see, but there's nothing we haven't seen before in movies like Twister, or Deep Impact.  The plot is just so inconceivalbe that I just rolled my eyes through most of the non-sense.<br /><br />Fun popcorn movie, but short on plot, logic, and intelligence.
068987474X|5.0|Sometimes, when we are attracted to someone we love, we fail to see warning signs or lack of mutual interest, and our wishful thinking leads to heartbreak in love and romance. It is in our best interest to be realistic and use common sense. Thinking to be our best, bring out the best in our partner and evaluate our relationships. This author hits the nail on the head with healthy advice. I highly recommend this book.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan. watched all three movies in the theatre at least twice, got all the DVDs, etc. <br />I think Chris Columbus did a good job with the first two, but Cuaron messed up the third one big time. I don't think he has even read the book thoroughly enough to truly understand it. PoA, my favourite book so far from the series after the 5th, was expected to be the best HP film yet by many Harry Potter fans, but it is the truth that many were disappointed. I used to think JK Rowling was kind of harsh with the whole sticking-to-the-book thing with the Chris Columbus, but now I can see that she said that for a good reason, because PoA turned out to be a wee bit better than just 'crap'.

B0002S94OS|5.0|First of all, don't buy this album expecting another \\"As the Palaces Burn\\". As anyone who's followed metal history can tell you, no great band keeps an identical sound throughout their career, and this album definitely has a sound all its own, but the unmistakable Lamb of God aura permeates through it from start to finish. <br /> <br />It's beyond me how P. HAUKAS can compare this to Slipknot. Lamb of God does with five members what Slipknot can only dream of, despite having almost twice the manpower. Bone-crushing riffs, amazing drum work and the vocal talents of Randy Blythe combine to forge an early candidate for album of the year. My personal favorites include \\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\", \\"Omerta\\", and the brutal \\"Break You\\". <br /> <br />While I'm still partial to their previous album, I have to give this album five stars because it shows a much more complex side of this band's musical talent. It's truly amazing how far they've come since the days of \\"New American Gospel\\".
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Underworld, while rooted in an eternal strife between vampires and lycanthropes - something that in itself is more rooted in roleplaying games that actual history, is a film with Shakespearean and Copollan themes. At the heart of the story is a Montague versus Capulet rivalry so old that the original cause has been forgotten by all but a few. This is where the Romeo and Juliet influences cease. Underworld, as the title suggests, is mostly symbollic of the criminal underworld of organized crime. There is tradition, hierarchy, turf, consolidations of power, and treaties between enemies. <br /> <br />Kate Beckinsale is a death dealer, a play on vampire hunters, but with a twist: she hunts werewolves. Following the ganster themes in the film, Beckinsale is a soldier for her family. Beckinsale's performance is mostly soulless, but so is that of the rest of the cast. This is perhaps where Underworld remains faithful to our established perception of vampires and werewolves. The lycanthropes are passionate and tempermental, and are savage in the way they fight and kill. Contrast this to the vampires who are cool, aloof, distance... a bit dull. <br /> <br />I don't believe that this is the result of bad acting on the part of the vampire cast - even if there are a couple of actors who don't shine particularly bright. The existential treatment given to vampire personalities has been established in earlier vampire franchises, namely The Hunger and Kindred: The Embraced. Vampires in Underworld have a kind of royal tradition, so making the nobles somewhat reminiscent of the Windsors helps the film. <br /> <br />What I enjoy about Underworld is the fast paced action and that aforementioned blend of vampire and mobster movies. I anticipated combat involving tooth and nail, literally; and I was pleasantly surprised at the deeply involved (and exciting) gun fights. The pressures put upon Beckinsale and others because of tradition and habit are the kind that are found in Scorsese andCoppola crime dramas. Make no mistake however, you won't be seeing a revised Godfather or Goodfellas. set to a hypergothic vampiric themes. Rather, what you will get is a vampire film that takes itself seriously and strives for originality. Whether it achives orginality however, is up to the viewer. <br /> <br />I remember and loved Frank Langella's Dracula back when it was a new movie. So, I have my own expectations about vampire films in general. I still found much to enjoy in this movie. If Underworld represents a new generation of vampire films along with Blade, then I am very excited for the future of the genre. <br /> <br />I'm giving Underworld a four-star rating for the quality of the DVD, its extras, as well as the quality audio production done in the film. I also enjoyed the visual work of the film. Underworld is a darker movie, certainly darker than Copolla's Dracula in terms of color and light. The film's colors are muted, making the film more dramatic. As a side note, those interested in seeing how color and light add tension to a film should see Mamoru Oshii's landmark film, Avalon. The only complaint I have for Underworld is the less-than-convincing CG work done on transformed werewolves. It's still better than what the previous decade of horror films brought, though I don't feel it stands up to An American Werewolf in London, and I certainly don't feel it measures up in the age dominated by films like The Lord of the Rings and the new Star Wars prequals.

I miss the brotherhood of Texas High School football....it is something unique that definitely doesn't exist on the college and NFL levels.  This book goes to the heart of Texans and their treasure that they hold dear on Friday nights, High School Football, community, love, pride, spirit.  I definitely recommend this book and movie to anyone who loves football and especially anyone who played in High School, namely Texas Football.
B0001AP158|5.0|This is a more mellow compilation of their songs, but mesmerizing  and a nice change for the right mood. Is their ever a time or a song of Bon Jovi not to like? This Left Feels Right original CD was stated to be acoustic and slowed down versions so this Live performance shouldn't be any surprise in how it was done. It still is very powerful and there are songs that aren't on any other CD.  GREAT JOB Bon Jovi!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|between the one star reviews and the five star reviews.  Take a look at the spelling, grammar, sentence non-structure, etc. in the one star reviews, then compare them to the five star reviews.  Does this tell you anything?  I don't think those one star reviewers are the brightest stars in the sky.  Seems to be a little left wing vs. conservative thinking here.  As usual, it's mostly the left-wingers that don't understand what's going on.
B00004U2G4|4.0|I bought an original copy of Truth in a second hand record store in 1993. A piece of rock history which I'm pleasd to own. It's an enjoyable record, but I can't honestly say that in the year 2004 that's it's a *great* album. The main defect is in production. The good news is that Jeff Beck is an enjoyable player, and Rod Stewart is the real surprise. To be honest all I knew of Rod before was his poppy Do Ya Think I'm Sexy and Sailing era stuff, but his raspy \\"smoky\\" vocal style suits the music perfectly.  <br /> <br />People inevitably compare this album to Led Zeppelin. For me The whole Jeff Beck group sound is more appealing to me than Led Zep. If The Jeff Beck group coud have improved their production values I would have been much happier with the course of hard rock!  <br /> <br />So I'm not really a *huge* fan of Jeff Beck, but I find Truth quite enjoyable. But it's not the peak of hard rock for me. The statement that some make that \\"hard rock doesn't get better than this\\" I can't honestly agree with. But I would have loved to attend a live perfornace of the Jeff Beck Group in 1968, and no-one would cheer more loudly than me. <br /> <br />
B00006JKON|3.0|After the disappointment with \\"A Passion Play\\" this album shows Tull headed in the \\"right\\" direction. Though not one of their very best albums, there are great songs that makes it impossible to ignore it.<br /><br />After two solid tracks \\"Warchild\\" the title track and  \\"Queen and Country\\",  the acoustic \\"Ladies\\" is where excitement begins. Pretty melody and great arrangement. \\"<br /><br />\\"Back-Door Angels\\" has its moments but like the first two tracks it feels a little abrupt and disconnected; which could also be said about \\"Sealion\\", an even more confusing track.<br /><br />\\"Skating Away on Thin Ice\\" , which opened the original album's side 2, is one of my all-time Tull favorites.<br /><br />The single \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" is catchy and delightfully free-and-easy.<br /><br />The short acoustic track \\"Only Solitaire\\" is just a pretty little song. A Typical Anderson song.<br /><br />\\"The Third Hoorah\\" is musically not very interesting, lyrically a part of the \\"Warchild\\" concept.<br /><br />\\"Two Fingers\\" was originally the closing track ( this CD contains 7 bonus tracks ) - a solid track, but nothing more.<br /><br />The bonus tracks:<br /><br />\\"Warchild Waltz\\" is an orchestra instrumental - does not sound like Jethro Tull music. I would have put it on as the last track; or on second thoughts, just left it out.<br /><br />\\"Quartet\\" is another weird instrumental track - not much better than \\"Warchild Waltz\\".<br /><br />\\"Paradise Steakhouse\\" is a good track, with a riff reminding me of \\"To Sing You a Song\\" of \\"Benefit\\".<br /><br />\\"Sealion 2\\" and \\"Rainbow Blues\\" are both solid tracks, \\"Glory Train\\" a little better than that; and the final track \\"Saturation\\" has its moments but sounds unfinished.
B000002U82|1.0|Oh I'm only kidding- this album isn't worth 1 star, but how can I get you all reading all these words if I give it the 2 or 3 stars I think it deserves? You see the 1 star and you want to read on to see how on earth a dumbass could award this life changing mastepiece such a low score! Besides some give it 5 stars without really meaning it so it evens out in the end.    Oooh I liked Dark Side Of the Moon when I was 18. It was so slick and mysterious. You see at the time I was into bands like Queen that had poncey \\"melody\\" *shudder* and Iron Maiden who were just brainless Neanderthals. It was high time I listened to some REAL music. The Floyd. Yeah. Totally legendary. And Dark Side is their magnum opus. The pinnacle of intelligent rock. One of the defining moments in the history of popular music. The atmospheric hearbeats, the mellow, spacey guitar runs of Breathe. What a fantastic start. I'm truly listening to the sound of deepest space here. And the repeated electronic loop of On The Run, with it's mysterious spoken passages. What is it? It sounds like a woman speaking over a PA ystem about flights to Rome. I can see the sheer GENIUS of that! And The great Gig In the Sky with it's soulful wailings. Money too, the more mainstream track with Waters in fine vitriolic form about how corrupt the music business is! It's all about making money! Oh no! I'm with Roger in feeling outrage too! And it's so obvious that The \\"dark side of the moon\\" is a clever metaphor for madness. And even the cover fits pefectly. A prism. The prism means both madness and the dark side of the moon. It's all so obvious! Pink Floyd really know how to churn out some clever stuff!     That's all great. But that's what I thought when I was 18. Hearing it more dispassionately 16 years later I don't think there's much good music on The Dark Side Of The Moon. The guitar run on Breathe is so mundane. The electronic loop on On The Run? You could do better these days on a music making software program. Thesinging on Great Gig In the Sky has no form or melody to it. I can just imagine Waters saying to the session singer \\"Right make it loud and soulful, but none of this *melody* bullsh*t. That's for commercial bands\\" And Us And Them to me sounds like something you might hear on Sesame Street circa 1971. Us....us...us....and...them....them....them... .None of the members are exceptional at what they do. Waters isn't the best singer, Gilmour isn't the best guitarist, Mason isn't the best drummer... you get the idea. In fact virtually nothing on Dark Side is MUSICALLY very good. For me Time and Brain Damage are stll quite good songs. So a band wrote some good songs, Whoopee. I could list a hundred bands who have written \\"good\\" songs. Dark Side Of The Moon ( and Pink Floyd in general) is mainly about EFFECT. The overall effect, the \\"sound landscape\\", is what makes it a noteworthy album. Some might find this reason to laud it. I don't particularly. And really, what's the dark side of the moon got to do with madness? The ideas which seem to obvious to impressionable 18 year olds don't really hold any water (no pun intended) to closer inspection. Dark Side To me is a clever album in that it can make you believe you're hearing a masterpiece, but really it's to pop music what Star Wars is to movies. Lots of cool efects to suspend disbelief, but not much else beyond that.     These days I don't take Pink Floyd seriously. I've outgrown Pink Floyd in the same way that I've outgrown watching The A Team. One entertained me at age 13, the other at age 18. In my opinion Pink Floyd appeal to a specific age group roughtly 16-25 or so. Their themes of mystery, madness and whining about how life sucks when you've got a mountain of cash no longer appeal to me now, and there isn't really much good music backing it up. Most Pink Floyd bores me to tears now. Trying to find the substance behind the aural chicanery (or less charitably, \\"wankery\\") of their albums is like chasing a rainbow. Somemight find this a worhtwhile pursuit. I don't. These days I actually prefer Iron Maiden and Queen to pretentious Pink Floyd. Things have turned full circle indeed. But I don't hate Pink Floyd now either. And really, people like Beethoven, Wiliam Byrd and Bach have written stuff better than any pop/ rock group, and in much greater quantities than the most prolific band. The best pop music is something to entertain you. Some rave about \\"The greatest musical achievment in recored history\\" when speaking about Dark Side Of The Moon. I can listen to arty pop music and enjoy it, but I don't take it all that seriously, unlike most Floyd fans. If you're the type who thinks Picasso was a genius then Pink Floyd are for you. Because while Picasso's paintings can draw attention for being odd, at the end of the day his paintings are from a technical point of view absolute crap. I won't go so far in saying the same for Pink Foyd, but really the main appeal lies in the presentation, not the music itself. Similarly people like to eat caviar because it has such high brow and classy connotations. But really it's just fish eggs. Prententiousness is seemingly part of the human condition.    I can cautiously recommend Dark Side Of the Moon to the listener, because it does have some worth, even if nothing more than a museum piece of popular culture. But I don't think that it's because the MUSIC is great. Some- and I mean SOME- Pink Floyd is quite good music IMO, but I need a lot of patience to find it amongst the overgrown sonic weeds of their albums. When people apply genius status to Pink Floyd it just makes me smile. But everyone reading this is actually a die hard Floyder who probably want my guts for garters for not giving it 5 stars anyway.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|This movie focuses more on the action than anything else including realism. Now, of course vampires and werewolves aren't realistic, that's not what I'm talking about. There's a monk for example who creates all sorts of inventions for Van Helsing to use (a little bit of a rip off of James Bond). Inventions include hand pumped spinning blades, a crossbow that can fire bolts like a machine gun and a device that produces enormous amounts of light. Although these are obviously fake, especially for the time period, they just make the action more cool and interesting. The movie lacks a bit in originallity, and plenty of ideas from other movies can be seen. What it lacks in originallity and realism, however, it more than makes up in action. A very good movie.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie is slow paced. However I didn't find it boring at all. I loved the scenery and the small glimpses into everyday Japanese life, all meshed together with this love story of two people brought together by loneliness and uncertainty, with a musical soundtrack that brings out the best in all of it.  <br /> <br />After watching this film, the first thing that sprang to my mind was that I'm so glad I don't rely on Amazon reviewers to make a decision about whether I am going to see a film or not. That's almost as dumb as asking a fifteen year old to sit through it and not go crazy or pass out. This film is too mature, dealing with grown-up questions, situations and problems that the kiddies here have yet to grasp.  <br /> <br />Bill Murray's character is going through a midlife crisis; Scarlet Johansen's is tormented that she cannot seem to discover her purpose in life. Both are trapped in a place where they know no one, and understand nothing. They gravitate to one another and fall into a kind of love that is very unique, but also not at all uncommon under the circumstances. They don't pursue it physically, because they live in a real world with real consequences and have to respect the promises they made to people they both still love. <br /> <br />No kid fresh out of tenth grade will ever be able to comprehend these emotions... no wonder most of these reviews are from people who were bored stiff. \\"No sex? No violence? This movie SUCKS\\", seems to be the way it works with these Amazon reviews. <br /> <br /> Too bad. Maybe when they all grow up they'll get it. I recommend this movie to grown ups who like minimalist dramas and romantic comedies. If you're expecting a samurai to jump out with a sword, pass this movie up. This film is about human emotions. <br />
B00004Y6OA|2.0|Only one hit song here and the rest are decent tracks at <br />best. Look for the other albums.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Unfortunately, most of these reviews don't actually review the movie as much as they declare reviewers' political affiliations.  If you take a step back, Michael Moore has compiled a documentary that raises key questions and highlights current issues.  Wether you agree with him or not is your business, however as a documentary, this is well put together and extremely thought provoking.  It is compiled mostly from released documents, news segments and historical facts, some of which seem to be questionable to the population at large.  It's an important documentary to see, if for no other reason, to be able to discuss it or disbute it intelligently.
B0002OERI0|5.0|But this is a d@mn good album all the way through. These guys <br />are better than I gave them credit for 10 years ago. American <br />Idiot is a great song about the idiotic crazy for show like <br />American Idol and all the homophobic people.
0140177396|4.0|The novel \\"Of Mice and Men\\" written by John Steinbeck deals with interhuman problems and the character's social differences. The protagonists are Lennie and George. They travel together from farm to farm because George has to take care of Lennie who behaves like a child. First the characters are described in a superficial way and the reader can not feel like the caracters do. But in the end of the novel every character becomes multilayered and now the reader can follow the actions that take place. So the reader is able to foreshadow the continue of the character's life. The last chapter is the most important chapter because the novel ends t the same place where it starts. To me, it seems to be the sane thing with life: Every ending is a new beginning. So we can use John Steinbeck's novel as a help for life and for us to understand how we should treat other human beeings. It's a timeless novel because Steinbeck writes about problems that exist in every generation built by human beeings. This novel is very important for all the young people that do not know about the meaning of life.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This is probably the most underrated of all of them. There <br />are some songs like \\"Sinners Swing\\" and \\"Hear about it later\\" <br />that were not hits, but they should be. Very underrated songs. <br />Then you have greats like \\"Unchained\\" and \\"Mean Streets\\" that <br />just put this album over the top. This album is so underrated!
B00004WKII|5.0|The Hendrix you see and hear out there is the hip flashy showman which everyone knows is completely awe-inspiring, but the collection of music in this box set allows you to look a little further.  Sure, sure, all Along the Watchtower, Purple Haze, Fire all blow us away (well whoever isn't surely has got a problem no one can cure), but the real gems, and my personal favorites, are the ones that show a side of the man that no one talks too much about.  The bluesman, the (gasp! dare I say it?) perceptive pop sounds, the funk and soul grooves.  Yes, my favorites are the ones that are quiet and melodic, like Slow Blues and Cherokee Mist.  In those, they are like the past and future colliding (and he truly was in many ways ahead of his time), the dirt of the earth and lofty gases of the heavens all combined to create truly heartstopping music.   Where he came up with sounds that were just so otherworldly, one can only speculate and just for those precious heavenly tracks alone they are certainly worth a few earthly paper bills.
B0000074Q9|2.0|Crossing Over and Can't stop loving you are the only worthy <br />tracks on this album. This album was worse than Van Halen 3 <br />but people give it a higher rating? Makes no sense to me. <br />Worse album they ever made.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I was hoping that like Lord of the Rings that all my Harry Potter films would be in casings that would be the same. I am saddened to find that the case for the 3rd film will be a standard boring plastic case and not a quarto fold in a sleeve like all the rest. Is there something we can do about this?
B00005JMJG|4.0|In another Charlie Kaufmann-written movie (\\"Being John Malkovich\\", \\"Adaptation\\"), the form again gets the upper hand over the substance, although it can be said that \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" really tries to tell you something; notably, that it's fine to love the one you're with. Otherwise, you may regret the rushed split. The story needs a while for you to figure out what's going on and when. Jim Carrey and especially Kate Winslet play two very contemporary lovers.  Other talented actors hand in great work (Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, Tom Wilkinson). For a critic it's hard to pick out flaws of the movie. However, the ultimate feeling afterwards may be that of relief you're finally out of the maze. And if you want to watch \\"Sunshine\\" once again, it may rather be for the time/event puzzles to fit properly than for the fact that the movie warmed your soul.
B0002S94OS|4.0|Lamb of God... what is there to say about these guys that hasn't been said already? They have to be one of the most powerful forces leading the forefront in the inevitable retrun of metal.  Back in about April one of my friends introduced me to this band and the first track I heard was \\"As The Palaces Burn.\\" Once I heard this song I was completely hooked.. I ran out and bought the cd. So you can only imagine how excited I was when I heard they were releasing a new cd.  As soon as it came out I went, picked it up, and popped it in my car for the drive home.  Sadly though... it seems these guys in their progression forward have lost some of that hardcore metal edge that both \\"New American Gospel\\" and \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" had.  They have went from a hardcore tear sh!% up sound to a more studio developed sound, but this could also have something to do with their record deal with sony.  Even though I have shown my aversions to this album, don't get me wrong its still great.  And you know what they say... change is inevitable, but at least these guys are still sticking to that great metal sound.  I would recommend picking up \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" first but \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is a great cd in itself too.
B0002MPU1K|4.0|My favorite tracks from \\"On the Moon\\" begin with the incredible \\"I Love Paris.\\"  Bashiri Johnson who did such a stellar job on Laura Nyro's last CD \\"Angel in the Dark\\" outdoes himself propelling this track with Cincotti's wild piano and Sam Yahel's excellent B-3.  \\"Raise the Roof\\" is an utter smash with Wycliffe Gordon's trombone, Barry Danelian's trumpet and a sax trio giving sexy swagger to this Andrew Lippa composition that sounds like a classic standard, \\"Grab your partner by the collar, bribe the barman with a dollar, just ignite that mighty holler, lead me to the trough till the light goes off!\\"  This track is causing severe wear on the repeat button on our stereo!  Cincotti gives a great reading to \\"Gerald\\" Goffin and Carole King's classic \\"Up on the Roof\\" that the Drifters made famous.  This reading highlights what a wonderful marriage of lyric and melody this song is, \\"At night the stars put on a show for free & darling you can share it all with me.\\"  The CD has many other sparkling moments including the lovely instrumental \\"Cherokee\\" and the Cincotti original \\"You Don't Know Me.\\"  Cincotti continues his development as a great jazz interpreter and shows a willingness to experiment that all the great innovators share.  I think the only thing better than listening to this CD would be travelling to Paris & listening there!  Enjoy!
B0002DKCMG|4.0|\\"Eurotrip\\" is a cheeky little sex farce that is far more endearing and amusing than it has any real right to be.  Think of this as basically \\"International Pie,\\" with four high school grads spending their final summer before college on a wild sex-capade through Europe.<br /><br />Writers Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer have penned a surprisingly clever screenplay, filled with ribald humor and irreverent, keen-eyed satire.  As director, Shaffer keeps the energy level high and the tone so innocently upbeat that material that could easily have become sleazy and smarmy in less gifted hands becomes genuinely hilarious and utterly good-natured in his.  Even when a particular scene or joke falls flat, there is always a clever zinger or ingenious comic concept coming right along behind it to keep the film moving steadily along on the right track.  And some of the scenes are very funny indeed, with the film, as a whole, providing more hearty belly laughs than almost any comedy in recent memory.  Those easily offended by nudity and a casual attitude towards sex may want to take a pass on this film, but the rest of us will find much to laugh at in this broad little romp.<br /><br />As the New World quartet suddenly let loose on the unsuspecting Old World, Scott Mechlowicz, Jacob Pitts, Michelle Trachtenberg and Travis Wester deliver performances filled with unflagging energy and youthful high spirits.  The fun these actors obviously had making the film is visible up there on the screen for all to see, making \\"Eurotrip,\\" for all its potential crassness, a surprisingly upbeat movie experience.<br /><br />One could easily damn \\"Eurotrip\\" with faint praise by calling it a \\"guilty pleasure.\\"  But that would be demeaning the people who put this very fun movie together.  \\"Eurotrip\\" is a high-energy, thoroughly entertaining comedy in its own right, one that needs no backhanded compliments or half-hearted apologies to detract from its very genuine virtues.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Then here you go.  I watched this movie in the theater and the first time I saw it at home was with my roomate, her boyfriend and all his tough guy, motorcycle riding, tatooed all over friends.  By the time this movie ended, all those tough guys were smiling from ear to ear trying their best to coolly state that they enjoyed the movie when you could tell they were all just as giddy as I was about it. <br /> <br />The best thing about this movie is that there are two points where you think it ends, then it takes off again.  I bought the DVD for myself a month ago after buying it as gifts for 3 different people.  A wonderful, wonderful story.   <br /> <br />You'll love the cast, Angelica Houston turns in one of her best performances.  The guy who plays Leonardo DaVinci, not sure of his name, but he just steals every scene he's in.  This is just a well done, easy to watch, movie.  It's not overly ambitious but it really hits the mark it aimed for. The pseudo-euro accents are...er...a bit rough around the edges but don't let that stop you from enjoying the story.
0312995423|1.0|The idea under the book is excellent. However, from the reader's point of view there is something worrying:<br /><br />When the reader does not know very much about the subject but knows about something specific and this \\"something\\" is poorly documented, the suspicion affects the whole book.<br /><br />Dan Brown speaks a lot about Seville and it seems that he never went to Seville nor got documented about this city. The description of the Seville airport does not fit by far with Seville or with any other big city in Spain. When he tries to exhibit spanish knowledge invents a word \\"callita\\" meaning \\"narrow street\\" that simply does not exist in spanish (I never heard it even in South America). He could use \\"calleja\\", \\"callej&oacute;n\\", \\"callecita\\" but not \\"callita\\".<br /><br />The problem with these details is the distrust about the whole book. I have read books by another best-seller author (Michael Crichton) and, however the reader knows that the book is a novel, the documentation about the subject is excellent and that gives credibility to the book. Unfortunately, this is not the case of Dan Brown.
B00005JMAH|2.0|I have read all the books and have seen the first two movies.  This newest movie did not have the same feel as the first two Harry Potter movies.  I kept finding myself looking around to see if I was in the right theater.  The movie was too dark and confusing.  It did not seem to match the book.  I was surprised the author had allowed this director to produce the 3rd movie in this way.  I wanted to see the whole movie because it was a Harry Potter movie but at the same time the urge to leave the theater early was pretty strong.  We were all a bit disappointed by this movie.  I am not sure this movie is worth buying maybe you could just reread the 3rd book again.
B00005JKL8|1.0|This film featured at the get-go some incredible camera work which continued throughout the film and the three main characters were very well acted, how can you go wrong with Gene Hackman and good ol' Owen Wilson?  Well, you can if you use a lousy script.  Where this film falls to pieces is in the script, message and character development departments.  The film came off as a blatant feature-length enlistment commercial for the Navy/Air Force, replete with the rock-video style shots and jarring action-footage.  But....it gets worse, the plot features a main character who wants to resign from the Navy because he hasnt had the opportunity to fly combat missions.  Although I imagine that this could be a problem in real life for these highly trained professionals Owen's character comes off to me as chillingly shallow even though he plays it well.<br /><br />It gets even worse, the two main characters are men who find no problems in \\"free-jacking\\" or going \\"off-mission\\".  Now, I appreciate the fact that society needs people like these at times as much as it needs people who obey orders well.  My problem is that the film mindlessly glorifies these character traits as somehow noble and heroic without CLEARLY revealing the complex repercussions that often occur as a result of these types of activities.  Because of the times we live in, I found this quite chilling despite the supposed noble outcome of Wilson's character's actions.  The jingoistic overly simplified telling of this story is grotesquely misleading about the complexities of war and the attendant international politics!  This is a film with no soul.
1592400876|2.0|When I read this book I had but one feeling.  Guilty!  Maybe it was my guilty conscious, or maybe it was the condescending tones that rang throughout this book.  Some of the funny stories may have helped me to remember a couple of the rules.  For the most part this book is a compilation of the author's complaints about people like me.  I wouldn't recommend this book as a teaching aid, nor would I recommend it for its humor.  I'm honestly not sure what I would recommend this book for.
B00005JMXX|4.0|How many disaster movies can Hollywood turn out?  While this one was fairly decent with its story line, casting, special effects, and subplot, I was rather disappointed in the predictability of plot twists and the dialogue.  It's a good flick to watch once or twice but I don't think it's one you would watch over and over.
B000006FYP|4.0|In this 3rd installment of the Batman series, Val Kilmer has taken over as Batman, replacing Michael Keaton from the first two films.  At first, I was disappointed, but Kilmer does a very good job in the title role.  He is helped by a strong supporting cast, including Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face, Jim Carrey as Edward Nygma/Riddler, Nicole Kidman as Chase Meridian, and Chris O'Donnell as Dick Grayson/Robin. <br /> <br />The mood and setting of this movie is different from its predecessors.  In the first two movies, Gotham City had a distinctly dark and gothic look, while in this movie, Gotham appears much brighter.  The action which made the earlier films so good is present here as well.  Instead of battling the likes of the Joker and the Penguin, Batman has encountered two new enemies; the Riddler and Two Face. <br /> <br />Riddler, played by Jim Carrey, began as Edward Nygma, an employee of Wayne Enterprises, who developed a box which is placed on top of a television.  The box can draw in people's brain waves, while strengthening Riddler at the same time. <br /> <br />Two Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, used to be Harvey Dent, former D.A. of Gotham City.  A terrible accident left Harvey severely burned, and he blames Batman for not helping him.  Thus, as Two Face, along with his trusty coin, he's made it his personal vendetta to destroy Batman. <br /> <br />This movie also sees the arrival of Robin.  Robin, aka Dick Grayson, played by Chris O'Donnell, was a member of the flying Graysons, a group of high wire circus performers.  A terrible accident happens at one of their performances.  Dick blames Two Face for the accident and he vows to avenge is family.  He moves into Wayne manor, and after a period of adjustment, joins forces with Batman. Soon, the two caped crusaders are fighting evil in Gotham City. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  The action is very good, and the acting, especially by Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones, makes it even more enjoyable.  Watch this fine movie and follow the continuing adventures of Batman.
0441003257|5.0|I've read this book twice.  It is so..... GREAT!!!.  It's very clever.  Style-wise and somewhat plot-wise it kind of reminded me of the movie Dogma (also great!)  I read this book on my breaks at work and found myself laughing out loud in the break room.  With other people in there.  Kind of embarassing.

B000002MP2|5.0|I have and always will be the BIGGEST Green Day Fan, and i have to say, THIS ALBUM SHAPED and MOLDED MY LIFE!! It made me who i am today, that's how mind blowing it is. this album is a work of art. It's not my absolute favorite Green Day album, but i never skip any of the songs. If you don't already have this CD, something must be terribly wrong with you, even if you aren't a Green Day fan.The standout songs are \\"Basket Case\\", \\"Longview\\", \\"Welcome to Paradise\\", and \\"When I Come Around\\". I suggest you go get it, and listen to it until your ears bleed. This is the album that made Green Day a household name, and one of the biggest punk bands on the planet.
0790729628|4.0|There seems to be much confusion over what exactly was the first ever released DVD in the U.S.  DVD was launched in Japan in late 1996, and early-mid 1997 in the U.S.  <br />  Warner Home Video was the first to release 4 DVDs in Japan for 1996, including Blade Runner.  Now, here is where things get a bit confusing:  For the U.S. launch of DVD in March of 1997, it is widely believed that Batman was the first DVD released in the U.S.  This is not true.  5 days before Batman was released, four Imax films were released on DVD, beating Warner Home Video to the U.S. market.  <br />  How does this relate to Blade Runner you ask?  Well, to the best of my knowledge, the initial release of Blade Runner in the U.S. (catalog 12682) is the only U.S. release DVD with a 1996 copyright on the back.  It's a possibility that the other three titles Warner released in Japan in 1996 also have the 1996 copyright for the U.S. versions, but I just don't know... <br />  As for the first pressing of Blade Runner, we have quite a rare DVD due to the 1996 copyright date.   <br />  For those of you who are DVD collectors out there, the first pressing of Blade Runner on DVD will continue to gain historical value as time passes.
076790592X|5.0|Simply a lovely story about how life should be lived and how it should end. From a healthcare professional view, I think this book is a must for anyone living through a difficult time in their life. The book describes the beauty of life and how even in trying times, meaning in life is found. Much of how to find meaning is focused on finding inner happiness. To understand how to find happiness is, (As Morrie tells us) \\"being compassionate and taking responsibility for others.\\" Happiness isn't found in a material world. Now, go read!
6305311463|3.0|This is a great movie.  Specifically for the Criterion DVD: Criterion should have never put their name on this transfer.  There is excessive picture flutter, like a flash of light noticable on the black bars.  It's not terrible, but for a \\"Criterion\\" release...it's terrible.   <br />  Criterion's main pitch is that they have exclusive director commentaries, and that's great, but the need to spend an equal amount of time making a transfer worthy of 30 plus dollars!
B000002UDB|3.0|Although MMT started out as an EP, you cannot ignore the fact that the released full album contains seven Beatles classics. I agree with many, that the other album tracks are very ordinary, which are the album's downside.  <br /> <br />I'd perhaps recommend people purchasing the Beatles blue-coloured double best of CD. It contains all of the seven classics from MMT.  <br /> <br />Other Beatles albums to consider buying are: <br />1.  Revolver <br />2.  Rubber Soul <br />3.  Help <br />4.  White Album <br /> <br />
B000063DFN|5.0|Forget all genres that come to your mind (trash, death, black, speed or whatever you like to call them)... This is METAL!! in its pure shape, perfect, pristine, immaculate; although all maiden albums are excelent (`till bruce rupture :P) i think this is their best, best sounding, more consistence, superb arrange, this is a must-have-or-you-are-a-loser record!!; maybe Maiden`s sound doesn`t please everybody i know, but trust me: if you are going to buy only 1 maiden album in all your entire life, be sure that 1 to be POWERSLAVE.
B000006YYM|5.0|IF you understand prog-rock music then this album is for you!! If you are looking for more commercial fare look at the newer Giant albums. This album has the band in rare form. If you wanted to pick their 4 top albums, choose this and In A Glass House and (although not the best recorded album) Gentle Giant Live-Playing the Fool and Free Hand. This album has so many nuances and gets better each time you hear it. Take note that this came out around the time of the Nixon tapes etc. The musicianship is awesome and is one of their best vocal albums. <br />I own all the aforementioned Gentle Giant albums and THIS ONE is my favorite!!!
B0001WTVUW|3.0|Maybe this was shocking back in its day, but I felt it was rather weak. But that could be because it is made for tv and not a feature. The acting was subpar, the story was mediocre at best and not that 'scary' and it filmed like a low budget tv movie. It just doesn't stand up to time. Not like others of its kind. And the dvd contains no extras.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|This show rocks!  I have been a devoted fan since the first epiisode and was thrilled beyond belief when the firdt season was put out on DVD.  I am just as thrilled if not more so with the release of the second season.  The show just keeps getting better.  The season two DVD will be amazing, like the fiirst and hopefully the rest to come.  The special features and the amazing episodes make this the greatest thing to come out on DVD, since season one.
0688170528|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  Amazing!  I was in tears before I finished and had to keep reminding myself it was a book.  The characters felt so real to me.  I wanted to reach out and help them.  Help them overcome their problems and go on with their lives.  Picoult is an amazing author.  I can't wait to read more of her books.

B00008S2VG|5.0|THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHY SHE HAS HAD A MASSIVE CARREER FOR OVER TWO DECADES NOW.  SHE IS ORIGINAL.  SHE IS ON TOP OF HER GAME.  SHE IS HERE TO STAY.  NOTHING CAN TOP \\"NOTHING FAILS\\"...
B0002CH8C4|4.0|This is a very good Tosca. Dessi is a little shrill but otherwise good and a good actor. Her real life husband Armiliato is very good. Where has this man been hiding? Good actor as well. But the show belongs to Raimondi who exudes evil and menace as Scarpia. Benini gives us a fairly slow performance which allows us to luxuriate in Puccini's melodies. The ochestral sound is quite thrilling in DTS. The production is on the lame side. They have made Scarpia a church figure although what kind is hard to say. Certainly a cardinal or bishop would not wear pants but a surplice. The settings are quite dark. You never do get a good glimpse of Scarpia's palace. But at least nothing interferes with this wonderful performance. Probably that best Tosca one could hope for today.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|(I don't have this set and I haven't see any of the director's cuts. This is for the theatrical versions of the films.) <br /> <br />The Alien Quadrilogy is a collection of four films starring Sigourney Weaver in her star making role as Lt. Ellen Ripley. <br />Here's is a brief summary over each film. <br /> <br />Alien-a ship of seven crew members gets a S.O.S. from a nearby planet. Three of the crew members go outside to explore and Ripley discovers it is not a S.O.S., but a warning. It is proven that is too late to tell the crew that because Kane(John Hurt),a member of the crew, now has something on his face that if it gets removed he will die. A couple hours later, Kane wakes up feeling great and the creature now off his face. The crew is now having dinner when sudenly Kane starts going crazy. He lays down on the table and an alien comes out of his chest. Soon, it begins to grow and kill off all the passagers. It is now a race against time as the crew tries to get off the ship and get to the escape pod before the alien kills them all. This is one of the best films of the ENTIRE series. Everything is amazing(Acting, Directing, etc.). Overall truly a classic film. You will love it. <br /> <br />Aliens- 57 years have passsed and Ellen Ripley has been found in hypersleep. She has been taken aboard a space station and tries to explain what happen to the crew. Nobody buys the alien story and the case is closed. Ripley tells them check to make sure, but the chief says it is not necessary because the planet has been colonized and there are no reports of aliens. But soon, contact is lost with the colonists and Ripley is asked to find out what went wrong. She will do it on one condition: to wipe the aliens and not have anyone study. They agreed and Ripley, along with a group of marines, sent off for the planet. <br />When they get there, they meet a young girl named Newt who is the only person still alive because the aliens have killed everyone else. Soon the aliens showtheir ugly faces and now, it's war! WOW is all I can about this one! This film is the best one, period. Everything has improved and the fight between Ripley in the robot suit and the Alien Queen is amazing. See this one! <br /> <br />Alien3-Ripley crash lands on a prison planet due to an acid spill in the cyrogentics room aboard the ship Surlaco, where she and the other survivors of LV-246, are sleeping in cyrosleep. Soon, she is found by the people who work on the planet and discovers she is the only person who survived the crash on the planet. Newt and Hicks(one of the marines from Aliens and the only Marine who survived Aliens) are now dead because of the crash and Bishop(the android from Aliens) is damaged beyond repair. Ripley soon hears about a death and she knows that a alien is now on the planet. She discovers that this alien was aboard the ship before it crashed.  It turns out this alien had used a dog for the host, thus making this one is much faster than its previous aliens. Ripley must now destroy this alien, along with the prisoners, who have taken up religion, without modern day weapons. She also must now kill herself because she now has an alien inside her, due to the fact another alien got in her cyro-tube and implanted her with one. It is discovered to be an queen, which means if it bursts out of Ripley's chest, not only will she die, but more aliens could be produced. This film goes back to the style of the first. I considered this the weakest film in the series and once you see it, you will most likely, agree. <br /> <br />Alien Resurrection- 200 years have passed and Ripley has been cloned by scientists of the space ship the Auriga. Ripley was cloned with the alien queen inside her.Scientists need more information about the aliens and Ripley, who now has acid blood and abilities like the alien because while she was being cloned she had sex with the Alien Queen(that's how I understand it,anyway),so the scientists get bodies to use as hosts for thealiens.They are  delived by the crew of the Betty, a group of mercenaries. The experiment proves to be  successful and soon the aliens are back to cause some more terror for the people on board the ship. Now Ripley and the crew of the Betty must now escape and get to Earth before they are all killed by the aliens. This is underated. Truly this is better film than 3 (IMO) and is more like Aliens due that is a action film. Still worth checking out, especially for the CGI aliens. <br /> <br />Overall a good collection. I reccomend it!!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|When listening to this cd, I felt overwhelmed with emotions.  I sat back and watched my children in amazement and with tears in my eyes.  Children are little miracles themselves and we should cherish every moment we have with them.  Celine did a great job singing these beautiful songs.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Cameron Crowe just makes good films. Period. Almost Famous is NO exception. The film is centered around a 15 year-old boy who goes on tour with an up-and-coming rock band called Stillwater in 1973. Along the way, he experiences 1st hand what the life of a rockstar is really like, falls in love with a girl, and at the same time, finding his place in the world! The soundtrack for the film was composed by singer/songwriter Nancy Wilson. Each song in the film complements each scene perfectly. Almost Famous is one of the best films of our time. Period.
B0002BO0HG|5.0|I had the pleasure of meeting Antony in Italy and seeing him (along with the lovely Julia Kent on cello) perform live in an opening slot for COIL.  I was happy to see that the magic was well-captured on cd.  His voice is haunting and beautiful and some of these songs will just cut you right open. If you need proof, just listen to  \\"starfish\\" and \\"hitler\\".  He has another ep with an enchanting track about being in love with a dead boy; I suggest seeking that one out as well.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump...what is there to say? Excellent movie. It's seeing history and telling it from a point of view. Many people, who were not in the era, do not realize how everything was, until they see this movie. With history is the whole 'true love' plot, which goes well for the movie. This movie is definitely one of my favorites, my friends and I can remember it word for word and we use many quotes till this day. I highly recommend this movie because of all the great actors, the plot, etc. I look at it as a drama and to me, drama has a little bit of everything in it.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Ed Wood is a gloriously atmospheric, black and white love letter to cinema. Tim Burton understands that for the devoted cineaste, the best moments in life have often been spent in a darkened movie theatre being enveloped by a film and becoming one with the environment it creates for two hours. Watching a movie is a form of escape from the harsh realities of the real world and Ed Wood argues that making films can also do the same thing. No one understands and appreciates this devotion to cinema more than Burton. From Beetlejuice to Mars Attacks!, his films are lovingly crafted homages to the horror and science fiction B-movies that the director enjoyed in his childhood. With Ed Wood, Burton indulges this obsession completely by telling the story of a man who loved to create and watch movies.<br /><br />There is a three minute music video directed by Tim Burton that features Howard Shore's atmospheric score with a strange, yet sexy interpretative dance by a Vampira look-alike (Lisa Marie?) mixed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />\\"Let's Shoot This F#*%@r!\\" is a 14-minute featurette introduced by a cheeky Johnny Depp dressed in drag. What follows is a montage of behind-the-scenes footage of certain scenes being filmed and Burton directing his actors.<br /><br />\\"The Theremin\\" is a look at this unique musical instrument whose signature sound was used in countless science fiction and horror films over the years.<br /><br />\\"Making Bela\\" examines how Rick Baker transformed Martin Landau into Bela Lugosi. The actor talks about his take on Lugosi while Baker speaks about how he got the gig and his approach to Landau's make-up.<br /><br />Production designer Tom Duffield examines the challenges of making a black and white film in \\"Pie Plates Over Hollywood.\\" He also talks about how he achieved the retro `50s look and his goal of aping the flat look of Wood's movies.<br /><br />There is also a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The best and most substantial extra on the disc is an audio commentary with Tim Burton, Martin Landau, the film's screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, director of photography Stefan Czapsky and costume designer Colleen Atwood. Landau introduces the commentary and all of its participants affecting Bela Lugosi's accent and voice, which is a nice touch and gets one in the spirit of the movie. This is an excellent commentary with a lot of detail and insights. This is a must-listen for any fan of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, there are five deleted scenes that include an insightful bit where Ed has dinner with Tor and his family. Best of all is Bill Murray singing \\"Que Sera Sera\\" with a mariachi band.<br /><br />Ed Wood has endured. It went on to win two Academy Awards (one for Landau's performance and one for Rick Baker's make-up) and a slew of critics' awards. The movie has also become a favourite of film buffs everywhere, which is rather fitting considering that this is exactly its target audience. Sadly, Burton went on to make Planet of the Apes, a paint-by-numbers action film with expensive computer effects that lacked any of Burton's distinctive personality-the complete antithesis to Ed Wood. Hopefully, he has not become completely absorbed by the Hollywood system and that there is still some of the spirit of Ed Wood left in him.a on the disc is an audio commentary with Tim Burton, Martin Landau, the film's screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, director of photography Stefan Czapsky and costume designer Colleen Atwood.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Truly awe-inspiring. A beautiful work piece that is never disappointing. Wonderful cinematography. Unlike this review, the movie flows gracefully without being choppy. There are so many more good things to be said about this movie. 2 more things: Russel Crow is such an amazing actor and seems to perfectly elude the character of John Nash. James Horner does some excellent work with the score, although it does seem to be a little repetative in some places.
B000002I25|5.0|Mesmerising. Beautiful. Flawless. Whatever you want to call 'The Doors' by The Doors, this is without a doubt, the greatest debut album ever made. The Doors are known for taking over the 1960s like a plague, and changing the world before Jim Morrison's death. But before the group's problems set in, they created The Doors, their best record by far. It encompasses everything rock stands for. The Doors rock hard, and the play harder. Their music comes from the heart. They rock everyone's hearts with their lyrics and especially their music. They changed the rock world with this one amazing album that nobody thought would be that big. <br />'Light My Fire' was the group's breakthrough song, but nearly every other song is just as good. 'Break On Through(To The Other Side)' is one of the best tracks, showing The Doors' passion for their music. Soul Kitchen was the first song that immediately caught my attention, but for some reason, I bored of it quickly. That doesn't mean that it's not one of The Doors' best songs, though. 'The Crystal Ship' is an incredible achievement in musicmaking. It is dreamy, delightful, and mysterious. Music is what this song is all about. Not one of their most popular songs, but definitely a favorite among fans. 'Twentieth Century Fox' is a great song, but lackluster on this album. A spectacular chorus is all that holds it together. 'Alabama Song' follows 'Twentieth Centruy Fox' as a poor moment on the album, but if you get in the mood to listen to it, it is still a pretty good song. 'Light My Fire' is the album's most popular moment, but not the best song. I can't help but notes its similarity to 'Soul Kitchen.' 'End of The Night', and'Take It As It Comes' both had serious potential, and are terrific additions to this already incredible album. Take it As It Comes was nearly a hit on scale with 'Light My Fire', but somehow never achieved the same success. 'End of The Night' is enshrouded in eerieness and mystery. It is deifinitely an essential song to the style of The Doors, and it fits in well on the album. The remaining songs are good as well, but the only one worth mentioning would be 'The End'. The eleven minute song is one of the album's highlights, and one of the best \\"ending songs\\" in history. <br />No CD collection is complete without \\"The Doors\\".
B00005PJ6M|4.0|I loved the first one and I think, with the logic and plot of the first one, this follows through. We knew they changed the world, and in this sequel we see that. The actors do a good, since the lead characters are suppose to be, let's say less intelligent, but nice. I think this movie and the 1st one are classics. I like the grim reaper, his atitude during the movie, and the fact the he is the comic relief (okay so most of the movie is comic relief) Even if they are fun to watch to laugh at, it is worth it to watch.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Amazing stuff by Eddie n boys....while ten had 3-4 classics and out of rest some were o.k. some were good...vitalogy has 10 classics...the rest 4 being instrumental..well u can't call them instrumental...they're just for filling up the album...Here's a brief description of their songs:- <br />1 Last Exit-The opening rocker...pretty cool..typical grunge....8.5/10 <br />2 Spin the Black Circle-This rocker won a grammy and is seriously cool..pretty hard n fast..lyrics about eddies love for vinyl 9/10 <br />3 Not for you-Another grunge rocker...the guitars are awesome.9/10 <br />4 tremor christ-a slow n a dark track but nevertheless a classic 9.5/10 <br />5 nothing man-another slow number..not as good as the other tracks 7/10 <br />6 whipping-awesome track with awesome lyrics...hard n fast...9.5/10 <br />7 pry to-a filler 3/10 <br />8 corduroy-pretty cool track with amazing vocals...8.5/10 <br />9 bugs-a filler 5/10 <br />10 satan's bed-good number..not so hard or fast...8/10 <br />11 better man-yo the best track tied up with immortality...the most popular peark jam track..starts off slow then midway turns fast n hard...superb 100000/10 <br />12 aye davanita-a filler 2/10 <br />13 immortality-the best track tied up with better man...slow number but the music n guitars is a clean sweep..lyrics is a tribute to kurt cobain..amazing lyrics...100000/10 <br />14 hey foxy....-a filler 4/10 <br /> <br />all in all a must buy for all pearl jam,grunge,rock n music fans <br />

B00002E224|3.0|Here is a simple fact: Richard Linklater makes the same film over and over again (before you reach for the \\"Unhelpful\\" button, I enjoy his work, this is an observation, not a criticism.) In \\"Slacker\\", a young man wanders around Austin, encountering eccentric people who ruminate about life, love, death, philosophy and culture. In \\"Dazed and Confused\\", eccentric high schoolers cruise around Austin conversing about life, love, death, philosophy and culture (between tokes). In \\"Waking Life\\", a young man wanders around in a perpetually metaphysical dreamworld where he encounters eccentric people who ruminate about life, love, death, philosophy and culture. In \\"Before Sunrise\\", Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy wander around Vienna, encountering eccentric people while they ruminate about life, love, death, philosophy and culture (in between kisses). What you end up with in \\"Before Sunrise\\" is something akin to watching Noam Chomsky and Margaret Meade on a blind date (well, okay, much more attractive versions of Noam Chomsky and Margaret Meade!) Hawke and Delpy both ooze an easy charm that, taken together with the beautiful Vienna setting, makes the film a pleasant enough experience, but it ultimately may be a little too \\"deep\\" for its own good. At least Woody Allen senses when it is time to temper the intellectual observations with a \\"quick yuk\\" to keep the pretension factor reined in. That's why I can watch a romantic comedy like \\"Manhattan\\" again and again-because it stimulates my intellect but also keeps me entertained along the way; Allen does not forget to keep his audience engaged. Linklater's characters tend to talk (and talk...) AT the audience, and that can be ultimately too exhausting. \\"Before Sunrise\\" is definitely worth seeing, but not necessarily worth treasuring.
B000068CNX|4.0|The second season of \\"Friends\\" still provides plenty of laughs even though it veers into more conventional sitcom plotlines that it did during its first season.  There is some silliness over a list that has Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) all steamed when she should be falling in love with Ross (David Schwimmer)-just artificial drama cooked up to postpone the inevitable kiss in the hopes of making it a bigger \\"ahhh\\" moment.  There are also a few stereotypical situation comedy situations based on pulling off some outlandish deception that no one with an ounce of sense could possibly fall for, such as \\"The One With Two Parties\\" (although the writers seem to be acknowledging this when Chandler [Matthew Perry] delivers the great line: \\"I wonder what Jack and Chrissie would do now?\\").  Some unfortunate guest stars don't help matters. <br /> <br />Despite these flaws, there are some great moments as well.  Tom Selleck has a fun and touching recurring role as Monica's (Courtney Cox) older boyfriend, Dr. Richard Burke.  A story arc concerns Joey's (Matt LeBlanc) success on a soap opera and his subsequent decision to move out; Adam Goldberg has a great role as Chandler's psychotic new roommate.  \\"The One With the Prom Video,\\" in which Ross and Rachel finally kiss, is genuinely touching despite all the contrived shenanigans leading up to it. <br /> <br />Just seven more seasons to go.  <br />
B0000046X0|5.0|This album is, in my opinion, the best of RTF. I thought Bill Connors was more musical than Al DiMeola, and that the band did such amazing work on so little by today's equipment standards.<br /><br />In fact I was living in Paris in the early '70s and went to see them play. Their equipment had been held up in customs, so they played with all rented equipment, and the show was phenomenal. It was all about interplay and improvisation, the cornerstones of Jazz music, but with the power and volume of rock music, which is what fusion was about at the beginning...<br /><br />I later wrote to Lenny White and he answered, and I even got together with him and met the other guys on their next European tour. A fantastic bunch, incredible musicians, and this album represents the essence of that band more than any other.
0780622553|5.0|At the intersection of the Twilight Zone and Star Trek's (Original Series) Pilot episode, there is a place called Dark City. The people living there are like rats in a maze, being subjected to an experiment in human behavior by telepathic aliens much like in the Star Trek Pilot. And just like in a Twilight Zone situation, the time is always just about midnight. When the clock strikes twelve, everyone goes to sleep for a few minutes. But not everyone wakes up the same person they were before. Each night the aliens, with the help of a mad scientist (Kiefer Sutherland), switch, swap or rearrange a handful of identities so the aliens can try to understand what makes humans individuals.    The walls of the maze begin to crack when John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) fails to be put to sleep, and his wife (the very lovely Jennifer Connelly) together with a couple police officers (William Hurt) begin to question why their memories are so vague. John also begins to realize he may possess the same telepathic powers as the aliens.    To compare this movie to Blade Runner does neither movie justice. While Blade Runner is an all time \\"pure\\" Sci-Fi great, Dark City really transcends the Sci-Fi genre and impinges on the fantasy / superhero realm. Its stunning visual effects are loads of fun (especially watching what happens when the aliens get killed) and the film is short enough to facilitate repeat viewings without becoming tiresome. Highly recommended and sure to be a cult classic if it isn't already.
1400034779|5.0|This book gives more than what you paid for! It exceeded my expectation. The Marple of Botswana and her bush tea brew a lot of fun for the reader as well as an interesting insight to Africa. It is a fun read and not overloaded with African stereotypes.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Farhenheit 9/11 is a powerful illustration of the appalling antics and politics of the GOP.  Unfortunately, the sensationalism that Moore seeks by selectively including footage that ridicules the GOP will likely prevent the film from reaching a broad audience and effectively educating those who have dismissed it.     <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this series based on all the raving reviews here.  I had never heard of it before.  My husband and I watched an episode a night, and we both got so into this show.  Very well made, great characters.  I miss it!  I bet we'll rewatch the series in a year or so and enjoy it again.  Too bad so many good shows, like this and 'Freaks and Geeks', get cancelled after a season or less.
B000001EL7|5.0|Great CD with a great cover! The songs are great and here are my favorites from Love Gun:     \\"I Stole Your Love\\" I love this song, it totally ROCKS! Everything about it RULES!! 5 stars.     \\"Shock Me\\" Ace's vocal debut and it SMOKES!!!! I've been playing this song alot lately and it's really growing on me all over again. 4 stars.     \\"Tomorrow and Tonight\\" Another anthem but not as good as \\"Let Me Go, Rock 'N Roll or Rock and Roll All Nite\\" but I still enjoy it from time to time. 3 stars.     \\"Love Gun\\" This song has only been dropped from the set-list twice, yes twice since 1977 WOW! I love it, it's one of their best IMO. The cool drum intro get's me going everytime. 5 stars.     \\"Hooligan\\" I really like this song. Written and sung by Peter Criss. I would have loved to heard this 1 again when Peter returned in 96 or even in 2002 but it never happend ;( Still, it will always get 5 stars from me.     \\"Plaster Caster\\" This song is very good, I've played it alot over the years but here as of late I've been skipping it, still a great tune and it get's 4 stars.     Well, those are my faves from Love Gun, be sure to pick this baby up, it's a classic!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I live in Australia and Seinfeld Seaons 1-3 was released here today, a bit earlier than up in the US and let me recommend that if you're undecided about buying Seinfeld put your doubts aside. Looking at the episode reviews on each of the boxes just makes me crack up laughing as I remember some of the classic moments just from a description!! You MUST buy Seinfeld. It is the funniest sitcom EVER!!!!!!!!!!
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Before saying anything else, let me state that this was a fun film to watch, though not much involved real human actors.  Stephen Sommers is clearly one of those directors so enamored with CGI technology that plot and acting get lost in the mix.  The two 'Mummy' films were very similar to 'Helsing', in that effects ruled them rather than storyline.<br /><br />The plot is literally all over the place, with monsters, characters, and geography passing by without much audience notice.  Hugh Jackman really is a fine actor, but you hardly get a chance to see it in this film (wonder how he felt about doing  virtually no acting in the final climactic battle sequence ?); he does a few weapons tricks and some one-liners-that's about it.  Kate Beckinsale looks great (how could she breathe in that corset?), but seems lost among all the flying wirework; like Jackman, she has minimal dialogue.<br /><br />The effects work in 'Van Helsing' is spectacular, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film gets an Oscar nomination in that category.  However, this along with the bombastic soundtrack crowds out what really makes for a good movie: good acting and a competent plot.  The irony is that Sommers eagerly states how much he 'enjoys' writing screenplays for his films (in the extra features).  I just don't see it here or in his other big movies.<br /><br />Nevertheless, 'Van Helsing' is a fun if uninspiring way to spend two hours...
B00005JMXX|5.0|It's a Popcorn film. It's big, it's blustery, and it's a way to while away some time with some great \\"gosh-golly-gee-whiz\\" views and FX.  I thoroughly enjoyed Ian Holm, his performance, as well as various others were typically excellent.  I absolutely love the Cheney clone, and the dig at the view about the \\"Kyoto\\" accord. But if the best that people who claim to be conservatives can say is that it is \\"liberal rubbish\\" ... what I want to know is ... Why do you watch this material ??  If you have a surround sound system, crank up the levels, and this DVD is absolutely great. An absolutely superb ride.    Worth every penny ( Especially at Wally Worlds Prices :-)     AFTER SEEING ALL THE MATERIAL  AGAIN:    How anyone could approach this film as a \\"message\\"  film is beyond me.  The Special  effects are brilliant, and work superbly. And eveything works around the FX. The commentarys do a brilliant job of illuminating how this work came together, and whilst there are elements of a \\"message\\", it is so hidden, as to be irrelevant. There are even notional political elements, but once again, if you watch this movie for some sort of political pot shots, you should really go in for analysis. Its pure ( or, \\"impure\\") entertainment, and thats where it excels  better than most disaster type films that Roland  Emmerich  does. Its not that the Emmerich family can't do decent pieces which have some depth ( FREQUENCY for example), it's just that when a film is done on this scale, they obviously want to make a BIG lot of dollars, so its lowest common denominator time, and its a  rare  film that can do both message, and mega-dollar  deals. This is another of the grand popcorn films. There are sequences in this film that are just eye popping in visual stuns, but if you want illumination about what the world of humans is doing to the planet, search elsewhere... this is a vacation from reality, not a reality tour-de-force.  Anyway, its Damn fine fun, and brilliant at that.
B000063DHL|3.0|After Powerslave, Maiden became too comfortable with themselves and their sound; Bruce Dickinson has acknowledged this.  This explains the reason why this was where Maiden began to lose their edge.  With Paul Dianno, Maiden had established themselves as an aggressive metal band full of truly talented musicians and no-nonsense approach to the genre.  With the classic Dickinson albums, they mixed old-fashioned metal with eloquent lyrics and complex song structures.  While Somewhere in Time is a more progressive album than the previous ones, it often sounds more like a pop-rock album than a heavy metal one. <br /> <br />For Somewhere in Time, Bruce wanted it to be entirely acoustic, but of course that idea fell through.  Having most of his creative ideas rejected, it was really up to Steve and Adrian to make this album what it was.  The title track is good, as is the commercial rocker Wasted Years.  Sea of Madness is the best song on the album, with Bruce's incredible vocals and some great riffing by Dave and Adrian.  The complex guitars and a great melodic section 3/4 of the way through make this the most interesting songs on the album.  Heaven Can Wait has some great lyrics that are killed by the synths and cheesy chorus.  The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner is a somewhat silly song, and Stranger in a Strange Land is bland, despite a great solo by Adrian.  Deja-Vu is a minor song on the album, but also one of the most entertaining.  Alexander the Great wants to be an epic in the style of Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but instead it comes off as a self-parody. <br /> <br />What really stops the album from being a dynamic heavy metal album are the synthesizers, which were put to better use in Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  All of Steve's and Adrian's lyrics are great, but the production of the album stops it from ever sounding as great as it could have sounded.  Instead of adding to the sound, the synths simply wash out the guitars and drums.  The lack of lyricsby Bruce is also a major problem, because he has proven himself to be a great songwriter time and again with songs like Revelations, Powerslave, and 2 Minutes to Midnight. <br /> <br />This is definitely a more commercialized Maiden, and somewhat out-of-touch with their roots.  Unlike albums like Killers and Number of the Beast, which still sound great today, Somewhere in Time sounds very light.  I would put this album somewhere in the middle of Maiden's discography, quality-wise.  Not bad, but definitely not the best.
B000089CJI|5.0|To start off, frankly, this is probably the best thing Ben Gibbard has ever done.  Death Cab for Cutie's a pretty good band, but I think that the Postal Service blows them clear out of the water.  Ben Gibbard's sensitive, saccharine sweet voice sounds much more natural and convincing alongside the ambient electronic music created by Jimmy Tambarello (of Dntel fame) than conventional indie pop/rock.  The chemistry that these two share makes Give Up one of the best and most beautiful albums of 2003.<br /><br />The album's sound is the perfect mix of IDM and indie pop songwriting.  The music and beats are subtle and soothing, and Ben Gibbard's emotive, almost understated vocals compliment the music perfectly.  This is undoubtedly a headphones album, and a great headphones album at that.<br /><br />Give Up starts off incredibly strong, with its best song, \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" leading the way.  Strong melodies, strong lyrics, relaxing atmosphere, and ethereal backing vocals make this track infinitely memorable.  Following it are the album's other stronger tracks, especially \\"Such Great Heights,\\" \\"Clark Gable,\\" and my second favorite on Give Up, \\"This Place is a Prison.\\"<br /><br />Give Up's only real noticeable flaw is the occasional lyrical blunders courtesy of Mr. Gibbard.  Some are pretty cringe-worthy if I do say so myself.  But that hardly detracts from an album as consistently beautiful, catchy, and memorably melodic as Give Up.
B00003CX5P|5.0|First of all, I am fully capable of admiting that this movie has flaws. Every movie has flaws. In fact, this movie had a good number of very impressive flaws that I will now list. <br /> <br />Flaw 1: The acting was (in general) not particularly impressive. It comes down to two catagories of sub-par actors: Jake Loyd, and the supporting cast. Sorry Jake. The \\"Are you an angel\\" scene will make even the most dogmatic Star Wars fan cringe. And all of the supporting cast seemed rather bored. <br /> <br />Flaw 2: Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't quite the horror that many people describe him as, but having said that, he is rather annoying. <br /> <br />Flaw 3: The battle droids. They simply aren't any substitute for the Stormtroopers. They look silly (although in the commentary Lucas says that they're supposed to look that way) and they just don't work very well. <br /> <br />Having recited the flaws that I see in this film, let me explain the five-star rating. <br />When I first watched this movie, I was somewhat dissapointed. However, after watching Episode 2, and having watched this film more, it began to grow on me. And now I can say with confidence that I enjoy this film (Despite its flaws) as much as I enjoy the original trilogy. That's not to say that it is better that the originals, but it has that Star Wars feel, that sense of adventure that we all enjoyed as kids in the original trilogy. And that is why it is worthy of the name: Star Wars. <br /> <br />Many a reviewer previous has stated how they didn't connect with the characters. I disagree. I only think that Jake Loyd, and the supporting cast's acting was sub-par. Ewan McGregor did a fine job as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and although he is no Alec Guiness, he certainly delivers and makes for a splendid Obi-Wan. Ian McDiarmid does a magnificent job as senator Palpatine. He is able to act as a character that is acting, and he does it magnificently. I also like the potrayal of Yoda. In the original trilogy Yoda was introduced asa lunatic old alien. Now he is introduced in the proper way; as a stern old master of the force. I also think that the character of Watto is one of the greatest CGI characters of all time, ranking up there with Gollum from the Lord Of The Rings. <br />But I think that the greatest contribution (acting-wise) to the Star Wars universe in episode 1 was that of Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. Leeson is a magnificent actor, and almost (I dare to say) as good as Alec Guiness in how he potrays a jedi master. Qui-Gon is one of my all time favorite Star Wars characters, and I don't see how anyone could say that the characters of episode 1 don't connect when there's Qui-Gon staring them in the face. <br /> <br />Of course the special effects are brilliant and ahead of their time. The sound is absolutey amazing, and in fact is far superior to the original trilogy. And the soundtrack by John Williams is perhaps the greatest of all the Star Wars soundtracks, because it takes us back to 1977, when we were just discovering Star Wars for the first time. The soundtrack will bring back that sense of wonder that we experienced a long time ago, in a theater far far away. <br /> <br />The action sequences are of course incredible. The duel of the fates between Darth Maul, Obi-Wan, and Qui-Gon is by far the best Star Wars action sequence thus far (Episode 3 anyone?). And then of course there is the podrace. The podrace is one of my all time favorite scenes in all of the Star Wars saga, because it is one of the greatest actions scenes, but also because it is packed with fun details (most of them can only be found on the DVD however). On the DVD you will see a vendor selling alien frogs to patrons as the pods flash by. You will hear one of the pilots of the pods screaming with exhilaration as he zooms past. These and many other details make this scene brilliant. <br /> <br />But the true reason that I am giving this movie five stars (which is an obviously contriversial thing to do) is becauseit conveys the sense of wonder that I had as a kid so long ago when I first watched Star Wars for the first time. People may scorn episode 1 for being too childish, but I think that these people are being too elitist. Chances are that they were kids when they first watched Star Wars, and were swept away by it. On repeat viewings, I too was swept away by this movie, and people that say \\"Too childlike\\" need to slow down. Star Wars is a very bright, energetic saga that appeals to the young and the young at heart. I don't always want to watch a gritty movie with oodles of gore. That's why I love the Phantom Menace. It's a great movie, and if you really liked Star Wars, I would encourage you to give it a chance. <br /> <br />May the force be with you... Always.
B00006GFAB|1.0|A group of old geezers prancing around onstage wearing makeup and silly costumes and lip-syncing to carefully synchronized pop music...is this a Backstreet Boys 30 year reunion tour?  No, its Kiss!  How many \\"greatest hits\\" albums do you possibly need?!?  The same old recycled garbage that was never that good to begin with.  Thank god for Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and the Seattle Sound for blowing all this hair-metal pop straight out of the water.  File Kiss under \\"Washed-up Has-beens\\".
6305897786|4.0|If you have read \\"The Club Dumas\\" by Arturo Perez-Reverte and have seen this film, The Ninth Gate, like me, you are probably wondering why Polanski made so many changes to it.  <br /> <br />The book itself is a lot more complicated than the film, not only are there more characters involved but also has a better storyline. Even though many changes were made to this film, Depp still did an awesome job at portraying Lucas Corso and the storyline was not that bad. I, however, recommend that all you folks out there read the book first, that way you will enjoy this film more.
B000001EAQ|5.0|What you get in U2's \\"Pop\\" is a bolder, louder, more experimental version of U2's Nineties work.  In many ways, this album surpasses \\"Acthung Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa\\", more musically diverse, and is perhaps the grand epitome of ZooTV.  Whereas U2's previous albums were an experimentation in pop-rock, this album (depite its tongue-in-cheek title) is unhibited in blending bolder rock riffs with a lush electronic soundscape.  The remarkable \\"Do You Feel Loved?\\" alone is worth the price of this CD.
B000059QYB|3.0|Where Billy Idol's place in rock history will fall is hard to say, but he did have a few memorable songs from the late '80's to the early '90's. This cd basically contains every song from Idol that you would like to own. Flesh for Fantasy, White Wedding, Rebel Yell, Dancing With Myself, Mony Mony and Hot in the City represent all of the classic Idol tracks. However, to this day I still believe the best track that Billy ever laid down was Eyes Without a Face. The song works on so many levels and is such a distinct break from his normal pop formula that it envelopes the listener. Structured with an amazing bass line, a heavy guitar break and those computerized claps this song simply blows away anything else he ever produced. Anyway, this is a great way to catch up on your vital Idol and a fine addition to any rock collection. Recommended.
0812550706|5.0|this boook is really good i just read this book a couple of months ago and now im riting a review... well if your looking for a action book look no further this book is action packed with great discriptios in battle leaving u hanging and wanting more. i am a very avid reader and i review mostly childerens books because i am still a child (kinda)  <br />your freind, <br />darippy9324
B00003CXCT|4.0|I have loved the Star Wars TRILOGY since I was a grade school kid when the first film came out in 1977.  I honestly didn't mind the changes made in 1997.  Perhaps they were a bit more show-offish than adding any real meat and potatoes to the story, but they weren't a major distraction for me.  What IS a real distraction is adding Hayden Christensen to the ending of Jedi.  This so-called 'actor' gives the most wooden, amateurish performances I've seen in ages, so adding even the slightest reminder of this goofball to the 3 classic films is absolutely abhorrent to me.  In my universe, the overly kidified advertisements for Star Wars playsets known as episode one and two don't exist so adding a reminder of them to the tasty portion of the movie series is a serious low blow from Darth Lucas.  Don't throw away your old VHS copies of the films if you have like-minded sentiments about the films.
B000000P17|5.0|Great CD, but too many fillers... My personal favs are New Rose, Down On The Farme, Ain't It Fun, Hair Of The Dog and Attitude. More or less ones are Since I Don't Have You and Buick Makane. The rest are ... meh
B0002858YS|4.0|So The Killers have astounded me.  A theme that runs through my reviews is that I impulse buy.  These turn out to be the best choices, ultimately.  Again, upon listening to this I found it wasn't too exciting.  Well, the first song that is.  The more I went through, the more I found.  There are some sour spots, a couple of them are slow and the long synth notes strike a chord in my head that makes me hurt...but the bulk of the album is exciting and definitely worth the listen and the buy. <br /> <br />Tracks worth your time: <br /> <br />Mr. Brightside - You know this song, it's on the radio.  It is one of their best, and it never fails to make me stop, listen, and sing along. <br /> <br />Somebody Told Me - The other song you know.  The lyrics sound funny...but once you get past that, it's infectious, engaging, and pretty.  Great song. <br /> <br />All These Things I've Done - A VERY interesting song.  The bridge is amazing, \\"I've got soul but Im not a soldier\\" just sings on and on, with voices and ranges being added before soaring back into the chorus.  Definitely one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />This album was released in June, and in my record store it is RISING in the Top 25.  That should say something.  Get this.
B0002KPIQY|4.0|Angelina Jolie was great in this film.  She has a truely magnificent rack.  They kept me mezmorized just starring and worndering what it would be like to be there, with those perfect pectoral specimens.  A great watch, just need the pause button a lot!
B00005JNEI|1.0|Moore's film makes some great jokes and touches the heart in many areas.  The problem is that he relies on these methods to make his point and not on careful analysis of evidence and well-constructed arguments.  He frequently takes Bush's words out of context, and not only those, but also the words of the other people whose interviews appeared in his movie.  Out of a wide variety of evidence, he selects the pieces of evidence that fit his point of view and presents only those.  A good example of this would be the frequent appeal to personal testimony to undergird his arguments, picking only the stories of those people who would agree with him anyway, without giving anyone with a different point of view any time to speak at all.  The voices of people who disagree with Bush's policies are given far more time in the movie than Bush's own words, which is a problem when one considers the fact that this is a movie about Bush.  We rarely see clips of Bush speaking more than a few words at a time, much less complete paragraphs; how are we supposed to understand what Bush is saying in each instance without understanding the context in which Bush originally spoke?  Instead of that context, Moore provides his own context and covers up his lack of scholarship with hilarious jokes and attacks on Bush's character.  Emotive appeals and ad hominem attacks like these are quite effective in convincing people to believe what you say, even if you have very little evidence for what you are saying. <br /> <br />If you still aren't convinced, put yourself in the shoes of someone who wants to make a propaganda film supporting Bush.  Take Bush's opponents' words out of context and re-contextualize those words in funny and catchy ways to make THEM look like they have poor character.  Interview hundreds of people and then include only the interviews of the people who agree strongly with your point of view.  Make sure, at the end, that you have video clips of Saddam's soldiers committing horrible atrocities and laughing over their own crimes as if it's all a big joke.  (Be sure not to include the behavior of any soldiers who actually seem to conduct themselves in a moral way.) <br /> <br />I'll buy this movie because I think it's important for my middle school students to understand the methods used in propaganda, hopefully so they can avoid them rather than practicing them.  And in the end, it does have the redeeming quality of being absolutely hilarious.
B000002J09|5.0|Radio saturation of nearly every track on this record may jade some listeners into underappreciating just what a landmark album \\"IV\\" actually was.  After getting the somber, acoustic vibe out of their system on the last album it was all systems go for the Page/Plant tandem, and what a one-two punch this one starts out with.  \\"Black Dog\\" practically invented Whitesnake's entire oeuvre with it's demonic boogie riff and Plant's piercing shrieks, sex, violence and all manner of ritualistic hedonism smelted together into a cast iron monolith to perfection.  Before \\"Rock and Roll\\" was relegated to automobile spots it put forth the notion:  \\"what if crack had been invented back in Jerry Lee Lewis' heyday\\"?  The fact that such an irrepressible hallelujah (you can't tell me this song isn't a spiritual experience) was created out of fairly sober minds (ok, there was the coke) is a tribute of the love for the genre these British lads proffered back in the day. <br /> <br />Proving \\"III\\" wasn't a fluke or botched experiment, \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" close out side one with ponderous odes to the band's Celtic heritage (the former) and God only knows (the latter).  Lyrically \\"Evermore\\" is most akin to \\"The Immigrant Song\\", a Viking paeon from \\"III\\" that also ripped the paint off the walls, whereas \\"Evermore\\" is a gentler exploration of ancient British epic tales.  On the other hand, scholars will be debating for centuries on the precise meaning of \\"Stairway\\" (I'd be satisfied with just narrowing down that \\"bustle in your hedgerow\\" business) but what is absolutely incontrovertible is it's significance in rock history, it's eternal place on \\"all time top 10\\" lists, and it's banishment from the ambience of guitar shops. <br /> <br />We're back in business on side two, opening with the breezy jam \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\", another flowers-in-their-hair anthem to unrestrained pleasure gratification.  \\"Four Sticks\\" is another solid mid-tempo rocker showcasing Bonham's mastery of the skins while \\"Going to California\\" is an acoustic ballad which would also fit right at home on \\"III\\".  Finally, Zep wrap it up with possibly the finest song on the album - and certainly one of the best of their career - an absolutely brain-mauling trawl through the blues staple \\"When the Levee Breaks\\".  Plant's vocals bend, shriek, scrape, and soar through seven minutes of guitar sludge, intersticed with resounding harp moans echoing the browbeaten but defiant cries of the narrator.  Simply astounding, heart shaking melodrama.  Whoever said \\"always leave 'em wanting more\\" certainly got through to the boys in Led Zeppelin.
B000002UB3|5.0|Equal with ok computer that is. <br />Beautiful baroque pop and the best the beatles did. <br />RE the reviewer below the guy rates clay aitken so we can safely disregard his 'review' as he doesn't know music. <br />And the one before I really think the members of zep would agree on the beatles superiorty. <br />nuff said..
B000000W5N|4.0|but im sure they were on drugs when they made these songs, so i cant give em 5 stars/.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I can describe this movie with one word.  S***.  However, I feel it is my duty to explain why this movie is crap.  Should I start with the horrible plot, or maybe the demented scribbles they call monsters.  No, I think it would be best to start with Van Helsing himself.  Van Helsing has no trace of any originality.  He is instead peiced together by several other action heroes.  He looks like he tried to dress like \\"Indiana Jones\\" and failed, he has the gadgets of \\"James Bond\\" along with the incredibly boring debreifing scenes, and has the personality of \\"Hellboy\\" except in dork form.<br /><br />Van Helsing is played by Hugh Jackman, but he isn't the only good actor here.  You also have Kate Beckinsale from Underworld, and... a bunch of people nobody who sees this movie will know.  Because they hired an A+ cast there should be some decent acting, right?  Wrong!  It seems as though the director wanted them to act like a group of third graders puting on a school play.  So instead of good acting you'll have bad one liners and some of the worst Transylvanian accents you ever heard.<br /><br />However since this is the director of the mummy the special effects should be good.  Wrong again.  Just about every monster or effect has been over done and doesn't look all that scary or exciting.  So what was supposed to be monsters looks instead like they asked a demented five year old to scribble on the film.  One good example is dracula himself.  Dracula is supposed to turn into a bat, right?  Well according to this movie he turns into a giant pink blob with wings and a snout.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention the plot.  Well apperntly, when Van Helsing was twenty he was a vampire hunter with, guess what, amnesia.  His job was to hunt down Dracula who seems to know him from somewhere.  Along the way he runs into this warrior princess who must kill Dracula or she won't get into heaven.  From there the plot goes on, but it doesn't make any sense and is about as dull as a bag of dirt.  However, Van Helsing seems to need to bring this dirty friar, and there seems to be a full moon every night in Transylvania.  Another thing is that Van Helsing doesn't seem to want to kill Dracula and nobdoy else wants him too either, so why is he doing it.  Maybe he's nuts, maybe this pope guy has it in for him, I don't know.<br /><br />Frankly all this movie does is insult Dracula and moviegoers in general.  Unless you enjoy torturing yourself or have about as many brain cells as a lawn chair, avoid this movie at all costs.g of dirt.

B00008ADPF|4.0|Ok, so maybe it's not as good as Silver Side Up, but the boys of Nickelback had a HUGE task in front of them to top that masterpiece, and they did pretty well. Most of the tracks are good, but unfortunatly I got the limited editon version which goes on WAY TOO LONG i.e after track 11, I start to get REALLY bored.  <br /> <br />Flat on the floor...(Very faced paced, with an awesome chorus. One of the best on the album 9/10) <br /> <br />Do this Anymore...(The beginning is kinda slow, but it kicks in pretty quick with killer verses and an ultra-catchy chorus. Probably one of my favorite songs By Nickelback, period 10/10) <br /> <br />Someday...(Way too overplayed, expecially on Mtv. At first I really liked it, but now I usually skip over to Believe it or not 8/10) <br /> <br />Believe it or Not...(The verses are kinda slow and repetitive, but the chorus is great 8/10) <br /> <br />Feelin way too damn good...(Very well sung, with a nice, melodic ring to it. It has the kinda chorus that'll get you singing along once you learn the words too, which is always a plus 8/10) <br /> <br />Because of you...(The chorus on this one seems almost perfect, right up until the end. The thing is, they try to jam too many words into too little time, and the result is an almost ugly sound. Minus that little detail, its a great song 8/10) <br /> <br />Figured You Out...(The second single, and totally stupid lyrically. Still, it's pretty catchy 7/10) <br /> <br />Should've listened...(The fact that I can't remember how it goes tells me right away that it's forgetable. Too be fair, I wont grade it n/a) <br /> <br />Throw Yourself Away...(Its got a very \\"Nickelback\\" sound, which is a good thing. The lyrics are pretty heavy too, kinda like \\"Never Again\\" from silver side up 9/10)  <br /> <br />Another Hole In The Head...(For some reason, the chorus really stands out for me on this one. That alone makes it worth listening to 8/10) <br /> <br />See you at the show...(Great (offical) closer. Thechorus is great, the verses are great, and the song is very catchy. The lyrics are kinda dumb tho 8.5/10) <br /> <br />The Other 3 Songs...I don't really listen to these, at all. But the first time I heard \\"Learn the hard way\\" (track 13), I was pretty impressed.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|For sheer chutzpah, alone, I'm tempted to give Michael Moore five stars. (Anyone with cojones that big surely ought to win an Academy Award for a film like this.) <br /> <br />However, if you're looking for truth you won't find it in Moore's \\"crockumentary.\\" All you'll get here is Michael Moore doing what Michael Moore does best: promote Michael Moore. <br /> <br />To see how far Moore's film is from reality, check out the Dick Morris film Farenhype 9/11. Or read the book \\"Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man\\" by David T. Hardy and Jason Clarke. <br /> <br />There. I've spent enough time considering Michael Moore. I think I'll go do something more worthwhile -- like scrub the soap scum off the walls of my shower.
B0002S64OG|5.0|My youngest son is 8 months old and sits attentively watching the entire show every time I play it.  Though he has other baby videos, this one consistently seems to keep his attention best.  And my older son, who's 2 1/2 years old, likes to watch too.  (Interestingly, there's an option to play this video either with or without animations.  They say that the youngest babies like to watch only \\"real world\\" toys -- but as kids get older, they begin to like watching animations also.  I don't know about other families - but that's definitely been true for my boys.)  There's also a \\"Parent Nursery\\" section for parents to watch.  It talks about how parents can teach reading, math, language and music concepts to their children at a very young age, in a fun and encouraging way (not at all \\"pushy\\"), which I found very informative.  I try my best to be as active as possible with my kids, and Baby and Parent Nursery is a big help.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B0001ADAVK|2.0|Well the problem I have with this piece is: It is a \\"time period\\" critical movie. It is already a known fact that in Hollywood, Editors and Casting Directors don't get the credit they are deserved. Let me re-phrase that, a whole lot of <br />bad pre and post production croonies make a bad name for the few good ones. <br />Here is a period piece set in 1953-54 and the casting of Julia Roberts was atrocious! Clearly she was another \\"superstar\\" household name, compounded with other household's as Julia Stiles and Kristen Dunst the (Matt Damen and Ben Afleck) of <br />the female screen gems. Mrs. Julia doesn't look any more retro than 1996 throughout the entire film, every time she's on the screen you completely forget that this story is set 50 Years Ago! Normally I wouldn't care... but the fact the movie makes a point of how women aspired to be housewives in the mid 50's and very little else and how you should break the shackles of that.... might make a lot of sense to keep her ALWAYS reminding <br />you what year this is and how surpressing those times were on women. But no, \\"don't touch my ever precious hair\\"... she couldn't even cut her hair to \\"look\\" the part. It's a joke - the story is formula... \\"take a subject - beat that subject up -beat up some more - subject prevails at the end - roll credits. it's funny, the layman HATED letterbox un-formatted movies <br />no less than 5 years ago, now 10 thousand dollar televisions only come in 16:9 format! and those same people will now only accept \\"widescreen\\" movies... but if you secretly invade <br />their VHS colection, every movie was full screen format! When will these same people who convienently converted also stop accepting formula hollywood movies? Drull - Drull - Drull.
B00005JNEU|5.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" is the true story of the 1988 Odessa-Permian high school football team and their quest for the state championship.  They are one of the best teams in West Texas, and Friday nights are for high school football.  Everything in town stops so that all can go to the game.  Tremendous pressure is put on the kids and the coaches to win.  The star of the team is James \\"Boobie\\" Miles (Luke), a cocky kid who definately believes all the hype about him until a early season knee injury turns his world on end.  Stepping up to fill the void are quarterback Mike Winchell (Black) and running backs Don Billingsley (Hedlund) and Chris Comer (Young).  But will they have what it takes to fill that void?  Coach Gary Gaines (Thornton) thinks so, and as the season moves on, he finds himself receiving both the love and the hatred of the town depending on whether they are winning or losing.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in this movie, both on and off the field, and the story flows smoothly back and forth.  After all, everything going on off the field is still football related, and plays into the story quite prominently.  Running through it all is the immense pressure to win.  This is not your typical sports movie, and the final game drives home the point of the whole movie.  This is a very good movie, with solid performances all around, expecially by the mostly unknow actors playing the kids.  This movie is for anyone who has ever been involved in the phenomenon of high school football.  For those people, it will strike a real chord.  For everyone else, it will still be an enjoyable, emotional experience that should not be missed.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Well... The last month all I was listening to was the S/T by Slipknot. Nothing can beat that one. I heard alot of crap about the new album and I thought why not get it just to hear em out... I was pretty blown away. It's interesting reading reviews on their new album but I think they headed towards a better direction. This is way better then IOWA but it cant beat the self titled. I do have a problem though... No swearing?!?! What happened to that F*** it all attitude... Man... But either way this is a very very good album. I thought I'd hate it... But I like acoustic songs so I do like circle and Vermillion part 2. I just hope these guys are around to make another album... the so called maggots who said this album sucks don't even realize that this album was made for ... THE MAGGOTS... They couldve ended this with IOWA but came back for the maggots but oh well... sell out whatever... trust me... if you were offered a million bucks to do something you'd do it... then again... how did they sell out? they just grew like almost every other band... do you honestly wanna buy albums by bands such as (bleeding through) and listen to every song and not get bored? SOme people like that but then some don't.  <br /> <br />the things that are missing in this album are... the funkyness... the out of no where in your face rapping.. well still good album...
B000021XR5|5.0|Ah, Stone temple plots. A band so overlooked it's almost painful to talk about; while Nirvana and Pearl Jam were in the top of the grunge scene, the STP were seen as \\"copycats\\" and dismised as so by many. This happens to this day, i might add, even when the artistic merits of the band shine even more when looking in retrospective. <br />  But, time passed, grunge faded, and yet they kept pumping out great albums. \\"Core\\" was raw, crunchy, top notch, unwatered grunge; \\"Purple\\" felt more like Led Zeppelin, and was a collection of music so good that it's hard to beleive it's a second album and not a hit-singles collection. \\"Tiny...\\" was more experimental and some people disliked it, but hey, even the Beatles were allowed to have such a stage. And \\"Shangri-la-dee-da\\" (their weakest, but still excellent) is a mixed bag of everything that came before. <br /> <br />  And in the middle, there was \\"No. 4\\". <br /> <br />  First of all, it's a darker album. Not in the sound, exactly, but in the whole feeling of it - specially when contrasted with, say, \\"Purple\\". Even the ballads like \\"I got you\\" and \\"Sour girl\\" have that sad, melancholic feeling. The rockers are raw and furious and remind of the earlier Core days, but again, they just feel.. well, darker. Not to mention the closer, \\"Atlanta\\", Door-esque, sad and touchy. On a first listen, it doesn't strike like much, and it might even be a bit of a downer. <br />  But then again, most great albums do that. <br /> <br />  \\"No. 4\\" is rock and roll in it's rawest form. Of course, you'll get your ballads and mid-tempos, but the album is dominated by crunchy guitars, hard hitting drums and solid basslines. \\"Down\\", the opener, it's the perfect example of this; and when paired with songs like \\"Heaven and hot rods\\" (one of the best rock riffs i've heard to this day), and \\"Pruno\\" you just can't help to want to shake your head to the rythm. The album alternates between hard rockers and softer songs like the country-esque \\"I've got you\\"and the very gentle \\"Sour girl\\", but as a whole, it feels rock. Good rock, the kind that stucks in your head and makes you hum as you walk by. I don't know if this is their best, but on the long run is their most addictive. <br /> <br />  If you like STP, you already have it. If you're into rock, you should not skip on this one - try some clips, and if that doesn't convince you, borrow or download it and give it a listen. This is modern rock as good as it gets.
B0002SROT0|4.0|I never write reviews but i figure since this is the guys last hoo-rah, couldnt hurt. He was an amazing songwriter. This album does not disappoint. I'm not even through listening and yet tracks such as 'twilight' and 'a fond farwell' leave thier stamp nicely. Seems like he was feeling a little experimental. Ultimatley he gives a little from all his albums on this one. A must for E.S. fans as i'm sure they all know. He'll be missed.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|Movies like the Matrix typically divide humanity into those who love it, and those who don't. After watching the first in the trilogy, I must confess that I fell into the first camp. It was novel, it had electrifying action sequences, and it promised much more than the average sci-fi flick. Now that all three parts have come out and the end has finally been seen, I have moved to the middle ground: I don't love it, I don't hate it, but I don't know what to make of it. <br /> <br />For those of you who haven't been on this planet for the last four years, the Matrix (1999) is the story of a world taken over by machines. What people see as `reality' is in fact a computer-created matrix, a dream state that lulls human beings into submission. The machines have plugged the brains of humans into the Matrix to make sure that people believe that they are capable of free thought and action. <br />The real world is in fact a horrible place that is ruled by machines which incubate and cultivate human beings for energy. A few humans have managed to escape the machines and have set up a colony underground, called Zion. <br /> <br />The third part, The Matrix Revolutions, came out this month, presumably because, as Agent Smith says, \\"Everything that has a beginning, has an end\\". The sequels were shot simultaneously in Australia over a 270-day stretch from 2001 to 2002. It had to survive the death of the original Oracle (Gloria Alice, who died of diabetes at the age of 64, and had to be replaced for the Revolutions by Mary Alice). Not much is known about the Wachowski Brothers, Andy and Larry, who have elevated taciturnity to an art form. The official production notes for the original Matrix mysteriously only explained that the Brothers \\"have been working together for more than 30 years. Little else is known about them.\\" Both supposedly dropped out after two years in College, returned to their native Chicago, and set up a house-painting and construction business while writing for Marvel Comics. <br /> <br />Although it is rumoured that the Brothers never disagree, both the cast and crew have insisted that they are not some two-headed monster. They are said to be voracious readers, and fans of the Princeton philosophy professor Cornel West, most famous for his work on race. Larry Wachowski's literary preferences are allegedly philosophical while Andy tends to read more science fiction. If that is not difference enough, Larry's tipple is wine, whereas Andy's poison is beer. <br /> <br />The story of how the Brothers bagged the right to direct the Matrix is the stuff of pure Hollywood legend. After their first script, Carnivore, about some rich people being eaten by cannibals, whacky enough to get them noticed but not filmed, the Brothers managed to get Warner Brothers to buy their second script called Assassins. Differences with the film's director Richard Donner pushed them to try to get their names removed from the credits (unsuccessfully). Amidst all this drama, they found time to narrate the Matrix's plot to Warner Brothers mogul Joel Silver who liked the idea till he heard that the Brothers wanted to direct it as well. <br /> <br />Fortunately, he gave them $6 million to see if they could direct a movie. The result was a Bound, a caper featuring two lesbians trying to steal from the mob. The movie acquired cult status amongst the art-movie crowd and the Wachowskis were on the road. The rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br />The Wachowski Brothers pioneered what has been known since as \\"bullet time\\" - first seen in the Matrix where the central character dodges bullets as the camera follows him 360 degrees. It has been copied ad nauseum since, in such movies as Charlie's Angels, Shrek, Spiderman, and Scary Movie. It was even used by Fox during its telecast of the Superbowl! <br /> <br />Another key innovation has been \\"virtual cinematography,\\" which melds the real and the computer generated into one seamless whole. It relies on the use of five high-resolution digital cameras strong enough to pick up minute details like pores and follicles on the skins of actors while they perform. This process is called \\"u-cap\\", short for universal capture. All this information is then fed into a computer, where a complex algorithm calculates the actor's appearance from every single angle the cameras missed. After this is done, whole events can be created without them looking like they have been computer-generated. <br /> <br />The Wachowski Brothers' true contribution, and perhaps only one, so far, has been the pushing of the technology bar even higher. It is hard to argue that the Matrix trilogy has much by way of plot, or insight despite aficionados (or nuts, depending on your point of view) attempting to play up supposed allusions to Judeo-Christian myth, Zen, and such other profundities. The acting is largely indifferent. Reeves' limitations as an actor are effectively hidden in the first part as he has to act slightly befuddled. But given that befuddlement is his permanent expression, it was bound to be exposed in the other two parts. Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a caricature of his original role in Revolutions, and added girth is the least of his worries. This is a terrible pity given his brilliant performance in the first part where he carries the movie on his shoulders alone. Carrie-Ann Moss is wasted - her intensity could have been put to much better use if the Wachowskis invested some of the money they spent on technology on such old-fashioned ideas as character development. Hugo Weaving is the only actor to emerge with his dignity intact - his diabolical \\"Misster Anderson\\" sears itself on the mind just as much as his twisted smile does. <br /> <br />If there is one tribute to be paid, it is to the casting director, for a wonderfully ethnically diverse cast. If this is a sign that Hollywood is finally waking up to the reality that other races exist, it is a welcome one. Otherwise, as I trudged out after the final scene had played itself out, strangely enough to a novel version of \\"Asatoma Sat Gamaya\\" in the background, I still didn't know why the machines needed humans to produce energy. Maybe the Wachowski Brothers believe that we are brainless, just like their humans in the Matrix!
0441172717|5.0|Herbert's Dune is a brilliant masterpiece of science fiction writing that combines the realities of our world and places them in a universe far in the future.   <br /> <br />Herbert delivers on a broad range of inteconnected topics including ecology, environmental policy, religious belief and fanaticism, the power of the mind, and real politics. <br /> <br />Herbert's Dune, the planet Arrakis, mirrors the reality of the modern Middle East.  Dune is the only place in the universe that produces the spice melange (oil?) and that spice is intertwined with a group of dessert dwelling \\"jihad\\" yelling religious fanatics who believe all non-believers must be killed.  Sound familiar? <br /> <br />What makes Herbert's Dune especially orignial is the fact that in the Dune universe, computers have been outlawed, by a jihad no less, and all complicated computations are tackled by super-trained human minds. <br /> <br />Dune is one of the most interesting and entertaining reads.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is undoubtedly my favorite book/movie of all time. Clockwork Orange is not only a story to me but a lifestyle. Not only does it tell stories of the old \\"ultra-violence,\\" but it teaches many moral lessons. Some of the greatest bands have also followed the lead of A Clockwork Orange. This is the greatest Anthony Burgess creation. Grab some moloko plus and put on the lovely lovely Ludwig van and read this classic Anthony Burgess novel.
B0000640VO|5.0|What an enchanting little movie this is! Amelie is almost a genre unto itself. Not content to just be a funny movie, or a movie about the thrill of new love, it combines both and mixes in a heaping helping of strangeness and random meaningless events to pull together a lovely picture of life as it really can be. It's harnessing all the meaningless little things of daily life into the swirling coherence of your life.<br /><br />In the big picture, I guess Amelie could be considered a romantic comedy, but it is so much more. It's a surreal slice of a France that alternately does and does not exist. It's the deep meaning of it all, as well as the utter meaninglessness of day-to-day life.<br /><br />Visually, it is a stunning achievement. If you pay attention to adults, or watch an hour of HGTV you'll soon realize that for some reason when most people grow up, their favorite colors somehow become tan and off-white. Amelie's world is one of color and joy, even in sadness. It's a world of hyper-natural color... the type of world within which every child would love to live.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou brought to life one of the singlemost memorable characters in movie history with her role as Amelie. The writing here is great, unique, and funny, but there is so much hilarious stuff Audrey can do just with a look that this still could have been an entertaining movie even if the writing had been much less inventive and funny. I recently picked up Dirty Pretty Things almost solely because Audrey is one its main characters. After Amelie, I just had to see her in more movies.<br /><br />If director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is ever able to top Amelie, that movie will certainly be another of the best films ever made.<br /><br />Experience Amelie for yourself. You've never seen anything like it.
0515127485|5.0|I have not read either ENIGMA or FATHERLAND, the author's two previous books; thus I can offer no comparisons of this novel to those highly praised volumes of historical fiction. However, this suspenseful, action filled historical thriller indicatives the impressive breadth of his storytelling abilities. ARCHANGEL is a very thoughtful, well constructed book which I highly recommend for readers who appreciate complex plots and are willing to allow the author the time necessary to provide the background details required to create an aura of realism. If the reader accepts the premise on which this novel is based, the historical speculations at the crux of the story all logically follow and there is sufficient character development to bring the main actors to life.<br /><br />The book begins with a relatively brief prologue, entitled \\"Rapava's Story\\", in which Papu Rapava, one of Josef Stalin's bodyguards at the time of his death in 1953, relates a story regarding the existence of a secret personal notebook of Stalin covered in a black oilskin which had never been discovered subsequent to his death. The fascinated listener is Fluke Kelso, an historian who had never lived up to the early promise displayed by his book exhibiting the courage to critize Commmunism and the horrors perpetuated by Stalin's regime during a period \\"when every other useful idiot in academia was screching for detente\\". Part One of the story then takes place in Moscow, and is centered around a mid-1990's symposium which Kelso is attending with other Sovietologists to discuss the historical archives of Communism being cataloged and released by the Russian government following the break up of the Soviet Union. The complicated nature of that period, the introduction to freedom so foreign to the Russian poplace, the promise of economic change and the inevitable corrution which accompanied such change, and the political crosscurrents (especially the yearning of the Stalinists for a return to the \\"order\\" of the past) all are wonderfully captured and form the backstory for this intriguing tale. In this section the reader is also introduced to three of the key supporting characters in this alternative history. First, Zanaida Rapava, Papu's estranged  daughter and a thoroughly moden Russian woman. Second, Vladimir Mamantov, a Commmunist party member who Kelso first met after he led a failed coup against Prsident Gorbachev. Last, O'Brian, a reporter for a satellite television news service who won't let go of what he believes could be the biggest story of his career.<br /><br />The notebook eventually points to the fact that the answer to the mystery of Stalin's obsession lies in the city of ARCHANGEL in northern Russia. Thus, the action in the second and concluding part of the story builds to a climax in this remote, frozen area bordering on the arctic circle. While by this time some readers might have guessed the central element of the plot and the secret of the notebook, the eventual outcome is impossible to deduce until the very last page. Meanwhile, we are treated to wonderful details of the desolation of this area of Russia and fascinating insights into the character of Stalin.<br /><br />This book includes wonderful historical detail, and Beria, Malenkov and other figures of the period are cleverly interwoven into the fabric of the story. In addition, the detailed touches add to the realism of the story, such as Zinaida's refusal to \\"trust the banks, either-- thieving alchemists, the lot of them, who would take your precious dollars and conjure them into rubles, turn gold into base metal\\". The mood of the city of Moscow and a Russia in transition are captured very well, and this setting provides the perfect backdrop for Fluke Kelso's search for personal and professional vindication through the dicovery of \\"something true and big and defintive -- a piece of history that would explain why things had happened as they did\\". Finally, in some ways this section is aboutKelso's realization of how many elements of the story have in some way been touched by the power of love in its many manifestations.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and only want to provide a few minor caveats. First, as you might expect there is a reasonable amount of violence and torture which is occasionally described in some detail althogh never gratuituosly; there is also a great deal of profanity which revolves around the almost continual use of one particular expression.  My only substantive criticism is that the conclusion, while totally satisfactory in keeping with the remainder of the story, is in some ways so shocking and abrupt that unless the author is planning a sequel, he should have written a prologue to bring closure to his readers regarding the few questions which remain unanswered, especially regarding its impact upon Kelso.<br /><br />Tucker Andersenis about Kelso's realization of how many elements of the story have in some way been touched by the power of love in its many manifestations. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, and only want to provide a few minor caveats.

B00005JMXX|4.0|Ok...I see all the negative reviews on here and people forget what movies are all about - entertainment!  I thought this movie while not the best storyline or acting was entertaining to say the least.  Its a 2 hour movie but you never get that when is this going to end feeling....the first hour is really good with the storyline strictly on the event..the 2nd hour turns into a story of survival for a group of people hiding in the NY library. <br /> <br />The special effects are great and the footage of news reporters describing the disaster gives an authentic look at what could happen in the future in our world.   <br /> <br />The only part I found a bit over the top was the wolves chasing the 3 guys as they go for medicine...that was a bit much....but overall I was entertained by the movie and thought it was a good two hours of fun. <br /> <br />Sela ward is really attractive - nice little role for her.
B000063S6Z|2.0|Sure, Moby's terrific.  Very talented.  If only he'd put that talent to use on this album.  Many of the tracks are just droning synth strings, some with bland and boring vocals.  It's as if he stood in front of his keyboard, punched in strings or pads, and leaned on a few major chords for 3 or 4 minutes and called it a song.  Come on, man, we're paying for these discs.  As always, I uploaded the CD to my computer, but out of the 18 tracks I copied only 8 that I thought were worth repeat listens.  Surprisingly, the best tracks were the ones where Moby sings -- and he's not a great singer.  Bottom line is I guess I'm glad bought it, but at the same time I feel a bit cheated cheated and let down.  Start with his other albums, like Play, first.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I'm tired of hearing people say this movie was terrible. True, many elements of the full story are missing, but what were you expecting? The full story of the Trojan War could not be told in a trilogy, let alone one film. I think the film maker made a wise choice in dispensing with the gods; that would have only complicated what is basically a three-hour film. And to all those that say Brad Pitt was miscast: you're full of it. I'm not a huge fan of his, but his performance was exactly the way I would want to see Achilles portrayed--arrogant, extremely skilled, handsome, often brutal, yet with a heart under all that armor. So to sum up, while Troy might disappoint people wanting the Iliad, I believe this film has the heart of Homer's tale through and through, even if it's from a different perspective. In all, it's impossible to satisfy people who think no detail should be left out, but if you want that, read the Iliad. It's better than the movie, but the film itself is very well done for those with an open mind and an understanding of the mindset of such men.
B00005JNEI|5.0|What we learned from this movie...and what it inspired us to find out from even braver writers and directors: <br /> <br />1 Bush lost the popular election. He probably lost Florida until <br />his buddies in the Supreme Court put a stop to the recount. His inauguration nearly cause a riot. <br /> <br />2 His oil friends planned the Iraq war even before 9/11. We know that Iraq is the second largest oil reserve. Bush's cabinet (Rumsfeld, Powell, Cheney, etc.) supported Saddam through his worst atrocities and never repented. They continue to support evil dictators who crush pro democracy movements (in African and Asia). Their credibility is zilch. <br /> <br />3 The President and the media lied to us about WMD, democracy in Iraq and how the Iraqis would greet us with flowers (not bombs). <br /> <br />4 They lied about Saddam's ties to 9/11 and Al Qaeda (who were Saddam's bitter enemies.) THER WERE NONE. <br /> <br />5. As Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges said it is \\"simply unbelievable how the war has revived the appeal of a global jihadi Islam that was in real decline after 9-11.\\" Recruitment for the Al Qaeda networks increased, while Iraq itself became a \\"terrorist haven\\" for the first time. <br /> <br />6 Up to 50,000 civilians  have been killed to establish military base in the Mid East. They and most of the world now dislike us for being ruthless thugs... according to many recent polls (I know we are not!) <br /> <br />7 Bush has been giving our money back to his rich friends (what he calls his \\"base\\") through \\"tax cuts\\" for the rich and the economy has tanked. <br />
0156027321|5.0|This novel is a joy to read.  The prose flows so naturally and beautifully, developing a story that is as vivid as it is unique.  There was alot of talk about the twist in this novel but, like a Shyamalan film, this novel is not about the twist and anyone who approaches it expecting a grand revelation risks being disappointed.  Savor every page instead, because writing like this is hard to come by.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|In the context of today's music I would rate Reality a 5 star recording, but obviously compared to past Bowie classics like Hunky Dory etc I cannot.  I bought Heathen a couple years ago and really liked it quite quickly.  When Reality came out so soon afterward I had to buy it based on hearing and quite liking Heathen but I admit my expectations were low....Without being long-winded I'll put it plain and simple: this album requires many, many repeated listens.  If you have the patience to do that, you will slowly start to love this album.  Happy listening.
B00007LTIB|5.0|This is truly a great record. The best of the infamous 'trilogy' (CTTE, Tales and Relayer). There is little I can add to the very informed and well documented previous reviews; I can say, however, that to me it is really a pity that instead of further exploring some 'new' capabilities that Yes display on this record (for, example, the 'free jazz' intro on Sound Chaser or the amazing guitar improv. in the same song), the group recruited Wakeman back and indulge on pompous, pretentious displays of talent that conform their career thereafter. I heard Relayer soon after its inception and, to me, it was a brain opener, a huge, monumental piece of musical craftmanship that leaves you craving for more, wondering where the 'next step' will take you. Unfortunately, there has never been a next step, though there has been a lot of records, break-ups, unions and re-unions. But nothing then compares to the power, intensity and -yes- VITALITY displayed on Relayer. For those of you that are new to this band, perhaps it could be a good idea to begin your  trip with this record and THEN go after 'Close to the Edge'. It can be a good way to stop the cravings. What is true is that if you are really interested in what rock music can achieve, you can't certainly pass on this record. Enjoy!
1594200106|5.0|I loved this book!!  I simply couldn't put it down.  The last 175 pages had me turning the pages quicker than I could read them because I HAD to see what happened.  Without question, the best book I've read in the last 2-3 years.  Worth every second of your time!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I just watched the DVD with the additional features.  Absolutely brilliant.  I saw it in the theater and watching it again it amazes me that there was not more attention brought to the points he made by the media.  We \\"promote\\" democracy abroad by killing people?  Then stifle rational discussion at home?  This is not democracy, not even the rumblings of a republic.  It's sticking your head in the sand!  I hope Kerry wins, so we can begin to bring our country back from the brink of disaster and begin really planning for the future and the end of oil.  A real energy policy developed to meet the needs of all the people of this country, not just cozy deals and wars for friends of the House of Bush and Saud.
6305949980|5.0|I was a skeptic before I saw this movie, I admit it! I thought it just looked plain weird and wrote it off. Finally a friend convinced me to watch it and to my amazement, I loved it! I was amazed at how a stop action animation movie could be so cute and touching! It is filled with humour, fun and great songs, but at the centre of the movie is a wonderful story of acceptance and Jack Skellington's struggle as the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown who wants to be part of Christmastown. Of course I went right out and bought the DVD and have now become a fanatic with shirts, figurines and more! I highly recommend this movie to everyone, although I know it's dark humour is not for everyone (my Dad hated it!)but love it!!!!!!
B00007AJF9|1.0|I am one of those people who enjoys historical movies, stories and books so much that I even buy those I don't like!  I have now seen this a total of 5 times and this is one of those rare movies that gets worse with each viewing.  Not only does it make a mockery of history it even has the gall to give you a few lines at the end as to what happened to some of the characters.  Why would they add these only to get them all wrong?    It's insulting to the audience.   <br />This movie is overly dramatic, badly acted and hideously inaccurate.   It's as if they decided to make up a story and chuck in some historical names to give it more weight.   I will go against the consensus here and say that Cate Blanchett gives her most unconvincing performance so far.   The whole cast do no more than deliver lines in grandiose costumes.  The characters are totally 2 dimensional and signposted throughout.  Here's the heroine, here's the traitor, here's the devious advisor.........  It is indeed a sumptuously filmed movie with marvelous costumes.  But hooded assasins moving in slow motion down architecturally grand corridors do not a decent movie make.   Avoid it at all costs, unless of course big skirts and old castles is your thing.   <br />I hear now this fraudulent director is considering making a sequel?   Someone stop him please.  Why will anyone take on bringing the excellent story of Elizabeth to the big screen after this fool has butchered it so utterly? <br />
6304711891|1.0|What a horrible excuse for film.  The African American characters are portrayed as knife-wielding, blood-thirsty, foul-mouthed animals.  The only female characters are:  a) A completely worthless ditz, and; b) An extremely foul-mouthed African-American woman threatening gun violence.  And the cherry on this Michael Bey/Jerry Bruckheimer sundae:  A obviously gay hair dresser.. in San Francisco.  Get it?  He's GAY.. a HAIRDRESSER.. and it's SAN FRANCISCO!!!! Get it?  Get it?  Hee yuk!  Haw haw haw!    Don't get me wrong, I love a good, violent action flick.  REAL man-movies.  Peckinpah, Verhoeven, Kurosawa, Tarantino.  THIS one is an execrable waste of celluoid.  If I could have given it negative 5-stars, I would have.    Oh yeah.. I hope this doesn't violate Amazon's \\"No Spoilers\\" rule, but Nicholas Cage's character.. he's an Elvis fan!  Does Cage play an Elvis fan in EVERY FREAKING MOVIE he makes?    Ugh.
B00005JMH2|4.0|After reading the reviews of my fellow contributers, I don't think that anyone really got the point of \\"Shall We Dance?\\"  I didn't see the Japanese original, but I certainly will tune in when it is broadcast on one of the numerous cable networks that have been airing it for the past month.  I will do this merely to see if the point is the same or as one reviewer suggested it deals with the culture clash of something as western civ as ballroom dance with the Japanese culture.  For me, \\"Shall We Dance?\\" was an attempt by Tom Clark, the Richard Gere character to break out of the mold that he and his wife, Susan Sarandon, had built together as upper middle class dwellers in suburban Chicago.  Their life is comfortable and fulfilling as testified by a daughter, a son, pleasant surroundings and two satisfying careers---but as they built their lives together and moved towards their couples' goal, didn't they lose a little piece of their individuality---the people they were before they were married, before they were parents, before they were no longer themselves but half or part of an integral whole?<br /><br />This movie addresses that urge to eschew the comfortable nest that one creates for oneself and move into an arena that, although different and alien, will bring one's own personality into light again.  After all, life is about change and Tom Clark is trying to change, to become himself again---his difficulty arises when he has to bring what he has built as a husband and a father into this new world that he needs for himself.  I believe this is the reason that Gere does not want to share---it has nothing to do with shame regarding ballroom dancing---it has to do with not wanting to give up his individuality as rediscovered by enrolling in a new venture.<br /><br />Happily, the film concludes in a way that gives all all of us reinventors hope that yes, one does not need to run off and have an affair or get divorced simply because the nest they have built for themselves has gotten a little too comfortable and alas a little boring.  Gere successfully slides Sarandon into his new life---and she stunningly accepts.  The rest of the characters support in a way that is only possible in the movies---they clap and reward each other with no traces of jealousy or any other of the human traits that usually get in the way of an everyman struggle.  They all should be viewed as supporters---for this is the way Tom Clark sees them as he moves forward to unshackle himself from bonds that he himself forged.<br /><br />I must agree with many of the other reviewers that Jennifer Lopez does little for the film.  She is wooden rather than willowy; her desire to \\"dance\\" with Tom at the film's climax does not really ring true as does Tom's initial fascination with her from his seat on the train looking up at the dance studio window. As another supporter of Tom's metamorphosis, her background story is unnecessary except to give JLo a larger part in securing that her fans come see her at the box office.<br /><br />All the secondary characters have dreams of their own---ventures that they have not ventured and I think the filmmaker does a great job of pulling all their hopes and desires into one gigantic bouquet of \\"yes, you can do it if you want\\" optimism.<br /><br />Gere is showcased nicely in the film---I am happy to see that instead of rushing off and qualming his middle aged ennui with an affair like his co-star in \\"Unfaithful\\", he slips into his Supadances and performs a mean Quickstep. Stanely Tucci is outrageous; his blousy female partner in the Latin dance, blatantly real.  Miss Mitzi--delightfully ditzy---all the right kind of stereo-typical characters that form a quick cinematic bond that will support the lead to the very end.  \\"Shall We Dance?\\"is unreal, magical and a lot of fun and not meant to be critiqued as if it were mirroring reality.<br /><br />Recommended to all those sitting on their comfortable fences and need a little push towards something unknown.
B00005JNJ7|1.0|And not only that, it's just bad.  And very hateful.  Such infantile trash should be banned from the screen.  I would have walked out after just 15 minutes, but my friend, who was laughing hysterically, inststed that we stay.  It was torture.  Truly abhorrent work with no redeeming value.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I was a fan of Madonna's back in 1985. I thought she had some good dance music back then. I lost interest after 1987. I moved on...I gravitated to deeper lyrics - that were more meaningful. And got into edgier sounds and artists. I thought I would give her latest a try. But it still lacks any real emotional depth. Her voice is still thin and she strains too hard to sing the higher notes. I listened to it once or twice and sold it for a buck at a rummage sale.
B000060OFT|4.0|I have to say that I respect Baz Luhrmann tremendously. Leonardo DiCaprio? Not so much. While I admire the incredible adaptation Luhrmann produced, I am gravely dissapointed in DiCaprio, and Danes' performance. Both actors have shown some talent in some places but obviously not in Romeo and Juliet. This movie is absolutely phenomonal if you ignore the bad acting, which is rather difficult considering the fact that DiCaprio and Danes play the title roles. Everything else is marvelous.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore was considered so dangerous to the US status quo that he inspired a far-right cottage industry backed by a huge amount of resources (legally, and not conspiratorial) which emerged to prevent the film from being released - for which they almost succeeded.  <br /> <br />When this strategy did not work, they attempted to smear his film with innuendoes and lies - while they saturated the media with the meaningless accusation of \\"bias\\". Indeed, it is clear that many (who it seems have not even seen the film) have loaded this site with such \\"flack\\".    <br /> <br />Michael Moore is certainly biased. He has stated many times that he wishes to oust Bush. However...being \\"biased\\" does not mean he is wrong. He has a considerable and commendable fact finding team all on line at his web site. In fact, all the criticism against him is petty at best and simply wrong at worst.   <br /> <br />Members of the women's suffrage movements were \\"biased\\" when they struggled to attain political equality with men. Galileo was considered \\"biased\\" (to the point that his \\"bias\\" caused him to be put under house arrest) when he stated that the earth went around the sun. What all these people have in common is that they have bravely dared to defy what was then conventional wisdom.   <br /> <br />I too, am not totally convinced by Moore's film. In my opinion, he pulls his punches far too often to placate Middle America. For instance, he avoids using the persuasive, strident arguments of the intellectual left (such as those of Noam Chomsky). He focuses on a grieving mother far too long. However these are minor criticisms; I would recommend all to see this point of view - if only to see the side of this story that is not permitted within the corporate-state \\"conventional wisdom\\". <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXMG|5.0|This movie will not make you cry, or even laugh very much, but in terms of impeccable story-telling this movie is matched only by the few greats such as Forrest Gump or American Beauty.  Cameron Crowe goes above and beyond here to show that the old adage is true, the best stories in life are the ones that actually happened.  The film is a semi-fictional account of Crowe's life as a teenager when he was given the opportunity to begin writing for the cream of the crop of music journalism, Rolling Stone Magazine.  The pace of the movie flows much like many of the classic rock songs that play almost non-stop throughout the movie.  It starts off a little slow, then goes into the first build and you get an idea that something special is about to happen, slowing down again at points to give the viewer a moment to reflect on what the characters are feeling and then it ends with a predictable yet unquestionably satisfying conclusion.  Everyone is perfectly cast here, with Billy Crudup proving he is worthy of a leading role and this movie MADE Kate Hudson the leading actress she is today.  While an unknown for the moment, Patrick Fugit more or less carried the movie on his shoulders, which was necessary because most of the film is told through his eyes.  With the exception of one scene that drags on just a little too long (Plane Turbulence), the rest of the movie is generally flawless and I've yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this movie.
015603008X|5.0|I cried for hours when it was finished. However, in a sense, it was a very happy book. I just finished it, in a day, and I am too tired, and my thoughts have been provoked by this moving novel, and you can better understand the plot by reading it... So go ahead! Right now! And read it! Just go to the library, good friend!
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Blind Guardian ever since I got their \\"A Night At The Opera\\" album as a cristmas gift. Since then, I've discovered: \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\", \\"Tales From The Twilight World\\", \\"Blind Guardian Live\\", \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" E.P., and last but not least, their first Live DVD, \\"Imaginations From The Looking Glass\\". B.G. are perfect live! They preform their songs live just as good, or dare I say, even better than the album versions. I've personally never got the chance to see them up close and personnal, but from what I've seen from the DVD and heard from their CD's, I can't wait until the \\"Guardians\\" come to Seattle! Musicly, the band is perfect. Vocally, there is no words really to describe Hansi's voice, it's that good. His talent has found it's way to other bands as well, on Therion's album: \\"Deggial\\", He sings the lead vocals on a song called \\"Flesh Of The Gods\\". He is also best friends with the lead guitarist and founder of Iced Earth, Jon Schaffer. Schaffer and Hansi have teamed up to do a solo project called \\"Demons & Wizard's, check it out if you have not already. The only thing I have left to say is: May Blind Guardian continue to shock us with amazing work. Long live Metal!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|i loved the matrix so i thought i would love matrix reload.  it was good but not great. i am looking forward to revolutions and hope that rates as well as the first.
B00006AW2O|5.0|This was the Rolling Stones second album.  They wrote a bit more original material this time out, with five original songs (three by Jagger/Richards and two by \\"Nanker Phlege\\").  The originals are all good, even the \\"filler\\" instrumental \\"2120 South Michigan Avenue\\" rocks.  The rest of the album consists of covers of rock, R&B and blues songs.  This is great stuff, especially the obligatory Chuck Berry cover, \\"Around and Around\\".  The album also features the group's first UK Number One hit, \\"It's All Over Now\\".  It should be noted that \\"Time Is On My Side\\", which was the band's first US Top Ten hit, is not the hit single version.  This is a different version of that song, which is most noticeable during the spoken word part, which Mick says more \\"calmly\\" than he does on the hit version.  Still great, though.  Another great album by the Stones, and highly recommended.
B000003CMB|5.0|If you were on a desert island, what book would you want,  who would you like with you and what CD would you want.  This is without question one of the greatest albums of ALL TIME and the one I'd pick.  I'll have to think about the book and companion later .... \\"Whipping Post\\" is starting, gotta go........
B0002SROT0|5.0|Closure. I wasn't looking for answers to Elliott's death in this album. I just wanted to hear him one last time, to feel what he was working on when he left us. I made it to \\"Twilight\\" before I broke down in tears. I'm grateful to Rob & Joanna, as well as Elliott's family, for making this possible. <br /> <br />Even if you never listened to Elliott when he was with us, buy the album. You'll fill a void you never knew existed.
B000003TA4|1.0|The Only thing In my opinion Nirvana did for music, Was make it ok to be half-ass. The album is borderline boring, it is depressing, and the songs are bland.  If you want to listen to music that really sets the Standards for what talent is, Listen to Nightwish, or Evanescence. Grundge indeed.
B00000K19E|5.0|this was the first sci-fi movie that i've ever seen. i thought it was representative of all sci-fi movies, but it's not.  it's far better that any i've seen after it. i'm not a big sci-fi fan, and i probably never will be, but i am a big fan of the matrix.  fantastic!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Love these guys.  I love all their tracks.  They begun something into the 60s and early 70s that most guys didn't do.  The songs they have are so great.  If you have knocked this group before you should be ashame.
B00005O3VC|5.0|What can you say about a film whose script has been virtually memorized by legions of fans since its release in 1975?<br /><br />\\"Fetchez la vache!\\" \\"Bring out your dead!\\" \\"English knnnnn-iggets!\\" \\"How do you noo she is a witch?\\" \\"Castle Anthrax\\" \\"Of course it's a good idea!\\" \\"Some call me.....Tim?\\" \\"It's only a flesh wound!\\" \\"Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?\\" \\"The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch\\" \\"Answer me these questions three!\\"<br /><br />Each of these quotes will immediately be recognized by Grail fans. The list of memorable lines and sight gags goes on and on.<br /><br />The film itself is the greatest of all comedies by the greatest of all comedy troupes. No small intellect is behind the script, and no insignificant amount of historical knowledge either. The actors avoid playing their parts with self-knowing irony, which gives viewers the a chance to get (or miss) the humor on their own. As much fun as the film are the director's commentaries and various shorts depicting the search for castles (not as easy as it might be supposed) and the shooting of the film itself. Two sad truths: Graham Chapman is no longer with us and John Cleese has developed into (perhaps always was?) an insufferable bore. Ah well, I'm over it.<br /><br />\\"Holy Grail\\" is a daffy, delicious send-up of socialist politics, encounters with the divine, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the Grail romances, medieval science and the perils of living in a verminous and crud-bestrewn land. For anyone with an intellectual sense of humor, this is a DVD you are guaranteed to watch over and over again.
B000286S8S|4.0|It seems to me that the large bulk of Van Halen vans fall into two very distinct categories: those who prefer Diamond Dave and those who prefer the Red Rocker.  I fall squarely in between.  I love BOTH incarnations of the band (however not the 3rd version with the old singer from Extreme).  I have read many of the reviews here and find it very interesting to see those who rip on Roth and those who find fault with Sammy, a good chunk of which have totally missed the mark entirely.<br /><br />Let me elaborate:  David Lee Roth insists to this day he was kicked out of the band.  NOT TRUE.  After he scored some solo success with his mini-LP 'Crazy From The Heat' which yielded two remakes (California Girls & Just A Gigalo) his ego, which was already about to apply for state-hood went astronomical.  He dumped the boys almost immediately upon fulfilling his tour obligations with the band.  Does Sammy have an ego?  Absolutely.  Does it even begin to match Dave's?  Sorry but he's got a long way to go to reach Roth and his unchecked love for himself.<br /><br />A few have even brought up album sales to prove the popularity of one singer over the other.  While this is a nice barometer of what the album-buying fans actually think, it doesn't erase the fact that there are a HUGE number of fans of BOTH singers.  (by the way, Van Halen with Sammy outsold David Lee Roth by almost 2 to 1. Like it or not, those are the facts)<br /><br />I noticed one fan categorized the songs by both singers in an interesting way, and I have to agree.  While I feel Sammy is a better overall singer, Dave certainly sang on songs that had a bigger variety of musical diversity.  I also read how one reviewer based both singers as songwriters...again, sorry but Dave was the lyricist and helped VERY LITTLE on any actual music writing for the band, while Sammy was already an accomplished singer, guitar player and songwriter by himself.  Again, not taking anything away from Dave, but he just stood and sang and did one thing that Sammy does little of: PERFORM.  Having seen both Van Halen WITH Roth and Sammy as a solo act, by FAR Dave was the bigger showman -- but sorry to say, his vocals are on the verge of ruin over years of smoking and screaming on stage.  It really sucks to see such talent whittled away at a relatively young age, but Sammy's vocals actually still pack quite a punch after all these years -- and he is OLDER than Dave.<br /><br />The debate over both singers will rage for a lot longer than I wish to participate, but with that said, I still enjoy listening to songs by BOTH singers.  Plenty of debate will also rage over which songs were left out (Ice Cream Man -- a horrible mistake in my opinion) and why oh WHY did they include 'Eruption' without connecting it to 'You Really Got Me'???  That's like listening to 'We Will Rock You' without hearing it go into 'We Are The Champions', many fans will find this inexcuseable.<br /><br />In my career in radio I have been fortunate to see and interview many of the biggest bands in rock & roll, from the Beach Boys to Sammy Hagar and yes, even David Lee Roth.  My personal opinions about either singer are based on my being a fan of both of them as well as personal experience being WITH both of them one on one on several occasions.  Sammy is a guy I feel I could hang around with, while Dave treated me like I was a butler who was pestering him with annoying questions instead of waiting on him hand and foot.  Didn't sit well with me, but I still enjoy his music.  Fans of both singers will most likely find SOMETHING to enjoy in this particular incarnation of Greatest Hits, but as always, YOUR opinions may vary.ang and did one thing that Sammy does little of: PERFORM.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I have played this album more than any other I own. I am a music fanatic and have always loved classical music on up to Heavy Metal. Dont like Rap and Country save the EXTREMLEY rare catchy tune. I have always wanted to here a band that had heavy metal, mixed with a strings section/orchestration, and classical or at least talented vocals. For a long time Savatage, was my favorite band with Queensryche, and Ozzy Osbourne close behind. Nightwish finally fills the void in my  search for musical perfection. Every CD is excellent, Wishmaster started to show what they were capable of becoming, Century Child stayed in my cd player for months without missing a day where I played it from start to finnish at least once.  <br /> <br />ONCE is released and I order it straight from finnland paying over 30.00 for it by the time it arrived along with Both CD Singles. I Still say its the best 60.00 Ive spent on music ever. <br />I not only kept it in my Truck from the time I received it, and played it 2 - 3 times a day but I recorded it onto my computer for fear of ruining the CD. ONCE is a fantastic album mixing so much different genres of music into one band and pulling it off perfectly.  <br />
B00005JMH2|4.0|Seen this movie with the wife an it really is a good story that allows the guys point of view to come across. Yes this is a happy feel good movie with alittle ball room and it was done quite well. (Kind of a chick flick) but hey ya gotta take the wife to a few of these a year. Sit back and enjoy.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|Jennifer Lopez can sing.  Who knew?  Her sassy voice with straight up R&B beats was a plus for her debut.  'If You Have My Love', 'Waiting for Tonight', and more were some of the songs I enjoyed on the album.
6305052158|4.0|Marlon Brando is his legendary charismatic self, if a bit methody, in \\"One-Eyed Jacks\\".  Brando, as director, does a good but not solid job here.  The story could have been tightened up a bit.  The story concerns a bank robber, Kid Rio(Brando) and his cohort, Dad Longworth(Karl Malden) on the run from Mexican police after robbing a bank there.  After losing one of their horses Longworth is supposed to use the one remaining horse to retrieve another.  Instead, he makes off with the gold they've stolen and leaves Rio to the police.  Five years later, upon escaping a Mexican prison, Rio vows revenge on Longworth.  On finding him, Rio discovers that Longworth is the respected sherriff of Monterey, California with a wife and beautiful step-daughter.  The story is a good one and the coastal photography here is gorgeous.  I didn't find Malden to be that formidable a baddy, though.  Good support is given here by Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens.  Timothy Carey, a veteran of Kubrick films, plays a lout that Brando tangles with in a hotel.  Also of note is that prior to taking the directorial reigns, Stanley Kubrick was attached to this film but had a falling out with Brando.
B00026WU4G|5.0|It's baffling that any critic can call 1983's \\"Infidels\\" a return to \\"secular recording\\" for Bob Dylan. After three straight Christian albums, the record was certainly more broad in its horizons, at least when compared to its predecessor, the rollicking \\"Shot of Love\\" or the second Born-Again album \\"Saved,\\" but its attitude is still as straightforward and uncompromising as Dylan's first Christian release, \\"Slow Train Coming.\\"<br /><br />He may look ticked on the album cover, but in truth, Bob Dylan sounds musically and lyrically comfortable all throughout the wittingly titled \\"Infidels\\", and artistically he is still as free as he sounded on his Born-Again albums. But his lyricism here is much more deliciously complex than on the three predecessors; a glance at 'Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight' may suggest that its a cliched song about sex, but it's not, it's much deeper and much more creative than that. 'Jokerman' boasts a slight reggae influence and Dylan's alluring attempt to try and reveal false prophets, as he does elsewhere when he clearly states that sometimes Satan disguises himself as a 'Man of Peace.' The driving 'Neighborhood Bully' reminds one of the rocking \\"Shot of Love,\\" but with a much more complex political message, unlike the straightforward social statements of 'License To Kill' and 'Union Sundown.' And like 'Don't Fall Apart On Me Tonight,' the second track 'Sweetheart Like You' may have a cliched title, but the content within is bursting with originality and mystery, much like 'I and I.'<br /><br />Ironically titled, this album is a must-have in Dylan's cannon and arguably the last great album he made for years, as critics claim he went into an up-and-down spin throughout the rest of the 80s. The different spiritual elements that make up \\"Infidels\\" (Christianity and Judaism among them) would put many other artists in a creative pretzel-twist, but here Bob Dylan handles them all with integrity and delivers one of his most effective albums.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|He's not far from his Wolverine character in this one.  It still is entertaining if you like the action genre. On the DVD you get to see a 360 degree view of the castle and the extras are worth the price.  I still think this could become a franchise. Too bad the producers of the X-Men never made a Wolverine movie instead.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Hugh Jackman both films would have never been tolerable.  It's a testament to his talent when he can carry a movie that's almost straight special effects. Acting in front of a green screen can't be very satisfying as an actor and he pulls it off well.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of the monster films to like this one.<br /><br />It has enough outlandish stunts in it to make it one you can see at least twice and still enjoy. Myself, I love the old classics and hope more of them are relased with this film.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I am actually not that big of a South Park fan.  I watched the show for several seasons, but after the movie came out the show seemed kind of tame in comparison. Team America is anything but tame.  The language, content, music....everything is as extreme and funny as it can be and I wrote this to say that even people who don't like South Park can still enjoy this.   <br />     Before I wrote my review, I decieded to check out what other people thought and it was as shocking as the movie.  Review titles like \\"Neocons will love this movie,\\" and \\"HATEFUL, NAZI-LIKE, PROPAGANDA FILM\\" soar like giant flags of stupidity.  Just because this movie makes fun of Michael Moore, Alec Baldwin, and other actors who think their opinions matter, doesn't mean that its anti whatever those guys are.  I'll admit I'm not an expert on politics, but when did conservitives start supporting gratuitous violence, language, sex scenes, and America bashing?  The title of the movie makes fun of Americas' believe that the world is theirs, America gets its intelligence from a retarted computer, and in order to stop a terrorist from blowing up a city with a bomb, America blows it up with missiles. I don't know what's worse, the fact that people can watch two things and only see one of them, or that someone actually looks to puppets for political guidance.  Every single person, place, and thing that appears in this movie regardless of affiliation is there to be made fun of....so laugh.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|As long as Iron Maiden is putting out music I will be buying it. The band's rich musical legacy warrants my loyalty. So when Dance of Death came out I picked it up hoping to hear \\"Brave New World\\" part 2. And there are some really good tunes on here, just not up to \\"Brave New World\\"'s level. The title track is probably my favorite song on the album and sounds like something off of \\"Somewhere in Time\\" without the synth-guitar. I also like the last cut on the cd \\"Journeyman\\", with it's acoustic intro and catchy chorus it really stands out. But there are quite a few dead-spots on the album that I find myself skipping. \\"Montsigur\\" has a really repetitive chorus and Bruce's shrill, falsetto makes this one a tough one to sit though. \\"Face in the Sand\\" is just kind of there, it reminds me a good deal of the music found on \\"Fear of the Dark\\". But Maiden is at thier best when singing about history and \\"Paschendale\\" is no exception. This song is as good as \\"Trooper\\" or \\"Aces High\\" and really shows why Iron Maiden has been around for over 2 decades. If you are a fan you will really enjoy this cd, and judging by the bands that populate the heavy metal world these days; Slipknot, Coal Chamber and Papa Roach, it's nice to have a band like Maiden around that can still write and perform coherant and enjoyable music instead of rapping or shouting unintelligible lyrics overtop of two or three guitar chords.
B00005JNEI|5.0|i am british and am so glad my son is not in the armed forces <br />after watching this. this is not an anti american documentery far from it, i think michael moore is a patriot, he is trying to shed light in the only way he know how on the corruption going on at the highest levels, he deserves an oscar at least. <br />bush is an self serving idiot not worthy of high office and please please vote him out.
B0001ENYKS|3.0|this album is a return to the dark side of the 70s where rock slowly evaproated into whatever the heck the 80s were. The only way to describe this album is Disco Rock as it fuses catchy beats with wicked guitar riffs. The band evokes KC and the Sunshine Band and Blondie (especially on the track Come On Home) yet has enough skill to make sure you know that this is definitely something different. The album is consistently fun and full of energy and has enough hooks to be worth your money.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Although my rating for this is 2 stars - one of my lowest ratings ever for a DVD - I'm going to be up front with you, be honest and say:  This movie MAY be right up your alley.  It really depends on how willing you are to overlook a story that could have been written by a high school prom committee that suddenly found themselves in possession of several cameras and 50 million dollars worth of special effects.<br /><br />You've HEARD (or read) the plot outline, right?  New Ice Age comes and covers most of the Northern Hemisphere and a handful of smart/brave Americans save..... well, they don't save all of the Northern Hemisphere, but they at least save themselves.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is a good and reliable actor, and in some roles I can readily accept him.  As an almost-washed-up Texas High School Baseball coach I buy it.  As one of the \\"Cutters\\" in \\"Breaking Away\\", he was powerful and brooding.  In \\"Day\\" he plays basically the genius scientist who predicts disaster but those dummies in the government don't believe him.  Not only was it hard for me to believe him in this role - I kept telling myself that it is a pretty weak \\"save the world\\" movie that essentially uses a weatherman as it's hero.<br /><br />Ian Holm is absolutely fantastic and totally believable as an ally weatherman over in Britain, but Sir Ian's screen time is minimal and his character disappears before the 2nd act, never to be heard from again.<br /><br />The \\"star\\" of the movie, of course, are the special effects, and they LOOK good.  But while I'm watching a guilty-pleasure extended sequence where a whole herd of tornadoes waltz through Los Angeles I was thinking....\\"just HOW was it that global warming causing disturbances in the polar ice cap and North Atlantic caused tornadoes in Southern California?\\"<br /><br />I'd buy \\"El Nino\\" or the recent string of Hurricanes through Florida first.<br /><br />The \\"fun\\" parts of this movie could have been condensed into a 15 minute special effects extravaganza and left out the absolutely ludicrous and impossible stories about our heroes and their impossible survival through a cold front so cold that earlier in the movie 3 British Helicopters are frozen in mid-air and crash - just from the cold.  To emphasize how cold it is one of the crewmen starts clawing his way out of the downed chopper, before freezing solid beginning at the tip of his nose.<br /><br />Our little band of characters, the ones we KNOW are going to \\"make it\\" not only live through that wave of cold air - but there are scenes where we see them running ahead of the freeze.... in sort of the same way teenagers flee from Jason in the Friday 13th movies.<br /><br />So.... if you want to see a lot of North America wiped out by bad weather - you've come to the RIGHT movie.  If you insist that your movies make logical sense.... keep on moving folks, there's nothing to see here.fects extravaganza and left out the absolutely ludicrous and impossible stories about our heroes and their impossible survival through a cold front so cold that earlier in the movie 3 British Helicopters are frozen in mid-air and crash - just from the cold.

068987474X|5.0|First my review of the book, then a few words for our \\"friend\\" P Rice.  The book is insightful and hilarious.  I laughed out loud many times, but was even more struck by how on-the-mark it was.  One of the authors' main points is that for some reason, women have been conditioned to forgive just about anything from the men in their lives and their collective self-esteem has sunk so low that they're willing to cut the jerky guys more breaks than the media has given George Bush.  It is quite empowering to hear Greg's message: that you should move on because why would you want a guy who treats you in a way that is less than you deserve?  No need to psychoanalyze him to death or spend numerous brunches with the girls trying to understand his every move.  Bottom line:  if he wants you, and if he's worth his salt, he'll do whatever he can to be with you.  If he doesn't, \\"he's just not that into you\\" and it is time to find someone who is. <br /> <br />Now for P Rice.  A paraphrase of a line from the old Saturday Night Live comes to mind:  You ignorant pig!  Take a look around you, buddy.  Not every gorgeous (or thin) guy is married to an equally gorgeous (or thin) woman.  Chemistry between two people can't be predicted, and it comes in all shapes and sizes.  And here's another news flash:  looks don't last.  She's not going to look like Heidi Klum in 20 years, so you'd better be looking for something deeper than how hot or thin she is.  It's too bad that your full name isn't here because to all the women out there, you'd better beware of this one.  I bet he's the guy who will divorce his wife when she can't seem to shed that baby weight after carrying his 3 children for 9 months each and she doesn't have a minute to herself because his sorry butt is on the couch every night while she works herself to death.  Wake up and smell the rogain dude - you're clueless and I bet you have the relationship history to prove it!
B000002LCX|5.0|for me, the best example of The Smiths musical and lyrical style in one place. This album is about having so much passion for something (hating, loving, obsession, politics, loneliness,ect.) you feel it to be a crime (or almost a crime). Hence the title; Strangeways is a prison in England. And the cover art: a still from East of Eden; Morrissey was so obsessed with James Dean he wrote a book about him (which is hard to find, by the way). And filmed a video in his hometown. Morrisey's wit and art with his lyrics and Marr's amazing musical talent contrast, contradict, encourage, and compliment each other and the listener.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first watched this series by borrowing a friend's copy, and by the time I watched the first disc, I was hooked.  I bought my own copy and now loan it to others to get them started on Firefly. <br /> <br />This is just a great series.  The way I describe it is a \\"Space-West-Far-Eastern\\", since it mixes Westerns with Far East influence, then shows it in space.  The episodes are well written, and very entertaining.  The casting is superb, with the characters really coming to life as you watch.  Luckily, the movie, \\"Serenity\\" is coming out April 22, 2005, so buy the DVDs and go watch the movie.  You won't be disappointed.
B0000542D2|3.0|I got the double disc edition of this dvd and got a bit disappointed in realising some of the sound remixing is poor (just go and listen to the opening credits version of the track A Hard Day's Night! Sounds as if it was taken from a restored rehearsal take, not from the polished album cut we all know and love!).<br />Also, some of the bonus features are virtually the same on both the discs so one wonders why bother with a double disc set when one single DVD would have done very well. I agree with that reviewer who said some JPGR's interviews or extras would have added some more magic to the item. Shall we Beatle fans have to wait for another twenty years and for yet another much hyped re-release of the film in order to get the ultimate thing?
1592400876|5.0|Lynne Truss is a Punctuation Stickler, Her \\"zero tolerance approach\\" encourages other sticklers to go out into the punctuationaly-challenged world armed with White-out, sticky apostrophes, markers and the like to change signs and posters and get punctuation correct. She even advocates more drastic measures such as weapons and wishes for natural disasters: \\"If you still persist in writing, `Good food at it's best', you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.\\"<br /><br />Eats, Shoots and Leaves is not the typical punctuation instruction manual. It is a lively and spirited book filled with humorous, yet entirely appropriate, examples to make her point that good punctuation is extremely necessary; it's not just about sticking to the rules, it's about writing intelligibly. For instance, \\"a woman, without her man, is nothing\\" has a completely different meaning than when those same words are punctuated as \\"a woman: without her, man is nothing.\\" Wow, I said. She's right! Punctuation IS important.<br /><br />Truss gives easy to understand instructions as to where and when and how to use such wonderful marks as apostrophes, commas, dashes, colons, semicolons, exclamation marks, ellipses, parentheses, brackets, and more. In addition, she gives a brief and fascinating history of the amazingly recent creation and use of punctuation. I had no idea punctuation was so new!<br /><br />Truss also tickles the funny bone with example after example of punctuation misuse and abuse. Her chapter on the correct use of dashes and ellipses made me quite ashamed of my email habits, as I saw myself in many of her bad examples.<br /><br />Eats, Shoots and Leaves is a cheery, enjoyable read about a subject I never expected to find cheerful or enjoyable. I have to give this book five stars, because not only did I come away much wiser-and more vigilant-about punctuation, I was highly entertained during the entire book. Thanks, Lynne, for waking me up and (hopefully) re-educating me about proper punctuation!ing me up and (hopefully) re-educating me about proper punctuation!
B0002OERI0|5.0|A well put together CD, good from stop to finish, no songs to skip literally.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|\\"Snow White And the Seven Dwarves\\" is a great animated fairy tale released in 1937.  Its theme has since passed the test of time.  The unforgettable charming plot remains frequently viewed by many audiences today.  It takes audiences through a tale of Snow White struggling to find Prince Charming.  Through life obstacles, namely the Wicked Witch, she finds seven dwarves whom she helps and help her.  This series of events, with others, keeps audiences interested in every scene.  The individual character personalities give this fairy tale a great name.  Through these events, the songs blend wonderfully with the individual scenes.  They offer the added entertainment pleasure that spices up the film events.  The voices add such delight to this film through the script and the singing.  The sounds add a beautiful element to the charming theme.  \\"Snow White And the Seven Dwarves\\" proves why it's become a classic film.  This is great for all ages to enjoy.
B00005JNEI|2.0|Having recently re-watched \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", I felt compelled to write a short analysis of Mr. Moore's film. <br /> <br />First off, he is a fine filmmaker who can use situations to effectively convey his intentions. He has a good eye for drama, and that must be commended. However, one must remember that this film is drama, not a documentary. It is filled with misrepresentations, and outright lies. Moore frequently takes words out of context to promote his cause: deframing the President. <br /> <br />If you are really compelled to find out the actual facts, please check out David Kopel's, a lifelong Democrat, website which chronicles the inaccuracies in Moore's film. [...] as this will present to you the deceits in \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\". As a good American, I feel it is necessary to view both sides of any tale. That is why I recommend every American see both Moore's film as well as \\"FarenHYPE 9/11\\" and also read what Mr. Kopel has to say in regards to the film.
0316776963|5.0|Not many books that I have read make me laugh really hard.  I have to say that the second half of this book was so funny that I read it three times and laughed over and over again. It made me asthmatic.  I am an American living in Belgium and have struggled day-to-day with the culture and the language issues.  I tried to explain how funny the book was to my French teacher.  But, of course, I was trying to do it in French.  This, of course, made it even funnier to me even though my teacher did not find it funny at all.  And what the hell with that bell from Italy anyway?
0446530891|1.0|Once upon a time, I enjoyed Baldacci's works. That was before he became famous. Now he's content to live off his reputation. Ludicrous plot sloppily assembled with the kind of wording reminiscent of the underachiever in high school composition class. Appalling.
B00005JMEW|5.0|\\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is Oscar winner Quinton Tarantino's first film release since his long break.  After directing and producing films \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"From Dusk Til Dawn\\", \\"Jackie Brown\\", and others, he yet again masters another unforgettable film.  The man known for creating 1970's style films masters another potential classic.  This time, it's almost his most bloody and graphic film to date.  He proves that he is a highly unique film maker with his untouchable style.  This film begins the quest of The Bride's (Uma Thurman) revenge after having lain in a coma for years.  She now wants to kill her assaillants, especially Bill.   <br /> <br />This film contains the perfect level of action, martial arts, and wit throughout the mission.  This creative plot takes audiences closely into the mind of those experiencing these events.  The film never holds back on the hardcore graphic violence, the blood, the body parts, and others.  Tarantino stays true with his trademark with occassional long flashbacks and one-of-a-kind camera work.  The numerous change of color backgrounds, including black and white, give each individual scene the added intensity that it deserves.     <br /> <br />Through the numerous physical brutalies lies the emotional value expressed throughout.  None is more expressed than Uma Thurman's powerful performance.  Her anger, sadness, and rage never loses its intensity throughout the film.  This is in no doubt her best work in her career, possibly tying her Oscar nominated role in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" (1994).  Other performers also give wonderful performances, offering their own taste of theme: Vivica A. Fox, Pam Grier, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, and others. <br /> <br />\\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is a great action film for those looking for something intense.  This is sure to keep audiences awaiting anxiously for the sequel \\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\".  Those curious about this series must watch Vol. 1 first.  Otherwise Vol. 2 will be highly confusing.  Unfortunately, according toTarantino, fans must wait about 15-20 years for Vol. 3 to be released.
B0002YLC24|5.0|A fantastic follow-up to Before Sunrise.  Well made movie, all the questions left from the 1st movie answered in this movie.  I wish they did not wrap it up so well, so we could have the chance for another movie.
B000093BDX|4.0|Its basically the best of the Beach Boys - it steered clear of some the more eclectic but equally good songs (Pet Sounds, Wendy, Little Girl I Once Knew)  <br /> <br />But overall it covers all the basics, from Surfin' USA to Good Viberations to Sloop John B to my personal favorite, Darlin'. A must have for anyone's Beach Boy's collection or anyone looking for all their favorite songs in one place.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Somebody please give that lil' boy (jimi's good?) a slap, he said Yngwie better than Hendrix, that dude just play sweep picking from \\" here to there \\" on every record he made and don't be fool the other dude that play fast, coz they only running down the scale without no taste, with a little talent you can learn it within two weeks, i told you, jimi maybe not the fastest, but he is the one who set the foundation, a lot of guitarist before hendrix thinks hey i can do that, but they never do because like million others guitarist thay are just followers, The Mighty HendRix is the revolutioner, that's why he is the GOD, he set and create, even Yngwie is a big fan of Hendrix,don't you read the sleeve of his album, and check his guitar too, stratocaster model which similar with Hendrix. <br />beside if the greatness of a musician set by how fast he can play the instruments, than the great singer is a rap singer, no matter how suck he is. And now about the album you're lucky if you can find the special edition of this album because it twice much of Hendrix. <br /> <br />Hendrix Rules !!!!!!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|\\"West Side Story\\", released in 1961, is a great adaptation of the Broadway musical thanks to producer and director Robert Wise (Jerome Robbins also directed).  It stars Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood.  This was inspired by Shakespeare's world-famous play \\"Romeo And Juliet\\".  The film earned ten Oscars including Best Picture.  Through the songs and the plot, its themes of two rival gangs, Jets vs. Sharks, and a couple who instantly fall in love in 1950's New York City combine well.  Other plot details also give it the added touch: Sharks frequently facing racism, wives and girlfriends deathly concerned of their beloved gang members, a restaurant worker trying to reach through the gang members, and others.  Since its release, the long-lasting impact has made it a worthy classic. <br /> <br />Its songs remain commonly sung by many audiences today, namely \\"Tonight\\", \\"Someday\\", and \\"Maria\\".  The score and they were written by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim.  The film soundtrack made music history on the Billboard Top 200 Albums Charts by staying #1 for the most weeks (54 non-consecutive).  The lyrics and the musical theme wonderfully blend with the plot, and every musical detail adds a wonderful unforgettable touch to every scene.  The dancing gives these songs additional meaning while enacting the storyline.  All these film details give great homage to the original Broadway stage version.  The plot romances the love scenes beautifully while intensifying the vocal and physical battle scenes wonderfully. <br /> <br />The actors and singers perform their roles wonderfully.  Though not every actor actually sang, the overall performances were spectacular, namely Rita Moreno (Anita) and George Chakiris (Bernado) in their Oscar winning roles (Best Supporting Actress/ Best Supporting Actor).  Beymer (Tony) and Wood (Maria) contain the special chemistry between them that makes the love theme more romantic.  Their charm gives their characters and the film the added beauty.  All other actors give the film the added individual touch. <br /> <br />\\"West Side Story\\" is a great musical for genre fans to watch.  This is sure to continue pleasing audiences for many more years.  Fans of this film should also buy the film soundtrack.  Such combination makes a great entertainment experience.
B0000VD04M|5.0|If anyone were to ever make a story about Ed Wood, it would have to Burton, Depp and Landau.  The team that made this movie is phenomenal and did a tremendous job making this film.  I'm so glad it's finally out and I never had to pay $50 on eBay!
B0002SROT0|5.0|It's a little fitting that Smith's posthumous release is also the capstone on his career.  To me, this album is heartwrenching, and on par with the definitive albums of Smith's tragic forebearers (Nick Drake's \\"Pink Moon\\" and Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\".)  From the heavy \\"Coast to Coast\\" to the austere \\"Last Hour\\", this is Elliott Smith at his finest.  I can easily call this the best release of the year, and possibly one of the best of the past ten years.  The fact that this is likely the last collection of new material we'll hear from Elliiott only adds to the mood of the disc.   <br /> <br />If you're a fan, this album is a no-brainer.  If you enjoyed XO, Either/Or, Figure 8 or any other Smith release to any degree, you need this album.  Buy two copies in case something happens to the first one.
B000003MZU|5.0|For me the best of JLG albums, even better than \\"Ojal que llueva Caf\\" and \\"Ni es lo mismo ni es igual\\".  Bilirrubina, Rosala, A pedir su mano are great merengues; Estrellitas y duentes,  Reforstame, Bachata Rosa (especially) showed the world how sweet, delicate and sensual bachata rythm is.
0743424425|5.0|When I read this book in 1980, I was already a King fan, having read \\"Carrie\\". This book literally scared me to death.  I was a young wife and mother, and when my husband was working at night and I had two babies to tend to, I read the book. I was looking over my shoulder and feeling truly scared.  We all know the movie starring Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrence;  that scared me badly, too.  But the novel is on it's own, if you haven't read it, don't try to associate it with the movie.  It is a great thriller, probably one of the best ghost stories ever written.

0767805712|5.0|GATTACA is, in my book, one of the finest movies ever made.  It's a movie about believing in yourself even when no one else does.  It's thought provoking, beautiful, and inspirational. This is a true masterpiece.      GATTACA is set in the near future, when your genes determine your status in society.  Vincent (played by Ethan Hawke) is one of the now few invalids (people who have not been genetically engineered).  Vincent's dream is to one day travel into space,   but because of genoism (genetic discrimination), he is forced to work as a janitor.  However, through hard work and help from Eugene (Jude Law), he somehow manages to find a way to beat the system to achieve his childhood dream.     Irene (Uma Thurman)is Vincent's love interest.  She, like Eugene, is genetically engineered but has a heart condition, and, like Eugene, suffers from the burden of perfection.  She sadly tells Vincent that because of her heart condition she will never be assigned to a mission beyond Earth's orbit.  Irene's tone and demeanor is a quiet sadness throughout the movie, which complements the movie's entire tone: bleak, sterile, and cold.      Eugene is charming and delightful to watch, as he provides relief from the sullen tone throughout the movie with his humorous quips (\\"Shall I save you some?\\" he asks Vincent after vomiting.)    The ending is unexpected and sad, yet somewhat fitting, and will leave you thinking.      I was completely blown away the first time I saw GATTACA.  Since then I have watched it five more times, and it only gets better with each viewing, never losing it's ability to inspire, thanks in part to the beautiful and inspirational score.           GATTACA is rich with memorable scenes and quotes.  Just a few of my favorite:    Scenes    -When the nursery school worker literally slams a gate shut in young Vincent's face, after denying him admittance (as his physical conditions would prevent him from being covered by insurance.)  The bars of the gate symbolicallyshow Vincent being separated from the \\"valid\\" world.     -When Vincent's father records Anton and Vincent's heights with a marker on the wall, you can see, from previous marks, that Anton, although the younger brother, is quickly gaining on Vincent.  After the measuring, the father smiles and rubs Anton's head, leaving Vincent in the background, sadly erasing his measurements with his fingers.  This scene captures the inferiority Vincent felt and sadness of being loved less because of it.    -When Irene leads Vincent outside to see the sun set on a shimmering series of moving panels.  The music in this scene captures the moment perfectly and combined with the dazzling visuals, makes for a truly beautiful scene.         Quotes    -Vincent (to Irene), on her lack of faith in her abilities because of her imperfections: \\"You are the authority on what is not possible, aren't you Irene?  They've got you looking so hard for any flaw that after a while, that's all you see. For whatever it's worth, I'm here to tell you that it is possible. It is possible.\\"    -Vincent, to Anton, on how he beat him in a swimming contest, where whoever could swim the furthest from shore wins:  \\"This is  how I did it, Anton: I never saved anything for the swim back.\\"
038551123X|1.0|Sure the book had some stereotypical characters, but it was breezy and a quick read and Dexter did have some interesting observations about people and life. <br /> <br />But the ending WAS implausible.  Almost a (excuse the pun) cop-out.  Like the author was in a rush to end it. <br /> <br />All along I was hoping the ending would be ~~~~~COULD BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER~~~~~ that Deborah knew about Dexter and was using her knowledge of her brother to set him up so that she could get a promotion.~~~~END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER~~~~  Did anyone else entertain this possibility? <br /> <br />Maybe I should write this alternative ending.
014028009X|1.0|Along with many other readers, I was urged by friends to read this \\"wonderful, hilarious, genius\\" of a novel. Since it seemed as such an excitement I went to the bookstore and grabbed a copy. I liked the journal like style and was eager to be impressed. So I waited-page by page, and chapter by chapter. NOTHING!! <br />     I was not the least bit amused by Bridget's objectionable thoughts or putrid actions. She in no way resembled anything I strive for in life. Bridget epitomizes the female race, to say the least. Her weight is a constant obsession, along with smoking, drinking, and child-like infatuations. Also she is searching for a boyfriend and CLEARLY does not use her head in this pursuit. She sleeps with her boss and lets other men have free roam to her body. How is this funny?!? Loose morals mixed with a selfish mindset, what woman would want to identify herself with Bridget? Not one worth one ounce of respect. With good intentions, she never dominates over her struggles. On the contrary, she only gripes and drags her problems out for 200+ pages. Yes, problems are not easily triumphed over, but where is determination, even just a hint? <br />     In no way do I wish to identify with Bridget and certainly did not find the story funny. It rather gave me a fiery determination to not resemble this stereotypic, brainless, loose, child-ish, self centered disgrace of a woman. Don't waste any precious time to read this highly overrated novel! <br />
B00005JMH2|5.0|It's a shame that this film is not being reviewed fairly.  Many reviewers are starting off with a blatant bias against Jennifer Lopez, and others seem down on remakes in general and overprotective of the Japanese original, which was a beautiful film.  I saw it three weekends in a row and immediately signed up for ballroom lessons (and am still dancing).  But this \\"Shall We Dance?\\" is completely satisfactory on its own.  The screenwriter chose a culturally valid reason for the Gere character's secrecy; the characters each have their spotlight moment and are each well-played.  The filmmaking is clean and unfussy, with good photography of the dancing and excellent design.  What many viewers and reviewers seem to hang up on is the Lopez effect.  But she is not the star of this film; her character is a catalyst.  Lopez deserves credit for continually trying to stretch as an actress and in none of her failures is she solely to blame.  Here, her performance fits the character's backstory and meshes neatly with the rest of the cast.  I saw this film at a sneak preview with a group of other dancers, all of whom enjoyed it.  So did the rest of the audience.  There was more laughter at this film than I've heard at any other comedy I've seen in the theatre.  Give it a chance and you'll remember how hard - and how rewarding - it can be to try something new.  The real story is between the Gere and Sarandon characters, who carry it off with considerable chemistry and great charm.  It is rare to find a romantic comedy that affirms married love.  I can't think of a single thing wrong with that.

B0000541AM|5.0|\\"The Warriors\\" is a fantasy film.  If you try to judge it in relation to the real world, you're wasting your time.  It takes place in an alternate universe.  In this world, street gangs don't traffic in drugs, they only fight against each other and never target innocent civilians, and they wear colorful costumes like in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\".  They also fight with knives and chains rather than AK-47s.  You know early on the David Patrick Kelly is the villian, because he uses a handgun, a clear violation of the gangbangers' civilaric code.    If you accept this alternate reality, \\"The Warriors\\" is a great adventure movie.  In my opinion it the best film that Walter Hill ever made.   I love the various street gangs which include:    The Thermal ACs, who are skinheads, but not racist, since they also have black members.    The Furies, who dress up like baseball players with clown makeup.    The Riffs, who seem to pattern themselves after Jim Kelly from \\"Enter The Dragon\\".    An unnamed gang who dress in the style of 70s roller disco (not really scary; rollerskates are definately something you don't want to be wearing during a rumble).    The Orphans, a gang of losers who want respect but are too chicken to earn it.    The Lizzies, and gang of man-hating lesbians who pretend to be loose in order to lead male gang-members to their doom (think Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\").    The Rogues, who are led by a sadistic psychopath (who also has the best lines in the entire movie, including the classic, \\"warriors, come out to play...!\\"    I love this movie, having seen it in my youth numerous times at the midnight movies, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves non-stop action and laughs.  Five stars.
B000001EEN|4.0|The cd release has a lot of unreleased tracks that are done well.

B0000027EP|3.0|Though I own quite a few Motorhead albums, I don't consider myself one of their biggest fans. Let's face, even though of us who like Lemmy's sandpaper on metal on gravel voice...a little bit of his...err...singing and/or grunting and snarling goes a long way. Motorhead, throughout their entire career, mainly prefer one volume level....VERYVERYVERYLOUD, and one speed..veryveryveryveryfast. And, I think many of their albums and songs, and even album covers are too much alike. If you want a little variety in your music, this is not your band.<br /><br />All of that being said, I do like this band and there are exceptions to most or all of the above, some of which can be found on this album. I have to admit, as well, that I like Lemmy's sense of humor, which can be found in Motorhead's liner notes. One thing I can't deny, either...nobody else sounds or looks like Lemmy...the man is a true original. Him and his bandmates have written plenty of(...) heavy metal/hard rock songs and some of them can be found here.<br /><br />The production on this album is great...I think this is one of their best sounding albums ever. And what songs I like, I REALLY LIKE! \\"Ramones\\", a tribute to the band of the same name, is one of my all time favorite Motorhead songs. In a minute and a half, Lemmy and company manage to out Ramone The Ramones, who thought so much of the tune that they would later cover it! \\"Nightmare/The Dreamtime\\" sounds like something Lemmy would have done with Hawkwind and has some backward vocals in it..makes me wish I had this on vinyl! It probably says something like \\"I eat rats and lettuce for dinner and apple pie for lunch\\"...or maybe not. The albums ends on a very quiet and solemn note with the title track, on which Lemmy actually does some real singing. It has organ on it and a military drumbeat. Very good song.<br /><br />I love the refrain for \\"I'm So Bad Baby I Don't Care\\"...there are some other good songs on this as well...just wish I could remember what they were. Most of this is just your typical Motorhead...loud and fast headbanging songs, with plenty of guitar solos and grunting and snarling and bass rumbles. Not completely memorable, but it's far from garbage, too. Overall, Motorhead fans will eat this album up!ust your typical Motorhead...loud and fast headbanging songs, with plenty of guitar solos and grunting and snarling and bass rumbles.

B00006NSGX|4.0|I went to the concert in Boston.  Same song list.  Eric came out by himself with an acoustic guitar and started into \\"Key To the Highway\\".  I also bought the cd edition with the dvd.  Overall, a great concert, the cd and dvd sound great, and the acoustic version of \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" was a real treat. During the recognition of an excellent group of famous musicians, Clapton was playing the intro to \\"Over the Rainbow\\" which was an added treat.
068987474X|5.0|Thanks to the author for this best selling book that is finally clearing up this matter for milliions.  Hopefully, after reading this book many women will begin to see how they are limiting their lives by depending too much on men for their happiness, while neglecting their own emotional needs.  Amelia Earhart, the famous aviatrix of the early 20th Century, would have never flown the Atlantic solo if she depended on a man for her sole happiness.<br /><br />I really have felt bad for women throughout the years who fall for men who just use them and don't have the ability to see their relationship for what it is.  Quite often these very same type of women dump on single women like me as a scapegoat  which is why I'm interested in this subject. I've learned that many times it's not really men's fault in how they often don't have the ability to truly love a woman, it is how their brain has evolved since prehistoric times.  It is also how a woman's brain has evolved, that is far more emotionally based than a man's (studies have confirmed this fact).<br /><br />There are always shades of grey, and nothing is ever black and white, but generally men and women are quite different based on how their brains are wired.  The question is, how can we use this knowledge of how our brains are different to fully harness our ability to co-exist on earth?  It seems many men expect women to trade off their true nature as emotional, sensitive beings in return for power they offer them in the world. The cost is usually at the expense of a woman's own happiness.  This is an injustice as we need more female energy (i.e., love and happiness) on the planet to balance the destructive, hateful, arrogant nature of men and their often misguided conquests in the world.
B000001E3V|5.0|If you buy any Clapton cd, especially any live cd, this is a must have.  Derek and the Dominos, Clapton, at his/their best.  Great song versions extended, adding unbelievable solos and song arrangement.  The emotion is present and you can feel it travel throughout the song list.  The extended versions out do the songs on \\"The Rainbow Concert\\" and bring you to a place where you realize this guy is one of, if not, the best guitarist/song writer/performers alive.  Although most of the latest live cd's sound more commercial and bland, this is the rawest of material well done at a time where Clapton was on his mark.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|The band just ain't the same without Tommy Stuwart. He is one of my favorite drummers. Anyway it sounds like Shannon Larkin is mimicing Tommy's style of play on some songs.It's okay
B000002MFE|5.0|If you have it on cd, get the video/dvd, also.  Clapton at his best with a great lineup backing him during this emotional journey back to the basics and blues.  One of the best sit down, on the spot, versatile jams.  You can hear and feel the emotion during this set and if you can hold down the lump in your throat during \\"Tears in Heaven\\", all the power to you.
0765301598|5.0|Herbert and Anderson's Battle of Corrin answered so many questions about how the structure of the Dune universe came about.  While they were answering those questions, they told a gripping story in and of itself.  A wonderful read!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I am writing this review out of compassion for any person over 13 out there who might be considering watching this.  Not only was the price of admission not worth it, but my time was painfully wasted.  The direction was atrocious, I've seen both stars act in other movies and they were not used properly (Pinnochio has less lumber), I would suggest both actors to find new agents.  The screenwriter should renew their alzheimer's medication prescription.  The story has horrible loopholes, grade school dialogues and takes itself entirely too seriously.  Did George Bush write this?  It wanted to be Die-Hard and Dracula, didn't even get close to either.  It does remind me of Hudson Hawk, but it's not one fourth as funny.    If someone had bothered to market this as a spoof I would be kinder.  It wanted to be funny and I would have appreciated that, even loved it.  Unfortunately it fell flat, horribly so.  I feel bad for the rest of the cast and crew, they did deliver.  The art direction, photography, special effects and costumes were outstanding.  It would have been pleasant to escape into some other time and world for 90 minutes, but its sheer absurdity grounded it permanently.  Stay away, far far away.
1400034779|5.0|Have you ever read a book and when you finished the last page, you felt like a friend had moved out of state? That's the way this book struck me - I really have no idea why I loved it so much, but ever since I finished it last week, I've been feeling a strong desire to get back with Mr. Smith and his Mma Ramotswe - so much so that I drove 50 miles today to buy the next book in the series (I couldn't wait for mail order!) The cover said something to the effect that the book is a \\"celebration of life.\\" Although I totally agree with that assessment, I can't put my finger on the reason that it strikes me that way. The book tells a mildly interesting story about people in a society far simpler than our own - which would ordinarily put me to sleep - but the fact is that I couldn't put it down. I sure hope that Smith continues to write these books - I'm sure not ready to stop yet!
0316666343|5.0|I found this book extremely moving both from the character's point of view and that of her parents.  I admit it did bring a tear to my eye on a few occasions.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable, heartwarming read and I would recommend it.  My only regret is that it wasn't longer. I couldn't put it down!
B0002SROT0|4.0|There's obviously a certain amount of buzz surrounding this record. It's been a full four years since the release of Elliott's last studio album, Figure 8, and practically since that time, fans have been clamoring for the follow up. Rumors of Mr Smith releasing a defining work - the White Album of his time - began to surface. There were whispers of a double-disc release, an epic masterpiece unlike anything in his back catalouge. And of course the biggest bucket of gasoline on the fire was the artist's death under dubious circumstances 363 days before the album sees the light of day.  <br /> <br />In the wake of that tragedy, Rob Schnapf - a former producer and collaborator of Elliott's who worked with him on the masterful Either/Or - and Joanna Bolme - another collaborator in a similar fashion, as well as an ex-girlfriend - worked together to piece the completed tracks into a posthumous release. The result stands as a 15 song, single-CD collection that isn't quite the godsend it was rumored to be, but certainly stands with the best work of a very talented songwriter.  <br /> <br />Were one to listen to Smith's six albums in order, there's a certain entropic element in the musical progression (not to mention that each record gets progressively longer - this clocks in just shy of an hour - six minutes longer than Figure 8 and nearly twice as long as Smith's solo debut Roman Candle. But I digress). From A Basement on the Hill continues in that tradition, as is evident right from the bombastic opening of 'Coast to Coast.' A spooky string ensemble gives way to a distorted and percussive bombast, typical of the harder-edged songs on this album. In addition, the electric-sludge mix of 'Don't Go Down' and the epic 'Shooting Star' (Smith's longest studio recording that I know of at six minutes) assure that this is the most \\"rock\\" album in the singer/songwriter's catalouge.  <br /> <br />While the bulk of the songs fall into a pleasant middle ground, these powerhouse, wall-of-sound tracks are balanced out by quieter throwbacks to the more acoustic-driven style of Elliott's Kill Rock Stars albums (the self-titled work and the aforementioned Either/Or). The most obvious of these is 'The Last Hour,' an underprodouced vocal harmony and acoustic guitar track. The somewhat more uptempo 'Let's Get Lost' and the somber 'Little One' are a bit slicker sounding, but would still be at home on earlier works.  <br /> <br />There are elements of the adventurous nature of this record scattered about here and there. For example, both 'Coast to Coast' and the superb 'King's Crossing' contain found-vocal samples and the latter takes nearly two minutes for the vocal to kick in - a change from Smith's typically very direct style. And then, there's 'Ostrich & Chirping' - a hallucinatory intermission that sounds like something out of a 1940's Disney movie.  <br /> <br />For the first time, full lyrics are not included in the liner notes for the album - quite probably because of Elliott's passing. Instead, actual handwritten lyric sheets (one on hotel stationery, another obviously crumpled up at one point and all contaning cross-outs and margin scribbles) appear for a handful of the songs. But the vocals are mixed very cleanly and Elliott's characteristic themes of loss, addiction, death and anger manage to shine through. It's difficult not to reflect on Elliott's death when listening to Basement, but viewing the album as a suicide note is very much unfair, given the time period during which most of the songs were written (largely 2000-2002, to my knowledge). However, tracks like 'A Fond Farewell' with lines like \\"A dying man in a living room / whose shadow paces the floor / who'll take you out any open door / this is not my life / it's just a fond farewell to a friend / who couldn't get things right\\" or 'A Passing Feeling' which laments \\"Though I'm beyond belief / in the help I require / just to exist at all / took a long time to stand / took an hour to fall\\"do take on a new poigniancy.  <br /> <br />The standout tracks here are the aforementioned 'King's Crossing,' and 'Twilight' - an absolutely heartbreaking ballad midway through with a devastatingly beautiful instrumental verse that's just icing on the cake. The record's closer is also noteworthy. The awkwardly titled 'A Distorted Reality is Now a Necessity to Be Free' has been renovated from the quirky b-side that appeared in late 2003. It now stands as a guitar driven crescendo and an acerbic political statement that closes things on a definite high note.  <br /> <br />There's some question, of course, as to how this version of the album would stand against what we might have seen had Elliott lived to oversee it's release. Unfortunately, it's one of those things we'll never have the answer to, but what we do have is a very fine album, to be sure. It's not as raw as Either/Or or as immediately accessable as XO, which are generally regarded to be his two finest works. But nor is it as fussy and relatively emotionless (relatively being the operative word there) as Figure 8. Instead, I'd go so far to say that, because of how it was finally created, Basement is probably the most peculiar balance of a raw unpolished messiness and carefully constructed melody, and it's certainly the biggest \\"grower\\" (that is to say that it takes a little time to really appreciate) in Elliott's catalouge. The only taint on this worthy addition to the canon, is that it is the final work, yet it seems to sit right on the edge of something incredibly profound, and just as elusive. Though maybe that, in and of itself, is a testament to a great man's genius.  <br />
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Why waste your time reading all the reviews? <br /> <br />I couldn't believe they put ONLY A MATTER OF TIME on this DVD - this song alone is worth the entire DVD. <br /> <br />Go go go .... buy it right now - you know it's only a matter of time. <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I'm currently serving in the british military and have recently purchased and viewed this program. After watching this I can honestly say that you guys have a lot to worry about, your government seems very shady and corrupt (I'm not saying ours isn't) If I lived in the states I'd truly be worried about how freedoms were being eroded away. Your elections from 2000 were quite obviously fixed.... this film brings up many interesting questions and answers a lot of them... truly worrying and to think our 'enlightened leader' likes to follow in your 'President's' Shoes. Also From what I could see you don't currently have any black members in your senate..... that's not exactly representing the people in your country is it? or don't you have a hell of a lot of black and hispanic people? At one point I was all for this country mirroring itself on america but after seeing this and reading of your 'Patriot Act' I think were better of staying as we are.
B00005RRG9|3.0|When reading all these reviews with phrases like 'Who needs a remake?' I just have to point out that the Hayley Mills version of 'The Parent Trap' is a remake as well. The first movie version of Erich Kstners book 'Lisa and Lotti/Das doppelte Lottchen' is a german film from the 1950's. For that film Kstner himself wrote the screenplay and participated in it as the narrator, providing interesting and funny comments. It was very true to the book and still worked perfectly as as film.  <br />The Disney version is fun to watch (and I really like Hayley Mills as an actress) but I wouldn't call this movie the definite version of the 'Parent Trap' story. It lacks the spirit of Kstner.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This film would make the propaganda masters of the Stalin-era Soviet Union and the 1940s German Socialist party very proud.
0736041850|4.0|This book helps your training with great pictures. But I would not recommend it for buying because it will lead you to bodybuilding philosophy of training peripheral muscles, which lead to injuries and deformities. The narcissism in bodybuilding is in my humble opinion wrong, and this book would lead you towards bad aims. So, you better buy book \\"Essentials of Weightlifting & Strength training\\" by Mr. Mohamed El-Hewie to get the real grasp of health and weightlifting.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Thanks for such thoughtful comments about this movie. I can't help but take the messages to heart. I normally think these kinds of forums should stick to commentary about the production skills or acting or writing of a movie. In this case, I want to go along with others who have talked about personal responses to this amazing movie. I related a lot to Satine. As the reviews point out she is as much a hero in this as Christian. They just have different roads to follow before they can be what I would call redeemed. I opted in my 20's for a comfortable life and I think my reasons were not bad reasons. I was not a materialistic person. I care about people and am voting Kerry even though it might hurt me financially. Just like Satine I found myself a little trapped. I met the love of my life 10 years ago. I denied my feelings for him because his life choices were sort of threatening I guess. He's a school teacher and makes much less money than I do. I hear he is very happy and now married with two kids. I married a man with a lot of money and we eventually got divorced due to all the cheating and the fact that he spent more time with his cars than he ever did with me. Good thing we did not have kids. I did not follow all of my values and I regret not having tried to make things work with the wonderful guy. This movie and the reviews about it make me want to reevaluate how I live my life. I might not be with the man I love but then again neither is Satine since she dies. I do feel like I can not be afraid to love the next penniless poet I meet though. I also think I have become too wedded to my things just like my ex-husband.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Everybody has said just about all there is to say about this little gem. A quirky little film that revels in its' own quirkiness. Marianne Sagebrecht is an absolute joy & watching her underplay & yet invite sympathy is a pleasure one doesn't receive very often in cinema anymore. Watch CCH Pounder slow melt to the \\"magic\\". Both performances are revelatory. It's full of magical characters who aren't going anywhere & you know what? I wouldn't want them to. They're perfect right where they are.
0790729342|5.0|After a brief prologue that details the events that led to a Nuclear War and the high points of the first film, the action begins and essentially doesn't end for an hour and a half, featuring one great chase scene after another.<br /><br />It's funny, Waterworld used almost the exact same plot except on water and it was a very poor movie, whereas this is a very good movie.  A lot of that can be attributed to the acting of Mel Gibson as the taciturn loner Max, and Director George Miller, with his flair for car chases.  The plot is simple: Max is a haunted loner who drives perpetually through the outback of Australia.  He comes across a refining station, defending their oil agaisnt hordes of marauders led by the Humongous.  These marauders are, for lack of a better word, rather gay.  The same trend existed in the first Max film, and why George Miller must make his villains homosexual is beyond me.  Perhaps he thinks the audience will hate them more if they are sexual deviants.  However, this is the only flaw (aside from un-neccesary and sometimes grating sped-up footage) in the film.<br /><br />In any event, the defenders of the refinery need someone to find a rig capable of towing their gasoline tanker, and ultimately drive it.  Max is eventually enlisted in both tasks.<br /><br />This film is a visual feast, with flame-throwers and razor-boomerangs, colorful characters, lots of crashes and explosions, sweet cars and great car chases.  Up there with Aliens for best action movies ever made. 8/10
B0001NBMBC|5.0|It's hard to find words that explain greatness. Which is what this album is. Vol. 3 The Subliminal Verses is nothing short of pure greatness. Its the best album I've heard since Slipknot's self-titled debut album. There isn't a bad song on this CD. You can turn your CD player on random and just let it play without skipping any song. The problem is that most people of the world will always want something to whine and complain about. The people that complained about Slipknot before, saying that they have all the problems with their sound, are now the same people calling them sell-outs for growing as a band and changing their sound a little. Slipknot has proven that they are more than mindless cursing and screaming about the things they hate. Corey has proven he has an amazing voice (for screaming or just singing). I'm not going to do a song by song review but I would lake to point out the fact that as a true MAGGOT, everytime I hear Pulse Of The Maggots I get chills. I recomend this album to anyone and everyone if I could give more than 5 stars I would.  <br /> <br />WE WON'T DIE!!!
068987474X|1.0|I ran right out and bought this book after its appearance on the Oprah show.  I thought it would provide some fascinating insight into interpersonal relationships.  I cried periodically as I devoured the book in one sitting.  I would caution that this book has limited utility for female kind.  First, as was reflected in the show, this book is probably best suited for those who date frequently and without a lot of discretion.  Therefore if you're not one of those women who is gratuitously handing out your phone number at bars or sizing up every man you meet this book isn't for you.  As evidenced on the show, most of the guys on it (and the prototype expounded on in the book) couldn't get a date with most women.  They are playboys and that's evident.  Not all men are like this.  Second, this is a very negative, male-centric way to view relationships.  There's something about hearing \\"he's just not that in to you\\" that is very hurtful--even if that \\"he\\" isn't particularly attractive/desirable/special to the woman.  My theory is that women take this as some slight to their value as people, and this is often just ingrained in us via society.  Instead, if the book is true to its stated purpose, it should be entitled, \\"IF You Have to Make Excuses for a Guy--You're Just Not That in to Him.\\"  The authors tout this as the maxim behind their acerbic title, and I think they have a point.  But the book isn't very scientific--it's undergirded by anecdotal evidence, which often includes 20 or so guys that are in the author's ilk.  Liz Tuccillo's commentary is nice, but it is bothersome that it take a backseat to her egomaniacal co-author.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any of my girlfriends, adn I have had a myriad of discussions with male friends (all respectable guys) who think the concepts in teh book are oversimplified and mostly untrue.  I can sum up the message without veiling it in all the rejection and the negativity that the authors package it in: Respect yourself andknow that you are good enough to have a man who wants to date you, will pursue you, honor you and treat you like someone special.  If a man isn't making you feel wanted and loved you should move on.  It doesn't matter whether he's in to you or not.  What matters is how you feel about him.  Save your money on this one and don't perpetuate this exaltation of male fancy!
0452282152|5.0|I usually don't have patience with most \\"literary\\" novels, but this book was breathtaking!  It was a short easy read.  It completely took me back in time to Vermeer's Holland.  The author did an incredible job of taking you into the mind of this woman.  Our bookclub read this book and everybody loved it!
B0002KVUL6|1.0|How anybody can even beging to enjoy this movie is beyond me really. <br />Lets break it down shall we? First the acting...if you can call it that is very, very bad. Hugh Jackman and Kate (both of who I enjoy in other movies) are both horrible here, but I'm putting more blame on the director then them. Then we have the rest of the crew, all of which are horrible also, the only good acting IMO was Frankenstein to be honest, he was the only good thing in the entire movie for me. <br />Next the action, we'll you'd think that a movie that has a budget of over 150 million would at least have some amazing action in it right...WRONG. It's so akward, clumsy, cheesey and crappy that you can't even get into it. Kate bounces around the sets like she's a Gummy Bear, and most of the monsters look horrible, I've seen better CGI in movies that only cost 4 million to make. Sad. <br />Now let's talk about the CGI and special effects...they were also bad. The werewolves looked like they were done for a saturday morning cartoon, and Hyde looked like a flesh colored Shrek, and sounded like a complete moron with that HORRIBLE voice they gave him. <br />I gave this movie one star for only one reason (other then that's all the lower you can rate things on here) and that reason is because of the extra's that come along with the DVD. It includes the orignal monster films (dracula, frankenstein, and the wolf man) and it's packed with tons of extras, but that is no reason to buy this POS movie. The movie it's self is actually lower then 0 stars, it's more like a -5.
078401213X|5.0|An excellent film that you will need to see it few times to catch some clues. *****
B00005JMJG|5.0|A fascinating early 21st century fable and one of the most beautiful American movies to come along in ages. Michael Gondry is blessed with a cast that seems to have trusted his direction and was equally responsive to every idea presented, and fearless executing every moment. <br /> <br />Jim Carrey is offered his best role to date and he not only doesn't disappointment he proves himself to be me more than clownish cartoon characters he too frequently (and easily) settles into.  It is a remarkably affecting and touching performance. <br /> <br />Kate Winslet is once again the chameleon and her Clementine while initially straightforward and uncomplicated beguilingly shows how many facets this character has behind her.  It's a fascinating portrait.   <br /> <br />The remainder of the ensemble, the art direction, sound and every other aspect of this movie set a standard for the new century.  I hope we're up to it! <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|One of the strongest movies I ever seen. Its incredible how the movie can catch your attention on the way that you feel that you are there. Is another amazing film by darren aronofsky (Pi's Director)Is a good film that everyone should see.
B000062YAZ|4.0|While my personal favorite Slayer is Divine Intervention, no one can call themselves a fan without knowing every syllable of Reign in Blood.  It's the first \\"must have\\" album for a myriad of reasons. You can skip (but really shouldn't) Show No Mercy, and Hell Awaits and go right to Reign in Blood and understand what this band is all about musically (though, if you're a fan at all you'd better have Seasons in the Abyss).   <br /> <br />The combination of violent speed metal with riffs that are the aural equivalent of a ton has seldom been done better than here - even by Slayer themselves.  Angel of Death, Necrophobic, and the delightful Jesus Saves are reasons enough to listen to this reckless joyride.  Get on! <br />
068987474X|4.0|Whoever you are, P Rice, your opinions are disgusting. This book was valuable in telling women that you are worth more than waiting by the phone or settling for someone who doesn't really like you. Your whole \\"stick to your own kind\\" theory isn't baseless, but it is hopelessly shallow. I can't believe someone who I guess is relatively intelligent honestly believes that's the way to a fulfilling relationship. Shame on you. You obvisouly didn't even give this great book a chance. Women everywhere - read it and take heart that not everyone out there is a P Rice.
B000002IOY|5.0|I gotta ask:  who has more fun screaming about violent death and dying than Overkill?  Seriously.   <br /> <br />At the end of 1989 there could be no more joyously rapturous psalm about annihilation than Bobby's Ellsworth's shouts of \\"eliminate, eliminate!\\" where voice, energy and tune all effectively convey the band's fever pitch frustration.   <br /> <br />My friends and I all had whiplash by the end of the year! <br /> <br />This is one of the earlier efforts of Overkill - and still one of the best.   <br /> <br />Remember:  Mirror man make you die! <br />
B0001AP14E|5.0|Though I don't listen to near as much rap music as I do other genres, I find this release to be very focused, different, and very refreshing! \\"The College Dropout\\" is very different from other rap albums and for me ranks up there with the likes of OutKast's double album \\"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below\\". Kanye's style of rap is different, and something about it makes it unique. As well as that, the production of this album is flawless!  This album resembles (for me at least) albums of the past that showcased \\"hits\\" as opposed to 2 or 3 solid songs.  Here's my rundown of the hits on this album: \\"We Don't Care\\", \\"All Falls Down\\" (it is ashamed Syleena Johnson is as underrated as she is), \\"Spaceship\\", \\"Jesus Walks\\", \\"School Spirit\\", \\"The New Workout Plan\\", and this is just to name a few.  Furthermore, the interludes are not dumb and work well with this album.  Kanye, I hope your next album is just as good, if not better (hopefully even better) than this masterpiece! 5 stars!
B000062YAY|4.0|One of the best live albums ever.  Slayer takes the show on the road here and offers up what we've come to expect from them.  Hard hitting, never less than challenging, the music is an electrified, pulse pounding frenzy and from the time you hit play with \\"Hell Awaits\\" there is no turning back from the entire experience.  Weightiness and fun all combine in this show of shows and Slayer never disappoints.   <br /> <br />The men show themselves to be the stuff of legend.  Nothing can be improved here - nothing that could have been tweaked in a studio could have any more relevance than what sheer talent, drive and energy can provide onstage.  The audience ate them up.  So will you. <br />
B00005JMUA|4.0|I like this one, a lot. Probably better than Vol 1. It's got a better story line. It does not have any of the \\"over the top\\" blood and gore that most people think it has.  Overall, a good sequel.
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|Wow, wow, wow. I haven't been this excited by an album after only a few spins since...I dunno, maybe Opeth's Blackwater Park. For those of you who are familiar with Green Carnation's Light of Day, Day of Darkness, this is what that album SHOULD have sounded like. Mabool is a wildly ambitious concept, pompous and pretentious - the kind of album that usually falls flat on its face but occasionally, just ocassionally, reveals a masterpiece. Mabool is one of those rare albums that fall in the latter category.  <br /> <br />For all its brilliance, Light of Day, Day of Darkness  too often reverted to monotone vocals and recycled chugging riffs. Mabool, on the other hand, never falters and consistently challenges musical norms. The vocals range from deep spoken-word, to chant, to Akerfeldt-style clean vocals and finally death growls. All styles are excellent and the harmonies are highly original and of a standard rarely seen in metal. The album is never truly aggressive - even in the heaviest passages with growls, they retain a peaceful quality (yes, this is a contradiction but listen to Agalloch if you don't believe this is possible).  <br /> <br />Musically, the folk element is strong, like Amorphis in the Tales and Elegy days. It is never stagnant, changing with the frequency of Opeth, but not as abruptly. While Opeth revel in jolting stylistic changes, Orphaned Land's music shifts more subtly and seamlessly.  <br /> <br />The lyrics have their inspiration in Jewish mythology. I can't quite figure out whether these guys are Zionist nutters, or whether they just like a good fantasy story. Either way, it only adds to the atmosphere of the album (and they are certainly no worse than some of the equally ridiculous satanic stuff coming from Scandanavia).  <br /> <br />'Folk metal' is now a fully fledged genre in its own right, and one of the most interesting in metal right now, including the likes of Orphaned Land, Amorphis, Skyclad, Ulver and Agalloch. So-called 'progressive' bands like Dream Theater would do well to sit up and take notice. With Mabool, Orphaned Land have set a new benchmark.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This gift set of \\"That's Entertainment\\" has to be one of the great DVD values. The three movies with incredible sound and brilliant colors and a fourth DVD with extras galore. I didn't even realize there was more extras on the B side including almost an hour of deleted songs. I just spent the past weekend watching the entire series. I never saw Part 3 before and it was just as impressive as the first two. What a great holiday gift this will be for anybody who loves all the great musicals from the past. This collection was done beautifully and it is now among the crown jewels of my ever expanding DVD library..
B0002SROT0|5.0|Trully a work of art, something very beautiful for anybody who has a true heart. goodbye elliott, we miss you.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I know because I AM one!  I love monster movies of all kinds and Van Helsing is no exception.  True, it is not a masterpiece in filmaking.   <br />I don't care.  It is entertaining and makes use of screen characters who have sat on the shelf for way too long. <br />Yep, I'm talking about Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man. <br />These are updated, reinvisioned versions.  Some people have a problem with this, but as long as you don't count it as Universal Monsters canon, you shouldn't have a problem. <br />So, here's a short run down of what's good in my humble opinion: <br /> <br />1.  Use of characters.  Lots of monsters!  Vampires, werewolves,Frankenstewin, Mr. Hyde, I almost expected the Gillman to pop up.  Oh well, maybe in the sequel. <br /> <br />2.  The action and SFX are solid.  I kno it looks like a cartoon, but it is STYLIZED! They are intentionally stled to look cartoonish. <br /> <br />3.  The plot is ORIGINAL.  It is totally different from ALL the original Monster movies.   <br /> <br />4.  The Costumes and Sets are AMAZING.  The film is worth seeing for them alone. Character wardobes fit the characters perfectly and the setting rovide the perfect air for the film. <br /> <br />So, take it or leave it.  If you want to check it out, go ahead, its a fun popcorn ride. <br />Classic film of the ages?  Probably not. <br />But, I shall say it again...IT IS FUN!
B0002SROT0|5.0|I remember going to see Good Will Hunting and hearing something I liked but never really looking into who it might be. Fast forward a couple of years to around 2000 when I was at my tattoo artists studio(Thanks Adam!!). He was playing something that sounded great and I asked who it was. He told me his name was Elliott Smith. Well as they say the rest is history. I picked up Either/Or, XO and Figure 8 and then eventually got his indie releases along with his earlier work with Heatmiser.   To say that Mr.Smith was a brilliant songwriter and musician would be an understatement. On every album there is something that touches a different emotion inside me as it does with many other fans and this last album is no different. From start to finish it shows just how much he still had left to offer. I'm glad to see that the powers that be saw fit to release this final chapter from someone who gave us music that would take most others ten lifetimes to create.   It's hard to give a song by song review because I love them all. Some that really stand out for me are pretty(ugly before), don't go down, strung out again, a fond farewell, memory lane, twilight, etc... I did prefer the 7\\" version of a distorted reality but that isn't that big of a deal in the big picture. Elliott you will always be remembered by those who love you as someone who brought beauty into the world by your music. You have touched more people then you could ever imagine.    XO
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 had covered a lot of ground in its first four studio albums, from adolescent post-punk to ambient experimentalism, free-form abstraction and political punditry. What the band had not yet done, however, was manage to craft a genuine masterpiece - an album which would be mentioned in the same breath as, say, HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED or STICKY FINGERS. With THE JOSHUA TREE, that finally happened, and it's easy to hear why. Building on the various textures and concepts of its predecessors, THE JOSHUA TREE outdoes them all: it's bigger than BOY, more introspective than OCTOBER, tighter and more topical than WAR and more atmospheric than THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE. This is an indisputable epic, almost certainly the greatest rock album of the 1980s, bar none.     Retaining the services of FIRE producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, while bringing back original producer Steve Lillywhite to mix a number of key tracks, U2 wisely chose to tie together a lot of the musical strings of its first four LPs in order to create a career-defining sound and sensibility on its fifth. With its wide-open-spaces imagery and implied longing for a freedom the singer knows will never be found in this world, WHERE THE STREETS HAVE NO NAME remains perhaps the band's definitive anthem, an opening salvo so driving you barely notice that it's really built on an extremely simple melody, endlessly repeated and intensified, with no solos or even very much in the way of sonic trickery. The more restrained and dour I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR essentially replays that melody (or at least its equivalent) at half-speed, while the soul-wrenching ballad WITH OR WITHOUT YOU slows it down yet again for maximum emotional effect before exploding into a now-famed howling climax. Politics come in - and how! - on BULLET THE BLUE SKY, one of U2's hardest-rocking numbers and a poignant reminder that the America this album is all about has a very dark side. One could easily imagine a band like Aerosmith having written and recorded the instrumental track of this song, and after the chiming 4/4 melody which stretches through the first three tunes the assault is doubly striking. Keeping Americana firmly in the foreground, RUNNING TO STAND STILL employs acoustic slide guitar and teary harmonica to add some down-home grit to a harrowing and beautifully sung dope story. For a band which had never so much as touched country or blues in any direct fashion before, U2 pulls off an amazing feat on THE JOSHUA TREE by fully absorbing American influences into its European sound without any awkwardness whatsoever.     While THE JOSHUA TREE is a prime example of U2's career-long practice of \\"front-loading\\" albums by placing most or all of the singles and other radio-friendly tracks early in the running order, the second half (side two of the original vinyl release) actually offers a stronger and more varied set of songs overall. Opening with the fully orchestrated RED HILL MINING TOWN, a mile-wide tale of a doomed middle-American community and its doomed family relationships, then jumping straightaway into the irresistable pop-rock of IN GOD'S COUNTRY, a bracing three-minute jewel, this is where the substance of THE JOSHUA TREE is in fact fully formed. TRIP THROUGH YOUR WIRES seamlessly marries American blues and European music hall traditions, while ONE TREE HILL is perhaps the album's emotional apex, a brilliant and moving work which ties all of the album's strains together in a powerful performance. EXIT and MOTHERS OF THE DISAPPEARED are a fine one-two closer, the former all hard rock and streetwise attitude and the latter a haunting tale of murder and loss with the dark legacy of American foreign policy once more rearing its head.     THE JOSHUA TREE - there's nothing else like it.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|All right now, this movie has gotten a lot of bad reviews. With good reason some say, I'm not one of these. Let me start by saying this: The movie is a campy crossover style tale that throws Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstien's monster, and several other notable horror creatures together for about two hours of CGI action. Stop. Read that again. Now consider this: What kind of plot, characterizations, and entertainment factor is something like this going to provide?     If you are expecting some sort of masterpiece, a triumph in action filming... This movie just isn't for you. If you are looking for a movie with a solid, sensical plot... This movie isn't really for you. Because honestly, when Frankenstien's monster is the key to some evil plot schemed by Dracula, can you really expect all that much?     However! I'd like to state that if you are just a horror loving person that's not afraid to operate under the \\"it doesn't have to make sense\\" rule... If you get excited at the mere mention of vampires or werewolves... If you just love hours of top notch special effects with a plot you don't have to think about to have fun with... Then this is the movie for you.    So yes, while the hard core, Bram Stoker's Dracula loving, film reviewer in me weeps at such a horrible mush of cliches and over-the-top acting... The part of me that is compelled to watch the SciFi Channel's weekend \\"originals\\" drools at the thought of being able to sit down for a fun movie featuring some of my favorite monsters duking it out.

B0002S94OS|4.0|I got a copy of this disc from a friend...  I'm hooked.  I'll admit, I am not a metalhead by any stretch (this sits next to Al Green in the jukebox, you get the idea), but I really like this album.  This CD has all the components of good metal: the guitar riffs are articulate, the drums have that metal throbbing pulse which sounds so cool, and the vocals are sufficiently throaty/gravelly/hellish sounding.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because some of the tracks lack originality...  some of this CD could just be one long track.  Otherwise, everything sounds good and would be a worthwhile purchase.
B000683VI4|5.0|The best movie i have ever seen. I have never cried harder in my life, or left a theater happier.  I saw it 3 times, and can't wait to be able to watch it again.
0060527978|5.0|This has to be one the greatest books written. it has the simplicity, that even a child can read it, and the complexity that just one phrase will have you thinking for hours about it. It has a small story, and that story shows how anyone can attain what they truly want. You can read this book once, and then again and again and again. The book is nothing with too much philosophical or other kind of views, it has very understandable parts to it. You wouldnt want to put this book down after you read the first page!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Been waiting a long long time for this-shame its not complete. Like most others I would pay much more for the full gig. I was there that day at Wembley in 1985, one of the most amazing days of my life. Just in reply to previous reviews, Judas Priest most certainly did not perform at Wembley. And to the guy in Australia fed up with the interruptions pleading for money-you obviously don't get it pal, this concert was all about making money for the starving in africa. I hope the clip of Bob Geldof using the F word on the BBC whilst urging people to donate is included here. It was always about charity - I hope the profits from this DVD go to the Band Aid Trust. None of the staff at the Wembley gig took payment for their services (unlike the Philadelphia concert). Feed the world!
B000068MKZ|5.0|my husband is french and i look for anything i can listen to that will help me learn the language. my sister in-law had me listen to this cd because of the song raphael (also my husbands name). i was happy to note how close my husband fits the song :-) <br />i love how she makes the music and the words come to life, you feel the mood she is trying to make.. not just the feeling that she can make a good cd for only the money like some other artists... it just has this feeling that grips you.. in other words i like it and i hope you do to :-)
B0002S94OS|2.0|I'm unsure how anyone could classify this album as complex or good metal.  The guitars are mediocre at best, the vocals are more prominent than the music and I find them to be pretty awful.  The only thing they have going for them are the drums. <br /> <br />Also, pretty much every song (aside from the title track) sounds the same.  Songs that stood out the most were Laid to Rest, Blood of the Scribe, and What I've Become.  The rest I didnt find to be entertaining in the least. <br /> <br />If you're looking for good metal, might as well look to their tour buddies Children of Bodom and Fear Factory, and others, i.e. In Flames, Killswitch Engage, Dark Tranquillity, Soilwork, Opeth, etc etc etc. <br />
B000096IB6|3.0|I really didn't think I was going to like DAREDEVIL all that much. I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck and when I heard he had been cast as the vengeful Matthew Murdock, I thought &#34;Well, the movie is doomed.&#34; Fortunately, this is one time where Affleck rises to his potential and adds to a film's value instead of decreasing it.<br /><br />Matt Murdock (Affleck) is a powerful lawyer who has given up all opportunities to make a fortune in corporate law and instead has returned to his boyhood neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen in New York City to mostly work on pro bono cases. As a child Murdock was left blind in a bizarre chemical accident. However, the accident that took his sight has heightened all his other senses to a supernatural level. At the end of his work day as a lawyer, Murdock goes home and changes into a costume and become Daredevil, the man with no fear. Daredevil is really starting to clean up the crime in Hell's Kitchen and New York's biggest crime boss, the Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) doesn't like it one bit. So, he sends an Irish assassin, Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to get rid of Daredevil. Along the way, a female vigilante named Elektra shows up on the scene and gets in the way of everything. She falls in love with Matt, but doesn't like Daredevil that much because she believes he's preventing her from killing the man who was responsible for her father's death, Kingpin. And so as the world turns, these are the days of comic book heroes' lives.<br /><br />DAREDEVIL is a very entertaining movie. It's full of action, lots of pretty stars who do a decent job at acting, witty humor, cool special effects, awesome sets, and sweet costumes. However, there is one component that keeps the movie from rising above an average comic book movie: a plot without any holes. Overall the movie moves along alright, but every once in awhile there is a scene and the audience goes &#34;where did that come from.&#34; Somebody either screwed up in editing or the writing left too much to the imagination. Either way, you can't leave too much to the imagination in a comic book movie; a little, yes, but not a lot and there's way too much missing in DAREDEVIL. Still, if you can overlook the occasional plot holes, DAREDEVIL is a thrill to watch.oo much to the imagination.

B0002OERI0|3.0|OK, Im probably gonna make a lotta people mad by saying this but outside of Green day,Nirvana(if they count), and Blink 182, I HATE PUNK ROCK, mostly those good charlotte queers. I hate that life and death crap so good charlotte can go jump into a swamp with an aligator that eats them up just like they eat people's money up! Any way on to the review. This CD has a lot of good songs like american idiot, and shes a rebel, except that sound thats in all punk rock makes it so I can't love this CD, but its pretty good, and if you like this I reccomend 2 even better Green Day albums, Dookie, and Warning! So before you get this get those.
1401301010|5.0|First off I want to say that several of the other reviews on here are misleading for all the wrong reasons. Obviously many of the other reviewers bought the book expecting to read all about the chili peppers, bad mistake on their part. If you wrote the story of your life would you talk all about your job, or would you talk about the experiences that made you who you are today. With that aside, the book is an amazing collection of all the things that Anthony has been through as an addict, punk, lover, fighter, survivor, friend and human. There are many detailed stories of sex, drugs, and rock n roll. Some might see this as repetitive but it is the life he has lived. If you truly are a red hot fan you will love the book as it gives insight as to where many songs came from, and the man behind the music. It is great to hear all the tales of a funky punk madman who helped create one of the best and most unique bands of all time. Bottom line if you are reading this you obviously like the band, so do yourself a favor get the book, read it with an open mind, and enjoy!!!
B000002L7V|5.0|This is the first (and only, so far)Dio album I bought. I am a new fan...I enjoyed ronnie in BS so I checked this band out.  <br /> I own this album on vinyl, and it is one of the best vinyl purchases ive made so far. I love every song on it. The guitaring is excellent and the \\"cheese-factor\\" (some 80s keyboarding)is actually kind of cool to hear from Dio. I especially enjoy \\"King of Rock N Roll\\" and \\"Sacred Heart\\". \\"King\\" is an excellent album opener. <br />  I've heard most of \\"Holy Diver\\" on LaunchCast radio, and I gotta say, I like 'Sacred Heart\\" much better. To all Dio fans and non-fans: give this album a chance! Once it grows on you, you can't get enough and look forward to every song on the record. <br /> Also, I must say, I am proud to be the first chick to review this album :-)  .
B0001LJC2K|5.0|If I have one thing to say    Those who think Matthew Cook, the apparent person worthy of reviewing Muse - Absolution on Amazon, wrote an absolutely disgraceful review.... vote YES    What in the world is this man talking about. \\"this album is unoriginal\\". He has not listened to it and it shows. \\"muse carries the torch ... unaware its running in circles\\". PLease, that is the laziest, and most ignorant piece of reviewing ive heard.     Aweful! It is a poor reflection on what Absolution has done and it should be removed!
0399241515|5.0|This book is great. My school had the author come so they decided to get some copies from Europe. I just finished the book and there's a lot of action. There is only one problem about this book; there is a HUGE dropoff, but that kind of makes it obvious that there will be a #6 book is the series.
B000089RV6|5.0|This is a classic CD.  I was in high school when it came out.  I remember the rock n roll coming out of the speakers and hearing the song 'you shook me all night long' for the first time.  I remember AC DC being the ire of every religious group out there.  They caused a stir, and they really offered up a great taste of rock n roll rebellion.<br /><br />Now remastered and touched up, with a great package with awesome pictures... well that is all good, but the music still holds well and sounds good everytime you put it on.<br /><br />The sound is a lot better on this one, obviously some of the REMASTERED releases don't sometimes live up to the title, but this one does sound very good.<br /><br />If you remember this from your youth, or you want raw rock and roll to hear for the first time, this is the CD to go out and rock out to.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the best recordings to just crank up loudly in a car.  I think so anyway!!<br /><br />Have fun!!

B0000028VT|5.0|By the time Mariah Carey released her fourth album, \\"Music Box\\", she had learned the rules of the music industry and was at the top of her game.  She knew exactly what her listeners wanted to hear and she gave it to us too!  This could explain why the album had four singles which were released.<br />  \\"Music Box\\" is an album which is almost full of ballads.  If you are looking for Mariah to belt out fast tunes, you should not be thinking of buying \\"Music Box\\" because it's mostly slow songs.  The best fast-tempoed song on the album is \\"Dream Lover\\".  This song has a catchy chorus and a nice beat.  This was the album's first single and was an immediate chart topper for the only female singer who has sold 100 million records.  \\"Hero\\" is an inspirational song about finding the hero within yourself.  Mariah showcases that amazing seven octave range she has in this song.  This song also went on to be a huge success on the charts.  \\"Never Forget You\\" is my favorite song on the album.  This song was written and produced by Babyface.  The song is about someone losing someone but hopes to see them again.<br />  After listening to \\"Music Box\\", one will see that it is evident that Mariah has been called the best singer of her time by critics and fans.  If you want one Mariah Carey CD, this should be the one.  After you listen to this CD, you will yearn for more...ENCORE!<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br />1. Never Forget You<br />2.

068987474X|3.0|I don't particularly care for self-help type books, because most of them make blanket statements about broad subjects, and this one was no different for the most part.  However, it is refreshing to see that someone has the guts to say certain things about the male mind that are so true.  I can't speak for the woman's point of view on any of this, so please bear with me. <br /> <br />As a male, the bottom line is that I go after what I really want.  It sounds stupid, because I consider myself a \\"nice, friendly\\" guy, but when it comes to dating, I'm interested in you or I'm not.  Period.  If I \\"connect\\" with somebody, I will do whatever it takes to seek you out, I will return your calls, and I'll want to hang out with you on weekends.  It isn't that difficult to figure out, really.  It feels like these guys are giving away all the gentlemanly secrets! <br /> <br />I think it's overly simplistic to say that a woman shouldn't call a man on the phone or whatever (because I, for one, don't mind it), but the better point is that women shouldn't try to force the relationship, especially anything that would lead a man to think that you are trying to change him.  That's something you definitely won't see in your relationship handbook.  In my dating life, I put up the blockers instantly when I sense that a woman is trying to make a power play with me, like suggesting that she move in when I'm not ready, etc. <br /> <br />From this book, I would say that men can learn how to be more aware of the signals that women give off and act accordingly.  Most men are aware of \\"desperate\\" women and a lot of times it's like shooting fish in barrel if you're horny enough.  The biggest knock on desperate women is that they are looking to define themselves through a man, which is almost a guarantee that they'll never be happy. <br /> <br />
B00005JJX8|4.0|\\"To catch a thief\\" is one of Hitchcock's less heralded efforts. On the surface, it is easy to see why. The film's plot is simple, the tone is light and the suspense sequences are sporadic. But nonetheless, there is plenty here to enjoy. The film benefits from Hitchcock's usual visual meticulousness and style as he utilizes the french backdrop to produce some truly elegant and picturesque compositions. While Grant's and Kelly's sardonic yet charismatic performances are a major asset to this charming, low-key thriller. Hitchcock also imbues the film with an undertone of social commentary about class conflicts and their effects, while the climactic set-piece that takes place on the roof tops at night, is pure Hitchcock suspense ingenuity. Although the film may be a bit leisurely paced for some, it does pay off at the end to sit through it, as it is a very enjoyable and compelling film experience.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|Although everyone is entitled to their opinion, I strongly do not agree with \\"focus Santan focus'\\" review.  First of all he should learn to spell, that helps in writing a review.  When this album came out, it was radically different than what the public was expecting.  The public was still feeling the repercussions of \\"Oye Como Va\\" and \\"Black Magic Woman.\\"  This album reflects perhaps what Carlos was listening alot to.  Which must have been Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" or Pharaoh Sanders \\" Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord\\" and McCoy Tyner's \\"Atlantis.\\"  It is a very \\"cerebral\\" album with great guitar playing and driving percussion.  McLaughlin was an important \\"mentor\\" for Carlos and his musical direction.   This is a great CD for any guitarist who would like to \\"cop\\" Santana's riffs and to see where his nowaday riffs came from.  Buy this!!

B00005JNEI|5.0|Even if you don't agree [in the spirit of full disclosure, I do] with what's put forth in F-9/11 it's hard to ignore the footage gathered by Moore.  He doesn't hide that he's liberal and not a Bush-lover, but he also didn't interview himself for two hours.  Moore has a lot of credible interviewees and tons of footage of Bush past and present [some of the scariest being the 7 minutes of indecision at the elementary school in Florida on 9/11--you can see his head kind of rocking back and forth], questionable activities by the Secret Service, a meeting of corporate cronies who stand to make millions if not billions off of the war in Iraq, and families whose lives are destroyed by the Iraq war, to name just a little of what's shown.  I didn't like Bush before watching, but afterwards I was not just angry, I was frightened that we have the administration that we have.
0679735909|4.0|\\"Possession\\" is british author Antonia Susan Byatt's magna opus. It received many awards, the most prestigious of them the coveted Booker Prize, the highest literary award in the United Kingdom. In my opinion, deservedly so. Anyone can see  that \\"Possession\\" is a great novel, different, a blend of many literary styles and tendencies. What many people won't understand is the density and depth of such a work.<br /><br />The story behind possession is a sort of \\"tresure hunting\\", but this time the treasure is literary. In the novel, Roland Mitchell and Maud Bailey are two scholars, obsessed by their subjects of study, respectively the 19th century poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. Roland is a low-profile, slow guy that suddenly and unwittingly discovers some ancient papers that hint a possible connection between Ash, the highly steemed poet and model-husband of the victorian-era and the lesser known poet LaMotte, a veiled lesbian, now a role-model and idol of the feminists. Together, Roland and Maud, with the help of the old letters, retrace what can possibly be a love story that may rock the foundations of their literary world.<br /><br />\\"Possession\\" is divided in two settings: one tells the story of the search by Roland and Maud. This part is intriguing, as it can be described as a thriller about literature, something I only have read in Arturo Perez-Reverte's work \\"The club Dumas\\". But Reverte has a more thrilling aspect, while Byatt gives her readers a smooth ride through her \\"detectives\\" finding. The second part of \\"Possession\\" is given through the writings of Ash and LaMotte, and this part is impressive. Byatt created a large amount of victorian letters and poems as if both their fictional poets have written them. It's a dense, slow reading, and I can only blame myself for not fully understanding and appreciating it.<br /><br />\\"Possession\\" is a remarkable work, but it's so complex that only the most experienced readers will completely enjoy it.<br /><br />Grade 8.2/10joy it.   <br /> <br />Grade 8.2/10 <br />
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The Beatles redux?  The Beatles reduced?  One thing this CD reminds us is that Phil Spector's  heavy-handed touch really only drastically altered three songs in the final mix of \\"Let It Be\\": the title track, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", and \\"Across the Universe\\".  The rest of the songs are not that different - a few embellishments and overdubs here and there, perhaps.  If not for the tinkering with the three aforementioned songs, this recording would have been considered one of the band's most naturalistic and personal efforts.  The tensions that were so apparent in the film of these sessions don't come through in the music.  It is wonderful to hear the original version of \\"Long and Winding Road\\" without the bombast of orchestra and choir behind it - this \\"quieter\\" version is in a way even more inspiring.  There are a few versions of \\"Across the Universe\\" floating around - my favorite being the one that appeared on the \\"Beatles Anthology\\" - but even this stripped-down version is preferable to Spector's over-produced final product.  Surprisingly, the title track here has more production value going for it than I expected - a chorus back-up, if not a full choir - and again, it definitely benefits from this more modest interpretation.  It feels somewhat like hearing a hymn sung in a church rather than a concert hall (and let's face it, \\"Let It Be\\" is about as hymn-like as the Beatles ever got).   To set the record straight, I'm not totally down on Phil Spector:  I think the \\"wall-of-sound\\" production on George Harrison's classic album \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was a work of art, and his Christmas album with his stable of \\"girl groups\\" is great fun.  But here, maybe he should have left well enough alone.  The bonus CD, \\"Fly on the Wall\\", contains interesting snippets of behind-the-scenes banter and musical ideas, but is probably something you'll listen to once or twice and forget about.  All in all, this isn't exactly an \\"essential\\" recording, but it is a fascinating document for completists, diehard fans, and the plain curious.
0156027321|5.0|On it's face, the premise seems impossibly silly.  Stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger.  It's plausibility doesn't improve but that's part of the charm of the book.  Mr. Martel seems to be giving head fakes throughout and certainly drew me in.  You'll get geography, religion, zoology and psychology lessons on your way to an ending that (if you're like me) will have you thinking for days after you've finished.  The story builds as it goes until I felt I had to take the entire second half of the book in one chunk.
B0000844M8|5.0|This movie won the 1966 Academy Awards for song and best score shared by John Barry and Don Black which is sung by Frank Sinatra; I'm surprised it didn't win more awards than it did because this is my all time favorite movie!  I saw this with my parents a few years after it came out in 1965; I cry every time, love everything about this picture.  Love the lions!!!  Especially Elsa who hung around until the local government got tired of her antics.  The maturing Elsa begins to attract wild male lions and pretty soon, it becomes all too clear it's either the zoo or the African savannah.  She came to the Adamson's East African residence when she was a little cub, her parents shot and killed by her soon to be foster father, George Adamson, the game warden for the area.  Getting Elsa to adjust back to life in the wild is no easy matter and is the major part of the story.<br /><br />The Adamsons in the movie, Travers and McKenna, were married in real life.  I think Virginia McKenna's performance really made this movie.  It looks like she didn't make tons of movies but has always been admired for her performances in the ones she did, sometimes winning nominations for them.  For years after making the movie, she and her husband became active in conservation issues establishing the Born Free Foundation with their oldest son in 1991. She's also written a few books on the subject.  The story is true and follows very closely the book written by the real Joy Adamson.  Not even cursing is found in this movie!
B0001I55OC|3.0|I haven't read Michael Crichton's original intentions in Timeline but judging from the shallowness of the movie, I presume much has been excised from the original novel.  So I lowered my expectations and rented this DVD... <br /> <br />Yeah, there were really some Huh? moments like supposed experts on French archaeology not knowing any French, among others. But their depiction of medieval siege warfare is exciting enough, it is almost comparable to Flesh + Blood . But aside from that, Timeline falls squarely in the mindless entertainment fare, along with another mangled Crichton novel, Congo. Ironic since other Michael Crichton screen translations like the first Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, 13th Warrior and even Sphere are enlightening in their pseudo-scientific background.
B000002U9W|5.0|This is the Definitive Floyd album. All of the songs are amazing, even Alans Psychedelic Breakfast, I can not believe the band hates it. Beware though this album is NOT for new fans. It is not at all like the Floyd you hear on the radio This is extremely experimental, Psychedelic Pink Floyd. The album is fifty-two minutes long with five tracks. Nearly half the album is taken up by the title track, which is arguably the best song on the album. The other four tracks are amazing as well, though. If you dont already own it, and own all the Meddle-The Wall stuff pick it up. Now lets move on to a more in depth looks at the songs.    Atom Heart Mother Suite- This is even better than Echoes, featuring an awesome orchestra and choir. It just never ceases to amaze me. It starts out with a triumphent main theme, which builds up, and then surges into the next part with a guitar violin and organ. Then the choir comes, and things get even better. After this theirs a bluesy part that is really great the song then gets really weird with tape effects, and we even get a lawnmower. We then return to the theme with an amazing climax. One of the best songs ever.    If- A great mellow piece of folk, relaxes you after you get wound up by the first. The lyrics are really great, introducing many themes Roger would later explore. The music isn't half bad either.    Summer '68- One of the best songs Wright ever wrote. This song is fantastic. It is extremely strong musically, featuring french horns, a piano, and acoustic guitar that blend together fantastically.     Fat Old Sun- More mellow folk. This song features some great soloing from Gilmour.     Alans Psychedelic Breakfast-This song divides fans, I personally love it. It features on of Floyds roadies eating breakfast overlapped with an instruemental it ends with some great jamming.    Buy it and cherish it like a child.
1567312373|5.0|I first read this set of books while I was still in college (late 70's), and I have re-read them at least a dozen times.  This is one of the best modern trilogies ever written.  These books \\"get it,\\" more than any other book you'll ever read.  The question is, will you \\"get it\\"?<br /><br />Yes, this trilogy is full of strange scenes and dialogue, it has sex, drugs, and rock and roll, it has deep philosophy and shallow meanderings of stupidity.  What I'm trying to say is that EVERYTHING is in this trilogy.  Most of all, it has humor; I'm talking about laugh-out-loud humor.<br /><br />I promise you that you will enjoy this trilogy, and you will learn from it.  I can't really tell you what you are going to learn, because everyone takes something a little different from it.  But, once you read this trilogy, you will never be the same.  I can guarantee you that.  Enjoy !!!
B00005JNEI|4.0|Interestingly, the ratings for this movie seem to be largely one star or five stars. That seems to accurately encapsulate the mood of this country at present under our fearless leader  (Who campaigned inthe last election as \\"A Uniter, not a Divider\\").  <br />I agree that Moore's a propagandist - but then, so does Mr Moore. He freely admitted that this film was an opinionated editorial piece, though one can't really dispute the facts that are presented within. Moore's a bit hamfisted in general and I believe that \\"creative editing\\" techniques were used to bolster his arguments, but I also wholeheartedly embrace his stance and share his outrage. I live in NYC and remember 9-11 vivdly. When I saw this film in the theatre I was unable to hold back the tears when the footage of the attack was shown. It reignited the outrage I felt when the Bush administration decided to attack Iraq while continually kissing the ring of the Saudis.  <br />A vote fo Bush is a vote for perpetual war. Al Queda is established in over 50 countries. Countries that \\"tolerate and harbor terrorists\\" are too plentiful to list. The war on terror cannot be won with military might; our best bet is to build stronger alliances who will willingly share intelligence with us and who share our interest in democracy. I believed this before John Kerry said it and i believe it more strongly than ever. <br />OK, maybe that was a tangent. The point is simply this: I liked this picture; the argument was solid, the pacing was right on point and I feel the same anger that Mr Moore does. However, if you're looking for a \\"fair and balanced\\" (sorry) documentary, this probably won't satisfy you.
1401301363|5.0|Nigella Lawson, you are truly amazing, I have been \\"feasting\\" my eyes overly this truly fabulous and funny cookbook. Not quite sure that Shoprite stocks ground venison however! but I will check this out tomorrow. a real twist on some traditional favourites, cannot wait to try the Xmas pud flames and all. My American version of Feast is great, and to have stockist and websites is a real help. For anyone living in Northern America and cannot get to the fabulous Myers of Keswick in New York try visiting your local Irish store, where you should be able to track down some Horlicks and other British delights.I am only on page 78 and this is the best read since Forever Summer! buy this Cook book as soon as possible and enjoy!
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I find this movie really funny. At first it took some time getting used to the movemnets and the strings of the characters. This movie is only for people who enjoy all the works of matt and trey like orgasmo, baseketball, south park and movie, and cannible the musical. If anyone has watched any interviews they have did about this movie then you would know that they mention that not everyone should see this movie. Every one of there movies has cursing and some type of bizzare sexual humor. i have seen some reviews about how south park is better and i to think it is better but not because of the words and content. mainly cause i enjoy watching the cartoon kids more then watching puppets. yyou need to remember south park is on television and can only go to certian limits but when matt and trey go into the movie world they go all out.
B00018D3RI|5.0|as i grew up, i wanted to stay up late, <br />so i used to sit in 1 ock'lock in the morning and watch tv, <br />then when starsky and hutch i was excited. they don't air it no more.  <br />so now i own it on dvd. i watch one ep a day and it's so gr8! <br />this show rocks! i don't watch drama/action shows but only this!!! this rule$ <br />y'all should buy it. enjoy, i do.
B0002DB52M|4.0|I knew that this film was not traditional before seeing it, but I didn't know how non-traditional it actually was. At first, the minimalist set was jarring, but eventually my imagination filled in everything else and I was used to it.  In fact, it really made me focus on the characters and not space out by watching the scenery or focusing on some small detail on the set.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, I don't claim to have understood all the subtext or the commentary it was making on American life, but I still enjoyed it. Probably like others who have seen it, I was rooting for Grace to take her revenge, but when she did I felt a little guilty for having wished it.<br /><br />I guess that was part of the point of the film - we all have a little Dogville in us.
B000069KGM|5.0|It is easy to see why Chicago is still around when you hear the energy, power and tightness of the band's initial release. Chicago, in it's early days (first 7 albums or so) melded rock, jazz, blues, and even a spattering of classical, as no other band before or since. The dialogue between Terry Kath's guitar and Lee's horn arrangements are organic and intricate. Chicago III is my all-time favorite, but their first and second are astounding accomplishments. I will never tire of listening to them.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I'm going to start by saying that the reviews giving Van Helsing 1 star are not accurate.  It wasn't a spectacular film but it wasn't horrible.  It's much better than some of the movies you could waste your time renting.  Van Helsing delivers what it advertises: a movie about monsters that is action packed and interesting.  It is a very well done action movie and I would reccomend renting it before buying it.  The acting is mediocre but the acting is not what drives this film, its the action.  Some parts can get slow and repetitive but overall its a fast paced movie.  So, if you want to have a fun night and watch a cool action movie, rent it.  If you are expecting to see a timless classic that you will cherish forvever go rent something from the classic section of the video store.
6305878323|3.0|Mary Poppins is a wonderful tale which combines the very talented Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. It is a great story for both young and old. However this DVD is not what I expected although there were a few extras such as a game and a very brief making of documentary, it was not as indepth as some of the other Disney DVD's on the market. So its thumbs up for the film and a thumbs down for the DVD as a whole.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|I really avoided seeing this film as it was panned by many reviewers that I respect. However, I broke down and rented the film...I loved it! Stupid? Yep. Predictable? Yep. Campy? Yep. The film was exactly what it was supposed to be. Light hearted entertainment, not meant to be taken seriously; the kind of movie that you watch and enjoy without having to work too hard. <br /> <br />If you're looking for an important film, watch Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List, but if you can suspend your disbelief and just want to be entertained, watch Van Helsing.
B00005JMEW|1.0|The fight scenes are a joke, with limbs flying everywhere, and blood spraying everywhere.  There is a 10 minute cartoon in the middle of the film?????, and two loud beeps near the beginning...an audio error I suppose.  Save you're money.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|I really, really, really wanted to like this movie.  Not only did it get great reviews, but it is set on a wooden square rigger.  The golden age of sail!  There were all these stories about how Peter Weir did all this research to really get the authenticity.  Wow! I thought.  Well, all that doesn't amount to squat if you don't have a story or characters that are interesting.  And what about a cohesive timeline?  One day they are off the coast of brazil, then next in the cape, having the same conversation!  Who was it that died overboard when poor Crowe had to cut the mast off?  It took a few minutes to figure out what was happening every new scene.  Those boats are pretty though . . .  <br /> <br />Rent Horatio Hornblower instead.
B000002WAD|5.0|Stock, Atiken &amp; Waterman prodig&eacute; Rick Astley ceated an instant bubble-gum pop sound that not many had done in the 80's. Unfortunately, his polished vocals never got the credit he deserved. To many, Rick Astley was simply a way for the SAW trio to make money. To think this is to ignore the fact that he is in fact a talented signer.<br />No review of this album can be complete without the acknowledgement that at the time, Rick Astley was incredibly popular. His addictive &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; skyrocketed to Number 1 in March 1988. Soon followed mammoth club hits &quot;Whenever You Need Somebody&quot; and &quot;Together Forever&quot;. Mindless and fun.
B0002SROT0|5.0|Elliott Smith has long been my favorite musician.  Like many Elliott fans, his music ushered me through a difficult time in my life.  I've been anticipating this album for four years, and it's really odd to finally have it in my possession.  'Roman Candle' and 'Either/Or' are my two favorite albums of his, so I was a little dismayed when I heard early reviews that the new record was upbeat and a total departure from what he had previously recorded.  I like the stripped down, raw nature of his first three albums.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, though this cd is unlike anything else he has done, it is beautiful and heartfelt and thoroughly Elliott Smith.  The album shares some vague similarities with 'XO' and 'Figure 8', but it is definitely its own creation.  Though I am normally drawn to the simplicity of his early work, the complexity of the songs on 'From a basement on the Hill' is what I find so intriguing and lovely. For the critics who have complained that Elliott's music all sounds so similar, this album will definitely provide a compelling defense. It is too early to tell where this album will rate on my list of Elliott's music, but it's safe to say it is well worth the wait.  Thank you, Elliott.   <br /> <br />
1592400876|4.0|Now this is a good book. It's got a bit of a British English slant, but then the author is English. The book is about the history of punctuation, how the use of punctuation has changed, and the role it plays in clarifying the content of a sentence. The author does a good job at pausing every now and then to explain the difference between American English and British English punctuation. For example, the British don't usually put a period (or \\"full stop\\") after an abbreviation. <br /> <br />English: Mister = Mr <br />American: Mister = Mr. <br /> <br />While educational, the book is also very entertaining and, as a writer, it was something that I enjoyed. I knew many of the rules of punctuation, but this still acted as a good refresher and the author doesn't take things too seriously. <br /> <br />I'd recommend it if, and only if, it sounds interesting. If you're not interested in where to place your commas and how to use the semi-colon...don't bother.
0671656244|5.0|First I'd like to mention.  I bought this book with hesitation as it said it was unbounded.  In fact, it is the trade paperback edition...so all was fine!  I just finished reading Fevre Dream by George Martin, and he continues to have an uncanny ability to write any genre.  After reading the first chapter - Plauge Star, the reader is already set in an immense world of discovery and adventure.  Any reader of this book should not be displeased!
B0006213WG|2.0|Or are these songs blatant rip-offs of other bands?  The most obvious example is \\"The Bitter End\\" which is a bad remix of Metallica's \\"Battery\\".  And its not just that the songs are similar in style.  \\"The Bitter End\\" and \\"Battery\\" are almost exactly the same chord progressions, chorus and solo.  \\"I'm Not the One\\" is a blatant rip-off of Linkin Park (the screaming bridge \\"You take the best of me\\" is a direct lift of one of LPs songs).  Other examples are not so blatant but quite obvious to anyone with an ear.  \\"Slipping Away\\" and \\"Some Say\\" distill every song ever written by Oasis.  I'm sorry, but this is the most unoriginal album I've ever heard.  I give it two stars because at least they seem to have some real musicianship.  They could use a helping of originality too.    ***TO Chicagomike above: They may thank Metallica for the influence but are they paying them royalties for directly lifting one of their songs?  Listen to \\"Battery\\" from Metallica and compare it to \\"Bitter End\\"  Other than the lyrics and a slight change in arrangement, they are the same dang song!  Just call this album what it is:  A rip-off!
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This movie deserves 10 stars opposed to 5. It is an excellent film and easily my favorite of all time. I've seen it more than once, and I like it better each time. Everyone I talked to who saw it agrees completely with me. People who argue that \\"Troy\\" is bad and \\"inaccurate\\" have unjustified arguments. My arguments are all my opinions, just as other reviewers have so blatantly posted. <br />    <br />First, the titles say \\"based on 'The Illiad.'\\" If it was supposed to follow the story line-by-line, they would have called the movie \\"The Illiad\\" instead of \\"Troy.\\" If you have a problem with that, don't see it and read Homer's poem instead. Nobody even knows for a fact how true \\"The Illiad\\" is, or if it really happened, so how can Troy be \\"inaccurate?\\" <br />    <br />Second, who honestly cares if they got rid of the Gods? Even though I personally believe and I'm definitely not attacking any deity, Gods do not take human form and control people they way they did in \\"The Illiad.\\" That's what I consider 'unrealistic' and 'inaccurate' to me. Plus, without them, it gives it the story more reality and leaves you wondering (did Apollo really guide Paris's arrow and did the Gods really come down and carrying people off the humans they liked?), since there are numerous references to them throughout the movie. <br />  <br />Third, the acting in \\"Troy\\" was terrific in my opinion. Brad Pitt was not miscast. I didn't even like him that much until recently, and this was in my opinion the best performance of his career. He portrayed Achilles just as he should have been: arrogant, extremely skilled, and even sympathetic. His scene with the great Peter O'Toole is one for the ages, and his dispute for Agamemnon is good as well. Eric Bana did an excellent job as Prince Hector, and in my opinion deserves an Oscar. Hector fought for honor: he had to, he didn't want to. Even Orlando Bloom did terrific as Paris. He played him as a sissy and a coward and self-centered, just as he was. Diane Kruger is a knockout and played the role of Helen well. I could go on and on about the performances of Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Brendan Gleeson, and Peter O'Toole. I don't think there was bad acting to be found anywhere in this movie. <br />   <br />\\"Troy\\" has excellent battle sequences and fight scenes. The fight choreography is stellar. The fight between Hector and Achilles is one of the best ever, in my opinion. Despite what people say, if you have a heart, you will care about the characters. I'm not going to spoil it, but there are parts that are emotionally deep and should touch you at least a little. The story is unique because there really aren't any \\"good guys\\" or \\"bad guys.\\" Viewers (or readers) are supposed to be sympathetic to both the Trojans and the Greeks. <br />    <br />I did not think the movie was long and drug out: I wasn't bored the slightest bit and I actually wanted more. The locations are stunning and very scenic.  <br />    <br />Honestly, who cares if they changed some things? I like \\"The Illiad,\\" don't get me wrong, but I think what the writers did with the movie is much, much better. It's more interesting this way and it enhances the legend greatly.  <br />    <br />Have an open mind and enjoy it for what it is, and ignore the critics who seriously need to give it a rest and stop attacking it. I for one am sick of it. The DVD will be a must-own, with a lot bounus features on the two-disc special edition. Again, this is all my opinion and I respect what others think, but I think this is the best movie ever. <br /> <br />
B0002KVUKM|3.0|Most published reviews of this movie criticize it for being full of superficial computer generated effects and lacking plot and character development.  I cannot disagree with either assessment.  However, this did not prevent me from enjoying the film.  The story, while cliched, moved at a good pace and kept my attention.  The CGI is plentiful, but for the most part well done.  The acting is also adequate.  This movie is definitely worth renting, but probably not worth purchasing.
B0002Y4TM4|5.0|Great place to start listening to Marillion.  Every song is different.  Good mix of catchy, radio-friendly stuff and more challenging material.  Get the double-CD version if you can.
B0002SROT0|5.0|This CD is excellent at its worst its still superb above many other artists. Elliott Smith sings us his \\"Fond Farewell\\" and for us (the fans) it is a very emotional ride.  This album is definately a must for Elliott Smith fans if you can find it at the store that is I had to look at 3 stores to find them having only 3 left.  This CD could quite possibly be the best CD of the year. Before this CD I was only a mediocre fan of Elliott Smith but now I love the man his music is so heartfelt and meaningful. I have deep respect for you Elliott and you shall be surely missed. If you even slightly consider yourself an Elliott Smith fan you owe to yourself to pick up this sad but excellent ending to a well respected man Goodbye Elliott We miss you
0316168815|4.0|It would be hard to overstate the horror of the first chapter of this book, a stark and unflinching first person account of the rape and murder of a 14 year old girl.    The only element that keeps it readable (and even then, barely) is that it's narrated from heaven by the remarkably unbitter and charming victim, Susie.    It's an odd premise, and there are points where the structure seems like it's been put in place only to provide the reader some escape from the really tough realities of the story. This is not to say that the story - primarily of the family's recovery - does not come through. It does, and in strikingly honest form. There is anger, sadness isolation and fear; and there is the clear imprint of the absense of Susie.    Overall, Sebold has told a really difficult story in the disguise of a really readable novel. She's done so in a structure that provides enough glimmers of hope to keep both her readers and her characters from giving up in the face of tragedy, weaving in an inventive, if imperfect afterlife coming of age story.
B0006213WG|4.0|Ok I was just trying to figure out what band \\"we're all to blame\\" sounded like and I have to say that the slow part sounds exactly like \\"chop suey\\" by system of a down. I mean it sounds cool but it's not really sum 41 style. Otherwise I like the album.
0784011710|5.0|Set in Brooklyn in 1947, Sophie's Choice is an haunting, deep,  of three people, whose lives are deeply intertwined, in Brooklyn - 1947:<br /><br />Stingo (Peter MacNicol): An aspiring young author from the South, who has made his way to Brooklyn to pursue his writing career.<br /><br />Sophie (Meryl Streep): A Polish war refugee, who has survived Auschwitz, and who's past is one of horrors we can only imagine in our worst nightmares.<br /><br />Nathan Landau: Sophie's mercurial and volatile lover, who is obsessed (if that is the right word) with hunting for escaped Nazis, and whose moods swing between joy of life and extreme generosity one moment and vicious, black rages the next.<br /><br />The first half of the movie revolves around the close friendship between Stingo, Nathan and Sophie, as well as the passionate relationship between Nathan and Sophie. The second part takes us to Sophie's nightmarish experiences during the Second World War, and ultimately the heartbreaking scene where a Nazi officer forces her to decide which of her two children will survive and which will be taken off to die in a crematorium.<br /><br />It is a movie both about the pathos and anxiety of each individual, and of the agony and evil of a world gone mad i.e. Europe during the holocaust, at a time when we are faced with mass terrorism , sympathy for terrorism and a resurgence of anti-semitism and totalitarian ideas.
B0002KVUL6|5.0|This movie brings back every thing you want in a movie. sure it isn't as digitally amazing as the lord of the ring series but comon! You know the kid of thrills you get from watching indiana jones swing from a rope? The chill down your spine from viktor frankinstien screeming \\" IT'S ALIVE!!!!!\\". the excitement of seeing wolverine sliceing someone in hafe in X-men, Jack Sparrow swinging from a pole in... This movie brings back the fun of watching a movie. Its the kind of movie that makes you laugh, sit on the edge of your seat, scream, cry ( depending on how emotional you are the end might get ya...) Its got it all. A movie shouldent have to be so perfect... its just gota be fun.
B00005OM4N|3.0|As much as I love the music as something I would more than likelyh hear at a party, the songs on this album don't hold a lot of substance showing some actual effort was put forth to compose the various songs
B000009ROK|5.0|OK, Luis Miguel might not be the greatest latin artist ever and he's light years from anything as adventurous as what's happening in latin rock, but he is THE master of the craft. These impeccably produced albums redefined a musical legacy (romantic bolero music) that was lost and relegated to lounge singers and corny latin interpreters.What began as a crossover experiment became a permanent cause for Luis Miguel, and we have to credit him for reviving bolero and re-introducing it to newer generations that could have cared less if these songs, \\"from my grandparents days\\", faded in time. The concept grows from the first album (weakest, experimental) to the third (best accomplished). These albums are a must have even if your not into latin pop, and it doesn't get any better(the fourth Romances album, not featured in this collection,is where things start sounding abit tedious.)This is best from Luis Miguel.
B0001FUHV6|5.0|The composer managed to write original music that sounds as if if could have been written in the mid-19th century by an gifted, highly original, yet still Scottish woman, and make it sound contemporary at the same time. I don't know how he pulled it off. It worked wonderfully with the film and conveyed a sense of passion, fun, tragedy, and romance. Do yourself a favor and see the video or listen to this.
B0002SROT0|5.0|my goodness.   i was skeptical about this album, considering elliot himself was not around for the finishing stages, but i expected it to be among his best.  It surpassed all of my expectations.  This album is haunting as all hell, it has some of the most heartfelt and honest songs elliot has ever done.  The writing on this cd, is obviously his most mature, amazing song structure, beautiful lyrics, and he sings it so soft and beautiful...god bless elliot smith.             <br />                    -Eric Anton <br />
B00005JNJ7|5.0|wake up fellow reviewer who says the sex scene drags on too long(its about 30 seconds and that kids will want to know more about the \\"birds and the bee's\\". Well first of all...its not really a sex scene because they are not really people see? Because(suprise) they are PUPPETS. They dont have genitals because they are PLASTIC! with strings too! Shut up to all you idiots who cant tell the difference and who are offended so easily. Oh ya....you dont think your little Johnny knows about the \\"birds and the bee\\" already? Then why is he putting KEN's hand under BARBIE's skirt? Just go on sheltering your kids from movies and games, but let them watch the 6 oclock news where real people are getting blown up daily. Thats SO much better.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I heard all of these people sing when they were in their prime. The cast is outstanding. Besides being a glorious rendition of one of my fave operas, each singer calls up wonderful memories of many past performances, especially Pavarotti and Caballe. Pavarotti is my favorite Calaf too. All in all, a superb acquisition for any opera collection
0790733226|5.0|This movie will captivate you from the beginning moment until the final credit.  Not too many films can do that.  Yes, Contact really is THAT good.  This movie never panders to you or tries to tell you what is right or wrong.  The beautiful story unfolds in front of you.  Unforgettable...
B00009AOBI|5.0|With out a question, Cher should have been nomainted and possibly won the oscar for her role in \\"MASK\\". Cher give's the perforamce of her carrer as Rusty, and with compansion and a tough as nail attiude she shows the love this woman had for her son. This release restores 2 delted scenes from the movie and couldn't be happier to have them after all these years. If you have not seen this movie, Do it now..you won't be sorry.
1563890119|4.0|...even then that's saying a lot. A bad Sandman trade is still better than 90 percent of the drek that's being published today. I guess the reason that so many of us consider this the weakest of the lot is because we read it after we had read books such as \\"A Season of Mists\\" or \\"A Game of You\\" and we knew of the majesty, of the mythology and the granduer that this series was capable of. <br />But you can't fault the book on those grounds, since it is bascially a set up for the rest of the series. Reading \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\" and then later volumes, you see just how much \\"Preludes\\" sets up. For example, in \\"A Season of Mists,\\" Lucifer makes a very dire decision, one that would impact not only the Sandman series, but the DC Universe as a whole. Someone reading it without having read \\"Preludes\\" might be at a bit of a loss as to why Lucifier did what he did, but if you've read \\"Preludes,\\" then you know why. If you started reading The Sandman with \\"Preludes\\" and wonder if gets any better, then let me tell you: boy does it ever.
B0000640VO|5.0|I really became a big fan of foreign films after seeing \\"Amelie\\", and this was indeed a great film to be \\"initiated\\" by!<br /><br />The movie is well-written, showing an equal affinity for the funny and touching sides of life, and Audrey Tautou gives a marvelous performance. Tautou is almost a dead-ringer for Audrey Hepburn physically as well as in her performance.<br /><br />This film as well as \\"Bread & Tulips\\" and the recent Jet Li film \\"Hero\\" are my choices for the best foreign films I have ever seen. If you're a fan of romantic comedies, you will love \\"Amelie\\", the language barrier notwithstanding. Highly recommended, buy it!
B00005JMJG|4.0|visually very impressive and thoroughly captivating. At times stirring and very moving performances. Somewhat interesting and thought-provoking, but maddening story-line that almost left me with a headache: (scenes like the two young lovers dancing atop his body while he is undergoing \\"the procedure\\" truly required a massive stretch of the imagination - despite the joy of seeing Kirsten in action!)<br /><br />Definitely requires a suspension of belief and a real open-mindedness to visionary cinema. It's a unique film that's worth a look, for sure.
B0000020C4|2.0|Of all the recordings of Les Mis, I'd have to say this is one of the worst, if not the worse. The orchestra isn't as strong as the others, however, it should be noticed that this is the recording of a concert, so that can be overlooked. All of the singers are pretty good, and michael ball is THE marius. The Songs are pretty good. . but The Attack on the Rue Plumet was absolutely butchered and One Day More is deffinetly lacking. I think the highlight of this recording is the first Encore: Do You Hear the People Sing, which is song in some of the different languages that Les Mis has been translated into. As far as the Eponine scenario goes though, Lea Salonga is not the best. . . for the part. She has an amazing voice, however does not fit the role of Eponine AT ALL. She sounds too old, and her speech (singing) is much much much too formal. She makes Eponine sound as though she had grown up her entire life living with Valjean and Cossette, Not on the streets in rags. Anyone who has read and comprehended the book would know that Eponine was a frail, rough spoken kind of gal. Also, In \\"On My Own\\" Lea sounds almost angry, or upset, but not in a sort of pathetic, \\"aww that poor thing\\" sort of way but more of a \\"creepy-stalker-not-getting-her-way\\" sort of way. She sounds way more whiny than Francis Ruffelle, not in her singing, but in her enterpretation of the character. But still, if you just want to listen to Les Mis for the music and not the full meaning/value of the story, then this is the Eponine/recording for you.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Surely I'm biased - as a youg kid, I dreamed of becoming a Disney animator (sadly unfulfilled) - but I believe 'Sleeping Beauty' has the most incredible art and music of all of Disney's efforts to date.  I rent other Disney DVDs from local library for my kids, but this one I bought.  Unlike the 'Lion King' special edition - which I found not-so-special - this one is truly well-done and worth a purchase. <br /> <br />Positives: <br />- High-quality digital restoration resulted in eye-popping color and details presented in 70mm widescreen format. <br />- Tchaikovsky's music is timeless in its power to mesmerize, and matched up perfectly with synchronized masterful animation. <br />- The supplemental second disc is unusually excellent both in breadth of content and the quality of presentation. <br />- There's a restrained, formal quality to 'Sleeping Beauty', akin to classical ballet, which provides a such pleasant contrast to the increasingly shrill Disney offerings of the late Eisner era. <br />- The painstakingly hand-drawn background and characters are simply awe-inspiring in their unique artistry. <br />- The sheer grace and elegance of the characters, as well as the consummate artistic skills of their rendering have NOT been matched by any other Disney films, generally as good as they are.  (I was disappointed by the comparatively amateurish art of 'Little Mermaid' and 'Beauty and the Beast'.  It was not until 'Finding Nemo' that artistic animation again made my jaw drop and stay there throughout the film.) <br /> <br />Negatives: <br />- This work was done almost half century ago, and the age does show in this time of computerized animation.  The most noticeable flaw is when Malicifent first appears literally with a bang, yet the characters in the background remain absolutely still.  This detracts from the power of this moment; rationality dictates that such an apparition would have caused shock and panic among the crowd.  Contrast this with the animated crowd scenes in 'Hunchback of Notre Dame', or the constantly dynamic background of 'Bug's Life', in which every blade of grass sways with the wind. <br />- The classical elegance of the story and characters means certain dignity and restraint (contrast this with the gross-out jokes of 'Lion King' and endless wisecracking of 'Aladdin').  In my opinion, this is a major plus, since this would make  'Sleeping Beauty' a true classic (like the best works of DaVinci and Michaelangelo) that will survive the test of time for decades to come.  However, in today's world where attention-deficit rules, its lack of cloying cuteness and 'Fear Factor' gross-outs may not win this film a general popularity contest.
0385484518|5.0|Is there anyone liave that's not read this yet?  This is a classic book. A touching story that affects everyone who reads it.  Albom has quite a way with words and really delivered on this one.
B00000FC5H|5.0|This disc is fabulous - it's not too skimpy and it's not too overdone. It's just right. It has all of the important EWF hits, it doesn't miss a beat. I love EWF, they were a great funk/soul group and they really had much talent. I would recommend this disc to anyone who loves good 70's-early 80's funk and soul. The sound is great, too!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This really is a pleasant suprise. Beutifully sung,nice backing arrangements and a nice mix of chosen songs. The recording is something else. Probably one of the best I've had the good fortune to hear this year. Put this on your CD player and you'll see why the biggest upgrade you can make to any system is a good recording against an average recording. Unfortunately not every record company puts this kind of effort into thier productions. For music I give it 90% and recording quality 95%.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Yep. This is my 3rd favorite film of all time besides The Godfather and Pulp Fiction. Following might be Taxi Driver, Star Wars Trilogy, Fargo, Memento, LOTR Trilogy, Goodfellas, and others. But anyways, this is truly a great movie. There's been so much talk about this film, either hearing it's amazing or it sucks. Some don't like it because they don't enjoy the ending climax. But more on that later. <br /> <br />Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the best new directors of our time, and is one of my favorite directors of all time. Some other new directors to note would be Quentin Tarantino, Joel Coen, Darren Aronofsky, Spike Jonze, Sofia Coppola, Kevin Smith, Christopher Nolan, Guy Ritchie, and so on. The film essentially tells the story of 9 lives in the San Fernando Valley following one day. The film is 3 hours, but works perfectly operaticly with the time. It actually is one of the most operatic movies in the running time it works within. I don't really want to get into the plot, because I think it's better to know nothing about a movie when going to see it. <br /> <br />The main problem people dislike this movie is the climax. If you notice, the prologue fully prepares for the ending with strange occurances, and there are also references to exodus that may not be biblical but relate in some reference. It is in no way a \\"cheating\\" ending just to connect everything. Read Roger Ebert's review if you want to fully understand why this is such a great movie. <br /> <br />But then again, it's everyone's opinion if they like it or not. You can get a rough idea of the kind of movies I like anyway. But the story is great, welding 9 stories in one blend of themes and emotions, and I really felt chills down my spine. The acting is phoenominal, being one of the greatest ensemble acting performances ever, if not the BEST, without a single bad performance. Love, hate, regret, greed, all surround this film in a swarming tale. It's simply engrossing to experience Magnolia. <br /> <br />Also to suggest would be PTA's other works. I don't think he's made a single bad film. While Magnolia is in my top 3, Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love would probably make my top 20, and Hard Eight would probably make my top 50. Once again, it's completely your opinion if you don't like it. Enough of bashing other people's opinions, just express your own and leave it at that. I say, enough already, see MAGNOLIA!
6305922756|5.0|Without a doubt the best movie about rock and roll and perhaps one of the funniest movies ever made.  Appeals to much more than just baby boomers as I watched this on DVD with my mother (70 yrs), and she laughed harder than I did.  This ensemble cast is wonderful in playing off each other and the release of the DVD offers a whole new movie with commentary by the band.  Their remarks over the movie are almost as funny as the movie itself.  \\"Tap\\" fans can talk in a type of shorthand and crack each other up by simply mentioning that \\"Boston is not a big college town\\", or humming the tune to \\"Big Bottom\\".  Never really taken seriously as a film because it is so funny.  However, the editing, camera work, and concert scenes are first rate.  The film also holds up very well over time without any \\"jokes\\" lost to time.  This is a \\"must have\\" for any DVD collection.  In fact, my band uses \\"Tap\\" as a role model for success.
B000004166|5.0|This recording was way ahead of it's time, both acoustically and musically.  Even though it was made in the 60's, the recording quality is superb: I was stunned this was recorded 40 years ago!<br /><br />Grumiaux's technique is mind boggling and his style poised and elegant.  The tempos are fast, and he drills lightning spiccato runs effortlessly with a crisp, flawless articulation that is superhuman even by today's standards.  The orchestra is far ahead of its time as well, as Colin Davis gets crystal clear, classical execution normally associated with today's recordings of groups like the Academy of Saint Martin in the Fields.<br /><br />Grumiaux's interpretation can accurately be described as \\"aristocratic\\", meaning that he concentrates on sparkle, clarity, and precision rather than warmth and psychological complexity.  Thus, to fans of interpretations like Mutter's, his playing will seem detached, cold, and fast, especially in the slow movements.  Understanding this mindset requires an appreciation of the crystalline beauty of perfect sound and elegant style, and not looking for deep angst characteristic of more romantic approaches.  Fans of period instruments as well need to be aware that this is 40 years old, and although his style is in perfect taste, it is decades before the first period recordings.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|Although the other themes are quite good to deserve 5 stars, the song that names the album deserves 10 stars! Some people hate large songs, but make this, put together this one with, let`s say Hotel California, one or two of the old Genesis songs, Stairway to Heaven, and you will change your mind.
B000003N7K|4.0|I belong to that class of jazz lovers who don't take too well to vocals.  Sorry.  I realize there is a long tradition of jazz singing; but it just totally passes me by.  I am far more interested in musicians who take their instruments and just play.  And there is a sizable portion of the jazz public that is just like me.<br /><br />So for my fellow \\"instrumentalists\\", I issue this warning.  IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS ALBUM TO HEAR COLTRANE WAIL AWAY, YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY.<br /><br />Now, that having been said, let's consider the virtues of this record.  In all honesty, this should have been labeled Johnny Hartman's record because its really his showcase.  Hartman (previously unknown to me) has a deep, honey toned baritone set of pipes that have an unusual rich quality.  Hartman's singing is also exceptionally clear and well enunciated so that the actual lyrics are communicated with ease.  (May seem like a trivial issue to younger listeners; but us old timers don't hear as well as we once did.  So when you hear Hartman sing and you understand what he is saying THE FIRST TIME around that is quite unique).  Hartman is so good I have to wonder why he is not more well known or remembered.<br /><br />John Coltrane actually plays more an accompanist than a co-headliner; but he does so very well.  Along with McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass and Elvin Jones on drums, Coltrane provides sensitive and respectful support to Hartman's work-taking only a few occasions to render short, tasteful solos.  All in all, a very successful record that earns all the high marks other reviewers give to it.<br /><br />But, again, I reserve my full encouragement to buy this record because it is not what most record buyers will be expecting.  It sure wasn't what I was expecting.  For a romantic, well-made vocal album you could hardly do better than this one and I myself will explore further into Johnny Hartman's other records.  Just don't expect to get GIANT STEPS PART TWO here.
B000001Y5J|5.0|I bought this CD a long time ago, when the bonus tracks came on a separate mini CD. Loved it from the very start and still do. This music was even then ahead of its time and, I believe, will never be considered \\"retro\\". I especially enjoy this CD when I'm angry about something. haha. Happiness in Slavery actually won a Grammy (rightfully so). I won't tell you what Trent's speech was because I can't in this venue, but it was quite funny, and fitting. I was MOST pleasantly surprised to hear Trent's version of \\"Physical\\", an old Adam and the Ants song, on the bonus tracks. I used to LOVE Adam when he was with the Ants and especially the album \\"Kings of the Wild Frontier\\" where you'll find the original \\"Physical\\". Trent's is definitely a more down and dirty version, but superb just as well. Bottom line? There's not a bad song on this album. If you like NIN, you'll LOVE this one and shame on you for not having it already!!! Oh and if you're looking for \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" type stuff, you won't find it here. I totally dig PHM, but it's on a different plane altogether.
B000099T2L|5.0|EVERY SONG WAS GOOD!THE BEST SONG WAS SPEECHLESS. I GUESS YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE IN LOVE TO UNDERSTAND.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|On her new album, Avril really reveals what goes under her skin. <br /> <br />It all starts with \\"Take me away\\", a fast desperate song, that I didn't really like at the beginning. <br /> <br />The second song \\"Together\\" is a very loud and strong song about being better off alone. <br /> <br />\\"Don't tell me\\" was the first single release from this album. So we all know it and I personally like the lyrics a lot. <br /> <br />The next song is \\"He wasn't\\". A funny rock song about a boy, that turns out to be a nightmare regarding his behaviour. <br /> <br />Then there is \\"How does it feel\\", a wonderful strong ballad, even though I think that it gets boring after listening to it more than 5 times. <br /> <br />\\"My happy ending\\" was the second single release and it is definitely one of my favs on this album. In this song Avril is vulnerable but gets very strong when she sings the bridge. <br /> <br />About the next 2 songs I can't really say anything, because I don't like them and I don't listen to them. <br /> <br />Song number 9 is \\"Who knows\\", and it is a kind of a hymn, even though it sound very pop. <br /> <br />\\"Fall to pieces\\" is also kind of a pop song with bad lyrics, but good rhythm. <br /> <br />The next song is called \\"Freak out\\", a song about being self secure and doing what you want no matter what all the others say bla bla bla   But still strong chorus and good vibrations <br /> <br />The last song of the album is called \\"Slipped away\\". It is a very intimate song about Avril loosing her grandfather, so I don't really think I'm in the position to judge it.  <br /> <br />\\"Under my skin\\" is a good album with catchy songs, but if you listen too often to it, you may get annoyed.  <br />But everyone who likes Avril, buy it!
0142001104|5.0|In a glut of books on personal improvement, this is a breath of fresh air.  Many of the illustrations were drawn from the world of classical music, and as a musician/lawyer, I found them particularly relevant and interesting.  Nothing trite here, just great thoughts and useful examples that you will find nowhere else.  When I read the book for the first time, I wondered whether a non-musician would be able to relate to a description of a Mahler symphony or Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony.  However, I used one of the examples in a recent speech to real estate professionals, and found that they were very interested in hearing about a string quartet (some probably for the very first time).  The event made me realize that I love books that take me into a world in which I have never been, and I think many others have the same desire.  So if you are not a musician, read this book, because you will be transported into the mind of a musician and the world of classical music.  If you are a musician, you'll find yourself agreeing out loud with the musical examples.    This is not to say that the other examples are not relevant and interesting - they are, and they avoid the well-worn roads.  I believe this husband and wife team have more to say, and I'm looking forward to their next books.
B000001ZSF|5.0|I am a writer, and one of the ways that I write stories, mostly fiction, is I listen to music and let my imagination run.  I use the music like background music to a movie.  So this cd, plus many others, is like the soundtrack to the unwritten movie.  While I haven't written anything specific to this cd, I love how it changes and moves.  I especially love track 2, using the music to represent a major battle between two forces, people, etc.  The song just goes back and forth and its atomosphere makes such a battle seem infinitly epic.  Many of the other songs also call for prophetic dreams and adventurous journeys. <br /> <br />However, I should also say that this cd just has good music in general.  If you like intense, instrumental synthesizer music that uses a variety of sounds, expressing various feelings, this really is a good album.  I personally think it spawns creativity.  At least it does for me. <br /> <br />I would recomend this cd to many people, expecially if they think that new age is some boring style of music.  At least I classify it as new age, because it is not like anything else.  And if you want a cd that is not like anything else you've heard, unless you already listen to Jean Michel Jarre, this is it.
B0000DIXN7|5.0|Frank, the new album by jazz singer Amy Winehouse, is outstanding. This piece of work is a unique twist that combines jazz, blues, dub, funk, and in some mild ways (specifically the beats) dare I say: hip-hop. She has a natural and incredible voice, and she uses it to convey honest heartfelt, and very juicy lyrical content. The production value is also top-notch, and you will enjoy bumping-up this one. I can't help but to think of Lauren Hill when I listen to this: there's something about Amy's pure voice cutting over those beats. The lack of availability of this album in the USA surprises me since its obvious she is going to blow up and sell multi-platinum. First industry exec to market this thing in the USA wins! Support this fantastic new talent by buying Frank, even at import prices. Here are 5 tasty and diverse picks for your 5-disc CD changer: Frank, The Miseducation Of Lauren Hill, Do You Want More?, Sounds from the Verve Hi-Fi, Pure Ella: The Very Best of Ella Fitzgerald.
B00000JCB2|1.0|how could anyone consider this good. This sucks. Its rap not metal
B0002KVULG|5.0|Frank Langella brings the role to life with such character that you actually find yourself liking the  character and not wanting him to lose!  Doctor Who fans; Sylvester McCoy (Doctor #7) plays a small part as one of the orderlies in the insane asylum.  Haven't seen the DVD yet, in fact have had a really hard time tracking this great film down!
B00003CXIY|5.0|Definitely an OUTSTANDING COMEDY, Road Trip, brings to the screen exactly what the title implies: the story of four college students who end up driving from NY to TX in an effort to prevent a mailed videotape from reaching one of the guy's girlfriend.  Along the way, they get into all sorts of trouble resulting in one of the best movies in recent years! <br />Breckin Meyer, Seann Willliam Scott, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  Road Trip is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's (in this case college kids') every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature. <br />Strongly recommended along with Old School, the Girl Next Door and of course (!!!) the American Pie trilogy.   <br />In short, Road Trip is a movie definitely worth watching, and actually one to seriously consider adding to your collection! <br />
B000001E8P|5.0|God, how I love this CD. Every time I hear it it reminds me of my college days, of the days when Brit pop was king...the good old days! \\"Different Class\\" has it all and is worthy of any hype or praise thrown upon it. I saw Pulp in concert when this CD came out and it was one of the best shows I have ever attended. Jarvis is a true entertainer and one god damn sexy guy. Nothing but good stuff here! By the way, you know a band is great when William Shatner covers \\"Common people\\" on his new CD!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|-=[If you dont see this movie for its deeper meaning, at least see it for the freaky, 6 foot, psychadelic, time travelling bunny rabbit]=- <br /> <br />I dont know if it was the fact i was reading Slaughterhouse Five by vonnegut or if i just liked the style but this movie seriously rocked. The idea behind it was fairly good and for an indie movie it was fairly well done. The story line would have been better if it had been explained more (mabye a book or something would have been cool to follow up the movie...). <br /> <br />People who dont like this movie just dont get it , in my opinion. ive only met a handfull of people who dont like it but after questioning, we realized they didnt understand anything about the movie. I dont think theres much 'teen-angst' in it, sure theres a little more than ur normal teen but people, its a freaking movie, thats wut movies do!
B0002SROT0|4.0|That's the question I repeat over again when I listen to 'From a Basement on a Hill\\". I've been excited about this album since it was first mentioned by Elliott as possibly being a 2cd set many years ago. This cd is great but more along the lines of \\"Figure 8\\" then the flawless \\"X/O\\", which isn't a bad thing. <br />\\"Coast to Coast\\" starts the album in an unusual direction, almost like a wall of sound, with lots of textures and emotion. <br />It isn't until the fingerpicking on \\"Let's Get Lost\\" and the simple strumming of \\"Twilight\\" and\\" Pretty Ugly Before\\" that the familiar Elliott shines through. <br /> <br />It's only little things or shall I say flaws that disturb this listen..Would he have wanted \\"Ostriches and Chirping\\" as a an actual track instead of just an intro, also, the hissing on \\"Last Hour\\" is out of place on such a well-produced album, it almost sounds like it could have been on the self titled cd. <br />In keeping with the theme of previous albums, a song as stong as \\"A Distorted Reality...\\" I think, wouldn't have been stuck as the last track, something like \\"Little One\\" would have been a more appropriate ending. <br />Never afraid to tackle his sadness and write down what hurt him inside, most of the songs deal with depression and often his dependence on chemicals that always made him the most honest in the singer/songwrite genre. <br />Highlights include said songs above and \\"Fond Farewell\\" which though it probably wasn't meant to be at the time, seems to be the most auto-biographical and it pains me to listen it because it is so beautiful. <br />\\"Don't go Down\\" and \\"Strung Out Again\\" aren't as good other tracks that I'm sure are lying around, waiting for another volume of the posthumous releases to come. <br /> <br />I'll take any Elliott recordings, especially now, anyway I can get them and I am truly thankful to his family for giving us the gift he left uncompleted <br />The high points outweigh the low and Elliott will always be the artist you turn to when you need to listen to something that makes you feel.
B00005JNEI|5.0|<br /> <br />The word liberal wasn't always an epithet.   <br /> <br />But it is now, thanks to a very successful effort on the part of the right to redefine what the word means.  Michael Moore is a liberal and isn't ashamed of it.  In fact he's proud of it, revels in it, trying to take back the word stolen from the left during the Reagan Era.   <br /> <br />Michael Moore is a brave man, taking on a sitting president during a time where the very rights and freedoms guaranteed us by the constitution are being questioned.  This period will be looked back upon as a very dark time in US history.  We now have brownshirts like Ann Coulter bandying about words like \\"traitor\\" and \\"sedition\\" when anyone questions the current government - a government that stole the 2000 election, and as a result, a government whose very legitimacy is questionable. <br /> <br />The aggressively populist position of Michael Moore is succeeding where a quarter century of \\"kid glove\\" leftist rhetoric has failed.  He's taking on the bellicose right with a solid dose of their own medicine and IT'S WORKING.  The amazing thing to watch are the ensuing attacks on Mr. Moore not by the right, but by the leftist elite criticizing Mr. Moore for his tactics.  It's the business-as-usual-Democratic Party policy of eating itself from within.  The left has a tendency to try to be all things to all people, thus ending up being nothing to anyone.  This is best exemplified by the party's decision to choose John Kerry to be their presidential candidate, while a man of principles and ideas like Howard Dean is cast aside.  It's time for the left to stop relying on voters being willing to vote against \\"the other side\\" and give them ideas and positions worth voting FOR. <br /> <br />Michael Moore understands this.  People have criticized this film for having a point of view.  It's a documentary and all documentaries come from a point of view, stating their case.  The real complaint is that this fat, grizzled, ball cap wearing guy with a camera is actually making a point and making more of a difference than all the usual suspects combined.  Michael Moore is through letting the right define what it is and what it means to be a liberal, to be a patriot. <br /> <br />This movie is about the Presidency of George W. Bush and the terrible things that this inept, inarticulate puppet of the oil industry has done to maintain that ever-so-important flow of cheap oil.  It's about lives lost, lives ruined and a country losing the hard earned respect of the world.  Michael Moore gets his point across very effectively, forcing the viewer to ask the difficult questions they may not want to ask of themselves. <br /> <br />Is it fair?  Of course not, but like anyone with a strong opinion, they're not going to BE fair when it comes to their beliefs.  It's up to you to make up your own mind whether Mr. Moore's opinions have merit.  You may not agree with him, but you SHOULD be asking yourself these questions.  This documentary provoked a strong response from everyone that I know that has seen it and in that respect, is an unqualified success.    <br /> <br />I think everyone of every political stripe should see this film. <br /> <br />C'mon, what are you afraid of? <br /> <br />
0767817664|5.0|At first glance, Fright Night looks like another cheesy vampire film: a young man figures out that a vampire has moved next door, no one believes him, the vampire comes after him, his only hope is an old horror actor, etc.  It's pretty predictable, right down to the whole thing about the boy's girlfriend bearing a striking resemblance to one of the vampire's old flames.  So yes, in its own way, Fright Night is cheesy.  At the same time, though, it is oh so much more than you would expect - an entertaining, somewhat creepy vampire film that features some great acting and some really impressive special effects.  You expect to see really bad, noticeably cheap special effects in a film like this, but Fright Night hits a home run in this department.<br /><br />William Ragsdale plays Charley Brewster, a typical horror-loving kid who just so happens to find out that his new neighbor is a vampire - naturally, no one believes him, including his friend Evil Ed (Stephen Geoffreys in a truly annoying performance) and his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse, who went on to play Marcie on Married With Children).  For some reason, Charley decides to be open about his suspicions, thus letting the vampire know that he knows his little secret - not a smart move, as Charley soon learns courtesy of a little visit from the new guy in town.  This vampire, I must say, looks nothing like your typical Count Dracula; he actually looks like a reject from Dance Fever, making it a little hard for me to take him seriously (although the threat of \\"Deney Terrio\\" busting out some disco moves in the film's one night club scene certainly had me feeling uneasy).  In desperation, Charley goes to the only man he thinks can help him - Peter Vincent, Vampire Killer (Roddy McDowall).  Vincent killed many a vampire - in the movies - and he is now the local host of Fright Night, a late-night horror show.  As you might expect, Vincent doesn't really believe in vampires and, once he sees that Charley is telling him the truth, he isn't too anxious to fight them, either.  McDowall is really great in this movie; he is the lynchpin upon which most of the movie's success depends.<br /><br />I can't say enough about the special effects, especially those in the film's climactic moments.  As a horror fan, I really appreciate the filmmakers spending the time and money to give me such an impressive show.  The plot features a number of clich&eacute;s as well as a couple of \\"oldest tricks in the book,\\" but the inspired performance of Roddy McDowell combined with the fantastic special effects leads me to bump my rating up from four to five stars.  This probably won't be the best vampire film you've ever seen, but I am sure that fans of the genre will not fail to get quick a kick out of Fright Night.him the truth, he isn't too anxious to fight them, either.

076790592X|5.0|With books, I have a penchant for fiction, so this nonfiction narrative I took to heart because all of this actually happened to real people, and I am left amazed at the impact of such a little book. <br /> <br />Nearly twenty years after finishing college, Mitch Albom learns of his college professor, Morrie Schwartz, and his illness (ALS/Lou Gehrig's disease) on national TV with the title \\"A Professor's Final Course: His Own Death.\\"  Mitch then visits with Morrie every Tuesday, and the professor teaches many valuable lessons of life that he has learned over the years.  Morrie offers lots of insight from topics ranging from emotions to money to death, and he concocts aphorisms... many of them that I (and I am sure many other readers) take to heart. <br /> <br />The ending was very touching... I must have read the \\"We Say Goodbye\\" chapter three times because it was so emotional that it brought the beginnings of tears in my eyes. <br /> <br />Being a young woman, I still have my whole life out in front of me.  Reading a book like this makes me appreciate my current life and what I have.  Morrie has shared many life lessons, so when the time comes for me to experience these milestones, both major and minor, in life, hopefully this professor's words will come to mind.  Morrie really has left a \\"lasting gift\\" for this world in the form of Mitch Albom's Tuesdays with Morrie.
B00009ATIX|3.0|This film is a boring remake of a boring movie based on Stanislaw Lem's fascinating book. The original film is a real endurance test; I have never made it through once without napping. This remake is shorter but coffee is still needed to get through it.  <br /> <br />Solaris is a beautiful film, the music is wonderful and it is a faithful homage to the original film, which is part of its problem. Both film versions of the book have long (endless) scenes of the main character looking sad and nothing happens.  <br /> <br />To its credit, Clooney's Solaris has some of that boring fat trimmed off but I was hoping that there would be more scenes showing Solaris as described in the book (hello, special effects department?). The original film took the same \\"men trapped in a floating tin can\\" approach. I was hoping for a film with a larger scope.  <br /> <br />  It is true that Solaris is not so much about the strange planet but how people in the space station orbiting this weird planet are affected by it. But Solaris is represented by a big glowing ball, looking like something taken from an old Star Trek episode. No details are explored in this film, and I was expecting that in 2004. <br /> <br />  Solaris is not bad but it could have been better. Its boring in (lots of) spots but if you are in the right mood then this will not bother you too much.
B00000JHAU|5.0|This is definitely rainy weather, introspective music, and I love every minute of it. I've been listening to it frequently as the weather is changing to rainy fall weather, and I live in Southern California, so this is kinda a rare feeling!<br /><br />  The songs are bittersweet intellectual musings on love and life. The whole album has kind of a fairy tale quality, in a kind of muted childish nursery rhyme sort of way, and singer Stuart Murdoch's vocals are heart melting.<br /><br />  The lyrics complement the sound quite nicely. They manage to be innocent, yet knowing and sometimes sarcastic at the same time. Every track is a standout track. Really they are all favorites.  This is music of very high quality. Everytime I play it, people stop and say \\"What is this?\\"  This is because even upon first hearing, the music is likable, and stands out from the mainstream.
0783225482|4.0|I have always enjoyed black comedies, and have a sometimes embarassingly warped humour. So this film is right up my street.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn's love for Bruce Willis. They end up fighting for him. But, unfortunately they are dead. Strange plot but well executed.<br /><br />I don't think the majority of people will find this a funny film. Some scenes, which in my opinion are hilarious, are crude. For example when Goldie Hawn gets shot in the stomach with a shotgun, and starts walking around with a tremendous hole in her. Or when Streep falls down a large victorian-style staircase, you can hear and see bones breaking, and when she stands up all her limbs are pointing all over the place. Well, crude or funny, or both. You decide.
B00006FDCD|3.0|A fan of the works of Stephen King myself, I can truly thank the producers for bringing It into cinemascope--it truly excels as a novel adaptation. As with Carrie(my fave), the Langoliers, and even cult classics as Creepshow, It is a true-blue-through-and-through book-to-film. <br /> <br />The generally relatable plot centers around 7 adult childhood friends, who attempt to put a stop to Pennywise(Tim Curry, thank heaven)a clown, which is the sum of all children's fears.The acting on part of the child actors is thoroughly beleivable, and there's definitely chemistry in thier circle, but the adults who portray the same charaters, are less than amusing. To say the least, one feels like he's still watching the children, which, although maybe intentional, boors the audience to death after the first hour or two. <br /> <br />The fact that 'IT' was a television premeire explains why the camerawork is a bit run-of-the-mill, and the electronic and sometimes dulling soundtrack is enough for you to go rent \\"The Dentist,\\" instead.  <br /> <br />I admit that clowns are somewhat of a nightmarish fetish, but to be frank, fellas--Tim Curry just didn't make me jump. Creeped me out maybe, but not jump.  <br />The makeup and effects are interesting, and you may never pop a red balloon coming out of your sink again, but give someone else the misfortune of renting this at Blockboster, guys, trust me. <br /> <br />Saw it, fell asleep before tape two, returned it, <br />--GIGI
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Brilliant and hilarious....everyone go see Team America ...it should be number one at the box office instead of that shlock Shark's tale
B000001ELB|5.0|Great early hits compilation but the Japanese version of \\"Greatest KISS\\" is better IMO. Anyway, I do love this CD and the remixes are very good, especially \\"Calling Dr. Love\\" it BLOWS the original version AWAY!!!!  <br /> <br />\\"Strutter '78\\" is cool but I still prefer the original.  <br /> <br />\\"Hard Luck Woman\\" cool but still gotta go with the original.  <br /> <br />\\"Firehouse\\" faster than the original but lacks the sirens at the end.  <br /> <br />\\"Deuce\\" slower than the original but definitely better! Paul's \\"DO IT!\\" makes the song for me.  <br /> <br />\\"Detroit Rock City\\" shorter version but does have an extra verse \\"You Gotta Lose Your Life in Detriot Rock City\\"  <br /> <br />\\"She\\" better than the original with a longer outro.  <br /> <br />\\"Black Diamond\\" longer intro but shorter outro, I like either version.  <br /> <br />I still say check out the Japanese version of \\"Greatest KISS\\" if you want the best KISS compilation out there.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|How is it possible that I'm just not getting around to seeing this movie?<br /><br />Carlito Brigante a vindicated ex-con is desperate to escape his past life as a cocaine dealer.  \\"I'm going straight!\\"  He says, to anyone willing to listen.  He's done it all and now his dream is to go to the Bahamas to invest in a car rental company.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's a stand up man from \\"THE NEIGHBORHOOD!\\"  He's loyal, and respects the bond of friendship that he and his corrupt lawyer Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) share.<br /><br />Everyone has dreams, don't they?  Carlito's dream was to get out!  While successfully saving money in order to make a break.  His heart is reopening to his past love Gail.<br /><br />It's always the pursuit of your happiness that others seem to mess up for you!  Corrupt Kleinfeld brings the pain to Carlito via the mafia, but what about his young nemesis Benny Blanco from Brooklyn, and those so called friends/enemies that help to deduct from his dreams.<br /><br />Ray Charles \\"You are so beautiful\\" plays as we watch Carlito as he ends the story that he's told us from end to the beginning.<br /><br />Al Pacino, has played them all!  Major Cats in the game, not to mention he's been Italian, Cuban, and now Puerto Rican.  I love this man...
B00005JNJ7|2.0|Wow!  It looks amazing!  I'm certain this is gonna be one the best puppetry films I ever seen since...since...hmm...does anyone know any puppet films that were done here within 10 years?<br /><br />~REVIEW~<br /><br />Originally, this was intended to be a \\"That's My Bush!\\" movie (You never heard of \\"That`s My Bush?\\"  Only devoted fans have heard of this short-lived sitcom...all 20 of them), but then South Park-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone decided to change its premise entirely and follow the path of Jim Henson.  Thus the two creators produce this off-beat, political action knock-off that is \\"Team America: World Police.\\"  Whether it was paper animation or live-action, oh hell, Matt and Trey could even make claymation exercise session using a man's unmentionables,  I support and watch whatever wild idea that come out of their demented, creators' flawed minds 100 percent, because I knew it would work to entertain me.  However, in the case of this marionette movie-making experience, this might've change my mind.  This movie didn't entertain me, because it doesn't work.<br /><br />What IS Team America?  It's a \\"Thunderbirds\\" rip-off group of young American normies with distinct abilities that goes off against terrorists around the world, while \\"accidentally\\" wrecking havoc from the countries by their own actions.  There's Joe, the arrogant action dude with a distaste for actors; Sarah, the  second-only-to-hottest chick with whimsical psychic powers; Chris, the quarterback gun'n jackass; and Lisa, the blonde beauty  on gathering information.  After losing a fellow member in the last battle, the boss of TM recruited an up-and-coming Broadway actor, Gary, to join for the cause.  After much hesitation (and glaring at Lisa more than once), the main character finally agrees to join, and goes on a team mission to find out what the terrorists are planning, and stop them for doing the Big Bang.  Add some hidden love-interests, potty mouths, and a North Korean Dictator as the main villain, this is made for big action storyline goodness...sort of.<br /><br />The story is linear, but I believe that's was intentional by the creators, only the bring in more hysterical chuckles of cruelty (like Matt and Trey has always delivered with their work).  Believe me, this puppet film is more f'd up than that Chinese puppet cinema of gorefest about some warriors finding a sacred stone (Sorry, fanatics, I have not seen \\"Meet the Feebles\\").  The writing in \\"Team America\\" is so obscene and mature that it has its moment of irksome laughter and upsetting parents.  It's also quite clever, like in the one scene where some celebrities team up to form as an association to stop Team America by the name of \\"Film Actors' Guild\\" which can be an acronym as...well, I can't say it here, but it's quirky.<br /><br />This is, by far, one of the best technical-looking puppet films I've seen.  From the well-made human designs to the scenery the movie's lo-cals are, I was impressive by how it looks and how it interacts with things with special effects (explosions, decapitations, etc.)  The beauty of its design, however, comes with a severe flaw to the work in which the creators produced.  Despite its sardonic \\"no-strings-attached\\" comedy, the puppets leave A LOT to be desired in the physical humor department.  The best they can do is wobbling around when a battling against enemies like a spastic dancer for CATS, puppet sex (yes, there is a puppet sex scene, and a long one, I say), and vomiting, which was the funniest part in one scene in the film when Gary was drunk and then he threw up...again...again...and AGAIN (Toilet humor, yes, but still effective funny stuff).  Other than those, it wasn't physically over-the-top or breaking new ground compare to Trey and Matt's best work.  And I liked some physical humor.<br /><br />Like South Park: BL&U, \\"Team America\\" includes many musical numbers; the pinnacle would be the movie's theme, \\"America!  **** yea'!\\"  But unlike thatmentioned movie, the songs here aren't completely memorable and they are not going to make me go out and buy the soundtrack.  What bothers me more, comparing to the mentioned movie again, is that \\"Team America\\" is so weak to watch.  It's crazy and overkilling on the profanities, and I expected that (maybe too well).  Come on, Trey and Matt, give me something new to laugh at.  Even with the morals and hidden messages the movie subjects, it didn't affect me too much since I wasn't interested.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Boring.  I wanted to give it a good grade, I really do; this is from the creators of my favorite show, darn it!  But watching \\"Team America\\", to me, is like watching a wooden copy of Matt and Trey's greatest cinema.  I like the production value, but that's all I can say for positives.  Fans of dark puppetry, or a South park fan with curiosity, should try to catch it and enjoy it by its novel idea.  But for fans looking a different taste of gag from what they already saw, watching this dummy movie can make you look like the dummy.But unlike that mentioned movie, the songs here aren't completely memorable and they are not going to make me go out and buy the soundtrack.

B0002BO0AS|5.0|after listening to the stings of conscience, i didnt think Unearth could get any better, and thank god i was wrong, with the sick lyris and screams, and amazing rifts, the oncoming storm elevates unearth to the next level of greatness, anyone who loves hardcore rock will love this cd, and know that its better that the stings of conscience in my opinion at least,
0312995423|4.0|There must be something wrong with me. I read this book on my summer vacation and I enjoyed it. No it's not The Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons, but it's still a good novel. That's the key - it's a novel. Some of these other reviews seem to rate it like non-fiction. I think you'll like it too if you are a Dan Brown fan.
0385512104|5.0|I have such a difficult time finding novels I truly enjoy in contemporary fiction -- this book was a delightful exception. Effortlessly powerful, the deceptively simple prose belies a piercing emotional intensity. The characters are smoothly wrought and vividly portrayed through the author's terse, understated descriptions; the world through Christopher's eyes is one in which both the good and bad in others is magnified, often through heartbreakingly funny observations. Full of pathos and with a blessed lack of pretention, this is one novel that anyone should be able to not only enjoy, but relish.
