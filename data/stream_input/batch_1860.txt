B008TT7CXW|5.0|This little packet has it all.  If you are buying any kind of tablet or handheld console, I really encourage you to buy extra memory cards and make sure it comes with adapter if needed.  This little packet has that and more and for the price, it is great.  Now, you will hear folks talk about Class 4, 6, 10, etc, but I do not notice any lag time with this Class 4 - it works just fine in the PSP 3000 and, again, the price is fantastic.

B006M4F67A|5.0|I really like this game.  It helps my concentration. It makes the time go by fast and makes you want to continue playing. And you have so many different arrangements.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|I had never heard of this group before. The vocals are unique and stunningly beautiful. There is not a single cut on the album that is not interesting lyrically and musically.

B00866JL96|4.0|Zac did a pretty great job acting this character. The film makers have captured these wonderful moments with the characters that seem so real or true to life. Now there are also moments of soft focused schmalzy sunset glowing, over-the-top-ness and a bit too many parts with the creepy gross abusive ex. We get it, he's bad. The main actress is quite good. She brings believability to the character. I just have to take away one star because of the cheese/ex and the fact that she looks like Macaulay Culkin. Which is so odd that it pulls me out of the suspension of disbelief. Overall I'd recommend it. I'd say a good 7.5 on the chick flick meter of 0-10.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Downloaded for kindle fire.  I like the features.  My only complaint is that on this small of a screen it is difficult to touch multiple keys for some of the songs.  Also some of the keys that need to be played are off the screen....the screen doesn't always auto scroll to the high or low end of the keyboard when needed.  You can change key width...but it is minimal and doesn't correct this.  this was a free app.  you can upgrade for more songs and instruments and probably some other features.  It forced closed sometimes when I tried doing the violin and organ.  Otherwise a good free app with nice visual guides and settings.

B008OIQYTG|5.0|This is a great album from Lee & a worthy follow-up to his previous effort called 6 string theory. Like the previous album, Lee packs this album with well-known faces including George Duke, Stanley Clarke, Dave Grusin, Nathan East, Will Kennedy, Marcus Miller, Christian McBride & many more great session players. But despite the big names, it's the composing skills of Lee that is prominent here whether it's his own tune or others. Lee really seems to have made a strong comeback with his last two albums. He seemed to have lost it musically in the albums prior to this but the 'FIRE' is back. I've been listening to it for the last few months & find it refreshing each time. Lee succeeds in using all the talented bass players to optimum use - they are at least 8 of them ! Also Kudos to Lee for promoting young talent in this album - he's featured a lot of promising fresh new artists (winner of a competition) on the track PUNTA DEL SOUL which is a re-worked version from the DAVE GRUSIN album called MIGRATION....This is one of the better jazz releases in 2012. Don't miss it I say !
B006O3MU96|5.0|if you are reading the previous reviews l, they are all wrong. they fixed all of the issues and made the platforms larger and better yet...ITS FREE!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is so fun and addicting. And when I try to turn it off but its so fun I just cant!!!
B004X4R49Y|4.0|We usually avoid videos with R ratings because of having too much objectionable material in them, but a friend who knows our taste still recommended that we check out The King's Speech. Great movie and the use of vulgar language in the context of helping to improve the ability to speak, rather than to just be vulgar and cheap was effective and funny. Knew we had to add it to our collection.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Great flick that I hope runs through a sequel. Only downside I found is it was somewhat predictable, otherwise 5 stars.  Definitely worth seeing
B008ASLK8A|5.0|We didn't think that a sequel to the first Sherlock Holmes videoi would be as good, but A Game of Shadows was great, maybe even better than the first one! A great addition to our home collection. It was surprisingly clean and suitable for nearly all ages, although the little ones might be disturbed at some of Moriarity's cruelty.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Anyone that loves angry birds will love this app.  It's one of my new faves.  Great fun.  Love it.  Buy.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This is a fun game. It's an interesting take on angry birds, being from the pigs' point of view. However, there is one level that I've tried EVERYTHING on and I can't get it. I could look on YouTube to find the answer, but when I'm out and about and have my Kindle with me, I may not have WiFi to be able to figure it out. So it's fun, but a bit frustrating with some of the levels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Ana is annoying, but the book is good.  Plot is senseless, but hey, a good read.  The reviews are more than the book deserves.
B000002J5K|5.0|Well, not really, but close. After all, the music is what makes The Blues Brothers truly great.<br /><br />Good soundtrack but for some reason, some of the tunes are out of order.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book.  I'm still not done with it, but I really need to find out what happens in the end.  Ana is annoying, but this series sucks you in.
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|I thought I could play this game but I guess that is why I am not a musician.  This game would be great for people who are musically talented.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|This book gives good insight into the dismal life of a Taliban follower. It also shows how different and<br />primitive these people are. Unfortunately, it's real and thought provoking. Sometimes John Corey's comments seem<br />stupid.<br />Not as good as the Lion.

0316228532|2.0|I was excited to find this audio book to listen to while driving across four states and back.  I was disappointed.  Maybe it's worse when listening than when reading, but the constant gratuitous spewing of four-letter words was an assault on the ears.  So far it's been a pointless meandering book about mean, unhappy, ugly people with few to no redeeming qualities.  JK Rowling is good at putting words together, but a story, especially one this long, has to go somewhere.  I wouldn't want to know anyone in this book.  The author sounds angry, but doesn't use her anger constructively.  I could watch a reality show to see people behaving badly.  I gave up less than half-way through.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|Heartbreaks, you can't live with them, you can't live without them. The movie fully captures this eternal human paradox, and it does that in a funny, touching way. I don't know about you, but I like intelligent writing, directing and good acting. (500) Days of Summer has all that and then some. If you are in love, were in love and broke up or you are planning on being in love, again, and again, one day, this is the movie for you. It reminds all of us that, like everything else in life, heartbreaks too happen for a good reason.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this case it was a good case for not a bad price. if someone has a kindle it's a great thing to give.
B002YDRA22|4.0|If you ever go to Bethel Woods, the place where the Woodstock Festival took place, if you walk to the left of the impressive museum ( a must experience location), you end up at the top of the hill where three days of peace and music happened in the summer of 1969. You can still feel the vibe of those times, the music, the mud, the youthfulness of the moment and the vibes of that moment is still in the air. Taking Woodstock is capturing all that, including the unimaginable pile of garbage the morning after, and the fact that the world was never the same after Woodstock. Excellent cast, script, directing and editing.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is surprisingly well-developed. The puzzle game itself is a genre I've seen many times before (switch gems and have 3 in a row match), but there is an interesting theme, interesting story, narration, mini-games, to try and submerge the user into the game experience. Overall, well done.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|I have purchased five or six different cases trying to find the right one. Then i bought this one for my wife and i wanted to steal it but i ended up having to order my own. This is probably the cheapest priced case but it was also the last I purchased. It is an incredibly tough case that stands up to a lot of abuse. It is also easy to remove when you want. Over time it has not stretched one bit like several of the other cases which started snug and ended up all stretched out.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Well into season two now, I wanted to go back and write a review of the first season of one of my favorite television series - especially as season two makes the first season look like \\"Mary Poppins\\" by comparison!<br /><br />After reading reviews here, I've realized that those who don't like the show tend to really HATE the show - often with nasty/insulting remarks about everything from the writing to the acting to Dylan McDermott's nude behind.  Am sort of wondering if this venom is because the show isn't mindless or gory enough; American fans of horror tend to like butchers and blood, I have a good friend myself who usually defines a \\"good\\" horror film by the body count.  The more people who die, and the more gruesome their deaths, the better the film.<br /><br />If that's you, you WILL probably hate \\"American Horror Story\\".  The writing here is more subtle, and much more clever.  It's about creeping you out slowly, confusing scenes that come to light later on (sometimes even in another episode) - if you just keep with it and let your brain be engaged instead of your visceral lust for blood and bodies, you'll \\"get\\" what's going on and understand the storylines and characters so much better.  It's a show that gets under your skin instead of assaulting your senses (and WOW, does season two amp up things, on this scale, a hundred-fold!), and even though season one and season two are two completely different anthologies - with completely different characters (some played by a handful of the same actors from season one) and story and even time-frame - I do think you're cheating yourself a bit if you don't watch the first season before viewing the second (especially to see Jessica Lange's brilliance).<br /><br />The story's been gone over before: the Harmon family - Ben (Dylan McDermott), Vivien (the brilliant and beautiful Connie Britton), and their teenage daughter Violet relocate from the east coast to Los Angeles, to start fresh after Ben and Vivien's marriage almost ended due to Ben's infidelity.  Ben got an incredible deal on a beautiful home, and only upon the Harmon's arrival do they learn it's because a death occurred in the home.  Well, more than one death.  In fact, a murder.  And suicide.  And more than one.<br /><br />In fact, their home is known as the Murder House due to its dark and macabre history - a history that starts reflecting itself immediately when we (the viewers) learn that the ghosts of those who've died violently in the home all remain there ... and can still have more than a little influence on the living.<br /><br />Jessica Lange MORE than deserved the awards gotten for playing next door neighbor Constance Langdon, a southern belle who is the only living person around who knows the true nature of the Harmon's home.  She has a basket-case of a son named Tate (Evan Peters, fast becoming one of the best actors of his generation working today), and a sweet-natured daughter named Addie (Jamie Brewer), a young girl with Down's Syndrome whose condition allows her to see the ghosts who walk the Harmons home when others cannot.<br /><br />All figure into the a slowly developing plotline that I won't divulge here - but this is, again, one series you cannot only half-watch!  NOT a show where you can get up and make dinner in between, and certainly please pause it if you have to use the john!  No, \\"American Horror Story\\" takes some thought to keep up with what's going on - and to get the meaning of some things that at first may seem meaningless.  It's smart, wicked, bizzare and very adult television (much like \\"Nip/Tuck\\", by the same creators) with a dark sense of humor ... that also becomes horribly addicting.<br /><br />And for gore-lovers ... don't worry, you got that coming in season two.st ended due to Ben's infidelity.

B003XOTID0|5.0|When I first published this review on Christmas night of 2006, I'd been thinking about Christmas of 1968-- I was 14 then. That was an awful year to live through for anyone, especially a kid. The Vietnam War, the assassination of public figures, and seeing part of my city burn the previous summer during riots-- it was a lot to handle.<br /><br />The song \\"Save The Life Of My Child\\" from BOOKENDS was in my head all throughout 1968. I identified with that frightened boy standing on the ledge, while a crowd below urged him to jump. His final thought as \\"he flew away\\" was \\"...I got no hiding place.\\" That was exactly how I felt in those days.<br /><br />What a powerful and unforgettable way to begin an album. The moods of BOOKENDS reflect so well the troubled times of the late '60s, with its anti-war sentiments (Punky's Dilemma), and its tales of love and love lost (America, Overs). The original first side of the record ends with the sad longing and fears of Old Friends, who sit on a park bench and reminisce together. But this bittersweet song has a deeper message. These old men were survivors-- if they were supposed to be elderly in 1968, then they made it through the Depression, and two world wars, and if they were the youth of 1968 projected into the future, well they too made it through trials by fire.<br /><br />And so have I made it through! I'm in my 50s now and headed for that park bench one day. The fears and sadness of 1968 are long past, but a final memory remains:<br /><br />As I lay in bed early that Christmas Eve, the colored glow of tree lights seeps into my room. Off in the distance are disembodied television voices of Apollo astronauts circling the moon-- they quote passages from the book of Genesis, and wish well the \\"people of the good Earth.\\" It's a peaceful and hopeful ending to a terrible year.<br /><br />Very few albums truly encapsulate a moment in time. Even fewer connect deeply with listeners in ways they may not realize until decades into the future. Simon & Garfunkel's BOOKENDS is one of those rare examples. It is paradoxically timeless and a reflection of its time.ture. Simon & Garfunkel's BOOKENDS is one of those rare examples. It is paradoxically timeless and a reflection of its time.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Great adaptation, listened to it before seeing movie. Excited to see it all together.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars because while Russell Crowe looks the part, he is most certainly not a singer.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I liked this book at first and the premise was interesting enough to get me curious but it couldn't hold me after the first few chapters. It became irritating when the female lead waffled then fell in love then waffled again playing another boy against her boyfriend. I can't understand why he (the boyfriend) didn't leave her after showing her kindness and consideration when she treated him the way she did. Not many men would take having their girlfriend  make a fool of them before his friends and dilute their image basically to door mat status to everyone around them like she did. It just didn't seem believable to me. For me the hero was the fighter who made you root for his bad boy image and didn't deserve the treatment from this confused female. My first book from this author I may try another in the future but not for a while........

B004F5GLJ0|5.0|No need to doubt weather or not to watch this if you love the franchise. As a romantic at heart I think this is well balance with action and romance. This is a great story and the characters development is key in this episode. Definitely a must watch and I will watch at least two more times.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I have waited so long for this album and it didn't disappoint!!! My only fears, singing wise, were Russell Crowe and Sacha Barren Cohen, but Sacha exceeded my expectations and Russell was mediocre, but really didn't take anything away from the magic of the music. 'I Dreamed a Dream' and 'On My Own' had me in tears the first time I heard them. The only reason I gave it 4 stars over 5 because of the missing 'Do You Hear the People Sing?' And because it took a few tries to figure out how to download the MP3s. But definitely a good buy; its so brilliant and beautiful.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|First let me start off by saying that if you have serious relationship issues it will take more than this or any book to help you.

B008DVJO8C|5.0|Not only did I receive Blood very quickly the music itself was even better then I ever expected..there is not a bad song on the whole CD!!!
B00881VLCE|2.0|Not a bad, something to do to keep busy kinda game.  My 9 yo granddaughter likes it more than I do.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The conversion for each movie is fantastic. The packaging alone looks amazing. Haven't had a chance to check out the Alien Anthology disc yet but I'm looking forward to it.
0316066524|3.0|My 15 yr old son carries this book with him.  While it is not my kind of book he seems to like it although he has yet to finish it as it is a very long long book.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This is an amazing show and it is definitely worth to have every season on Blu-ray. Haven't had a chance to check out the extra features yet but I'm looking forward to it
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox has made my life so much easier!  I have access to all of m documents, pics, videos, music, etc no matter which one of my devices I am on or where.  Don't know what I did without it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is such a awesome game its doesn't have ANY viruses on it ,doesn't take 10 years to load, entertaining
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It doesn't matter here.  This app works just as good as if you had a Kindle in your pocket book
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Great classic book for Christmas time. Every parent should make this a tradition . And read this to your children young & old.
B007SGM084|4.0|Not as a good as the Fifty Shades of Grey but definitely still a good reader when wanting more of the love story that started in Grey.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|sometimes the video get stuck somewhere when i watch the movie, i could not find the subttle which is easier for me to understand the movie better
B001BANK32|5.0|A great book. It's more creepy and spooky than it is scary.If you love Stephen King and you haven't read this book yet, you really should.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Fantastic at relaxing you.  I bought this for my Windows phone for travel and after a hard stressful day. Works wonders at relaxing your mind and body. It is a bargain at the price.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Fun read with lots of problem solving that makes you really think along with the story. Has made me think a little deeper in what we all of capable of in a crisis
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|Not really funny this time<br /><br />Was expecting more funny parts<br /><br />But also it wasn't good as the movie  see ya
B002GY9F9K|4.0|An interesting series with many suprises for the viewer. Throughout the various episodes the old wizard adds humor the the series making it more enjoyable to watch.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Violent but not much shown on screen.  Story had holes but it was a good movie to kill several hours.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Not a bad early CD for Pink. A combination of upbeat and slow songs brings a good contrast. However there isn't much variety in the songs causing the listener to become bored with it.
1451648537|5.0|It is a great book that gives a behind the scenes look at the man the creation of a company and the products.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|A great CD for Breaking Benjamin fans. One of their best so far. With a wonderful combination of melodies that connects to the listener.
1400069289|4.0|Would recommend this book.  Interesting about the effects of habit on our life choices.  Not a large book, so a quick read.
0767817710|5.0|A great movie taken place in the old west. A great storyline and wonderful character development. A must see for western fans.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|My eleven yr old is loving it- as everyone does. I'm sure we'll be ordering more of the CD's because he just loves to listen to it. (Though I prefer him to to actually READ one of our copies- I know, such a MOM)
B003Y5H54W|3.0|Not a bad movie. It left something to be desired though with the storyline. It seemed just a tad cheesy.
B00338QENI|5.0|I devoured this book even though it's really not one of my favorite genres.  The science was just so fascinating (and easy to understand) and that she told the story from the perspective of Henrietta's family made it very interesting indeed.  Do YOU know what the do with YOUR genes???
B006P0FICE|5.0|A modern take on a classic movie. Very well done, loved the action sequences and the character development. Would definitely recomend.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I just want to suggest this book to all of my arty friends. It's written with so much imagination and beauty. Not to mention a great story to boot.  Highly recommended for those who like the fantasy genre. (plus it's super clean except for ONE WORD in the beginning- could even be a YA selection except for that one thing).
B001TODO54|4.0|Wonderful storyline unlike many others. The reader sees the characters develop along this journey to essentially save the world as they know it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a great series- though not my usual genre for reading. I know the author probably hates the comparison, but it's like Harry Potter for grown ups- but it's different enough to definitely hold your interest.  I didn't realize that the 3rd book in the series isn't written yet, so I'm waiting with bated breath for the conclusion.  Hurry Patrick!
0694003611|5.0|Wonderful storyline. A perfect bedtime story for any child. Wonderful illustrations with few words which helps young readers to learn how to read.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|While the main character drove me a little crazy sometimes (with her choices), it was made plain by her description of her upbringing.  A happy ending doesn't hurt either. : )
2012017746|4.0|I have read the english version of this book many times and loved it. The french edition is the same but in french making it a bit of a challange but still the same story.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|Love that they made a sequel just about Puss!  We think it was hilarious and a good investment. Hmm, makes me want to go pop it in the CD player right now- ha!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|A great new artist coming to light. This is an amazing CD filled with lyrics that the lsitener can relate to.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had the ending ruined for me but read it anyway- what a good use of time. I love the way the author wrote it and knowing the ending didn't get in the way. Now off to see the movie...
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I'm a big Seth MacFarlane fan, but this is a dud. Made up of Family Guy scripting that falls flat, predictable humor and plot, and vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity that isn't very funny and adds nothing. There are a few funny moments, but they fail to carry the movie. It appears that the writing team is better when they have to work around the FCC's television rules.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The daily scripture is uplifting and right on time. The Bible reading plans are well thought out with a wonderful devotional. The text is easy to read and you have a wide selection of Bible translations to choose from. I'm very pleased with this  Bible. It's the word whenever you need it. Our Pastor says if you have the Word of God with you daily you'll have a better chance of reading it.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Bring on the Cheese! Entertaining enough as long as your expectations aren't to high. Alec Baldwin is a weird choice for his role. Hough is a decent enough singer, but gets thoroughly blown away when Mary J. Blige starts singing.  Stealthy, but liberal auto tuner use makes the cast sound like better singers than they are. There are some sort-of interesting song mash ups that tend to freshen up some of the songs. Just barely worth a rental.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I love geek and roman mythological. i have not read this book but might to see what little bits they could not have in the movie . Did seem to feel very close to Harry Potter , but all and all a good movie .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|wow so fun its so much gunner then other games like temple run it doesn't freeze or have any glitches. wow I would recamend it for anyone. wow.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Movie was kind of slow.  And the plot was a bit contrived.  It was not worth the price.  Should have been an Amazon prime free one.
0307895475|5.0|You never know with Prima Guides - some are maybe ten pages of information spread over 250 sheets of paper, but not this one. This guide has everything you could possibly need to experience every singly nook and cranny of ES V.  864 pages, indexed, with detailed explanations of everything, maps, screenshots, checklists, comprehensive tables.<br />If Skyrim is your first Elder Scrolls game you need this book.  If, like me, you've been playing since Arena you can relax knowing you are going to experience 100% of Skyrim.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I love this movie :) It was so funny and had a lot of great moments in it. People who like comedies movies should buy Ted.
007174889X|4.0|Great book. Very informative and up to date; impressive text! Recommend for all medical professionals who want to correctly diagnosis and treat.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i think its a great game i have a little brother and its easy and fun for him as well
B004SDEP38|3.0|Have only used EXCELL to date and so far so good. Hopefully I will be satisfied with the other apps as well.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|the item came on time and in one piece. This is a awsome P R O D U C T
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is additive and will your attention for hours. The only thing is I wish it changed with the seasons and holidays that would be nice
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|the item came on time and in one piece. This is a awsome P R O D U C T
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Really awesome movie. Heartwarming and touching. I didn't think they were going to make it , but they did. Get it.
0446580848|5.0|Got this for my son's birthday. Was delighted with the speed of delivery, using standard free shipping. Book reads very well, son read it, wife is reading it, I get thirds.
B000WBZZ2A|5.0|Action packed and full of adventure. Max is gonna save the world from the villians or die trying. Good movies.
B00555X8OA|2.0|Most of the book is just common sense if you have been paying attention to life and people.  &#34;Don't judge a book by it's cover&#34; is something we all know is good advice.  Author tells you why you should think before acting, deciding,  or opening your mouth.  If your lucky the message from this book was taught to you by your parents.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|It's a so-so game. It's not as fun as angry birds. The same idea, but the pigs fly, big deal.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I bought this book as soon as I heard it was out.  I have heard that publishing this caused the author some trouble but this needed to be written.  These are serious warriors and the story of what they do and how they live reminds me that we are free because violent men are willing to protect us.
0307592731|1.0|Not sure why everyone thinks of her as some sort of heroine.  I have been through far worse then she has and I couldn't just walk away and go 'find myself' I had real life to deal with. Had to and still had to deal with my problems not runaway. This isn't a freaking fantasy, this knitwit actually did this.  When it looked like she was going to be assaulted, I didn't once think 'oh how horrible.'  I thought 'You're damn lucky, you set yourself up for this.'  I had read this for a book club and was chastised for my views.  We need stories of strong women over coming adversity, not stories of stupidity and then to make them famous and rich off it too.  Disgusting.  I really want the time back that I spent reading it.  If you don't like my opinion deal with it.  If you have constructive things to say, great if not, keep you mouth shut there is far too much bashing of peoples opinions anymore.  People are not wrong for having an opinion and expressing them.  Think that's part of living in a free country.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book was written so well that I could not put it down.  In hindsight those brave men fought battles they should have skipped.  This book is riveting.
B009ZE27US|1.0|Its ment to be funny...but its not. It is just another thing to take up space on you're device<br />It Sucks.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Spider Solitaire is absolutely addictive<br /> we downloaded spider just before boarding a flight to India,we spent the entire time playing,except for meals and drinks!! now we are in the most beautiful place imaginable,we are still playing,very sad!!! FOrcing ourselves go  to out and explorel We will have to leave our Kindles in the room!!!<br />great mind game,buy it though,otherwise you will be annoyed by the adverts,worth every penny. ENJOY!
B006LSZECO|5.0|These characters put the &#34;dys&#34; in &#34;functional.&#34;  Well-written and fast-paced. I was pleased that I could not predict the outcome early on.  Read the synopsis to get an idea of the story line, but do read the book.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I have to agree with most of the four and five star reviews. I really know nothing about this women, but have heard of the children's books and probably read one or two when I was younger in school.<br /><br />The acting is good, the theme, and the landscape scenery in, I want to say - in England ( I hope) - is very delightful. God has created such a beautiful Earth and how marvelous and delightful it will be in the near future under His heavenly kingdom government when the Meek and Righteous ones will possess the Earth and \\"find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace\\" (Psalms 37: 11, 29, New World Translation).
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I thought it was an entertaining twist on the Matthew Damon original three.  It was time for a few twists on the old formula and they pulled it off reasonably well.  Final chase seen was a little too forumulec.  But for that I would have given 4.5 stars.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This was a very good purchase and the price was excellent. Have purchased these Maxell lithium batteries before and never had any problems with them.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|It was good, but not as good as the earlier ones. Maybe a little more like a video game than a movie. I was glad I watched it, though.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is one of the most amazing films I've ever watched. Very well done! There is a good deal of violence throughout the movie and it may not be suitable for some younger viewers. Similar in intensity to the Star Wars series.<br /><br />The collector's edition has a &#34;Made for General Audiences&#34; version that allows a choice viewing.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I saw a lot of people saying its a little off with the buttons. had no problems with that it works great. so fun and im a big whovian and any whovian needs to have this!!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|it seems like just a lot of running around.  Great graphics and scenery.  I do not recommend it to anyone
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was able to upload my own EBook simply by following the step by step instructions.  It was a great help!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I started reading Wool 1, I liked it.  Didn't think it was particularly special, but it was fun sci-fi and it was cheap (purchased omnibus on sale).  I mashed through parts 2 and 3 which were better and then parts 4 and 5 utterly blew me away.<br /><br />I could not help but think \\"Why isn't this a movie instead of all the unoriginal crap they make nowadays'.<br /><br />I'm hooked and just bought part 6 and will buy part 7 as well when I'm done with that.<br /><br />These books are simply amazing!<br /><br />I'll probably finish book 6 tonight!
159420229X|5.0|nice product, with great looking and nice price. it's hard for me find it at market, but easy at ebay..
B005LAII80|5.0|After a summer of generally mediocre and unremarkable blockbusters, it took a mid-budget, independent, comic book adaptation to generate any excitement.<br />And what an exhilarating and exciting movie Dredd turned out to be-more than living up to its classic comic book source material, no mean feat in itself.<br />Dredd (2012) gets everything right that the 1995 movie iteration of the character got so spectacularly wrong.<br />Dredd is a refreshingly adult piece of filmmaking-brutal, dark and with a razor sharp vein of black humour running through it and is pretty much the opposite of what Hollywood churns out today.<br />Dredd is old school filmmaking at its best and reminiscent of many of the classic 80's dystopian sci-fi movies of the past, such as Mad Max II and Escape From New York, and is really not to be missed by fans of such films.<br />The performances are uniformly excellent. Karl Urban perfectly embodies the cold, almost machine like character of Judge Dredd and Urban is matched by his co-star, Olivia Thirlby, who gives a remarkably committed performance, as rookie Judge Anderson.<br />Your protagonists are only as good as your antagonist. And luckily with Lena Headey, playing Ma-Ma, they have their equal as she depicts a brutally ruthless individual, that is also a strangely sympathetic one. Not an easy juggling act to pull off.<br />The film is visually striking with an effective (read subtle) use of 3D that never overshadows what is effectively a high octane and sharply written character study from director Peter Travis and writer Alex Garland.<br />If, like me, you miss the days when films weren't just an excuse for increasingly overblown and redundant uses of CGI and in service of an actor's ego, at the expense of a compelling narrative, then Dredd is the film for you and should be ordered without hesitation.
1410441229|5.0|nice product, with great looking and nice price. it's hard for me find it at market, but easy at ebay..
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved it in the theater and I've watches it many times on On Demand. I am so happy to finally be able to buy it.  And the price is good . It's just a great story especially if you like English Actors and films of India.
1451648537|5.0|nice product, with great looking and nice price. it's hard for me find it at market, but easy at ebay..
B009X01FJS|5.0|This case is on my wife's new 8.5&#34; Kindle Fire HD. It fits well and it allows her to rotate the screen easily. She love the case and her new Kindle. Good product.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Very fun little game where you are fighting against other ships for control over islands and eventually working your way over to destroying the opponents base. So far I have only fought against the computer, would be cool if they made it so you can play against other players online.
B00124BNF4|3.0|Nice to hear some pop music from the seventies. One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Eleven.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!  Loved the Sky and Holder. I will definitely look at the sky and stars with new eyes. Thank you Colleen Hoover!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|it is an ok game but I would not pay for it. the game is really easy but sometimes things are behind the timer and you can not see them or move the timer out of the way making it really stupid which is to bad. I will not buy any more games from them till I see that this is fixed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A book you can not put down.......<br />It's full of unexpected twist and violence, and it makes.you want.to bring down the capitol
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I loved this book it took me back to the days of playing Nancy drew. It was a real mystery that had you guessing in the beginning then you begin to put the clues together yourself. It's a fun read.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The \\"mono box\\" is essential for Beatles fanatics who absolutely need to have the recording variations that exist only in mono. I suppose one could get by with the collection of stereo CDs, but having the mono recordings adds a nice cherry on the top. The one specific track I really looked forward to hearing was the mono mix of \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\". Although beautiful to hear in stereo, the mono mix features different backward guitar notes and a verse or two out of order. This whole collection is like that; because The Beatles sometimes went as far as using different takes for the mono versions of their recordings. The other reviewers at Amazon have gone to great efforts to document some of the sonic details that distinguish the mono and stereo mixes from each other. If this mono box set never existed, I would certainly be satisfied to own the stereo CDs. But since this mono box does exist, I love The Beatles enough to have laid down the cash to own \\"The Beatles In Mono\\". I am obsessed enough to feel that my collection is incomplete without the mono mix of \\"If I Fell\\" that has Paul McCartney's voice NOT cracking the last time he sings \\"was in vain\\", or the different swine sounds on \\"Piggies\\".
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good story! Loved how Dean never stopped loving Sky after all those years!  Would definitely read again! Great book!
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|This is one of the best step up movies that they have made in my opinion. but then again I love all of the movies... this one is going into my collection
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game it is so funnnnn and addicting!! I play this game all the time!! Amazing and fun game! :) Thank you OMGPOP!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|love it so far, cant wait till the next episode! If you havent seen it yet, its a must see
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addicting. It is fun for me and. y husband. Our kids love it too and our youngest is only 5. Great for all ages.
B009K0P10K|5.0|love the plot line. Was totally sucked into season one, but season two seems to have some laps between episodes which i really dont like... wish it was on every week
B009A9EPLM|5.0|Another wonderful score by the inimitable John Williams.  Pastoral and optimistic are the two words I would use to describe the music that underscores this brilliant film and that helps underscore a more noble time in politics.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Its really sad when the best thing about this movie is 5 amazing actors taking off their clothes. but the story like kinda sucked, and it left you hanging when mike just left...
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box is another new adventure in the series........loved it<br />Michael Connelly makes his books very realistic so you are on the edge of your seat reading them
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Really like this product, the price was right and it really protects my Kindle. You can buy more expensive, but for the value I would recommend this product
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I wanted a game my grandkids could play but you must invite friends to be able to complete the tasks
B009FZFONO|5.0|Abandon all hope ye who enter here. Season three continues its post apocalyptic plunge into the depths of despair. The main characters continue to die off.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|very good movie. i definitively watch it again, but overall i like the price i paid to watch it 1.99
B0072OFM28|5.0|one of the best shows on tv ,next to the walking dead ,these two are to good for tv !!!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is wonderful as is the narrator.  I listen while traveling and rad while at home and when a narrator is god, I continue to hear them as I read.  I love this combination and I am reading it again in anticipation of the movie released this Christmas.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows ever made. We never get tired of watching it at out house! Can't tell you how many times we've watched every episode!
0345803493|4.0|I could not get into reading this 2nde book. I still have not finished it. Maybe I will come summer
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Brave is by far the best animated film of the year and deserves the Academy Award. The scenery, storyline, and music make it one of Disney's best films!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|It is un awesome story of friendship that warms your soul. It is also very funny, any kid and adult in the world should watch it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I enjoyed the game. but once I really started playing, the application would come up then shut off.  I tried downloading it about five times but the same thing keep happening,  thats very disappointing. If you have any idea, how it stop this, please let me know...I really liked this game.
B005HSL626|5.0|This was a REALLY FUN GAME ....... then 2 days after I got the game when ever I went to launch the game it would go right to the home screen. Otherwise I would say by this app. The only reason I gave it five stars is cause it was great before
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and this is s good one!  It is very quick in its responses of moving cards around....and it was free!!!
B00913P6G0|5.0|Bravo! This is a brilliant record. It is a must listen for ALL music fans, not just hip hop. The high praise the album has received since the album release is well deserved. It has me more excited about a rap artist than I have been in years. Dude is so sick with it.<br /><br />Production is spot on with clever use of samples. I particularly love the use of \\"Silver Soul\\" by Beach House, played backwards, during \\"Money Trees.\\" Beautifully done.<br /><br />Kendrick has a smooth as silk flow and vocal style. I don't understand the complaints about his voice. He has a unique sound that is easy to decifer, and he uses different styles well when the song calls for it. His sound is just as well suited for chill, laid back tracks (money trees, B**** don't kill my vibe, Sing about me, Swimming Pools) as it is for high energy, higher tempo songs (Backseat Freestyle, m.A.A.d. city, Compton). You can see Kendrick Lamar's versatility in one track in particular, \\"Backseat Freestyle,\\" in which there are 3 different verses, each performed masterfully in a different vocal style. His talents are diverse and he has a blazingly bright future ahead of him.<br /><br />This album deserves to be heard start to finish. If you do and still aren't impressed, you are lying to yourself or you are a hater. It is so refreshing to hear a \\"concept\\" album in this genre that functions as a cohesive piece of \\"album art.\\"<br /><br />Kendrick absolutely knocked it out of the park. I literally can't stop listening to this album, and I wouldn't even consider myself a die-hard rap/hip-hop fan. But I know good music when I hear it, and Good Kid, m.A.A.d City is one of the best albums of the year.<br /><br />Intelligent lyrics, incredible production, and a perfect level of swagger from Kendrick Lamar on this brilliantly crafted album. Must listen!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Was expecting a better fight with JCVD. Jet Li's role was too short. Even with all the extra character appearances, I think I like the first one better.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Wow, in terms of functionality this product actually works. I was worried about the whole cable thing, but this thing works with some wireless keyboards and mouses. Iv'e tested a couple. Unfortunately i have the crappy ms wireless 3000 kb and mouse combo. The kb works but not the mouse. So i bought another mouse. I was expecting problems with the deadzone and stuff but never experienced none. If you do try to turn around, the thing rotates very fast (once you get used to it its actually a better thing)<br /><br />Othe than that the ps3 now feels exactly like a PC. I didnt go in with the default settings. Their website has excellent support and there are settings for all the ps3 games as played by users who upload them to the site. I downloaded the settings for COD mw3 and loaded it straight to my eagle eye.<br /><br />Once on i hooked it up, ps3 reconized it in about 10 secs and i could play. I was really impressed with the device. I actaully havent adjusted anything on the eagle eye. Just played a bit with ingame sensitivity.<br /><br />Very amazing feature is the scope mode, which allows you to decrease sensitivity. So, if your'e playing normally and running around, you need highger sensitivity for quick responses, however if youre sniping, accuracy becomes an issue so you can go for lesser sensitivity. The eagle eye will do this for you automatically.<br /><br />So its a very impressive piece of kit (pc required for updates and controll config changes). However it does look a bit on the cheap side, the outer casing concerns me abit. Other then that it works amazing
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hat these book a lot because I can not  see soda that I want like a, little, bother, because
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It is a very timely subject.  A lot of this is probably going on in the world now.  A great read, as always.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It brought the trilogy together.  Much more believeable than the first two books.  Most people like happy endings.  Good read.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Great acting in this thriller. Man vs Nature. Plot kept my interest for the entire movie. Good special effects as well.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I know most of what was in the book. I farm and study some of the history of food. This guy just put into words what i have been thinking.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app helps me not only tell how charged it is but felled me how hot it is so I don't get it over a hundred degress
0446580848|4.0|I've been a Nelson Demille fan forever. Okay, not forever, but at least since the last millennium.<br /><br />He's funny, clever, and squeezes in fascinating information, drawing upon extensive research he does for almost all his novels.<br /><br />THE PANTHER is a very good example of this.<br /><br />It is a great, fun read. I learned a lot about Yemen, and I enjoyed seeing the familiar heroes--John Corey and Paul Brenner--fighting side-by-side. However, both these characters are too similar, and there wasn't enough tension between them to make for more than an interesting and amusing distraction to the main theme.<br /><br />I think Demille could have done a lot with this, but alas, he didn't. He was more focused on Yemen than playing around with character development. I must say, he did a ton of research on Yemen. It was quite interesting, but at the same time, I had the feeling he didn't want any of his research to go to waste--he went out of his way to have his characters act as tour guides throughout the book, filling the reader's head with facts about the history of the country and the Yemeni culture.<br /><br />The book was too slow for my taste. There were too many giveaways and too few surprises. You have to read to the very end to find yourself sitting at the edge of your seat. And I guessed everything anyway. This was a very predictable plot.<br /><br />Despite all that, I had a great time reading THE PANTHER, and I finished it in three days.<br /><br />If you like Nelson Demille, you'll like this book, no question. It's nothing like THE GOLD COAST, but it is a fun read, and if you just want to be entertained and learn something in the process, THE PANTHER should definitely be on your reading list.
B008133MDK|5.0|Continually amazed at how closely the BBC writers and producers capture the original feel and flavor of AC Doyle's masterpiece, even though the time has been moved up to the present. The way they show Holmes' observational skills and vast knowledge of minutiae is perfect.<br /><br />They have yet, if I remember right, not done much of anything with Holmes' masterly use of disguises, but the cliffhanger at the end of season two may open the door for us to see how masterly Holmes' disguises can be. We'll see.<br /><br />Captivating! Stunning visuals! Brilliant acting! Intelligent plot and dialogue! Great tension AND humor!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|boring movie. has story but direction is not good as previous batman movies. not much action. villain is highlight of movie.<br />good thing I waited to see movie as rental than theater.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Immaturely written. No point. Weak characters. Degrading. The worst and most worthless book I have ever read. I can not subject myself to the colossal waste of time required to read the next two.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez was/is a bright thread through my life and it has surprised me how few people have even heard his music let alone know who he is. I made sure my 10 year old watched Searching for Sugarman, not only to catch glimpses of times during my youth but also to make the point to cast the music net far and wide in hopes of snaring these kind of gems.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I always expect great story telling from Ken Follett and Winter of the World did not disappoint. He picked up the threads of Fall of Giants and wove and intertwined a great story. My only regret is the two year wait for the conclusion.
0545265355|5.0|Fantastic book series!  As corny as it sounds, I feel like these books changed my life.  They really make you think, and maybe change the way you look at the world.  I was unable to put it down, and it didn’t matter anyway, because I couldn’t stop thinking about it even when I wasn’t reading it.  Like a fire, it consumed me.  I feel that I relate more to the character Peeta than any other character I have ever read about (with the exception that he can paint lol).  This trilogy is one of those books that I think everyone should read!
B004ISVH7U|5.0|Simon and Garfunkel are the best, and always were.  This CD makes me happy when listening (and singing along) while  I'm driving, making me a better driver, I think.  The DVD is most revealing of the whole process, and the times Art and Paul came of age in, and dealt with, by writing and performing songs which said it all.  Bravo gentlemen!

B0058YPLA2|5.0|Where do i begin? How about...<br />Once upon a time there was a show that I watched on hulu on breaks inbetween studying for Step 2 CK. A show so wonderful, that I fell in love with it and was motivated to wake up every morning to eat my breakfast and watch before every day's study session...<br /><br />I bought the season to watch with my significant other as well as other family members. A great show with good twists and turns and dynamic characters. I cannot wait until the 2nd season is available for sale!
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Presumably, this was an attempt to kick the typical action film up a notch.  I'd say mission accomplished but along with the skill required to tell a story in multiple flashbacks comes a level of complexity that might frustrate fans who want a simple revenge story from point A to point B.  If it really matters, the story is explained at the end.  In the meantime there's tons of action and the fun is that these things are so over the top, you're not expected to take them seriously.  Gina does so much running and climbing she makes Tom Cruise look like Remo Williams.  Good soundtrack, too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I almost hate to start watching something so good, because when it ends, I'm devastated! If you had told me even a few months ago that I would be into a show about zombies, I'd have thought you were crazy.<br />But this is good. Really good. Hooked from the very first episode. Good cast, great story.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|This novel was highly predictable.  Poor Harold, probably more aware than the author would lead us to believe considering Harold's mild case of Alzheimer's.  Harold's adventures, as he walked along the road were not terribly memorable and (I won't spoil it for the other readers), and the ending was most predictable. My low rating is probably my fault, since I tend to like books with more energy and with more dramatic events.

030758836X|4.0|This book. Seriously. This book. It was ALL everyone could talk about and since I've been a Gillian Flynn fan since her first novel, I was obviously going to get around to reading this one. This was one of those novels that I went back and forth between loving and hating because I absolutely LOVED it until I got to a certain point and then I was so abnormally angry with this novel that I almost threw it out the window. I'm not lying. I was that pissed off about it.<br /><br />I've loved all of Flynn's novels before but the writing in this novel was superb. It was seriously such an incredibly complex and well-written novel. I'd promise myself only \\"one more chapter\\" and that would almost always turn into five more chapters. Flynn has a way with her narrative voice that makes it impossible to not get addicted to reading her novels...especially this one. Nick and Amy are so intricately written, so deviously deceptive, so... irrevocably interesting. If I could possess just of fifth of Flynn's writing abilities, I'd be in good shape. Seriously. Not only are her books worth reading for pleasure, but they're worth studying because every writer should aspire to write novels the way that she does. She completely charms the pants off of her readers and invites them into her disturbing, crazy, fictitious world. The twist and turns in this book are some of the best I've ever seen in a novel. Just when you think you have things figured out--you have no effing clue what's about to pop up. The characters are a particular place of controversy for me because even though I absolutely hated one character...I also had to love to hate her because Flynn was just that good about writing the character. It's hard not to appreciate the talent it takes to write such a reprehensible character like she does. Really, the thing I loved MOST about this novel is how it messes with your mind. I couldn't stop thinking about what I was reading, the situations the characters were going through and every night as I set the book aside, it's what I fell asleep thinking about and it's what I woke up thinking about. Then, after I finished it, even as I'm writing this review, I can't get certain things out of my mind. This is the kind of book I live for.... the kind that won't get the hell out of my brain even though I finished it months ago.<br /><br />Honestly, the ONLY thing I can complain about, (and it's a rather large complaint) is the ending. I've thought about it long and hard and while I've read many many reviews that both loved and hated the ending, I can only speak for myself when I say that I HATED the ending. I hated it. The ending is the thing that caused my coveted 5 star rating down to a 3.5 or 4 star rating. I've said it many times before and I've even campaigned for more authors to do the sort of ending that Flynn gave in this novel, however... I just couldn't dig it this time. I was so pissed off. I felt gypped, I felt betrayed and I felt like I invested a lot of time, emotion and brain power in this novel to have such a cheapened experience with the ending. I can't really elaborate any further because it's almost impossible to say anything else without giving spoilers and this is a book that deserves to be read from beginning to end without spoilers but I can't write this review confidently without giving my honest opinion and that is the ending friggin sucked. Okay, rant over.<br /><br />Overall, I had to go ahead and give a 4 star rating because I really did love 3/4 of the novel. And regardless of the ending, it was stellar book with impeccable writing. Gillian Flynn has shot to the top of my favorite authors even with the little ending mishap. I'm not so narcissist to think that everyone will have the same views of the ending as I did, so I HIGHLY recommend you give this book a try and see if you loved the ending. I know a lot of people who did. In all honesty, I can totally see why this book was all people could talk about. Give a try. Let me know what you think.

0671624342|5.0|Jeffery Archer is one of my favorite authors and he didn't disappoint me with this book. Subtlety in characterizations and rich dialogue are his trademarks, as is the surprise ending. Much like his book, Shall We Tell The Preaident, he has a fine attention to detail, no doubt achieved by extensive research. I've read this book about five times and I can't wait to read it again.

1400067820|5.0|Let me begin this review by saying that if I could rate this book six stars above all other works in my library, I would. Taleb's books continue to improve with every release he makes. Fooled By Randomness was good and worth reading, The Black Swan was illuminating and life-changing, but I feel that Antifragile is the book which I will uniquely reread and refer to for a very long time indeed. Now let's move on from the praise and discuss the book itself.<br /><br />Antifragile is first and foremost a work of philosophy, and rarely strays into the world of finance which Taleb's previous works focused most of their attention on. The main thrust of the book is that fragile things are those which are harmed by volatility. A glass on a shelf does not generally benefit from an earthquake. This idea is then applied to many sectors of life, exposing fragile careers, people, life choices, and governmental systems, among others, which we generally may not think of as being particularly in danger of collapse upon first glance.<br /><br />The opposite of fragile is then given a word, \\"antifragile\\", which is defined as a thing which benefits from volatility. An entrepreneur can attempt many ventures and at worst ends up back where he started, with nothing to show for it. However, one of his attempts may be a success, and he has the possibility of massive returns from his repeated small investments. This concept is also extrapolated across the human experience liberally, and exposes some interesting insights as to what may be the safe thing for a person, group, or society to do as opposed to the immediately profitable but not-so-obviously fragile options that are sometimes presented.<br /><br />And let's not confuse safety or antifragility with anti-capitalism. This book is staunchly capitalistic, but it encourages people to seek profits which are sustainable and benefit from the randomness of time and modernistic society rather than those which are gained then lost then gained and lost again. Taleb's argument does sometimes come dangerously close to anti-modernist anarchism, but these extreme leanings simply drive home the fact that he means what he says, and is willing to carry his beliefs further than most would dare. While I do not personally agree with every single statement that he makes in the text, even his most radical arguments are compelling and worth reading.<br /><br />Antifragile is a work which I feel has more in common with ancient philosophical treatises by Seneca and Plato than with modern literature. It is deeply personal while still being far-reaching and applicable to almost any situation. It is one man's attempt to show others their blindness and then explain to them what they can do about it. Taleb is an erudite but also a practitioner, whose studies of the classics and life experiences have led him to some unique insights on the nature of life and living. It is my hope that his books will be read alongside those of the ancients in the years to come, as equals in the philosophical canon.nd lost again.

B008133DO8|5.0|My youngest son and I have explored all the various incarnations of Sherlock Holmes.  From The Strand stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, to silent movies, to the Basil era, to John Gielgud's radio programs, even the re-imagining of the genre from Hollywoods' big machine with Robert Downey Jr, each with it's own charm, but we do enjoy this series immensely!<br />These shows are wonderfully imagined, with intelligent scripts, superb acting and a lovely twist incorporating your old favorite stories into modern themes and times.  We couldn't be more pleased, one that Sherlock has truly withstood the test of time and just keeps getting more famous with each passing era, bringing new fans into his world and mind, and two, that this show does not play down to it's audience, but brings you with Sherlock and his clues into deducing all, with a quick wit and a sharp tongue.<br />Truly, a well worth your while and extremely brilliant series, which we hope continues for many more seasons!  Well done!

160094048X|5.0|So, I gotta say, I got this cookbook after getting Veganomicon and trying several recipes that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I am THRILLED with this purchase, and so is my omnivore husband!<br /><br />So far we've tried the tahini-lime cookies, the mexican chocolate snickerdoodles, the blackstrap gingersnaps, and the mocha mammas, and each and every recipe is gorgeous and delicious.  I can't wait to try the fig bars and the \\"nutter butter\\" imitations, as well as a few others that have struck my fancy.  Every single recipe has been declared a keeper in our household which is truly something amazing.  It's a great book for any cookie afficionado and I can't wait to bring these little critters to my holiday parties!

B0058YPLA2|4.0|this was a good investment for me. Me and my family all loved this and I just had to get it. My older sister would never watch them. She thought they were dumb until one day I told her to just try one episode and she has been hooked since. I really liked the first season but I like the second season much better. I will most likely get the second season as it becomes avaliable.

Going for a cup of coffee while staying in the conversation is good. Have been using this unit for about three months.<br /><br />The G930 Head Set was easy to install and setup. Operation is mostly intuitive. The G930 has many features far beyond my requirements. I have tried all features and they have all worked perfectly.<br /><br />Send and receive sound quality is very good and that, after all, is what it is all about.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was probably the most intense book in the series.  I would also argue to say that it was probably the best written, as well.  The author still over-used certain words & phrases, but there was much more movement within the story.  There were parts of the story that were so gripping, I physically felt my heart pumping fast... I couldn't read it fast enough!  It was full of twists and turns... This book will have you on the edge quickly!! There are two parts of the end that were nice, but also didn't make sense.  I felt like they could've been added at the beginning of book 2 or something.  Christian's first Christmas is mainly what I'm talking about.  After such a good ending, it kind of throws you off.  Also, at the very very end, it tells the first meeting between Christian & Ana from Christian's point of view.  It was great, but at the same time, I felt like it would've maybe been better elsewhere.  I finished the book with a good feeling about the development of Christian Grey, but then (even though you understand that it was a retelling of the past...) it felt almost like a regression.  You remember how much of a jerk he was in the beginning.  If you're going to tie the story in a nice little bow at the end... \\"Happily Ever After\\", if you will-- it kills the mood a little when you reiterate that he was once a jerk... Overall, I loved this series.  It gets only 4 stars for redundancy & overkill of certain aspects, however.
0375413405|5.0|In some ways, cooking is like Anatomy and Physiology. Things just don't change dramatically with time the ingredients are all still the same and the function behind bringing them to the table is too..<br />These recipes are timeless and aside from the methods used then and now to mix and prep, the recipes are still the same. I have always admired Julia Child and was depressed when she passed. I couldn't help thinking, &#34;That woman was a few days shy of her 92 birthday and lived on butter and cream and all the things that we are told are bad for us&#34;. It's because she cooked from scratch and tended not to use anything loaded with chemicals or preservatives.<br />  I sat down and started to read the beginning. It's the basics of everything that is cooking. The descriptions are such that you can envision what to do before you do it.<br />This book, along with &#34;The Joy of Cooking&#34; should be a staple in any kitchen.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|I've always liked this movie series...watched the first install like 3000 times while &#34;working&#34; at a mall (a Direct Tv promo). It's been a couple of years since the first one but it still impressive...
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|I gave this 5 stars primarily beacause the cast of Alec Bladwin and Anthony Hopkins give a great performance that is usually an  unsuccessfull venture. Many times when 2 or  A-lists actor and/or actresses join together to make a film the results are dissapointing. I also take a lot of consideration that the movie I purchase in Blu-Ray format is often action/adventure or is very special effects driven, e.x. Stars Wars, Matrix. This was actually a borderline gift purchase since it is not an extreme special effects movie at all. However, this is a movie that the majority of people I know thoroughly enjoy which is also another reason I considered purchasing it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Got this game for my kids they love it! I even like to play it. That's saying a lot because I'm not that big in games.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Its OK interesting plot, well about as interesting as any other zombie flick nothing about this show screams must watch.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It does you no good to just read the first book of the series. This series is so much deeper than the sex that it's famous for.  It's somewhat unfortunate that E.L . James decided that overkill was a safe tactic, because I'm sure she alienated many  many readers.  The story really didn't need as much sex (and redundant sex-- described the same way, might I add) to make the story phenomenal. I love the last part of this book-- and might I suggest, you better have Fifty Shades Darker on hand to start right away!
B001609SQA|5.0|I saw the first movie Alien when it first came out. I was in 8th grade. Scared the bejesus out of me, I couldn't sleep normally for weeks after. Every time It came on TV, i made it a point to watch it. Ridley Scott directing gave the alien less screen time than any other &#34;scary&#34; movie I know. You only got to see bits and pieces of it and never the ENTIRE creature for very long. I think that's what made it so scary. There's no &#34;In your Face BOO!&#34;. Alien is far more cerebral than that.<br />Aliens has more comic relief and being directed by James Cameron is even more so about strong female leads.<br />  I was talking to my daughter about it. She was about 20 when Prometheus came out. I told her, before we see it, I told her about Alien and how Prometheus was loosely based on the original alien series. Of course, whenever you deal with a new generation, your stuff is old and the kids know nothing about the movies of their parents generation. But, she is a trooper and will watch and read things I suggest (One great thing about my kid). So, one day, I Amazon primed this movie and we sat down and watched it. She never moved, peeped or blinked. I think I messed her up a bit. She was never one for Freddy or Jason movies.. She's smarter than that. So, THEN, I Amazon primed &#34;Aliens&#34; for her and she was thrilled with it She thought it was the best one (As does the rest of the world)<br />  Then, we Primed Prometheus... The ending was supposed to be sort of where Alien starts, but there's a few whoopsies and things don't line up exactly. But, she saw the things she was supposed to see that paralleled Alien with Prometheus.<br />  I guess you can say that Alien and Aliens are timeless movies to me in the same boat as Gone with the wind and Wizard of Oz.  Good enough for generations to enjoy

B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love John's dark sense  of humor. I believe the book accurately portrays Americas current activity in Yemen. I learned a lot about the country and find that it pretty much shows actual life in the middle east.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I think book 2 is where Christian & Anastasia grow the most.  They go through this world-wind relationship, but each time grow and learn more about each other.  I only have two complaints about all of the books in the series, and that is 1) The author seriously needs to learn the art of minimizing \\"overkill\\"-- there are certain words (aka murmur(s) that she overuses to the point where it literally made me want to poke my eyes out if I had to read the word again.  She should've definitely made more use of a Thesaurus.  2) The sex overshadows how great the story actually is.  Everyone loves a good sex description, but (again, along the lines of overkill)- I feel the series gets too much attention because of the excessive sex.  At the end of the day, many people will not read the books b/c they will think it's just pure smut.  They will be seriously disenfranchised, because the actual story is phenomenal.  Poor them.  But if anything, if you make the commitment to read one, you HAVE GOT to read all 3!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got hooked on this game and I love that it has many levels, so I don't get bored. Great App
0375826742|5.0|Book is in excellent condition, no evidence of previous use, can't wait for my son to open it on Christmas!
B009B8YZIK|4.0|Im not a Halo person. Never played it. Still I sat and watched the movie. So I didnt know the backstory or anything. I thought it was a really good movie, way too short though. Just when the story was really taking off it was over. Hope they put more out
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Not much happens in the book but its rather beautiful. It goes quickly and keeps your attention. I would definitely recommend it.
1449410243|5.0|I read The Oatmeal at work whenever a new comic is uploaded.  These are by far the best comics I have seen from the website.  I am a cat owner myself, with two cats, and previous cats before these ones.  This is a must buy for any other cat owners.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|...and I read constantly.<br /><br />Weir put it all together just right. Drama, constant conflict, comedic relief at just the right moments, and an awesome finale.<br /><br />Some say the &#34;science isn't right&#34;. It's called science FICTION. Don't get too wrapped up in the numbers. The story is what it's all about and this one is just incredible.<br /><br />I cannot begin to recommend this enough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So do I. I'm not sure there are many people that haven't read this book series , but All I can say is can't wait for the movie!
1401216676|5.0|Book was in pristine condition, shipped very quickly, and I really think my husband will really enjoy it!  He doesn't know it's under the tree, so I'm looking forward to the look on his face!
0061537969|5.0|amazing story from a dog. I must read but warning it will bring tears to your eyes. If your looking for something moving look no further
B00000612P|5.0|Rod Stewart is great.  I loved him with the Faces and without the Faces.  On this album, I thoroughly enjoy his cover of &#34;(I know) I'm losing you&#34; with its hard driving drum solo.  After it came out, several musically-inclined friends often broke into impromtu drum solos whether they had drums or just table tops, none of which came close to the expertise on this album.  So, if you have friends who break into drum solos for no known reason (or reasons no one should discuss), then buy this CD, crank up the sound, and drown them out.  It's a great album all around, one of the greatest of all time.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I needed some much needed comic relief and this movie far exceeded my expectation.  Laugh out loud moments infused with a showcase of musical talent and a touch of romance.  The great mood and songs will resonate long after the movie has ended.
B000I186FW|5.0|i really liked the movie.  the theme of a totalitarian government and the man who fights to destroy it is awesome.  natalie portman is beautiful and V is cool
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I really liked being in a dog's perspective. Definitely different and well written. I thought some parts were kids of predictable, but the entire story is really catching.
B009ZE27US|3.0|I really was not that impressed with the App. It tells you up front that it<br />really doesn't tell your age. It's all a joke, but it might be a<br />perfect gag for others.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Buy it!! The best show in the last 5 years IMHO. Gripping drama. Leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for final season
B0043URV5U|5.0|Bob Seger does it better than most.  My favorite song is &#34;Katmandu&#34; and was happy to find it on this album.  While I wish I could afford to buy every album I love, this compilation gives me some of the best of Seger's music.  The sound is fantastic.  &#34;Old Time Rock and Roll,&#34; &#34;Night Moves,&#34;  &#34;We've Got Tonight,&#34;  &#34;Like a Rock,&#34; and  &#34;Against the Wind&#34; are just a few of the great songs included.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has a way with writing characters that are sick, twisted, demented and wickedly EVIL. This book is full of them. I loved it!
B0007TKNII|5.0|my fave - when the dish on the roof filled with snow - i still had my dvd and played this over and over - could watch and listen all day.  beautiful music, romantic - i wore out my first cd for the car, had to buy another.  i watch and listen to the dvd in the house when i am cleaning
B0054JZC6E|4.0|At first there are around seven games. when you play games it unlocks harder games. I hate games that are too easy. this game is hard but fun!
B0055S348W|2.0|Didn't work with my brother or epson printers. All that happened is the paper would feed  but no actual printing occurred. Even if it was only one page it would feed 20 pages. I eventually had to turn off the printer to stop it. They don't respond to emails either.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed the depth of the characters and the story. It was not your typical love story in any sense, and that's always refreshing. It's also gritty and raw, but it is written so well that you aren't turned off by it. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This movie had a slow start at first, but it picked up at the end.<br />Good plot, good graphics. Loved it.
B000A6T1KE|5.0|Great movie and I'm not really a big Star Trek fan. This movie holds up in its own. There are a lot of interesting extras, best one is the screen test with a young Tom Hardy playing Shinzon. I went with this DVD instead of a box set because this is the best movie from the bunch.
0547564651|5.0|This book is great. I had to have it aftetr seeing the author on Tavis' show. It arrived just in time.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|For our family movie fanatic.  He asked for this movie so t must be good.  I'm sure ill end up watching it sooner or later.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was so good I didn't want to put it down! Suzanne Collins created one cool heroine in Katniss!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|My wife, two little boys and I watched this movie. It is a great family movie. I would highly recommend it. Being 33 years old, I still enjoyed it as did my wife and boys.
0920668372|5.0|Book was in great shape. Arrived in record time. Not much else to say otherwise that it came exactly as presented.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|If you don't want to wait for Valve to make a Steam box, this piece of silicon can do the trick right now. I bought a bunch of games during the Big Picture steam sale, and the A10-5800K can handle all of them in 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second. It can even handle big 3D games like Just Cause 2, Serious Sam 3 and Saints Row 3 if you tweak the graphics towards medium and low. All this runs on just 300 watts of power. Not too shabby. It can also play Minecraft on fancy graphics with far render distance. Just make sure you get an A85 chipset motherboard and at least 1866mHz RAM to squeeze the most performance out of it.<br /><br />Whether you want a netflix/hulu/crackle machine, or a gaming computer, this APU does it all, no discrete GPU required. Really impressive piece of technology, I hope AMD keeps raising the bar like this.
B006GRBK4G|5.0|great movie, great follow up to the first one.i've watched it three times already and can't wait for the next one
B004UHF51S|5.0|After hearing &#34;I'd Rather Be Happy Than Right&#34; on the radio, I decided to order the cd. When it arrived, I found that the other songs were just as good! Surprise. There's poetry in every song, which I enjoy.  You could just read the lyrics and be satisfied, so putting them to music is a bonus.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love this show.  It's smart and witty, sexy without being raunchy.  Glad I stumbled upon it.  One of my faves!
B008JAGZDE|4.0|This was a funny movie, it is was the typical vulgar comedy that all the others have been, so if you're offended easily don't watch it, but if you've appreciated the others, you will like this one too.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I love how this book describes Tim's protocol for breaking down and learning ANYthing. Lots of tangential information that can be informative and interesting or (if you find it too distracting) skipped and revisited. Successfully lowered the barrier to entry in the challenging world of cooking.  Not just slapping a few recipes together and looking at some pretty pictures. This is a practical path to learning impressive skills in the kitchen. By this book.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie made no sense, the plot if you could find it should have been hidden even deeper. I know it was just a movie but who get up and runs around after major surgery, REALLY!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|always good to have this app on the tablet for weather up dates. have the same on my phone. use it all the time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game.  I use this to get my mind soothed, I love this game. I. also use this to get my brain to shut off.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|title says it all. Some funny scenes, and some good songs at times, think Glee with different actors in it
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I thought it was well done. The action scenes were good and the story line kept my interest. Hope they do a sequel.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great funny book for kids...Best one by Jeff Kinney by far<br />Was the first book on my kindle fire hd
B009EAALEW|3.0|This DVD only goes for 55 minutes which is disappointing when you see the song list in the bonus material.  Sound quality is good and performance is great which is not unexpected if you have ever seen Chris Isaak live.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|i don't like the fact that i had to buy this in order to use the camera already in the tablet.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great for writers! Really easy to use,  and auto saves very often so I never lose work. You also don't even need wick! Get it!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|This variation and well made. However the clue  are frequently off the visible screen. This is an oversize that should be corrected.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing the FlipPix games.  I have played 6 different versions of the game and have enjoyed them all.  Very fun.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Seth Farland did it again. I loved this movie, it was so funny and also so touching. It is not a kids movie, this is a<br />adult movie, I saw the unrated one. I will purchase this in the future. thanks
B001706I5I|5.0|It's a great remake of the classic &#34;Grinch&#34;...great for all ages! My whole family loves it & we watch both every year!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is great! I mean literally right when I got it I played it for the rest of the night. I am so happy that it is free! P.S. for those of you who want a hint, to get the rainbow dragon breed paper dragon with lightning dragon. P.P.S. I do not know if this will work for sure.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Play it all the time. My family also enjoy playing coin dozed. I would recommend this game to be added to your kindle.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2GB5SRWYBL92J]]The 2012 Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar was not as exciting as it was last year.  I like the original trilogy and am not so much a fan of the prequels, which seems to be the theme in this set.  Whereas last year, we got Yoda Santa, Millennium Falcon, and black R2, this year we get Darth Maul Santa, Snowman R2, and Jar Jar.<br /><br />My favorite is the AT-AT.  I didn't care for Jar Jar in the movies, but he was cute as a Lego figure.  Darth Maul was my least favorite.  It's like having the Grinch as the finale.<br /><br />Last year, the children had crying fits over who got what.  This year, it was ho-hum.  They didn't care.  Ah well, it's Star Wars.  I got it because I'm a fan.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Excellent action pack  movie with some of the old actors of my younger years.Expendables 2is deffinately worth seeing if looking for an action pack movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Me and my sister play it on our kindle fires all day long! You HAVE TO get this game now!!!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of our more recent holiday favorites. It was my sons school's Christmas movie of choice before vacation. We had pajama day & it was very enjoyable!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this app is both fun and addicting. i recomend this app to anyone who likes stratagy games. i got this for kindle fire and it is really fun
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Best movie ever! It is so very entertaining and funny! You won't be disappointed, especially if you have a sense of humor
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|Lucky this is part of a trilogy - it sure couldn't stand on its own.<br /><br />One tempo for this movie - unless you count slowing down a slow movie even more as a tempo change. REALLY sad, as this was once a very cool franchise. Michael Keaton was the best Batman, giving a human edge to the character, with a little bit of craziness, to justify his becoming a crime hero.  Now, it's SFX, one grainy voice void of emotion, and plot-less chases. Don't bother paying for this one - it'll play on network over and over, as all bad &#34;action movies&#34; eventually do.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I have watched this show for now,eight years.I love it!Will be VERY disappointed when someday it comes to and end(like 24).It is not a show for everyone because there is a lot of violence and ugly things that take place,however it is riviting.I own all 7 years of their DVDs and enjoy watching the reruns.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|The movie was ok. You need to go into it not expecting a great film, but rather something somewhat funny with juvenile humor.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I laughed & laughed & laughed! I just saw this for the first time (2012)...I was definitely missing on a hilarious Christmas movie!
1451613512|4.0|Don't let the negative reviews discourage you from reading this book. This is a well researched,well written and highly informative account of 20th century American history. Popular and politically sanctioned history books are largely false narratives and patriotic propaganda. Historical truth,if such a thing is possible, is a relatively rare undertaking,which takes courage and honest scholarship, for which I commend the authors of this book. If you are at all curious and interested in knowing the truth or the hidden history of the US then you should read this book and decide which view[s] of American history has the most merit. Don't let the negative,politically motivated reviews discourage you from reading what I am sure you will find both fascinating and thought provoking. Go for it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book was good... not quite as graphic as the first book. Good story line and a great intense ending.
B00AHXDECG|4.0|The first 5 songs are the only ones I really listened too. But they are good. I will have to listen to the album more, too really get my groove on. LOL. Learning new songs takes a while to grow on me. But I give it a thumbs UP!!!!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app has been always good and never any mess ups. I have downloaded this app on every cell phone I get.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was good for a free read. My only issue was how the two characters kept getting together and then running from each other. Still worth reading though.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|My wife and I joined forces to complete this game. We couldn't put it down. Great one, keep them coming iCOOLgeeks!
B005LAIH4A|3.0|Enjoyed the story in this movie. I don't care much for the music, but it is funny. Kids love it
030758836X|3.0|This is a difficult book to rate.  The first half was ho hum.  The only thing that kept me reading was all the rave reviews.  It wasn't boring but there was nothing very exciting about it.  Then at about half way through the book took off!  There were twists and turns galore.  I had multiple scenarios going through my head trying to solve the mystery but none were correct.  Thankfully the resolution is a true resolution and it also didn't have that 'rabbit out of a hat' feel.  It made sense....in an insane way.  Unfortunately I missed the literary designation some other reviewers perceived in Flynn's writing.<br /><br />first half of book = 3 stars<br />second half = 4 stars<br /><br />This review is based on an e-book provided by the publisher.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I love this album. It's great! She has an older sounding voice like Anita Baker, Etta James and others. So if you like those type of singers than you will love this album too.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|Toy Story Trilogy on Blu-ray...need I say more? The movies are individual but a nice box to group them together. Great movie for people of all ages.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|From some reviews I had read, was far better than I expected.  Lots of smiles, plenty of chuckles, and a few &#34;wait, I have to pause this, I'm laughing so hard.&#34;
B008X6N1OA|1.0|Failed to Deliver this for my Kids befor Christmass...? Amazon.com Customer Service 1 Star but the Movie 5 Stars....? Shame I was Planning to Watch this on my Christmass Holiday with my Kids.....? But still it has not arrived befor the 24 December....? Please try to do a much better job for 2013 Christmass Seasons December....? Whats wrong with you GUYS ??? Really dont you know christmass is only ones a Year and you Failed to Deliver this on Time....?
B0042U94UQ|4.0|We all love the movie. It is a story about how love and compassion can change a persons life. Inspiring.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|IT'S A  LOL book high guns go guns free download and install the first place in my life and death penalty
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I ordered this for my mother, a HUGE ROD fan and she LOVED IT! I love it as well! Classic hits with GREAT guest artists on the CD as well! Highly recommend this to anyone who loves great Christmas music!
B005HED08I|5.0|Star Trek has always been my favorite show. It tells me what it will be like in the future. Thanks.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This is a challanging book to read.  It is very deep in the speech and thoughts of the time.  A lot of background getting to the basic story most of us know.  Having said this I am enjoying the challange and have not quite finished the book I look forward everyday to a little quite time reading.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|I tend to shy away from Wes Anderson movies because they're so stylized and screwy. And that's not to say that MOONRISE KINGDOM is NOT stylized and screwy. It is! But it is also charming and very, very sweet. The kids are amazing. Bill Murray, whom I do not like, is tolerable. Bruce Willis is almost unrecognizable, but he really has fun with his part. And the wonderful Frances McDormand does not disappoint. Play this one when you're feeling kind of grumpy and your spirits will lift immediately!
B00A7ZWUJC|2.0|This cd sounds rushed and unoriginal. The lyrics are other people's words written to somehow fit Rihanna's life. Most of it sounds emotionless.
1449433251|5.0|Came on time and postage free.  Was a good price and what we wanted  It is intended as a gift for someone.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I came across the music (MP3s) of this concert initially, then when discovered this was available on dvd as well, I purchased the cd/dvd combo pack, uncensored version.  Miss Adele gave wonderful performances, outstanding vocals, and engaged with the audience in her humble yet very forthright (and uncensored) way.  Every performance I have ever seen at Royal Albert Hall has been amazing.  I think there is a chemistry or karma the musicians feel about the honor of performing in the Hall, and that comes through in both their behaviour and their sound.  Miss Adele exemplifies this.  Absolutely love this cd/dvd, recommend highly!<br /><br />Please note this cd/dvd IS available in a censored version for those who do not wish to hear certain words or language used.  Adele tried to humble herself, but in the end she did spout a few less than desireable 4-letter words.  Personally, I love that about Adele, she's sweet, humble, grateful to her audience and to the opportunity of playing in such a &#34;royal&#34; venue... however, she is also true to herself, and her genuine natural self.<br /><br />(Have just discovered the recordings - mp3s - of Pink Floyd in The Royal Albert Hall.... also quite fabulous!)
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|My little guy was begging for this game. We tried it out and once we were clear on the rules, we began. The game doesn't move along very quickly, and everyone had had enough after about an hour. More pieces, particularly curved ones, would help with the pace immensely, since most of the time was spent digging around for parts. It got a bit boring, you waited for 5 minutes for the person to find pieces before you could even begin guessing. We will have to supplement the provided parts with odd pieces left from other lego projects to see if that helps a bit. Maybe the challenge is trying to build something round without curved parts, but even when staggering pieces, there just aren't enough in the box anyway to make any sort of guessable shape. So it drags on.<br /><br />Some shapes on the cards need to be a certain color (some don't matter) and we ended up announcing when we started our turn whether or not the colors used were accurate because we almost always never had enough correct shapes in the colors needed and had to mix n match.  (a blue and yellow tree?)<br /><br />So if you can, supplement this set with more pieces of your own and that should speed it up a lot. If you are looking for a fast paced game like Pictionary or charades, this is not the one.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good read. Characters were likable and easy to identify with. Somewhat surprise ending. Enjoyed this book a lot and definitely will read others by this author
B0076DELIG|3.0|Connelly's Black box is not as suspenseful as previous books.  Needs more action and a little sex would contribute to it's appeal.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Good game.  Very addictive. I'm not pleased ag all about the need to purchase coins.  They are way too expensive.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|He definitely has a DMB vibe but newer and I love it! Great first album, I'm looking forward to many more!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Merry Christmas, Baby by Rod Stewart<br /><br />Best Christmas music of the year! Would highly recommend to any Rod Stewart<br />fan or lover of Christmas music.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This was a lighthearted, entertaining movie. It moved along a little slowly, but sufficed for an evening without too much serious action. Even the romantic moments were not explicit! Yeah!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book is great! No negatives from me.<br />However, as kindle progresses, the percentage of the book did not match the end of the book. At 73% read, my book was over! I was taken aback that the story was not continuing and I was looking at the &#34;fluff&#34; of the book, the credits, the footnotes. That is not what I consider the story. Kindle needs to format the percent for the content not all the pages. Or, at least give a heads up with numerical notation that the content is a certain percentage through and the end of the book's formalities are a certain amount.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|I love Jo Nesbo, the trilogy was great, however these books seem to be getting so carried away they're like wanting to be made into a movie.  He needs to continue being who he is as an author and not try to be Stieg Larsson.  I like Nesbo better.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Excellent time sink and very well produced in regards to the Star Wars property. Lots of fun, and if you enjoy the angry birds style of game, this is a must buy.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This show is so real and makes you feel that it's actually happening in our society -- you often forget that it's all not real! I am recommending this show to anyone who would appreciate all that goes on &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; of the public and private political and military world. Many issues arise within family members and even co-workers and it all runs together when your professional life IS your world. This isn't a cookie-cutter show either -- not for the faint of heart and definitely not good for young eyes. Multiple scenes that aren't appropriate for teenagers even (in my opinion... that's for you to judge) but man... this show is amazing and it's only getting better!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Based on the review of others, I was expecting a great show. This was extremely long and dragged out and just had no real point to it. Great disappointment. The Batman Begins of the trilogy with Christian Bale was the best of the three. So disappointed. Glad I didn't waste my money and get the trilogy Blu ray combo pack.
B009JBZH54|5.0|NO words! amazing!!!!!!!!!! Sin palabras es Asombrosa! La trilogia de batman es demasiado buena, y es mi superheroe favorito, Nolan You Make a Great Work!!!!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I enjoyed the movie mostly because Matt Damon was not it in. If these Bourne series continue on they need to be like the James Bond series and change actors.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|The movie came quickly and in excellent condition. I had seen this movie some years ago and looked on line to see if I could find it. I like stories of King Author and I also like musicals. It was as good as I remembered it to be.
1419701533|5.0|Super collection at a great price, was very happy, this made a great gift, very nice, would definitely order again
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Mad Men...where do you start? This show makes you want to smoke ciggs, drink scotch on the daily (even in the morning) and wear tailored clothing. You never knew of the world that was behind the advertising agencies on Madison Avenue. This show has so many twists and turns, sparks of humor, and heart-wrenching love scenes that when the episode ends, you jump saying &#34;aw come on!&#34; The writing is superb and unmatched to any other show that identifies with that time in history.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it.  It makes it easy to access my Facebook Account from my tablet.  Sometimes it's slow but it is teaching me to learn patience!<br />Namaste!
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|It's sad what the series has come to. It seems as though the movie was based around how many cheesy characters and special effects they could squeeze into the allotted time frame. The fact of the matter was that at the center of this train wreck there was a decent idea and extension of the previous films. I guess they figured it was more important to appeal to the teeny bopper crowd. This too is coming from a fan of the series. I could say more but this film has already wasted enough of my time. If you're smart you will avoid this movie. Unless you're a 10-15 year old boy then you might like this.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas. Blu-Rays are the best quality and the movies are great. Nothing wrong with this product.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Not sure why the critics did not like this movie so much when it was released, but it is far superior to a most of the modern toxic sweet Christmas movies out there! Very excellent humor, with still a touch of the classic kindness for the season. Of course I am not interested in what most critics think anyway, I rate movies on whether or not they entertain me and this is a tradition at our house every year!!
B000T433CO|5.0|I added this movie to the list of my must see movies every Christmas.  It's funny, romantic and sweet and puts me in a great mood.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great Modernization of a classic series with a strong supporting cast. Can't wait for Into Darkness the next leg of the journey
B00457WZEI|5.0|Love that it was the horse telling the story.  Easy read but very enjoyable highly recommend it.  Loved the ending
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love this show and season 10 is just more wonderful episodes filled wil action, humor and Gibbs' family fun! Will continue to purchase episodes through Amazon!!
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I would recommend this book to all to read. I have learned a lot from it  . As a American and being of Kiowa ,Apache and Delaware blood this book has meant very much to me. The people have suffered and deserve to always have there story's heard by all. Fiery Horse .......
B008US4PBY|5.0|I needed to use my PS3 dualshock controller for my PC and my 360.  I connected my controller via USB once, and it was paired and working wirelessly immediately!  Very easy to use and hassle free.  The instructions are vague but it is very straightforward to use.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|haven't had a chance to play it yet so can't a good judge of the game. It probably is like many of the majong games with matching tiles.

B004RZGUBM|5.0|Dickens is quite simply the most masterful story teller of his age.  I am re-reading Dickens in his 200th birthday and am marvelling anew at his gifts as a novelist.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|The movie is great. I found it listed under New Releases, so I assumed it WAS the newest release(Dark Knight Rises). I've already seen this multiple times(have it on DVD), and wasted my money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a good read from beginning to end. Suzanne Collins is a good writer and I would recommend this book to people who are fans of sci-fi.
1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has helped countless people.<br />His work helps teach how to understand and calm the mind.<br /><br />I've read dozens of books on meditation and private forms of spirtituality.<br />The Power of Now was the first to give me detailed descriptions of consciousness, and the means of understanding the madness of the world around me. Any who seek self awareness and inner peace, this is the place to start. Any who want doctrine or to blame others for inner pain, this is not for you
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I recommend this book, because is a great almanac for my generation 80´s. Ernest is a good writer. .  .
B001FQIWSK|5.0|The plot is great, the scenery is amazing, and the little girl makes the movie. I recommend this movie to all of my friends and family. It is definitely worth the buy.
159514188X|5.0|My sister loves this book. She said it was very interesting. It came on time. Would definitely buy it again for someone as a gift.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros: all you have read about these headset are correct. very good sound, good build, nothing to complain about.<br /><br />cons: a bit more driver support would be good, G keys are not as customisable as you may think... you have to get plugins for anything other then the very basic stock application. its hard to find plugins for the things I want.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I thought Afterlife was bad enough, but at least the special effects were kind of cool to look at. The same cannot be said about this film. It is awful. I didn't like one thing about; bad acting, ridiculous plot, downgraded special effects and horrible pacing. I found myself confused about what was happening when and why did Paul WS need to show us that? Pointless trash, it gives the real RE experience of the games a bad name.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|First found out about this app from an IT tools review article.<br /><br />I'm still learning how to use it, but like the ability to store things and retrieve them later.<br />Not being tethered to a single device, or app is good too.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|All I know is I paid for an HD movie to be streamed and all I  got was one star quality.  What's the point of paying for streaming if the quality is terrible.  Amazon better get it together, Red Box is only a few short minutes away and when you buy HD you get HD.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I found this movie rather predicatable, but there are great comedic scenes throughout.  Some of the lines are rather corney, but if you like the genre there are great laughs to be had.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  This is a very additive show , I can't stop watching look forward to season 2
B0060QM09M|5.0|I fell in love with Jame herriot's writings 30 years ago and i could still read any of his books cover to cover
B000QGEB12|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle combines some of the best aspects of action and comedy with great results. The action scenes are very well done, but the hilarious plot makes it impossible not to laugh.
0985081821|5.0|I have only seen one review of this book but I am a voracious reader and kept hearing buzz about this book. Little tiny hints at the book's plot and subject nature intrigued me to no end. So, I wanted to see why people are reading this book and why it is becoming a phenomena. To paraphrase Hunter S, Thompson, I bought the ticket and took the ride. It was well worth it.<br /><br />I read the book in about two or three days, taking careful notes, that ended up amounting to some thirty-pages of notes and other addenda to help me surf the waves of this book. \\"The Forever Girl\\" is a tour de force of the divine feminine in action. This book helped me see how women sense the world through a lens filled with incense, delicious food, and soft touches. The tight-rope an author must walk in creating that type of an atmosphere--an atmosphere that is very realistic and yet still fantastic--- is a difficult one, but Rebecca Hamilton has done it in the \\"Forever Girl.\\" Add on to that impeccable prose, interesting names, places, races, and characters, you will find that this book is a feast! And like all good books, if you thirst for more, a second, third and multiple readings are well-worth it. On a second read you might discover (as I did) perhaps incredible synchronicity and happy accidents like I did. Major plot points are made on pages 66 and 111. See this book one every level you can, dive in, see what you come back with, but do not expect to get everything in one go. Though many authors in this genre use magic in an overt way, Hamilton has a way to penetrate to the subconscious and subtle levels, and thus achieves a sort of alchemical relationship between the reader, and the book.<br /><br />The one review I read on this book noted something about \\"critics\\" saying there is \\"lack of depth\\" in the characters. I find this very intriguing, For it seems that if there is any \\"lack of depth\\" resides with the critics and not with the characters or plot of this book. How anyone can read this book and not come away with an enchanted feeling, is beyond me. And so, I will not spend any other words for so-called critics.<br /><br />Another important point: The book was not predictable at all and has many plot twists and turns that were very surprising and thus not boring! Like I wrote above, I read this within the span of three nights. I could not get enough. It also has something in it for everyone; a sort of mass appeal. For example, there is mystery, suspense, romance, there is history, there is Religion, there is Spirituality, even a theology and most definitely a psychology that is so subtle and yet so deep.<br /><br />Beyond all of that, there is a genuine spooky feeling one has when reading this book, especially all alone, in the middle of the night, in silent darkness. I know it made me peek outside my window a few extra times while reading it and even had a dream about it all. Simply put, this is an excellent read for anyone. The responsibility for lack of depth lays with the reader. If you are intelligent enough to see the deeper symbolic picture Hamilton is painting with \\"Forever Girl,\\" then you will see this as an incredible insight into the depth psychology of women, and to the ultimate interesting question this book posed for me, which is \\"Why are women attracted to the supernatural sexy?\\" One could say the answer lies in The Book of Genesis and I would say that the question is posed, but never answered. It is up to the reader to figure for his or her own self why the \\"paranormal romance\\" section of your local bookstore might be the most popular genre today. And this book left me still with that lingering existential question, and giving fleeting hints as to the reasons behind all of it.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton's \\"Forever Girl\\" goes beyond the genre in my opinion.Her world seems more realistic to me than\\"True Blood\\" or the \\"Twilight Saga\\" and without that sort of pomposity and pretentiousness one is used to. \\"The Forever Girl\\" hasa \\"down to earth\\" feeling to it, while paradoxically being very other-worldly, a huge achievement not many writers achieve.  Again, although I am a philosopher and read this book on many levels, I do not have much to compare it to because it really belongs in it's own category. And therein lies the true achievement of Rebecca Hamilton's \\"Forever Girl,\\" This is a book as big or as small as you want it to be. What you bring to  the book will determine what you see in the book. Like all good works of Art, it is a reflection, a mirror. I invite readers of all shapes and sizes to read the book and to come to their own conclusions, but for me, reading \\"The Forever Girl\\" was a breath of fresh air, a diamond in the rough.
030758836X|1.0|I was drawn to this book by the amount of positive reviews it received, and read the first two-thirds of the book in two days as it was very compelling.  However, the ending is beyond creepy, but very sick and absurd (and extremely disappointing), that I can't rate this book anything but 1 star (and I would rate it less than if I could).  It's a little disgusting that people can actually think up of stuff like that ending, and I'm angry with myself that I actually paid for this book.  Hopefully this review will spare someone else his/her time and money.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|The title for this review says it all - Boring and predictable. Boring and predictable. Boring and predictable. Boring and predictable.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My 6 year old loves to play angry birds on my kindle!! Great game, just too many ads and I get scared he is going to click on one of them. but over all a good game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|love the game! definitely entertaining and worth the price. liked the dramatic scenes that added excitement. hide and seeks are a little tricky
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This one took me a while to read, but it was definitely worth it. Very dense but very well done.
B000002KE2|4.0|I remember when Sabbath released their first album. It was competing with Grand Funk Railroad for my friends attention. To me it was no contest and I embraced Black Sabbath into my life's soundtrack. By the time 4 came out, they began polishing their sound. I guess we all get attached to the initial sound that impacts us, whether it was Steppenwolf, Hendrix, the Doors or the Stones. While I enjoy and would recommend 4, make sure that you get the first three Sabbath albums and listen to them in succession to appreciate their impact and progression of the band.
B004FEJ3VY|4.0|My 4 year old son liked this toy....I just thought it was going to be a little larger than it was.
B0088XXCZ6|3.0|Like all of her work, I simply need more time with it. I've listened to the whole thing once and I liked it. I'm sure I'll come to enjoy it more after multiple listens
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|I thought the Bourne Legacy was a good movie and better than I expected it would be, since I had heard it wasn't as good as the first three movies.  Thankfully it was better than expected.<br /><br />But since I rented it through Amazon and this movie in HD was conspicuously devoid of surround sound, as an HD movie should be, Amazon gets a MAJOR FAIL for the delivery of this movie, especially at $5.99 and in this day an age - there's absolutely no excuse why an HD movie should be delivered in stereo only.<br /><br />I honestly don't think I will ever rent another movie from Amazon again and will stick with VUDU.  Shame on you Amazon!!!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Lots of action, but I believe Pierce Brosnan is a better Bond character. Daniel Craig just doesn't have the suave personality to fit the character. This was written with Sean Connery in mind and would have been good during his Bond years. Timothy Dalton would be next choice after Pierce Brosnan. I agree with Desmond Lewellen that Dalton was closer to Ian Fleming's portrayal of Bond as a spym so it's a toss-up between Brosnan and Dalton. Time to put Craig out to pasture and bring Brosnan or Dalton back.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Loved it. Exciting ; well written; well casted, full of suspence; sometimes too real, excellent acting.<br /><br />IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE ENJOYED ANYTHING SO VERY MUCH.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I love this game.  Spend way too much time playing it.  It is easy to see and large enough for senior eyes to see.
B004G606K8|5.0|Being a fan of the remarkable works of resemblance, have decided to write this review to make first mention of the fantasy element that draws me into it. If fantasy isn't your cup of tea then you may want to bypass, but should you find yourself in need of a compelling story with a remarkable assortment of unusual literary elements and this whole series shows that the default form of written word is not set in stone. I would recommend that anyone willing to go on a literary adventure partake in the wondrous world of Dragon Lance.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This is by far the best batman movie by far.  Realistic characters facing real struggles both internally, and externally.  Great introduction to the next Robin as well.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this bok is really nad and horrible like someone with a grilled cheese sandwhich go go go go flute gigrilled chicken fot to pee
B000P0I4O4|4.0|I won't give away the plot but it has some interesting twists and turns. If you're a Morgan Freeman fan this is not one of his better films.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett has long been one of my favorite authors, and he only keeps getting better. This study of the effects of World War II on the various members of four extended families is compelling and insightfull. It brings home the horific insanity of warfare and the politics that drive it. Amazing!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use it a lot. and believe me it helps... l don't sleep very well at night, and its better then watching Tv.
B00A23MYCC|2.0|The plot is a common one.  Boy has toy, toy gets him into trouble, boy saves bear.  The movie is'nt even funny.  I'm sorry I purchased the movie.  Not something I would watch again.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|After reading this book I find that I know very little than I knew before. A five year old has a book out describing his &#34;death&#34; experience and I learned more from that book than this one. A waste of money!

B004UID2LC|2.0|When when I initially downloaded this particular application, I figured it was going to take me to YouTube and let me choose subject matter I wanted to find and download. But rather it has taken me to downloads that I have no interest in. I am thinking about deleting it from my collection.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is about as talented a writer as I have ever read. He never fails to keep me on the edge of my seat and turning the pages. This novel is as good as it gets.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|wow.  this was most definitely aracketeering like rip off by john.  an epic waste of time and money.  he even tries a preemptive pualification in his post, by bragging about his lack of research.  pathetic effort.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I never got the chance to experience Zeppelin live, so it was important for me to select a DVD that showcased their maturity as a group. This collection achieves that. That fact that Jimmy Paige produced it and not some record company trying to milk yet another Zeppelin product from the archives is what helped make my decision. It comes with 2 booklets of facts of how they put this together, all of which I found fascinating. They are at times not at their best. But they don't have to be to blow you away. The music from their later albums really surprised me. If you are looking for the clean polished sound from the albums, you will not find it. In its place is raw energy and excitement. I caught myself holding my breath many times. John Bonham is an animal on the drums and is so fast, the 16mm camera used to capture him can barely keep up with him.
0345529057|5.0|I'm a newcomer to this series - I'm reading through books 1-5 all at once. I'm about a month and a half in, and just finished book 3. The first thing I'm going to say is you might want to take notes! Martin's style uses multiple narrators - every chapter is told from a different character's point of view, and you can have a series of chapters each of which has no interaction with the others, and while all the plots obviously work into one, if you're not keeping track of every one of them in the back of your mind you're likely to get whiplash when the story suddenly moves from one side of a continent to the other. Additionally, this series has an absurd number of characters. There are as many narrators as most authors have characters, and there are easily a thousand named characters.<br /><br />The other thing is this: Martin has no problem whatsoever with killing off characters. It seems he wants to keep the reader on their toes, so he'll just kill some people off every once in a while. Get used to it.<br /><br />I'm reading the kindle edition, and while there are a few noticeable typos, the book is readable. Navigation is somewhat difficult in this edition though, since there's a main table of contents and then each of the four books has a separate one.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|THIS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER.  I READ THE BOOK AND SAW THE MOVIE, WHICH WAS QUITE DIFFERENT BUT GOOD ANYWAY,  I AM SURE SHE WILL ENJOY THIS

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Started slow but ended unexpectedly. Was a really good book that I would read again. So many unexpected things happened!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was amazing, we watched it twice during our 48 hour rental! Really funny, great cast and well written script.
B005QUQP76|1.0|Got it, using it for not even a month goes dead one day when I come home from work.  Starts to not respond. then next morning after I try to update drivers and reinstall it goes dead. worked great till then.  worthless not even 30 days of use and dies. I read reviews not the only person to have this problem.  Bad product Corsair BAD
B005OCFGTO|3.0|You get what you pay for this collection. The boxset itself was really cheap, but the box it comes in feels so flimsy. It nearly fell apart the moment I opened it and the case sounds like something is rattling around in the plastic. Doesn't really matter to me, personally, but something to mention. The quality of the movies themselves is great.
B004NSUXHU|5.0|unfortunately i had to return this item because is  was region 2 and would not play on american dvd players.<br />however, contact with the seller was prompt and courteous.  i would definately use them aGAIN

B003V4AK8E|3.0|Hi,  I've used the Pro Elite PS 3 Controller for some time now.  It is true the unit has some slight lag (dead zone)on the toggles.  For most fast shooting games it acts more like the flutter of a real weapon as you squeeze the trigger, acting like adreneline. (which actually adds realism).  The trigger should be moved to the R-2 position the grenades to R-1 and L-1.  The aim and shoot scope or sights should be on L-2.  The grips are comfortable to me, provide less slippage, and don't sweat up as fast as the smooth PS 3 controllers, however; for those who have never used their hands for any real work but still mind slippery grips, the company may want to consider soft rubber slip on grips with less knerling.  Some soft rubber on the left 4-way directional and the right quadrupal button set will make it much easier to play for longer missions while spending less lime walking your thumb or finger around the controller searching for the buttons. It is probably the closest product out there to the XBox 360 controller.  I am actually surprised that a PS 3 twin to the XBox 360 controller does not exist yet.  regards:  Golf-owl
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great show, if you like to watch Keira Knightly period movies you will love this series, can't wait for the next season
B009JBZH54|5.0|Fantastic trilogy. Only thing, be aware that both Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises were shot with both IMAX and 35mm cameras, therefore there is going to be scenes such as the amazing intro scene in Dark Knight that is boasting amazing full screen HD, then there will be the scenes with horizontal bars above and below the screen. Can be distracting, but on the other hand, comics have different sized scenes so it can add to the comic illusion! Fantastic trilogy nonetheless!!!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|THIS IS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO IS A GREAT FAN OF JOHNNY DEPP.  SHE HAS NOT SEEN IT YET BECAUSE IT IS A CHRISTMAS FIDT, BUT I AM SURE SHE WILL ENJOY IT.
B008NQYWC0|5.0|Wow, 5+ stars for sure! What an exquisite time I had throughout this story. I love the way King gently pulled me into the past and made the world he described not only real and believable, but filled with characters I both adored and hated. The interweaving of this tale through other stories in the SK universe was cool as well. Plus, the haunting presence of the obdurate past hanging over every page provided a level of tension I couldn't shake till the last page. I thought the ending was perfect, and even though I was left with a sense of foreboding and loss, I still honestly feel that the ending was true to the story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. Like the movie, it evoked many memories of awkward teenage years not knowing where you fit in. I want to be friends with these people. I WAS friends with these people. Lovely.
B006O3MU96|5.0|this game is probably one of the best games I ever played....and that's saying something. I would recommend this to anyone.

B009J2VR3Y|5.0|This album has every popular amazing song Whitney Houston ever put out.  I have been a fan of her my whole life and have every album she has ever made but I purchased this anyway to add to my collection.  Whether you are a hard core fan, or just someone looking for an album to capture the best of Whitney Houston, this album will bring you back in time and get you singing at the top of your lungs. Rest in peace Whitney, you will live on forever through your music.

B004SOR4H6|4.0|I wasnt impressed before, now it is very good. I still wish the app is a bit smaller though, it takes up a lot of space.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The face book app sucks. You can not skip ads. Always brings up friend suggestions even though I have no clue who it is and could give a crap less. I won't let you remove it. Also the app does mot respect you options on the real facebook page Tired iof seeing updates from people I have put as only important messages. Works fine on a web browser but not on this app. I could care less what games people play but on the mobile app you are forced to see it regardless of what you have setup on your main settings
B002UZXJA6|5.0|This is one of my favorite  Celtic Woman CD;s. It is soothing to listen to and very relaxing. Makes all the cares of the day go away when you listen to it.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Christina is one of my favorite singers without a doubt. This is a great album that brings me back to the Stripped album.  It has songs that are along the same lines as &#34;Fighter&#34;, songs that are spicy, love songs, and songs about life.  Stripped is without a doubt my favorite album of hers but this may be my second favorite now.  I love all of the songs on it and I would recommend it anyone looking for a Christina album with a little bit of everything.
0765348780|2.0|Set in a medieval land of fighting and magic, Gardens of the Moon describes... well I'm not quite sure.  Every sentence has a name, nickname, or oath that I have no idea what or who it is referencing since there's no real explanation.  Consequently, I have no investment in the characters or world the author is creating.  Somebody gets ripped in half by a demon, they play tarot cards, someone wants to kill this hated high mage Tayschrenn, Paran comes back to life after these Oponn magic fate twins stop him from dying, I am about to drop this book.  It was easier reading a medical article about cardiac ultrasound techniques and I'm not a doctor.<br /><br />You can say that this is the author's way of writing, but for an introductory book and beginning of the series, one really needs to explain why the characters and world are important.  If you invested enough time in it, all the references would be understandable, but I'm not that sadistic for a fantasy book; I'd rather read something enjoyable.  Good writing is not about making up words, it's about bringing the reader on a journey that doesn't start with a cliff when there are many other more gently sloping journeys to be had.<br /><br />tl;dr This ain't Game of Thrones.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have used many sharpeners and this one fills the bill for convenience when out in the wilderness and ya need to touch up a blade.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Wow... I believe this is the best James Bond movie yet.  This one has action that has you holding your breath. This draws you into the begining of the movie.  Daniel Craig played the older James Bond to at T. Judi D. is always great.
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|This movie was pretty good but it doesn't follow the comics and is quite rediculous at time. In the original story line, Wolverine was the only member of the X-Men that wasn't born with powers but actually gained these powers as a military experiment to build a super solder. And the bone claws are just rediculous. If you can get past these flubs, the movie is pretty good with a lot of action and a decent story line (though I kept being reminded that this was not the original story line). Though I like the X-Men franchise, I believe they could have done a much better job with this movie with just a little more effort. Most of the poeple on these movies don't actually care about the original stories, they just want the name recognition so they can get better jobs, to hell with the story.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun to play with helps when needed to keep the fun flowing.  fast ending with auto finish if you would like.
B009329ZF2|3.0|The plot wall all too predictable .  the assortment of characters reminded of a high school acting cast.  The only thing that made the movie somewhat bearable was the special effects but even with those i still i overpaid the rental fee.<br />Lord knows why anyone would put a pop singer in a movie without first giving her the minimum of acting lessons.  While some of the other cast members were at least at high school play level;  the singer rianna was at best at a que card reading  elementary school level..
0525478817|5.0|First read it when it first came out, now just finished it for the third time. This book gets all the better with each re-reading -- The emotions are conveyed so eloquently through the characters that you feels its power every single time. Splendid book, absolutely recommend to anyone, both old and young.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  It is a great story that should be viewed by everyone.  Highly recommended.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Brave has all the action and just enough drama to make it another blockbuster. The color was vibrant, the scenes amazing and the storyline VERY interesting. I watched it twice and enjoyed it both times.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|My brother use to read these comics and pass them on to me. Though it's been a quite a while, the movie actually seems to have followed the story of the comics (which is rare today). The only complaint I have is deformity was much more pronounced in the comics. If I remember correctly, that part of his face was the bone of his skeleton and his teeth (on that side) were always showing. With today's technology, you'd think they could have done the affect a better. The story line was good though a bit far fetched in areas. Over all, the movie was very entertaining. Just to try to over think the plot.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|A worthwhile animated Christmas movie.  The action, characters and story were more than enough to keep the kids engaged and there's plenty of humor to keep mom and dad paying attention too.  I could re-watch it just to catch all the funny bits I missed in the grandpa and reindeer scenes alone.  Funny funny stuff. The animation is well crafted and thought out. They kept it modern with nice touches of the past and not overwrought like some Christmas fare. Definitely good wholesome fun for the whole family, as the cliche goes.  I may consider picking this one up for our permanent movie collection.  I recommend it.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Another must read. I have read them all. This is still a great read. Please keep Harry going for awhile longer.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Difficult with lots of twist, fun. Great sound and HD gives it a realistic visual play. Br ready to never sleep again. May the force be with you. That was dumb to say.

B009O2XY12|4.0|Works great on my iphone not so on kindel fire, it gliches a lot. Although I love the game I play on phone more often even though its much smaller.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|As a kid, I use to read the X-Men comics all the time. I vaguely recall the story of Xavier and Magneto but I don't recall if the movie follows this story line. There are several scenes that I believe were in the comics but I'm not certain (the wrecked sub on the beach). Much of the movie did have the comic book feel and they did a very good job of telling the story. Very enteraining and action packed while being just a little over the top (like the comics). All the makings of a good story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Purchased at the recommendation of my niece and read the whole series within a week.  Totally saw the 1st movie right away too, be prepared to have facts changed... even the simplest of things.  Gotta love Hollywood.. :/
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie was amazing. I rented it and watched it by myself up in my room, oh my gosh. The bears, the Celtic symbols, her HAIR, the boys, her mum, her hair, the horse, the plot... Watch it. Just watch it. Please.

B009A9BF5G|5.0|I was at one of the concerts this year and was amazed by the music and performance, when I knew they would sell the video I asked for it. It's really worth it...
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  It is a great story that should be viewed by everyone.  Highly recommended.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|i want every body too see this movie funny as hell. mark whaberg is funny and milla khunuz is sexy funny
B007X4ECMI|4.0|I had heard such terrible things about this movie that i went into it expecting the worst. However, i actually liked it. I can understand the criticism, because it feels like you fall into a movie already in progress, leaving you to guess a lot about plot holes. But sometimes it's not a bad thing when a movie dispenses with the dull introductions and pushes us down the roller coaster. Overall, a nice bit of escapism, with some good one liners.
B00866JL96|5.0|This movie has happy and sad factors but It still is such an amazing movie, for sure would recommend it
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I loved watching the behind the scenes features on how they transformed the main actor! the story is fun, maybe a bit cheesy... i like cheese! more please.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved the book as I am going through chemotherapy and have always been afraid to think about death. This book made me look at death with much less fear. It was written well and easy to understand considering the complexity of the subject matter.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|Snooze fest from beginning to the moon walking end.  Sorry, a waste of a sci fi budget.  This should have been called \\"what would Mtv moon man do in space with an alien! \\"
B00APUYWYA|5.0|What a Fun Movie Night! Great Music, Great Cast, It was better than I Anticipated. A Must See : )
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works better then the Kindle App that came with my phone.  I have  Motorola Droid 4 that came with the Kindle App preloaded.  Even after regular updates I couldn't get it to see all of my books.  I deleted the preinstalled app and replaced it with this one and it works fine.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs!  It is some great music that should be heard by everyone.  Highly recommended.
B0053TMP24|5.0|All I can say is wow. This is the best book in the world. It is full of action, when you think one thing will happen something else will do the completely opposite of what you thought. I call it a \\"Mind bender.\\".
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a fantastic fairy tale. If you have seen the movie read the book. There is much more to the story and I recommend reading I to your kids
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is awesome. quite a ways into it now. if you like war games, youll love this game. i promise
B00263HWM8|2.0|So many times in this movie you just think &#34;really!&#34;  Stupid! Story line.  Action stunts.  Stupid!  Stupid! Stupid! and Stupid!
B00005JPFH|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  It is a great story that should be viewed by everyone.  Highly recommended.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Emma Stone and the entire cast of this movie are absolutely amazing.  It's pretty interesting how all of this comes together in the end to make quite the storyline.  A definite must-see!
B00009QNY5|1.0|Apparently not all DVDs work in the US.  This is the second time I have bought a movie that cannot be played except in Europe.  The seller won't exchange them or refund all the shipping and the price paid for the disks.  Now I have two movies I can't even watch.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Love the book. Interesting read and I can't wait to read the next book in the series. Maybe I will watch the movie now.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|It is what you would expect from a Bourne movie.  Renner is actually pretty good in it and i would recommend it.  The only thing you had to get straight was that this was happening in the same time period when Bourne was still in NY.  Not a pre-quel or sequel.
078322933X|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  It is a great story that should be viewed by everyone.  Highly recommended.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|First I must say that I am a fan of the works of Robert A. Heinlein. I loved the original movie Starship Troopers because it was true the elements of the original books. But when Starship Troopers 2 and 3 came out, I thought that they were terrible. But #4 was a pleasant surprise. The video game type animation method was used to tell the story and I found it to be acceptable. The story was simply a shoot-em-up-bang-bang that was fun to watch. I call movies of this type my escape from reality time and I really enjoyed it. Although I did think that they went a little overboard with all of Johnny's scars. You would think that with this universes modern technology that the story editors would have toned it down a bit. Overall, 4 out of 5 stars. A great waste of time!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, kept me on the edge if my seat! Can't wait to ' read the next book in the series·
B0015DROBO|5.0|More than what I had hoped for. Captivating being, mysterious plot, perfect ending.  On to the next in the series.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|its an amazing movie and its cheap and arrived on time and packaged good :) cant complain one bit, very satisfied.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies!  It is a great story that should be viewed by everyone.  Highly recommended.
0316069434|3.0|Connelly is one of the more reliably spellbinding mystery writers, and the first 3/4 or more of this novel of a 20-year-old cold case deliver in spades, with new twists coming regularly, well prepared for but not obviously telegraphed in advance. The ending is perhaps not so good as Harry Bosch moves away from LA into another setting where he really doesn't have enough traction to make things happen as he wishes, and a lot of what happens there is not so easily believable, with a denouement that is a little too neat. Still, a very good read and quite entertaining.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I hoped this would answer all of my questions about Thomas and Theresa. Instead it introduced a new set of characters and how they dealt with the Flare when it first happened. It didn't explain anything about the maze... basically, like I said before, it left me hanging with many unanswered questions.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|I've watched this movie at least twice a year since it came out. The holiday season is never complete until I've watched this movie at least twice. The acting is great and the script is hilarious. This movie is timeless!
B001TCNSOI|5.0|I had seen it before and wanted to see it again. My favorite streaming site, free,  1channel dot ch  was acting a little quirky and slow so I saw on IMDB that I could rent it from here. Worth the price and I almost never pay to watch movies anymore. It is a gripping drama, Angelina Jolie at her best and you will recognize Jeffrey Donovan from Burn Notice as the Police Captain, in a formidable performance.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Awesome show.  Continues to be the best show on TV!  Would highly recommend to fans of this show to purchase.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I always loved Matt Damon as Bourne so this movie was a lesser movie only for that reason. The storyline, characters, and set pieces were all very well done and the movie was no disappointment. It is hard to discuss much about the movie without giving spoilers so if you liked the original Bourne series you will like the Legacy.
B008RZF1UO|5.0|As always this Kamelot's album is perfect. Tommy has a great voice and the songs are great.<br />You won't miss Roy :P
B001CDWFPC|4.0|All of the features work as promised, and I will continue to use this version.  My suggestions for improvement:  a back button that goes back for four or five references would be nice so that I don't have to remember to bookmark my pages when I follow a link, red letters for Jesus' words would be useful for corporate reading, less-obtrusive note links would be nice to be less distracting when simply reading verses. Would love to see a pronunciation guide added like my old KJV has.  Since other digital bibles don't have all of these features, either, I put them in the category of my wish list for publishers to consider.
0553382179|5.0|I have had my own business cleaning and organizing homes, teaching organizing to clients and doing 'home staging' for about 6 years. About 3 years ago I came across this book.<br /><br />My own home was drowning. I was so tired after cleaning or organizing other people's homes, I couldn't handle my own, let alone fight with my teenager about her doing any chores. I was swiftly losing a battle of laundry washed but not put away, dishes stacking up, an office and a basement that were falling apart.<br /><br />I was teaching ideas similar to this, but definitely not as good. I started following this and following it slowly. I was stuck on shining my sink for a long time. And my sink is porcelain and really unshineable, but she goes over that in the book. I started putting on sneakers to handle the sink and to handle a hot spot. And I built on it from there. Everything was getting organized and I removed years of things accumulated I did not use or need.<br /><br />There was a complication at one point. I had surgery for cancer and recovered in my bedroom for about 4 weeks. Family took care of my daughter. I was on heavy medication. I recovered, the cancer was gone, but my bedroom was a wreck of clothes and dishes and papers. When I left that room, I closed the door, only to open it to put junk in, and shut the door again. I had a block in my mind about thinking about the recovery weeks. The surgery was painful and on my face, what was to be a tiny removal turned into a huge slice across my temple and down past my ear and behind. I am thankful to the surgeon, who's specialty is in cancer and plastic surgery, so very little of it shows. But the humbling experience and pain caused something terrible. I slept on either the sofa or in the guest room or even my daughter's room when she went to her dad's for the weekend. I didn't have a bedroom, when once I had a beautiful one. Lovely furniture, a built in bookcase across an entire wall, 2 closets, a marble, hand painted table from Italy, a gift from my mother and some nice artwork.<br /><br />Over a year went by like this. I finally decided I needed my bedroom back. I walked in and out several times and did nothing. I then picked up this book and re read it, cover to cover. It took about 3 weeks, but I broke the room down into zones. I took a lot of the information in the book and applied it to just one room. The fling boogie. The 15 minute routines. Over and over and over. But what emerged, was my bedroom from a place I literally could not walk in before.<br /><br />Just last week I vacuumed, an old down comforter had ripped and that was a feather mess over almost the entire floor. That was almost the last step. I cleaned the top of my wardrobe cabinet and my dresser. I put down a memory foam mattress topper I had received as a gift and a new comforter and pillows and shams I had ordered..6 months before.I hung clean clothes in my closet and put clothes in my drawers.I was then ready to call my cable provider, I bought a small flat panel TV and wanted to be able to watch tv in there. 10 years in the same house and tv only in the living room, I wanted to treat myself.  But would not have been able to have a technician in there before.<br /><br />The cable was installed and I put a couple of plug in air fresheners in, after having opened the windows to air it out. 3 nights ago, I slept in my bedroom. The best sleep in a year.  Before I posted this, I shined my sink, there were no dishes to wash, I am well beyond that and have other routines that have my coat hung, my work bag and gloves and hat put away. My holiday shopping was done in October. The wrapping was done in November.  Things people would need and use, no junk.  The tree and decorations up a week after thanksgiving. Now, tomorrow, I can just enjoy Christmas eve with my daughter and Christmas dinner with my mother...we're going out, I told her we would have more sanity if no one had to cook, and she agreed.e from Italy, a gift from my mother and some nice artwork.<br /><br />Over a year went by like this.

B0092MKFIY|5.0|I usually listen to an album for a week straight before it starts to get boring, but it's been a month and I'm still crazy about Night Visions. Every song is amazing and I can't wait for another album by them.
B0055MIT2O|5.0|Better than I expected. I used to have an older pair of Tevas but these blow those away!<br />Very comfy and stylish!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Good movie - not great. I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. In my opinion, it was not up to par with the previous Batman movies.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Sans Attendre is a gorgeous new recording by Celine Dion.  If you are expecting a powerhouse performance and some strong percussion, you are in for some surprises.  This is one of the tenderest albums I've heard in quite some time, and for Celine, a welcome change of pace.  There is one rocker, but not the full one-two punch usually provided.  It fits the mold of the mood of the album.  I love all her work, don't get me wrong, but this lovely surprise really stands out.  She has some great duets, especially one with French legend, Johnny Hallyday.  Lead single, Parler a Mon Pere, is excellent.  My personal favorite so far is Attendre, which should be the second single, unless they go with the Hallyday duet, L'Amour Peut Prendre Froid.  The ebb and flow of the album reminds me so much of the Petula Clark French albums recorded on Vogue in the 60s and 70s.  Not sure if that was the intention, but being a huge fan of both ladies, so nice to hear when styles blend like this, and I know Celine is a Petula fan.  Even with limited French understanding, this album is a joy to listen to from beginning to end.  No \\"duds\\".  Fans for sure will pick this one up, but if you haven't sampled any of Celine's French recordings, I would recommend this one highly for a start.  Enjoy!

B004YM6JI2|5.0|While season 5 will always be my favorite, I still enjoyed season 7.  It is well worth the purchase.  I highly recommend you complete your collection.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|This movie was Good, but it wasn't great! O f the three movie with Christian Bale this story was not the best. By far not the best.The acting was fine but it seems like they ran out of story and then started throwing things in there to fill time.Another bomb going off,gotta get it out of here movie. Come on, the writers can't think of anything better than that!
B00973902K|4.0|It's a catchy jingle and has a good bass beat to it. Can see why this became a hit and spawned youtube videos.
B007THA4FI|1.0|this book took 6 weeks to read  it was so boring.  meaningless and pointless.  i just hate leaving things undone so i had to finish.  not a lot of character development.  kept waiting for something to happen which did not until the very end.  please skip it and get 6 weeks of your life back
B0086700CM|5.0|My child loves this game.....He laughs when I try to play it and don't get very far.  I guess I need more practice.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|The cast of characters was well chosen.  I know that this movie has gotten a lot of &#34;haters&#34;, but if viewed with a &#34;new movie&#34; attitude, its quite good.  I actually managed to watch twice in my 24hr period.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Miracle on 34th Street<br /><br />I watch this version every Christmas. I think its the best of all the versions made.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love This Game To The Max Although It Freezes My Kindle...<br />It Was A Brilliant Idea Whomever Came Up With It...
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory has leveraged her extensive research into another excellent book.  Her ability to &#34;fill in the gaps&#34; with plausable events to give the limited details of women's roles in history a full bodied story is well deserving of all five stars.  I thoroughly enjoy reading her books on this period in history.  This one is no exception.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game I can just sit and play and relax. Makes for a nice evening when it is really cold outside.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The new Sweeper design is a very productive unit.and cost effective.  I purchased a battery replacement for the the old units.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted is certainly worth a watch.  Is this the funniest movie ever, no.  Is this the most creative comedy ever, pretty close to it.  This is without a doubt a funny movie built on basically a premise never done.  It's a talking teddy bear, and it's real.  The beautiful idea behind it is it's true.  If this happened today, in two or three months it would certainly fade to black.  It's no longer exciting and no longer getting ratings, so move on.  Move on to something else.  Genius in thinking on this one.  This is adult oriented and certainly not for kid's , as another viewer said this is not a KID's MOVIE so please read the ratings on this :-).
B00785P2QC|3.0|adddi ting this app is I recamend it I love this app. the game is slow but sometimes but usually works good.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A great sci-fi adventure.  New twists on a familiar theme, can truth be too dangerous to share and who should decide?
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Jack Reacher character is a dream for all mankind.  He understands danger, evil, greed and how to combat them with his size and intelligence. His desire for being left alone and drifting is a dream of many people.  The action in the book is always interesting and his ability to always win out over evil is a wonderful thought.  The insight into the &#34;bad&#34; characters are always thought provoking.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The movie had all the ingredients for a great movie. It had a great villian in Bane. Batman had to reach down deep in his soul to overcome defeat. The storyline had nice twists and turns near the end, and the addition of Robin was nicely done. The cast was first rate with Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Christian Bale. The storyline, the special effects, the new gadgets, and top notch acting from all contributed to a great entertaining movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun I play it almost everyday with my brother sometimes. you can get mad but still want to play and never stop. for me its hard to get some of the goals like get 2coins but some can be really easy like I said its an really awesome app and it works well for kindle fire I like and I hope you like too and make a review like I did. I hope you like it or even love it and get a lot of goals finished
B004H0M8EA|3.0|This is interesting and very well documented, but very dry reading.  I felt that much of the book was discussions of societies that are very small and isolated. This makes them easy to study, but I have to wonder if they really give good insight into the workings of a society as a whole. Also, I have to wonder if the historical knowledge of these societies is really deep enough to support what Dr. Diamond is pulling from them.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it is super fun!!!!! it is very addicting once you start playing!!!!!! if your wondering if you should get I think you definately should!!!!!!

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Arrived promptly! Watching Mad Men is therapeutic. I recommend it for anyone with at least one good eye, who loves seeing historic American culture, and fans of Jon Hamm.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I am extreme introvert.I am not shy. I just love being alone. I am not necessarily uncomfortable being around other people, in fact I love being with one or two good friends. Sometimes. I even do quite well with public speaking, presentations at work (even to the owner and CEO of the company), managing other people, and things like that.  However, as Ms. Cain points out in this great book, it takes a toll on me. I have to have my alone time to recharge.<br /><br />This book makes a strong case that our society places all the emphasis on being extroverted and constantly being social, and that being an introvert is normal and is just as valuable.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I was hoping that there would be other great songs not played on the radio and I was not disappointed. I actually like almost all of the songs on this album, which has been rare for me lately.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is so funny, I enjoyed every bit of it from beginning to end and the song they sung were PITCH PERFECT!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved the previous books I've read by Colleen Hoover and was anxiously awaiting her newest endeavour. I was not disappointed. While I still believe that Slammed and Point of Retreat are my favorites this book was still fantastic in it's own way and I would recommend you read it. I enjoyed the story line,and didn't find it predictable which was refreshing and which I also enjoyed about her other books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautifully written book that had me crying in the end so good try it out for yourself<br />-Shannon Hinton
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is a relaxing but fun game. It is kind of addicting because I keep trying for a better score
B007ZEG3Q4|1.0|I received this and it is not the ultimate edition, It is just a regular Digibook version. Very misleading description so watch out for that.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a fun and challenging game. Its perfect for all ages because it improves logic skills. In the beginning, I thought that I had wasted my money, because it was so easy and I thought that I would fly through it. Now, into the fabric box level, I know that its not going to be as easy as I thought! So, I recommend this game to all ages!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My all time favorite books this trilogy left me in complete awe .I have honestly read this whole series eleven times .I feel a strong connection towards the strong female role of Katniss Everdeen for her devotion to her family and friends and her bravery.I do have to say I am not nearly as much of a fan of the film as I am of the books which were amazingly written and had me up all night trying to finish .You should read these books they are the best I've ever read .My friends don't even like to read and I got them to read them.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app only loads about 2 pages of my newsfeed updates normally. After that there are a few posts that lack the same nice formatting as the previous and after that it just stops loading updates all together. It is terrible. I just end up using my iPhone to check Facebook which was one of the main reasons I wanted a kindle fire...to check my FACEBOOK! Please please let me know if you guys fix this as I would love to have a fully functioning facebook app.
B001EN71HC|5.0|I love this collection, wish the cases were not thin cases, but rather the original bluray cases, but the artwork is very detailed, and the name on the front is embossed, nice set.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Great Item.  The story was easy to follow enjoyable and out of this world.  I especially appreciated the special effects which were definitely NOT low budget.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After seeing the movie I just had to read the book and I can easily say that the book is spectacular, way better than the movie for sure. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent book to read.
B002M87V0A|5.0|I grew-up watching this movie on TV specials and then I saw it performed by the Amarillo Little Theater.  It is a wonderful family movie.

B009K45Y62|5.0|The movie was more than what I expected. It was filmed in Pittsburgh and I loved the shots.The cowl is smaller than expected but nevertheless a nice feature to the movie set.

1400069289|3.0|Just finished \\"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\\" on Audible.com.<br /><br />Good read for anyone trying to change group behavior or personal behavior but the author's examples sometimes present coincidences and assumes causation without demonstrating it. Aside from that bit of spurious logic, its worthwhile. His four sequential steps for changing any habit:<br /><br />1. Identify the habit routine.<br />2. Experiment with different rewards.<br />3. Figure out exactly what cues the habit.<br />4. Make a plan - beforehand - about what to do the next time you are cued.<br /><br />According to him, 90% of what people and organizations do every day are just combinations of different habits, so learning how to re-code yours is learning how to do nearly  anything.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Blood Song is one of the best books I have ever read. A masterfully woven story. Anthony Ryan is an exceptionally talented storyteller. The story just draws you in, does not let go and never disappoints. Well worth reading. Destined to become a classic.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This was not the movie I thought I was going to see. This film is about the passage of the 13th amendment to free the slaves. It looks at the various backroom dealings with lame duck Democrats in order to obtain its passage. As a docu-drama it would make for an excellent showing in the classroom if not for the F-bomb<br />Steven Spielberg insists on putting his his films (aka &#34;Super 8&#34;) in order to ruin it for kids.<br /><br />Sally Field played an excellent Mary Todd Lincoln capturing her period of perceived insanity. Tommy Lee Jones plays a very important role as Thaddeus Stevens, who was instrumental in the passage of the amendment. Daniel Day-Lewis creates a complex Lincoln, one that goes against the grain of former Lincoln performances. This film does not include the Gettysburg address delivered by Lincoln, but presents it by having others recite it. There are no Lincoln-Douglas debates, no rail splitting, nor does it show how his mother was killed during a zombie infestation as does other films.<br /><br />The beginning of the film seemed liked an &#34;Oliver Stone&#34; revision of history where African-American soldiers speak up to Lincoln about inequality. This appears to be one of those scenes designed to compact history for the screen.<br /><br />Parental Guidance: No sex or nudity. 1 F-bomb about midway through the film.
B005DOJ68K|4.0|love it - reminds  me of my teen years - know all the songs - and they are classic in today's age - !
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A co-worker let me borrow the first book, otherwise, I tend to steer away from the book bandwagons (&#34;Hunger Games&#34; this, &#34;Hunger Games&#34; that...Have you read the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; yet?). I read the first book, and was hooked after that.<br /><br />I opted to buy this last book in the 3-book series in order to read it on my tablet. It was a great read, but I believe the second one was more exciting. It felt like this last book was eager to just tie all the loose ends together, abruptly. In other words, not much explanation at times.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase, as it kept me entertained for hours.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|3rd movie, rated PG seemed to be a bit about will smith. Funny movie to see, a must buy for your trilogy collection. First movie came out in vhs, I guess I need to wait for the package set to order. Recommend as  a fun, family  oriented movie..Or a MIB follower..
B00914JWSW|4.0|Barbra Streisand's 'Release Me' offers a wide array of mostly outtake songs from different eras of her career.  But, let me start by saying what this album isn't.  It isn't brand new material.  At least, most of it isn't.  There is one song listed from 2012, but was only enhanced recently.<br /><br />Track Order<br /><br />Let's start by saying that this album is tracked out of order.  In fact, because this is mostly a retrospective release, the album should have been tracked in order of year of release rather than by whatever order Barbra decided it should have been.  In fact, the songs flow a whole lot better when played in order of year of release.  So, here is the track order by 'year' of release.  Note, there is one track that was recorded early in Barbra's career but was embellished just recently.  The below is the track order in which I listen which flows much better.<br /><br />Willow Weep For Me (1967)<br />Lost in Wonderland (1968) *<br />I Think It's Going To Rain Today (1970) *<br />Didn't We (1970)<br />Mother and Child (1973)<br />Try To Win A Friend (1977)<br />With One More Look At You (From A Star Is Born) (1977)<br />Being Good Isn't Good Enough (From Hallelujah, Baby!) (1985)<br />How Are Things In Glocca Morra? / Heather On The Hill (From Finian's Rainbow / Brigadoon) (1988)<br />If It's Meant To Be (2011)<br />Home (From The Wiz) (2012)<br /><br />* = removed from my playliast<br /><br />Songs and Quality<br /><br />The songs are all over the map in quality.  Some are simply amazing (Willow Weep For Me) to downright cringe-inducing (Lost in Wonderland). There is also the problem that, for whatever reason, Barbra thought it would be a good idea to open many of the songs with recording studio banter. While it is interesting and historical, it does disrupt from the flow of the music.  The good thing with iTunes is that once you rip the album, you can clip out this unnecessary banter from the flow using 'Get Info->Options->Start Time'.  You can then start each track several seconds in skipping the studio banter. Once you also do this, it makes the album a whole lot more listen-worthy.<br /><br />Performance<br /><br />Barbra's performances on nearly every song here are practically letter perfect. The problem, however, isn't her performance, it's the weak song material combined with poor mastering.  The strongest composition on this album is by far and away 'Willow Weep For Me' followed by 'Didn't We', 'Being Good Isn't Good Enough' and 'Glocca Morra'.  Barbra's best performances on this album include 'Willow Weep for Me' followed by 'Didn't We', 'Being Good Isn't Good Enough' and then 'Glocca Morra'.  It's also fairly amazing that 'Willow' didn't end up on Simply Streisand.  I can somewhat understand why, though.  'Willow' wasn't nearly as strong as 'Stout Hearted Man', 'My Funny Valentine' or any of the other tracks on 'Simply Streisand'.  However, I'm glad we're able to hear it now as it is still an amazing track and I hope there are more 60s tracks in her archives on the way towards release.<br /><br />With that said, there are a few tracks on there that I can full well understand why they didn't make any release. The tracks 'Lost in Wonderland', 'Mother and Child' and 'I Think It's Going To Rain Today' all have issues of one kind or another.  'Lost in Wonderland' is bluntly, bad... both in composition and in Barbra's performance. Her voice does not at all lend itself to running the scales that this track apparently requires. With the composition, the melody just doesn't work and this song is just too odd even for Barbra to pull off.  Also, the song requires Barbra to follow the instrumentation along with her voice hitting the same notes. Unfortunately, Barbra is not great at that and this song suffers greatly for it.  Barbra needs a much more loose song structure where she's singing a melody that does not require following the notes the instruments are playing.  To her credit, she put her best effort out on the track, but it simply doesn't work.<br /><br />'Mother and Child' are basically an A, B, A+B combined into a duet song.  Story and compositionally, the song is somewhat dark and gloomy describing a child's view of darkness and scary dreams in opposition to the adult who thinks it's all sugar plum fairies and jelly beans.  So, Barbra sings A as the 'adult', then she sings B as a 'child' and then both are combined together in a duet at the end.  The problem with this track is that while Barbra pulls off the 'adult' part quite nicely, the 'child' part doesn't really work.  Her voice is too 'adult' sounding for the child's part.  The duet at the end where she's singing over the top of herself also doesn't work. I'm not entirely sure how she could have made this one work any better.  Perhaps rethinking the 'child' part and approaching it vocally in a different way or by having an actual child sing the part.  This isn't one of the worst tracks here, but it definitely isn't one of her best.<br /><br />With 'I Think It's Going To Rain Today', Barbra performs an amazing rendition. The trouble is, the recording of the piano is plain awful. The piano part is boring, monotonous and uninspired combined with an extremely bad mic placement and poor recording job on piano.  So, while Barbra's voice recording is crystal clear, the piano is muddy, droning, the playing uninspired and unlistenable. I'll bet that this was recorded such that the piano and her voice are intermixed.  So, as an engineer, you can't exactly remove the horrible piano part from this mix and make it better.  If the piano part could be replaced by a new part or by adding some strings, this track might actually be salvageable.<br /><br />With the rest of the tracks, they have their ups and downs, but are recorded professionally and sound reasonably good, barring the mastering issue.  The trouble is that beyond those described above, they are all B quality songwriting.  Meaning, these are tracks that would not and could not ever hit the charts in any substantial way.  They're good enough for filler material on an album, but by no means is the quality that Barbra has always been known for.<br /><br />Remastering<br /><br />This album needed one more level of mastering polish to complete the sound for each of these tracks. For example, 'Willow Weep For Me' sounds dull and lifeless on the release. Running it through iZotope Ozone on even the most basic dynamics enhancement setting reveals the shine (and her voice) on this track.  Each of these tracks here could have been shined and polished through better mastering.  With a little TLC, this album could have sounded far better than it does today.n the track, but it simply doesn't work.<br /><br />'Mother and Child' are basically an A, B, A+B combined into a duet song.

B004AKCME8|5.0|I have children  who I took care of when I had a daycare and are now 11 years old.  They love this movie and I do.  They can watch it over and over.  Dislike nothing.  Would recommend to all parents of older children.

030758836X|1.0|I won't ruin the ending but after reading about 95% of awesomeness which is this book the ending was just absolutely terrible. Not so much that I was hoping for a certain ending, but it just fell flat on its face and the story wrapped up in a few hastily written pages.  It felt like she just gave up and ended the story. This was my first Gillian Flynn novel I've read and I must say I don't think I'll be checking out her others.
B00000634J|5.0|Arrived in timely manner, in good condition...I was really only interested in about 5 tunes on the CD but might grow to like the other tunes. I would reccommend this to any Beatle/John Lennon fans.
B009A882D0|5.0|This is for me I'm 68 years old and I still love Creedence! Would recommend to anyone.  You can't get any better than this.
0486236951|5.0|White work is so beautiful, just look at the cover.  I have a chance to do such work with the knowledge I have acquired from this book.  Set back, enjoy and create beautiful craft items from days of past.
B000002KDG|4.0|This is a classic nail young album. Along with being just a classic album. Take me bak too high school and all the great music of that time. When a album was more than just a record. It was also album cover which for a lot records were a work of art. Thanks
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The family loves this movie, great job as usual. Beautiful picture. My daughter loves it and watches it every dau
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday.  She just turned 6.  She loved it so I loved it.  Would recommend to all parents.
B000056WTG|4.0|A must have movie for action fans. The stunts are real not animated.<br />This is probably the best of the &#34;Mad Max&#34; series.<br />The precious &#34;juice&#34; (gasoline) theme is something Hurricane Sandy made real when gas lines extended for miles recently.
B00936A0RU|4.0|I bought this for my father who went to see this in the theathers, and he loved it. And when his dvd arrived he got excited and has watched it five or six times already. Great quality!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It hass all the features that I can use. It is better than some PC versions I have purchased. Great.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I was expecting more of a plot in this movie, it was very confusing and didn't get it at what was coming next.
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Most underrated album of the year, big improvement from their debut album. Great sounds and great California Pop vibe. Also very good in concert.
0151008116|4.0|I bought and read this book twice, long before the movie came out.  The movie was actually very true to the book, but - as always - the book contains quite a bit more detail about Pi's adventures at sea.  Even if you've seen the movie, and know the spoiler surprise ending, the book's a great read.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I want more. More than I expected. Cant wait for the next series. All of the actors were great. WOW!!!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I like this game because the animals are so cute and not slow like some people say they are; but their not.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|I bought one of these from another retailer, like it enough that I bought another here, save for a firewire card I need to run my recording equipment...but, that is easily remedied.<br /><br />Partially bought this to stream to my TV...to do internet junk in my living room without needing my laptop, and, partially as a 'spare' for my recording PC should I need a system ready-to-go.<br /><br />I do wish it would cool the CPU better, the one I'm using in both systems is an i7 2700K, not overclocked. This system doesn't support overclocking...and the idle temps are a BIT higher than I'd like. Benchmarking utilities will get the CPU temps WAY up, but, so far nothing too concerning...<br /><br />32GB ram supported, Corsair has a kit that works well with it.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|I don't know because for a couple of days my kindle would not ever pull anything up after I rented it!  so I only saw the first 5 minutes :(  I should get a refund!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|If you saw the first one and liked it you will love this one too. Great action and the actors did a great job
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. It's hard to stop playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone.

B003WUYRGI|1.0|Nada me gustó saquen un libro de Halo 4 o algo así de acción o ya saben que a los niños también les guste como el diario de Greg
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond!  There's just something very soulful about his acting.  Really enjoyed the movie and looking forward to the next!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|i thought i mobile app was bad......this is so much worse! you can only see first few stories on newsfeed and then nothing! please fix!
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|As a college senior preparing to graduate, Christopher's search for the meaning of his existence made me think deeply of where life will take me and what ultimate truth is.
B008CO1DPM|5.0|Great little case. Well designed. Took about 40 minutes to put together including installing windows. I run this with an i5 and ssd drive. It is very very quick. Make sure you use the 65w version of the cpu. I run XBMC on it and it works wonderfully.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|Absolutely awesome version of the extraordinary book! Love any movie with Daniel Craig and he made a great Mikael.  The actress that played the lead was perfect!
0547564651|4.0|First chapter was a turn off. But the book picked up steam from second chapter on. A concise summary of takeaway points from each chapter would definitely help keep the reader more interested.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|An extremely powerful film, at times I found myself struggling to keep my eyes on the screen during several highly visceral scenes. As usual Edward Norton blows the top off of his role and is at times admirable, despicable, remorseful, calculating, and vicious. A must see
B0086700CM|5.0|I real real real real like this game it is so cool and when I mean cool I mean cool
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've read all of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels and loved every one of them.  Some are great and some grab you from the first paragraph and won't let you go.  I couldn't stop reading this one until I had finished the entire book.  Then I wanted to cry because it was over.  This is a wonderful read and now I can't wait for the next one.
B00936A0RU|1.0|It had to much violent in it. I thought it would be about them making moonshine. And selling it. But it had to much cutting and blood in it.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Behringher products have ALWAYS been much, much more than what I've actually paid for them, brand new. This mic was bought exclusively for my home pre-production micro studio setup (Along with a Behrinher XM8500 mic, ProTools, and Behringher MS16). Right now, I'm using it for  LIVE acoustic show, including 2 vocals & 2 guitars (sometimes it's 1 guitar, 1 bass), with powered speakers and the results are AWESOME!!! Its EQ ranges are right on target. Quite vesatile (I can even use external FX with FX volume per channel! Waaaay too much for its size and price.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a great game!  I think everyone should buy it.  It's a lot of fun. Get the free version. Thanks.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was a revolutionary in the horror genre when it shocked audiences back in 1960. Watching it again on blu-ray I can say confidently it has held up extremely well. It stars Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin, all in strong performance, especially Perkins whose creepy yet vulnerable Norman Bates led to him being typecast as that character for the rest of his life. But without the touch of the master Hitchcock it would have been nothing more than a very decent thriller. The atmosphere is amazing, tension builds perfectly, and even if you know the outcome the shocking turns will leave those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing it with their hearts racing.<br /><br />Marion Crane has stolen some money, a lot of money, in the irrational hope she can use it to help her boyfriend. After arousing the suspicion of a cop and a car dealer she arrives at the Bates Motel where she meets the odd but seemingly kind owner, Norman Bates. The rest, well spoiling anything else is either unforgivable because it's so huge or pointless because so many people, even without having seen it, know the major twist going in. I knew the shocker before I first saw the movie, but if it dampened the experience it didn't do it by much. Every scene has a purpose (yes even that ending that some think was unnecessary), every character is meaningful and many shots are unforgettable. This one of Hitchcock's best and arguably the greatest horror film ever made.<br /><br />The blu-ray is of premium picture and sound quality, showing as well as anything why beautiful black and white was really the only way it could have been made. There are some good documentary features, and a well-done commentary by a Hitchcock biographer. But of course the movie alone is the reason this is a must for any blu-ray fan.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Very good, grew up watching, old memories as a kid with my brother playing like the bionic man & being the good guy with super strength
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Behrinher products have ALWAYS been much, much more than what I've actually paid for them, brand new. This mic was bought over an industry-standard (and much higher-priced) Shure SM-58 for my home pre-production micro studio setup (Along with a Behrinher XENYX802, ProTools, and Behrinher MS16). Low shake noise, perfect for beatboxing & vocals in general!
1594202842|5.0|Had to read it as it created so much controversy and I found it amusing as there was so much similarities of my childhood years.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Good Songs. Good Fun. Good Lyrics. GOOD CD !!  If you like PiNK, then this is a must CD to add to your collection.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Excellent film! Very well made and well developed plot. Christian Bale is awesome as Bruce Wayne/Batman!  A great start to a trilogy that was a masterpiece.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The best Dr. Suess movie yet! The music score is wonderful. Must see family movie! I originally bought from Best Buy, then bought another for my niece and nephew. My boys have watched it over and over again. :)
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The wife is loving it.  A nice collection to enjoy by yourself or with &#34;Friends&#34;. Maybe plan your own party
0316286850|5.0|LOVE IT !!  This is a very detailed and outlined book. If you are already a Cosmotologist, this book will help make sense of how to bring the make-up all together.  I LOVE IT !!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a deal book so I downloaded not thinking much about it.  When I started reading I was immediately caught up in the story.  Enjoyed it very much and think this type of railroading goes on a lot.
0446572993|5.0|The book was in great shape and I have really enjoyed it. Thanks so much for the quick response to my order.
B005LAII80|5.0|i was very dissapointed by the critics not giving this movie its due. this was an action packed movie filled with gritty characters, great soundtrack, and not to mention dredd himself in the way he's suppose to be. im really hoping theres a part 2 for the director said that if the 1st movie did well at the box office, he will make a part 2 with the dark judges. im really looking forward to owning this on blue ray, both in regular and 3d!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because it allows me to have the good book with me everywhere I go and it is soo simple to use.

B009MF56GC|5.0|stallone never dissapoints as he brings this classic team back for another round. great story, great action, and funny moments. only dissapointment to me was that jet li didnt have a bigger part fotr the rest of this film for he's only at the beginning. other then that it was awsome seeing stallone duke it out with van dam!!! very highly recommended movie.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|If you do not expect it to be as good as the Dark Knight, you will have a lot of fun. Also, the plot is very expected, so be ready. Visual effects are amazing.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's the best book yet. Johnny Cheddar is really funny. I definitely would recommend it to every one I know.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|it's good for gamers ... but I've tried FX-8120 and I don't know why I feel that FX-8120 is better ( IN USE NOT IN BENCHMARKS ) .... but it's still perfect !
B008F5YDRI|5.0|This was a great all around movie - humor, love, interesting premie, great characters, unique plot line, well acted and directed.
B00A8V3VVG|1.0|I think I got in because of a song written by John Legend.  I put the CD on while wrapping presents and couldn't even get to that song - had to shut it off.  It is a movie soundrrack for sure.
0316069434|5.0|Connelly has yet to write a book that I did not find outstanding.  I can lose myself in the book and all my other concerns fade into the background.  The Lincoln Lawyer series is just a good.
B00000ITOY|5.0|Was wanting a simple gift for my young Granddaughter and this fit the bill! A colorful, educational toy and very well made!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Fresh watch ladies love it ( and they love me ) compliments from everyone ( including your wife dont't ask)
B003F9G8B8|4.0|I had to watch this for my MBA leadership course so I was not expecting something that good but overall it was a decent movie.  A touch long but the content and story were good.  The story is uplifting without being too sugary.  It appears to be a fairly accurate rendering of the events and the acting was well done.  I would recommend as a rental movie as it is not that bad.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|The app did not work. Crash a lot and it's slow, more slow than Google maps. When updated I'll give it a try.
B0090XMMJK|5.0|Best movie EVER. this movie should've won all the academy awards available. It's amazing, I love it, best movie ever.
B0059XTU1S|2.0|I'll keep it brief (unlike Peter Jackson did).  WAY too much filler!  Scenes that could/should have been 1 or 2 minutes stretched into 10 or more.  The pacing is so slow that I found myself proverbially \\"counting ceiling tiles\\" in the theater.  LOTR was an epic story in 3 books, and it deserved the full-trilogy treatment.  The Hobbit is NOT en epic story (it's just a bunch of dwarves that get kicked out of their home by a nasty dragon, and then try to get back in again).  This is NOT the stuff of epic trilogies, and making it so results in an endless, moves-like-molasses yawn-fest.  Getting past this basic problem, the movie is also relatively grotesque to watch -- it's like a cross between \\"Time Bandits\\", \\"Shrek\\", and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" - with the worst elements taken from each.  BIG disappointment, after how much I loved the LOTR trilogy.  If you remember the empty feeling after seeing \\"The Phantom Menace\\", AFTER having seen the 3 original Star Wars movies, you have a pretty good idea what to expect here.  I won't be returning for episodes 2 and 3.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|You know the drill, Christmas is threatened.  All of it.  The nation's economy has come to depend on the spending; in Britain, without Halloween or Thanksgiving to hold them back, they have decorations up by the end of October.  But, Christmas Is Threatened!<br /><br />Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!<br /><br />Okay.  So that's the idea.  The most likeable characters are British;  the least, the militaristic, gucci-suited erstwhile Santa-to-be is an American militarist.  The whole feature is soaked with an unfortunate militaristic air, we have no Draft so most Americans have no real tie to our overseas adventures;  we can bomb and pillage without any real risk to anybody who matters to most of us, so our culture is getting ever more militarized; kids play games killing people that some suggest are training for the future soldiers they might become.  And it takes over this movie giving what to me was an unwelcome flavor that ruined the film.<br /><br />Basically, beyond the militarism, it's a story of one kid getting missed, the system accidentally missing her toy (sort of like the basis for &#34;Brazil&#34; with less serious consequences).  Arthur, the Romantic Claus, a bumbler extreme is appalled that the kid is going to be averaged out and left without her toy, so he and Gramps---the retired Claus, get out the Old sleigh and reindeer and set off to do it the old fashioned way.<br /><br />They get lost.  It turns out that the Welsh town has its name in several global locations, including Mexico.  Things go wrong.  Gramps has an agenda.  But in the end...<br /><br />That would be a spoiler, now wouldn't it.<br /><br />It's an enjoyable film even with the militaristic taint, it just makes me sad that our culture is taking this turn and it even affects our holiday films.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Have enjoyed playing the Christmas songs in this game. Love the features, such as seeing which notes are played and the ratings you receive when playing. Lots of fun.
B0039PPW60|4.0|All the functionality you'd expect.  Not as easy as I'd hoped to customize effects.  The chassis is quite a bit taller than the photo would lead you to believe.  Still, a very good mixer for it's price point
B000YHG72E|5.0|Okay so it's up at the top of the best Christmas movies at least. So funny. Great for adults and kids.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Really reeally loved the movie!!!!!!  Saw Captain America firet which was a very wise choice. Would def recommend this movie!!!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|My three year old grand daughter loves this movie and now her Nana loves it as well. It really heard our interest.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|If you are one of the millions who can't live without their fb fix, then this app will do the trick. Take a pic and instantly up load it plus much more! Have fun.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|everything about this game is straight out amazing the graphics story mode the mulitplayer everything..... reason why its not 5 stars is because again gameloft I cant ever level up on your nonlinear play!!!!! had the same dam problem with Nova 3 nonlinear play and took forever for you guys to fix. no one at the customer service does there effin job and they hang up on you in the middle of you talking..... ive played about 6 rounds so far and still it says I have no stats and I'm still level 1 ... fix this or give me a refund....
B003I55BIA|5.0|I just got a kindle fire for Christmas and asked my dad to buy me a book. I don't know why I chose this one or how I found it but I'm glad it came to me. I loved the book. Once I started reading it I couldn't stop. The romance is very real. The events and everything in the book seemed real. Anybody who likes books that have romance and characters being changed should read this. I absolutely loved the book and didn't want it to end. So I defiantly give it 5 stars and hope any other reader enjoy it as much as I did.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This author is extremly talented and much more articulate!  Eva is a special heroine that isn't dependent on a man... Not the typical damsel in distress!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|LinkedIn is one of  my indispensable apps. I use this every day and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to network professionally.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Why 'historic'? Because the long wait, because it was only once, the performance...and of course: the band.<br /><br />I just got this for Christmas and I love it. I was expecting a more than competent performance but was amazed that these guys played at FULL POWER, like they were in 1976! My friend and I were completely blown away by the performances of In My Time of Dying, Kashmir, Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotta Love.<br /><br />Robert Plant's voice obviously is not the same, but he reserves some high pitches for the last third of the show, this guy is truly a great singer and performer. The same goes for the band: in the first songs, completely professional and at the top of their game but as they carry on and I believe is from the second disc, the rock n' roll magic takes completely over Jimmy Page who is traveling high high high with music and having a hell of a time; John Paul Jones is also excellent and unbeaten in No Quarter and Kashmir (FANTASTIC version).<br /><br />No other drummer would have been better than Jason Bonham; he is completely worthy of his dad and legitimates this show as a true Led Zeppelin gig.<br /><br />About the video, there is some silly editing but never distracts from the band's performance. Get this with at least the DVD, the music is all great but watching the show adds the dimension needed to truly appreciate what this band was capable of.<br />What my friend and I were talking after it was all over is that we wanted more and this was no diminished version of a great band with all its members in their 60s, these guys played that night with rock n' roll hunger !<br /><br />I've read some complains about the sound; I'm not techno geek, I'm old school: watched and listened the DVD with just a pair of excellent big Bose speakers, Yamaha amplifier, good enough for me. On my PC with Sony speakers and subwoofer, using SA Stereo Tool digital console, with my preferred settings...Wow!<br /><br />Celebration Day is a must for all rock fans, indeed an historic document of rock and music.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It took me some time to really get into reading the first book, but once the plot started moving, I was hooked and flew through all three books! Definitely a fun read, and I enjoyed seeing for myself what the hype in the media was all about. Certainly worth it!
B004SIP8BG|5.0|I love this movie and I am not a huge martial arts fan. I just love the story! There is more to life than just you; sometimes the good of others takes priority. Even if it is painful.
030758836X|4.0|This was a book that really kept me reading, a true page-turner!<br />I will try and be obtuse as it will be difficult for me to give a review without revealing the twists and turns that this novel has in abundance.<br />A chess match till check mate. What depraved individuals! Can this really happen? Most definitely not! But it was great edge-of-your-seat reading.<br />Looking forward to a movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft on xbox Pc and tab now and I have been waiting for this forever an I had to wait for an amizon card to its fun but I want the beta update if u get there
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|the song if i die young fit my grandchilds life to a tee beautyfull........................ yes, she did at 15 years old
0671027344|5.0|I loved the book, it was a great teenage novel. Five stars from me!<br /><br />My advice to people buying it because they saw the movie: It's like how the movie would have been if they were ok with a R rating. There was definitely a lot of drug/alcohol usage cut from the film, as well as some other content. I chose to view them as two separate (albeit related) entities, that are independently good of each other.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I love this movie. Even though it's not billed as an official prequel to Alien, the film takes place in the same universe and has strands of the same DNA. What I found most compelling about this film was the concept of our Creators being angry and disappointed enough with us that they wanted to wipe us out, in essence, &#34;fixing&#34; their mistake. Plus the cast is solid :)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my daughter. She loves this collection and is still watching it over after a year. Highly recommend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Who wouldn't like this app.  If you like to get ideas for your home, and make anything at all then this app<br />is the best.
B004I1AGTC|4.0|disc was loose in case but still worked, movie came quick too maybe 4 days and i live in alaska.
B00081912E|5.0|Ordered for Christmas, arrived like three weeks ago, in time! One the best Jim Carrey movies, hope sisters likes it!
B005LAIH54|3.0|I like the clash of the titians better. Had a much better story line in it. If you didnot see the first one then it is not bad
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Works great, I have used this app on my kindle and have not had any problems with it at all.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|This movie was such a waste of time. I actually started cleaning 20 minutes into it because I was so bored. My husband fell asleep both times we tried watching it!
B00138KEZ4|1.0|This is such a disappointing album.  It sounds more like Enya's Christmas album, which is essentially a copy of all of her other songs.  They all sound they same and they are not at all Christmas like.  Do yourself a favor and save some money... if you like this artist then I'm sure you already have other songs that sound just the same.
B005LAIISA|5.0|very cute movie. I have all of the ice age movies this one is the best. This one is a must get one
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn upped his game with this book.  Mitch Rapp, I'm sure, is a difficult character to consistently create new and exciting scenarios for. Unfortunately our world today supplies a lot of material for a character that lives to protect America and her values. Well written, fast paced, and exciting. Flynn's best effort in a while.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Colorful. Simple. Does its job. I like this app.<br />Calculates time based on what you are doing.<br />Even loads up at startup
B001KPYNR0|1.0|I truly did not enjoy this so-called \\"Christmas\\" album.  None of the songs sound Christmas-y and if you are looking for a traditional Christmas style CD, or just something that sounds holiday-like do not buy this CD.  All of the songs sound pretty much the same and they are slow, boring, and repetitive and this is coming from someone who has all of Enya's other albums.  Obviously from the other ratings I am one of the few people that feels this way but I encourage those interested in this album to go to Youtube to listen to the full songs before you buy it, otherwise you may be disappointed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|every time we watch this movie my hubby starts crying it is a really good movie and I have recominded to others
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Garbage.  It wasn't cute, interesting or unique in any way shape or form.  Maybe pre-teens's or the totaly immature \\"adult\\" may find it entertaining.  Deffinately not for me!  Sorry, but that's how I feel.  We streamed it in HD, but the Video quality was very poor.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Yuk and more yuk.  However, nearly every friend I have love these books.  Not only do they love it, but their husbands and boyfriends loved the benefits.  Get it if you need spice.  Not only did many of my female friends borrow my kindle but several of my male friends borrowed it so they could share with their wives and girlfriends.
B000I9WW6I|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since it came out, and probably have at least 2 vcr copies, which I can'play anymore; thanks to Amazon I have it again.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I am never disappointed with a John Grisham novel. I Would love to see a sequel to this one.  Unusual startling
B000YHG72E|5.0|This has become a Christmas classic.  Every time I see it, I like it more. Hilarious yet heartwarming.  Suitable for the entire family.  Even if you're not a big fan of some of Will Farell's movies, this one is special.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Anther great book by a great author! I highly recommend this book. There was just enough suspense to keep you reading, not too many characters to find it confusing,a very good read.
B0060D123K|1.0|I loved this movie growing up! However I was SEVERELY disappointed upon purchasing that several of my favorite scenes had been cut. I did not know about the cut scenes at all when I bought it so maybe then I wouldn't be quite so upset. Don't waste your time with this and buy the older versions that are not \\"remastered\\".
B000T433CO|5.0|This one is a real charmer.  Great writing, great acting, but not sappy.  The cast is amazing.  Eli Wallach is wonderous.  If you liked &#34;Sleepless In Seattle&#34;, &#34;You've Got Mail&#34; and &#34;French Kiss&#34;, then you'll love this one, even without Meg Ryan.  When the world outside becomes a bit much, either during the holidays or at any other time of the year, make yourself a cup of chocolate, put on something comfortable, slip this into your player, sit back and enjoy.  You'll be happy  by the closing credits.  A real &#34;feel-good&#34; movie that has become one of my all-time favorites, one I could -- and do -- watch over and over again.  Oh, and see if you can spot Dustin Hoffman's cameo.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|Did not work at all on my TF700 Infinity.  Closes after about 3 seconds every time I try to play anything.
0307730697|5.0|Blehm approaches this subject matter from a humanistic point of view. He reveals a remarkable human being who has flaws like the rest of us, but overcomes any and all obstacles to achieve what he wanted out of life. This is a great testimony to our human experience and Adam Brown is a real and genuine hero. My life has changed because of this book! We owe each and every member of our elite forces a resounding \\"Thank You\\" for their sacrifices. Last, but not least we must recognize the sacrifices these warriors' families endure. May God bless you all.
145210655X|5.0|Before I wrapped this item for my 28 year old daughter, I had to read it.  Love the pictures and spoofs!  Any diehard Star Wars Fan must read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Oversll a decent little app that allows you to track battery usage. Free is an excellent price. I eidh I had the option of turning off the app screen  when the kindle is plugged in. Otherwise good app.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|Loved this book and now loved the movie.  Its definately not one of the best of the dr seuss movies, but its right up there.  My grandbaby and I want to buy it now
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy the Facebook app on my phone.  It is quite stable and robust.  It is quick to respond when scrolling down the posts.  Very liitle lag time when pulling up notifications.  The Facebook app on my Amazon Kindle HD needs some work (or maybe its the device).
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Slow moving,need more free options for coins and prizes.  The story line isn't bad either. More pony game options would be nice, seems to be the same ball,  apple or balloon pop game.
0525952926|4.0|Ken Follett has great writing ability.  I love the depth he weaves into his story lines.  Very interesting and hard to set down!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|There was way too much political crap in this movie.  The storyline was good and it was a good conclusion to this series.  I do hope that this really isn't the end as this was the best batman series yet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After 5000 reviews on this site, I don't know if there is anything new to say?<br />This was like reading a new Hitchcock story.<br />After reading the author's 2nd book (from the library), I actually couldn't wait to  purchase this one!(still 55 on wait list) I'm now waiting for the first book.<br />Many people did not like the ending, but it seemed appropriate to me.<br />The characters were all terrific, the story amazing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It has all the basic settings and features. I particularly like the mute option and the hint option so I can know if I've really lost or if I'm overlooking a move.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Jeremy Renner was a nice surprise to this franchise. He first caught my attention in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. He's a great lead and succeeded in making this movie his own.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|have just one song, but it is great, hard to find it right now, it is not even in the main soundtrack.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is a timeless classic that my daughter will truly love and enjoy for many a night and day. Thanks
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|Sad that I can buy this for my phone from Google but Amazon wants to only sell it to kindle fire owners. LOL it says its not compatable for any of my devices (2 phones and 3 different tablets) what a crock.<br />Great game on Google but I wouldn't support this here as they are full of crap.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This Reacher book was a great read. I have read the entire  Reacher series of Lee Child's novels and this story was one of the best.
B008645YEE|5.0|the third of the series, quite interesting and the conclusion is amazing, i have all the soundtracks from the batman movies and this is my second election between the dark knight.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|watched it on Netflix loved it had to buy it for my dad for Christmas woo hoo whoooooo ooo oo
B000YHG72E|5.0|haven't actually watched it yet, but it shipped fast and great price for blu ray.  I'm happy with the purchase.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This serie was captaivating from the beginning. My family enjoyed each episode and looked forward to viewing it each week.  Unfortunately our service provider did not keep Showtime in the package we subscribed to.  The first time I saw the DVD offered on Amazon I ordered it.  The show is powerful and had me guessing right up to the end of the last episodes.  We will watch it again and probably deduce things that escaped our mind when we first viewed.  Great show
B009FBX5M0|5.0|i got it because that was my last soundtrack from the james bond series, the score is great, i am still believing that the live and let die is more synchronized but this is just great.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Have used this add since the beginning. It is still the best of it's kind. I do wish it would except raw handwriting for use with tablets but I am sure that is being looked at. Keep up the good work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book start to finish.  I enjoyed the characters a lot! Colleen has a way of writing that makes you feel many emotions and pulls you into the story completely.
B009SJ47XA|5.0|Creators of American Horror Story are not afraid to break boundaries of what was previously believed to be allowed in the Prime Time television. Brilliant combination of true horror, character-driven plot, violence and sexual tension all at once. And in a absolutely unexpected turn, Season 2 not only dared to break free from Season 1 story line but was able to achieve one of the rarest things in the American television - be a better sequel then the original.<br />Few of the actors from the Season 1 return but the story is completely unrelated and the actors are playing different characters. Jessica Lange is brilliant as always and this time she has a great antagonist in James Cromwell.<br />This is the best horror series since X-Files and I dare to say that if the inventiveness of this series will not dry out, it will eventually eclipse it's spiritual predecessor.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Slick remake of the book surpasses the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie version for special effects, but the original intent and twists of the story are butchered and lost. Original story is on Mars, but this movie has an elevator going through Earth's core. The &#34;colony&#34; is never explained, and questions on the &#34;recall&#34; are never answered...is it real or is it a memory implanted?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i love this Kindle Fire app. it is an excellent app. its very easy and performs true to its description.Its so handy and useful.
0142419400|5.0|I believe there is not much that is needed to be said about Anna and the French kiss, besides how marvelous and sweet it is! I have read this book more than once and it is amazing how I am able to feel such exhilaration each time I re-open the front-cover. I mean what is there not to love? This novel has it all: Romance, Boarding school, Charming characters, a beautiful setting, and a plot that is simple yet intriguing. It is the dream life of many girls ... and boys!<br /><br />The story begins as Anna-an Atlanta girl with a great interest in reviewing films, is sent off to the dream-like city of Paris. Though feeling a tad bit homesick and somewhat out of place where chic boots and coats flaunt the streets, Anna is comforted by a returning student Meredith who introduces her to a group of witty friends and a boy-Etienne whom she'll try to keep under the \\"friend-zone\\"; but it is hard when he's good looking and charming in every way. Oh, not to mention ... he has a girlfriend; all the more reasons to not take things further. As their senior year takes off, Ah-na and her friends encounter heart-aches, redemption, betrayal, obscuring feelings, and many many events that demands your attention and will keep you mechanically turning pages after pages.<br /><br />I have yet to meet someone who has disliked this novel; therefore I would definitely recommend it that is, if you haven't already read it.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Our family watches this movie every year.  The old VHS finally gave out so I found this DVD set.  The colorized version was a nice change.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love that the princess is kind of tomboyish and questions why she has to do things the way her parents did.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is your basic Vince Flynn novel.  A page turner.  I love the Mitch Rapp attitude and the patriotic themes.
0525423281|4.0|O-la. I have read this book twice, and have to admit that I just liked it the first time; but after recently re-reading it, I was surprised at how much better it was the second time around.<br /><br />Lola is a seventeen years old girl who does not have the typical \\"traditional\\" family; living in San Francisco-a girl who dresses in costumes instead of \\"regular\\" clothing. That is who she is ... or at least that is who she think she is? In this companion novel to Anna and the French kiss, Lola struggles as a teenager with an older boyfriend (who by the way is not acknowledge by her parents), the question of \\"who am I?\\", and a past that she wishes to never look back to again-The Bell twins ... or to be more exact Cricket Bell.<br /><br />What can I say; Stephanie Perkins does an amazing job at giving her stories and characters form of realism. The one thing I love most about her novels is that the characters accentuate reality and young adults can actually relate to them.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to Anna and the French kiss lovers. And if I have to compare the two, Lola's story no matter what comes in second for me. It is great on its own, but there is just something about the City of Lights ... the aura perhaps that just draws you in.<br /><br />All in all, they are both a sweet and delightful read. And I am looking forward to the third and last companion novel- Isla and the Happily Ever After (which is said to be out 2013)!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|It gives the brain a workout. It was a lot of fun to see my 5 year old figure out the game and win must of the time without my help.
B00005JKCH|5.0|So therefore, I like movies, they're made into. Plus, I replaced the VHS tape,  I already have in my collection.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|More difficult than I thought but really a lot of fun.  Interesting playgrounds to have fun in, I recommend the game for all ages.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|It is hard for me to get into this book.  I have just now found a little about the main character.  Maybe a better  review later.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Well, being an avid fan of Family Guy, American Dad, and pretty much everything Seth Mcfarlane puts his &#34;touch&#34; to it, I would have like to have a better time watching this movie. What I mean by that, is that I was looking for the same feeling of &#34;I about soiled my pants I was laughing so hard&#34; that I got when I watched movies like the hang over. Overall, it's got it's &#34;wow I can't believe they did that&#34; moments, followed by a chuckle. Did I laught my behind off during the movie? Uuuuuhhh no, but I did enjoy Mark Walberg's acting and Ted's antics. And Mila Kunis? shes hot as all get out, but every time she spoke I couldnt help but think of Meg. That also quickly went away with her hotness, her funny moments; i mean, shes pretty cool in my book.  I'll say this is a movie for adults who have a free Saturday  rainy afternoon to sit home and enjoy a couple of laughs. Feel free to drink any beverages, this movie would not make it shoot out of your nose (from laughter that is).
B004G600A4|5.0|which I truly liked. I took my youngest niece to see in our local movie theater. she liked it too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i started using pinterest website on kinlde fire but it was really slow...and then i found the app.  it works great and i love the format.  sometimes it does get stuck and u have to wait a while for it to figure itself out..but it does eventually and thats great.  if you love pinterest you should definitely get it.  and the best part is its free!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen, her show, and what she stands for. That said, I just had to read this. I was not disappointed. It was hilarious. Would highly suggest reading.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I gave it five stars.  But I don't want to write anything about.  Why can't I just give it stars and not have to say anything in this box.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I use this when there is insufficient network to stream high quality video.<br />it is silly that they don't allow you to download and view content later. its annoying to have to chase this app down every time they try to avert this. its a function we should have anyways by default.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|this movie is so bad i'm not even going to capitalize the first letters of the words that start the sentences. it's that bad. the greenscreen is so bad you can see the cgi engineers pushing the little helicopters with their hands behind the waving sheets in the background. the bad guy is so cheap and shallow, he has some weird german accent like he's a nazi doctor, but he can't even pull that off. he just sounds totally frou frou. you can tell they used sets that are probably the actors actual houses in real life, just doubled them up so they could make money off the production budget using their houses as sets. there are parts of the movie where it looks like the actors are actually standing on stage sets, reading their lines, lined up as if they were in a stage production. this thing sucks.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Have no problems at all with the Kindle fire.  Easy at first then becomes challenging as you continue on.  I would suggest it.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|great movie
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have this game on my iphone &amp; it has tons more updates...why doesn't this version keep up? ive done everything I can do! boring
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Ignored this APp when i first got but it literally has turned into APp i play with daily....give it a chance and it will wind up becoming a part of your daily routine like morning coffee...
B00138J4ZA|1.0|Really not much of a Christmas album.  A few really great songs/performances and many others seem unrelated to Christmas.  The most disappointing thing was hearing these great voices attempt to perform traditional light hearted Christmas songs.  It just falls flat. I'd recommend you listen to ALL of the samples before deciding to buy.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a movie that everyone must own, a story that goes right to your heart, .wHAT A GREAT STORY
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I chose five stars because Ted was funny and entertaining from start to finish. I recommend Ted for anyone who likes raunchy comedies.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|Description said fits Kindle Fire - Would not fit my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;; Amazon accepted for return and refund.  Ordered different model supposed to be ONLY for the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Stay away from this product. they charge extra for fonts that should be included and always running inthe background. this is completely unacceptable. i want a refund.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is soo cool i love it.  it is so amazing. the only thing is that when you pkay you need to get more acorns. but if you play kung fu scrat you  can get up to 100 acorn's  that is what i got
B00280LYIC|5.0|The plot in this story is great with a unique insight to Greek mythology. A must read for all ages!
B007XGJK4G|5.0|I was a fan of Bob Marley before but after watching this documentary, my respect for him grew ten fold. I didn't know anything about his story or his background, or even how he died. I just loved his music and thought he was awesome. He was such an amazingly inspirational human being, and I feel that this documentary really captured that. The never before seen interviews and footage were so great to see. It made me want to learn any and everything about him. Luckily the boyfriend has his biography so I'll be reading that as soon as possible. I highly recommend this movie for any Marley fan.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|This is the best chess game I have tried on the Android so far. It doesn't have all the fluff others have, you can control the expert level, and you can return to the game if you aren't able to complete it in one sitting.  Very nice..
1452110581|5.0|This book will keep you laughing from cover to cover.  I gave copies to several of my friends and we all agreed.<br />If you ever owned a cat, the observations are terrific. Very well written, a fast read.  A good book to read if you're had a stressful day.
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|In the deluge of Christmas movies out there, ARTHUR CHRISTMAS is to be commended for its imaginative reworking of the Santa mystique.  The opening sequence explaining how so many gifts are distributed in such a short time is entertaining.  However, once ARTHUR focuses on the sibling rivalry and tradition vs. modernism, the familiar overtakes the inventiveness.  Nevertheless, ARTHUR CHRISTMAS is enjoyable and well done.  James McAvoy, Bill Nighy, Hugh Laurie, Jim Broadbent and Imelda Staunton lead a talented voice cast.  Younger children may lose attention but adults and older kids should have a good time.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|There are about 8 episodes each season. Excellent. On the last disk of season two make sure you watch Christmas at Downton. It's really another and the best episode.
B006O3MU96|5.0|This is a game you can pick up and learn play in 30 seconds and continue to be challenged for ever.  Doesn't ever seem to end so it isn't something your going to play for hours at a time but fun for a supermarket line or something.
B00439MV42|5.0|I love b.t.t.f. trilogy . I've was watched dozens of times.but this the first on my kindle . part 3 is my favorite due to the &#34;old west aspect
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Just what you need after a long year at work...really a feel good movie.<br />Really makes you wish you lived there.
B00138J1XK|5.0|A nice collection for Kansas. I prefer studio rather than live music but the live stuff sounds really good too. I bought this MP3 for $5.00. Thanks Amazon!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a kid favorite and my two love it! It can be very challenging for adults as well as kids. I would recommend for moms with kids (especially in a doctors office).
B001F8W400|5.0|Lots of comic book fans were down on this movie, but I loved it. I read the NOW Comics version of the SPEED RACER books and this film brought it all back for me in like 10 minutes. All the fun and joy of racing superherodom. Man... how did I wait 4 years to see this thing. Go, SPEED RACER, go! (and va-va-voom Trixie!)
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|On time , good price, as advertised, Thanks.  A great movie for kids and adults.  A great gift that kids will love for years.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|I love movie scores. This is the best one I've heard since Daft Punk's \\"Tron: Legacy\\" score.<br /><br />I recommend this highly.
1451695195|5.0|An easy and interesting read.  As a physician who has done some spiritual work, I enjoyed his account of this near death experience very much.  The book cuts back and forth between what was going on in the physical world, then the spiritual.  It is an insightful view into the spiritual realms around us.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander for writing this book.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|Very unique concept a boy/ man with his childhood Teddy bear. Gross humor at times, but reasonably good acting. Good viewing if you want some laughs and a light story.
0062082353|5.0|TITLE: AMERICAN SNIPER<br /><br />A very good story but a bit heavy on training<br />Yes, I would recommende  American Sniper to anyone interested in sniping
B0076DELIG|5.0|Have read ALL of the Harry Bosch novels and have enjoyed his path through crime...and life.  Hoping he dhoesn't &#34;retire&#34; before I do - I'd miss him!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I didn't like some of the choices like Batman retiring for the years between the two movies.  batman wouldn't give up.<br /><br />You can't deny the quality filmmaking though.  It's a good movie, not great.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It is pretty fun, but you rarely get bingos and you run out of card purchase money too fast.  But for the time you do get to play, it is a fun game.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This is not the continuation of Jason Bourne . I'm a die hard fan of Matt Damon and was not even enthusiastic about seeing this movie but I decided to give it a shot and see it. I think it was fun and had a good story. Jeremy Renner is good and convincing and the movie does not have too many action scenes like the other Bournes but its fast paced. I enjoyed watching it.
B000YJ6736|2.0|Not very interesting.,,content shallow with little too recommend other than to waste an hour. Would not be interested in reading this author again.
B00511PTWM|4.0|I got this product because I had an FM transmitter and a GPS that I needed to plug in at the same time. Unfortunately, most of the other products out there are either too bulky, or are the type that droop down. I needed something firm that would fit in my charger slot. It does what it needs to. Hasn't broken down yet. If you accidentally move it a little bit too hard it does come out of its socket, but not that often.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Great love this show. Crazy twist and turn just always really good. Season 1 was epic but season 2 feels great and exicting from the killer with mother issues. Too the nun that has the devil in her.
B0020M99LC|3.0|Daniel Craig does a good job as the new James Bond.  Casino Royale is certainly enjoyable if you're a James Bond fan.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the show, but I miss Shane's out of the box thinking. I think the group should head to Stamford, Ct. to find out who is the baby daddy.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Made it halfway through the second book, very painfully i might add, before I gave up on it for good. Terrible plot line, terrible writting, no substance. If you enjoyed this book it is only due to your own unfulfilled sexual desires and boring romance, if you are looking to fill that void there are much better alternatives...
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I was impressed with the timely service after ordering!  My son gets this for his birthday every year (Dec2) and enjoys opening a box every day until Christmas.  I will order from Amazon next year too!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride is an awesomesauce game. I have had it for 3 days and already played on it for 7.5 hrs! Not only do I love it but little kids and adults like it to. It is totally addicting and I defently recomend it to you.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very good game, good quality, and above all good price, so i recommend anyone that's looking for a nice game, to get this one.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|If you enjoy the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th season, you will be sure to love this as well. No surprise there.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Attention all Harry Potter fans. This is the final chapter of our favorite wizard and it does not disappoint. A definite must have for your Harry Potter collection to watch again and again
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy does it again!  Pretty scary how his books seem to set the tone for what's happening in the world today!  Right on the mark! Outstanding backstories which give the players a real feel.  I'm almost afraid of where his next offering will bring us. The saying &#34;Art imitates life&#34; well here &#34;Life imitates Clancy&#34;  Thanks for agreat read!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is an easy and essential way to get you tube content to you tablet the easy way.  It works fine, I'm not sure if you tube  would work at all if you didn't have this little app.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game. Fun for all ages! My 80 year old grandma loves playing with me.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Must see final chapter of the Harry Potter saga.  Part two of this two parter is full of the excitement that our favorite wizard can muster. I was sorry to see it end but it did not disappoint.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|The ideas in this book can be applied to all sizes, multinational corporations, small business, private practice, and individual self-optimization.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I'm no musician by any means, but I really enjoy Piano Master.  It starts with a listen only program, then allows you to try the song yourself, sort of like guitar hero or something like that.  As you get better, you can move up to apprentice, then finally expert.  It grades your performance on each song, noting how many notes you hit correctly.  It's a lot of fun.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This movie was long the action was good the ending left lott to be desired Over all good film. Would tell my friends to watch if bored.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is in my kindle collection of interesting reads if just for the stupid sex scenes that are too good to be true.
1442359315|5.0|I first read the article in Newsweek magazine. The story was so extraordinary that I could not wait for the book. The book met my expectations and more. Wow!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use it every morning.  I can't think of a better praise than that.  It works... it does what it says it will do.  It's a nice easy way to get the weather on your tablet.
B00A4TKDKY|2.0|Buddy Guy is probably very capeable of making a great live CD but this isn't it. It's a lot like his concerts- some decent blues, and some real junk , like his Cream and Hendrix covers. You go to see Buddy play blues but it turns into some dreadful show boating. The man is a true legend with undeniable talent but this CD is terrible.
B00004UIP1|5.0|Rene Jacobs has his champions and detractors. For those that get it, his readings are terrific, For those wanting a 'Romantic' reading on modern instruments, they will not be happy. I imagine that this is what the opera sounded like at its premiere. Cheers to Mr. Jacobs for giving us a glimpse into Mozart's era!
B007HO392S|5.0|This is a great cd and showcases Carrie Underwoods stellar passion through her songs.  This is new country that I like and yet it brings back some of the old country fire/passion.  However, don't get me wrong these songs are 100 percent her own and only Carrie Underwood could pull them off.
B0083V2W6I|2.0|I don't want to seem like a movie critic.  But I'm a Who freak... who doesn't like this movie much at all.  I could have done with a LOT more Who and a lot less... umm... &#34;movie&#34;, I guess.  It didn't do much for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holy crap! Is it possible to laugh and cry and get mad all at the same time? First off Dean is amazingly beautiful and such a caring person. This book really picks up about half way through and keeps you engulfed the rest of the way. I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire time. Great book and I highly recommend it.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|This game is alright wouldn't buy it but is worth playing free. Looking for awesome games. Hail Odin hail Thor
B005SFR7YE|5.0|i saw this on pbs. music is  wonderful. love the ending. ramin karimloo sings great and the rest of the cast.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|If you want an alarm clock for your tablet, look no further.  This one works really well.  It has several other functions that you might like too!
B007UXSPK2|1.0|I rented this movie to watch on my new computer from Amazon and it did not play properly, the audio track was off I could only take ten minutes of lip movement waiting for the voice to come after the lips move or before, etc.  Calling Amazon and being put on hold twice and disconnected while on hold, and waiting for 10 minutes or more for help I gave up so I rate this film as lousy since I did not get to watch it.  Same thing happened a week or so before when I watched Expendables 2 and it had the same problem.  IT seems more and more of recorded messages and the time that takes to talk to someone is ridiculous for companies who make millions and billions each year that they cannot afford to hire enough people to make you want to buy anything from them. John W. Allen
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down! Definitely recommend to anyone. It is very sad though. John green is my new favorite author.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The book starts slow as the character and story builds but once that is done it is a great read highly recommend it.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I think in order to understand and appreciate the movie, people should read the book first, just a suggestion.<br /><br />I liked the movie, followed the book well. It felt a little rushed at times but I understand it's hard to fit a novel into a 2 hour movie.<br /><br />In the book, it is told from Katniss's perspective. So maybe a little more dialogue from her mind would have been good to really become attached to her.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good movie.
B005LAJ23A|4.0|Great price, timely delivery, and it is on blue ray you can not go wrong with all this working in your favor.  One or two scenes are a little grainy ( not blue ray quality) but other than that it is a great series and I love that amazon was here to deliver what I wanted at a price I wanted to pay and did not make me wait two weeks to get it.  I received this two days after I order it Thanks Amazon.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a very realistic game that is very challenging, especially the carrier landing portion of the game. a really fun way to pass some time.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Excellent all-star cast!  If you liked Calendar Girls, you will LOVE this movie!  Not only heart-warming but also FUNNY! And Cute! Enjoy!!!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Met my expectations, totally.<br />Wish he'd play at my local venue (Cascade Theater).<br />Sound also was very good on this CD
B003VDY7XE|4.0|Light science fiction with a touch of Stephen Kings oddity giving it 4-stars in my book. The acting in the first 2 - 3 episodes are pretty cheesy, but it improves and you being to enjoy the simplistic nature of the town, with lots of skeletons in their closets, bursting at the seams.
B00000099Y|5.0|I really hate reviews that require me to make a comment. I mean 5 stars says alot already, and they want more............
B000W2W4JQ|5.0|The appeal of this translation of the French children's story is universal.  I can think of no greater gift for a mother or father to be than a gift of this particular translation of Antoine Saint-Exupery's classic children's story.  Except maybe, purchasing it for yourself.  You will not be sorry!  [Later translations are, in my opinion, are of lesser impact.]
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This should have never made it off the launch pad.  It seriously makes me want to never watch TV again.  I feel that my IQ just dropped 10 points after watching.  Every now and then I don't mind some &#34;stupid&#34; humor such as &#34;There's something about Mary&#34; but this was just plain HORRIBLE!!
B005PMNBNG|5.0|There are not many artists that truly focus on their \\"sound\\", M83 really does and it's profound. With minimal lyrics the music speaks volumes...
B000000993|5.0|I really hate reviews that require me to make a comment. I mean 5 stars says alot already, and they want more............
0152465073|5.0|The appeal of Katherine Woods' translation of the French children's story is universal.  I can think of no greater gift for a mother or father to be than a gift of this particular translation of Antoine Saint-Exupery's classic children's story.  Except maybe, purchasing it for yourself.  You will not be sorry!  [Later translations are, in my opinion, are of lesser impact.]
B002NZTZ8S|1.0|The audio was low. I purchased it to watch with my first grade class and we were unable to watch it because they could not hear it
B00004W510|5.0|The Band were 4/5 Canadian, but their second album is all American. This is one of their best albums period.
B00005B36H|5.0|I really hate reviews that require me to make a comment. I mean 5 stars says alot already, and they want more............
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|All I got to say is this book is awesome. And that I love this series. Your welcome for my response.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have read most of his Green's books now, and this is my favorite. The narrator/main character has a great sense of humor, and I found myself laughing a lot. I hope my kids will read this book when they are teens.
B0000024K1|5.0|Loud, obnoxious, funky, avant-garde, political, hilarious- Public Enemy's brilliant second album is all of these things rolled up all at once.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|WE RECEIVED THE DVD IN GOOD TIME. WE ENJOYED THIS CLASSIC MOVIE AND IT IS BLACK & WHITE AND THE COLOR VERSION.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I waited forever for this to come out on the kindle. I played it on the iPod and it was great, this just as great. Get it!
B004SDEP38|4.0|Great app for minor edits to MS Office files.  I wouldn't want to try and write a novel on my KFHD, but this works in a pinch.  I got it for free (app of the day), so I can't complain about its limitations.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I love this show and am so glad it is on DVD so I can watch it whenever I want.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the graphics are great! the audio is alright. But I am definitely hooked on the game. I love the mammoths.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|being a very big fan of modern combat 3, I was thrilled to hear that modern combat 4 was coming out. I waited and waited and waited AND IT TOOK FOREVER for it to come into the amazon appstore. I would absolutely love to know why amazon is one of the very last people to get good apps. the guns in mc4 for some reason all look the same to to me. I liked how all the guns in mc3 all had their own artistic flare to them. the game is extremely good I love it. also about leveling up I feel that you do not have to put much effort into leveling up. I level up once a day. thx gameloft you have again impressed me!
B008D37J6O|5.0|Product does exactly what I wanted...play flv files.  Interface is a little clunky, but functional.  I haven't had any problems with it crashing during playback.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Yes, the picture quality is a bit grainy, but that adds to the overall vintage feel of the animation style. I have been a big fan of Toei studios since their animated &#34;Swan Lake&#34; from the early '80's. I like the fact that the story is told solely through the music of &#34;Discovery&#34; and minimal sound effects.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Mundane at best.  Grisham's books are becoming diluted from the page turning thrillers he used to write. I miss those books.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a very easy app. All the kids love it and I do too.  I have reconnected with all the old friends....
1451662432|3.0|The book was misrepresented on Amazon.  It said it came with a leather bound gift box.  No box was included.  I thought the gift box added to the book presentation and made that purchase partially because of this.  Bummerrrrrr!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A- It just says &quot;his dog&quot;.<br />B- Why would rate an app on its description?<br />C- Even if it did say &quot;his pitbull dog&quot;, how is that offensive?
B000FC1KBG|5.0|I am sooo glad that a mommy friend of mine recommended this to me! It has given me some great techniques that have really helped our little man! Love Tracy Hogg... New favorite person!
B00571F26Y|5.0|What a great buy.  Easy to read and understand and it works which is the best part of the whole idea.
B006JD48NM|4.0|It told a Great Story about a Great Driver that passed away too young.. Senna was very focused on hise driving.and this Film showed that
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|rip off of the original movies<br />poorly written script as well.<br />good acting but not story to justify<br />it doesn't make sense to kill off all of the highly trained people
B00992CF6W|3.0|its an great game but its not like the Pc or x-box edition you cant get redstone and there's a lot of many things that should be upgraded, but besides that fun game
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Taleb's prose is anything but dull. You may or may not like his idiosyncratic style (I find it very entertaining), but it's hard to argue with the points he is making. We have been making individual careers, businesses or political systems increasingly fragile. Instead we should make them not just more robust but apt to benefit from the unexpected and the unknown. City-states vs. large bureaucratic states, Top-down businesses vs. Silicon-valley style entrepreneurship, Directed scientific research vs. tinkering, the examples abound. I wish more people would pay attention.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Overall good movie in plot, cinematography and characters. Ann Hathaway did  superb job as the cat woman. I would definitely recommend it!
B009HELT3C|3.0|ok movie, but i didn't find it very funny.<br />story had way to many contradictions with he other movies.<br />story didn't fit
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I really enjoy Mahjong online at AARP,  and got this game to play on my Kindle.  It is a disappointment! Too bad there are no other options like the games on AARP offer. I do not understand why this is called &#34;Deluxe&#34; at all!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much .  I was not to sure about how it was written but after awhile it seemed the right way to write this story.  It held my interest throughout the book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|MAHJONG dELUXE  Haven't really had it long enough to tell.  I've only played one game  so far it is't bad
B0053O89IS|5.0|to &#34;BONES&#34; so waiting for series 7 was painful. I cannot watch broadcast TV without drifting away, or just changing the channel during ever advertisement break. I'm sorry to be such a snob, but I've just been through too much education to watch 99% of American ads without the feeling that I'm being lied to, manipulated, or treated like a cretin with an IQ of 60. So, most of my viewing is done by purchase of my favorite series, and this is one of the best. The cast ensemble is fantastic and the stories pretty good after all these years.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is the best CD she's made so far.  Voice coaching has helped her much.  I will buy all her CDs even tho she is far from a pro in the music business.  She has a very unique sound & I find it enjoyable no matter what she sings.
B00979CS50|5.0|Take a psychedelic pill back on this rollercoaster ride of sound,to a 60s venue but mixed in with modern concerns,a rail of rage and acidic sun-warmed feelings,\\"Driftin Back\\":brutalist, direct,thrashing in the all mighty jam with the Horse,yeh having fun too, what a gas.Young IS young, plugged into his unconscious on a river of brown mud and moving slowly,welling up,flooding the disco,hip-hop,MP3 banks of modernity,clipped and shorn of the 95 % sound wave of Neil Young's growl.Repetition is necessary,it's the Madeleine cake of memory ,\\"hey now now hey now now\\".  \\"Looking for a good time\\",the title track rides in the wake of Cinammon Girl,renewing an old thread of art-pop a la Buffalo Springfield,in waves of phasing.Young singing about the ageing process,in\\"Ramada Inn\\" he's looking back, from the long-married couple,17 minutes of broiling guitars and stressed reaction in which Young examines a love that has somehow stayed alive long after the high times turned into routine and basic daily needs.Crazy Horse have an ability to ride such long numbers,marching forward on their rhythmn section,love turned to duty and habit, \\"and every morning comes the sun\\". He even reminisces his way back to the cradle, with \\"Born in Ontario\\", a brief country-rocker that's a welcome breath-catcher,a chip off the Ragged Glory era of sound in a return of memories past.The kings of grunge rock are back!<br /><br />\\"Twisted Road,\\" one of eight new songs sprawled across this turbulent two-CD set, Young recalls, in a brilliantly mixed metaphor, the first time he heard Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\": \\"Poetry rolling off his tongue/Like Hank Williams chewing bubble gum.\\" And Young tells you what he did with the impact. \\"I felt that magic and took it home/Gave it a twist and made it mine,\\" he sings over Crazy Horse's rough-country swagger, as if the marvel of that time and his dreams are still close enough to touch.\\"Let the good times roll!\\"\\"She's always dancing\\"a song about where the muse ofmusic takes him,the language is stripped down,no ornate flourishes,chanting anthem-like \\"Shelikes to burn out on the edge\\"(better to burn than fade away) with a great jam on \\" she's always dancing\\".\\"For the Love of Man\\" a gentle Xmas-type utopian message song a la Lennon/Dylan.Then in a great track \\"Walk like a Giant\\"at the end he and Crazy Horse stride musically across the landscape,revealing shattered dreams of the 60s,Young confesses through clouds of distortion and the whistles of Crazy Horse mockery,\\"we were going to save the world ...then the weather changed\\".Young here shows a true unity with the song,Crazy Horse,the lyrics,the guitar sound.Young's idea of a giant marching through ruin: thunderclap drums and hacking-cough chords,a tone veering from feral growls and feedback to blistering fury while the other three egg him on with subtle, perennially underrated counterpoint. But the real end hints at rebirth: a cleansing coda of wordless acid-choir sunshine.Young may feel like the last hippie standing, but he still sounds like a guy who believes the dreaming is not done.Great churning,crunching guitar work-outs.The epic scrawl of a musical Picasso.Spontaneous,raw,raucous,no holds-barred rock.Best since Ragged Glory
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|There are all kinds of FX effects but the story is weak.  Batman seems a little over the hill in this one.  Not my first choice but not the worst either.
B00993FEUK|5.0|What can I say about Laika that's negative?? NOTHING!<br /><br />This movie is altogether cute, funny, scary, touchy-feely, and action packed.<br /><br />I'm so, soooo very happy this came. I'm just joyous I have it. A top of 2012, I say, TOP!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I read a lot of non fiction books on subjects like programming, databases, etc and I have most of them in PDF format. Trying to change them to a mobile reader format tends to lose the graphs and tables. So I read all of my PDFs in this application. It is easy notate and highlight documents. I've recommended it to several friends who all use it as well. I am running it on an Asus Transformer Prime tablet.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|this movie although well done and not a sleeper left you wondering what??? at the end.  Not any real end that left you wondering are they just leaving the door open for another sequel?

B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funny movie and great singing!  No sex scenes which is great and a little gross (vomit) in 2 scenes but other than that is was great.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I thought this was a delightful movie with the tongue in cheek lines and music from my age group.  It was an very enjoyable couple of hours.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Wasn't at all what I expected.  This is a real move!  Thought it was going to be one of those corny 2 star specials but was shocked to see it was actually a big budget flick with an unusual plot and good effects.  if you need a change of pace and want a whoa waht next movie this could be the one.  Old Abe never seemed better and was far less boring.  Worth checking out.

B00A80SHFM|3.0|I wish I'd read the track listing before I purchased this.  Several wonderful songs are missing, and \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" does not get nearly the attention it deserves.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game! I have my parents hooked on it! The only thing I don't like is sometimes it takes forever to have the icons at the bottom of the screen pop up when u press a habitat. Other than that best game ever!:D

0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferriss does it again.  The &#34;4 Hour Body&#34; changed my life and now the &#34;4 Hour Chef&#34; has exceeded my expectations.  I thought it was going to be mostly about cooking but really that's a huge misnomer, positively speaking.  I bought 2 extra copies as Xmas gifts.
B00AC8ZJ6K|3.0|Nothing special, ok to rent but not worth buying. The story was a bit confusing and once it got going it left you hanging.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a fun game but takes forever to build things and get energy but it is a free game
B000W91RUG|4.0|I love the Big Bang Theory and the only reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is because each season gets successively better and more histerically funny, so seasons 4, 5, and currently 6 deserve the absolute 5 stars. Still, a must-have for any fan!
B0001I561E|5.0|We played this item on the back seat DVD / Video system for our grandchildren while we were traveling to/from WDW.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Movie was well made, tied in nicely with the Borne series of movies. Hope the make another and soon, the series is awesome.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Glad I read this while traveling Asia.  I almost changed my trip to go to India!  I didn't, but became more observant of locals and things going on around me.<br /><br />This is not a book to start if you truly have no time.  You want to get back to it at any frr moment.  I suggest reading it broken up like that.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I can't honestly say that I love every song on this album, but my mom used to play Enya for me when I was little and since she died recently her music has become even more special. This edition has all of my favorites from many different albums, including versions of her LOTR songs that are previously unreleased. Of the songs that I deem &#34;Ok&#34;, that is what the 'skip' button is for. Overall, I still give it 5 stars for the beauty of Enya's voice and the beauty of her songs, and for me, the memories that they envoke.
B00005RDSM|5.0|We played this item for our grandchilren while we in the car [on the back seat DVD player system of course] going to and from WDW.

9626343532|1.0|The seller delivered the item in the time frame that it was supposed to arrive, but I have just started to use it after retirement with the intention of listing to the stories while we are driving on various long trips.  Unfortunately I have found several of the CD's are defective.  They jam and fail to properly eject, plus some of them will only play part of the story before they start to malfunction.  This problem has occurred in multiple vehicle players, so I don't think it is the machines since I have never had a problem like this with anything else before. I know that I've waited too long to try to return them, so that is my fault.  But regardless, I doubt if I will ever buy items made by this manufacturer again, thus the one star rating.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and you cannot beat the price of $1.99.  If only they would do more in this price range they could give the video rental kiosk a run for their money.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|As usual, most of the funny scenes were in the trailer clips. It would be ok for kids if the last visual in the checkout scene was omitted. It's presence is a little too graphic and simulated as xxx.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was looking for a light fun book to read.  This book was it.  Girls weekend in Vegas for a wedding and you marry someone you just met...what could go wrong?!?
0891419063|5.0|Bought this item as a present some time ago and the person I gave it to was pleased with it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a fun game. Only thing is it takes to long to progress and enter other rooms. I've been playing for month and only have three rooms open. I play every day.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Gone Girl book is awful.  I do not read books or<br />anything else containing the F word.  This book,<br />within the first few pages uses it twice.  That<br />is enough for me to trash it.  If possible I'd like<br />a refund and would like Amazon to remove it from<br />my Kindle Fire and 2nd Generation Kindle.<br />Vulgar.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Liked the movie. Got it as a present for my brother. He loves movies and this one was a good on to add to his collection.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Based on the previews, the movie was not what I expected, it was better!  If you like Glee, you will like this movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is not what I expected.  I am not into S&M and I don't like the way Christian approaches sex.  However, this is only the first book, maybe my view will change.  I would be willing to read the second book, but if it is the same, probably not the third.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Good action flick. It is almost 3 hours though so be prepared for a long movie! The quality of the streaming was great and I have no complaints.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|But still a lot of action and fun.  Wish it was not the end of the series.  It should go on.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Sweet and funny kids and adults movie! Enjoy with your kids. Very funny at parts, found myself laughing out loud.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Wow, of you have 2 hours to waste, do it with any other movie! Everyone associated with this film should take a nice long look at their life to figure out where it went wrong. This movie is worse than AIDS. Sorry to AIDS for the insult!
B009E9R2OK|1.0|I wanted a DVD not a cd and it was a lot cheaper at best buy! The DVD and cd combo at best but was much cheaper
B005K17RU0|5.0|Since I have been using this app it has been pretty accurate. I use it when we are planning any type of traveling.
B009GEAWOU|4.0|Why not offer it in 1080p? Is the show not filmed in 1080p?<br /><br />Other than that, I really enjoy this show!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This film was produced by Michael Bay. I was expecting a b-movie so I was caught by surprise by it.<br /><br />The story line is great! -Yes: this is a sci-fi movie with an actual story line, which is hard to find now days. The special effects are amazing but not overwhelming, very well placed. The acting is good, but it shouldn't have been; the very few parts where the acting wasn't good were probably scripted that way intentionally.<br /><br />It has some mandatory sci-fi cheese but with a twist. If I had to make a funny comparison with another movie I would say it is the \\"Grease\\" of science fiction (but with superheroes and without being a musical). Watch it and you'll understand what I mean.
B006ZE66P8|5.0|An amazing and classic read!! I encourage everyone to read it!! No matter what age, this book is a classic!God Bless Us, Everyone!!
B000065V42|5.0|Watched this again recently. Great movie. I can't wait to watch my kids reactions when they see it for the first time.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|Liam Neeson is a fantastic actor and I love him dearly. But this movie was not very good. Plot was weak, acting very strong, wolves totally computer generated. Everybody dies one by one. You just wait for the next guy to be killed. Depressing!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This was a collection of interesting characters set in different time periods.  I found the speech patterns initially rather uncomfortable but once I realized the purpose it made sense.  Although this was not one of my favorite books it was never the less quite informative.  I will next see the movie and decide which was more enjoyable.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|fun and caring<br />this a great game for animal lover's and people who love being charge and having nonstop animal fun.
B0001I562I|5.0|Good 80s fun. My wife and I both enjoy watching this movie.<br />Looking forward to letting our kids see it too.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|If you´re a Peter Gabriel fan and have seen this concert before, this print is the one you´ve come to know. The sound is flawless. Bluray shows the limitations of the 16mm source material, yet it remains a definitive record of the concert in Modena.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app works GREAT for my Nabi-Tablet (An Android Tablet).<br />I can download my fav. books to it, and take it anywhere and be able to read.<br />It has several in-app items like a bookmark, places you can make notes about certain pages or whatever,<br />and you can change the background color from white to black to sepia even. You can pick how big or small you want the letters, and you can even choose how you want the pages lain out. Like double columns, or one big page, one space between words or two. There are SO many ways to use this app, and I couldn't be more pleased with it!<br />Hope this helps!!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Perfect humor, songs that get stuck in your head and a good message. A great 3D animation movie for any collection.<br />Our kids love watching this.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Always loved surprises, this one was decent!! Great action by Ann Hathaway, It was a great flick with lots going on!!

B008PNBU30|5.0|A few bands nowadays are trying to branch out and be creative with their music and fail to be considered \\"bland\\" or \\"derivative\\", which is what THREE DAYS GRACE has finally accomplished. After LIFE STARTS NOW, their material was just sounding tired, but TRANSIT OF VENUS is the turning point of that. Following in the footsteps of Shinedown (who impressed me with Amaryllis), THREE DAYS GRACE has made their most creative record to date. It seems like THREE DAYS GRACE is trying to please all music fans with this record, by having their original sound that the hardcore fans all have come to expect, and bringing in new fans with their experimentation. This, again, is exactly what I expect and love from any radio-rock band, and it's far better than hearing the same lyrics over and over on every song (I'm looking at you, Theory of a Deadman). Overall, while most of it isn't classic material like their classic debut album, TRANSIT OF VENUS still is a breath of fresh air in the radio-rock realm.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars
B009A87X80|5.0|So sad that this artist is no longer a soul on earth.  I recently discovered her beautiful voice on Quiet Music program by Nick Francis.  A great CD!!
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Disappointing. I think the best parts were shown on the trailers and advertisements. Graphics special effects were wonderful, but lacking in storeline, I wanted more.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I remembered this book from when I was a little girl. A wave of Nostalgia made me download it onto my kindle. I love Grover and the goofy sweet way this book was written.
B008Y1YFNU|4.0|Throughout the years, PAPA ROACH has been considered to be a band that plays, \\"Nu-Metal\\", \\"emo-rock\\", \\"radio rock\\", and \\"metal\\", and blends it very well to create a unique sound. With their latest album, THE CONNECTION, they're presenting all of the genres that they have played in their entire career, while adding more electronics, and for the most part, it works. This proves once again that a band doesn't have to change in order to evolve. They can improve their sound and still be listenable. Though it's not a full home run like INFEST or GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER, it's definitely not a hit-and-miss like THE PARAMOUR SESSIONS was for me. THE CONNECTION does very well at maturing and stengthening the band's sound, even though it's not perfect.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars/5 stars
B007HACDLK|3.0|As much as i love Mitch this book got confusing because of so many players! There was a lot going on and if you put it down for a day or two its hard to catch yourself back up.  However, die hard Mitch fans will not be disappointed in his performance!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|One too many 80's references and awkward jokes. Then again that's what makes the Family Guy funny. Plenty of stupid humors and entertaining enough.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|The flange on this LF-4 is a few millimeters wider than the traditional rear Nikon lens cap and seals against the back of lenses and Nikon T-mounts securely, yet releases easily.<br /><br />My old lens cap would not lock against my Rokinon 800mm T mount adapter. This cap snugs right up. This is what is now the standard rear lens caps and comes with all new Nikon lenses.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|A two-part concept album is very rare and risky in the rock music realm (Green Day's UNO series and Coheed and Cambria's AFTERMAN albums have a very similar approach to this one). STONE SOUR does the job to keep us wanting to find out what happens in Part 2. The plot of the HOUSE OF GOLD AND BONES series is of a man at a crossroad choosing to stay adolescent or becoming a man, all within the span of 11 tracks. The songs don't set themselves up intentionally, but regardlessly fit together like pieces of a puzzle which, again, leaves the 11th piece sticking out. Also, the musicianship of this band is just as good as it was on AUDIO SECRECY, with blazing riffs and complex but catchy solos, and energetic vocals from Corey Taylor. Overall, this is a very good Part 1 of this album, and I hope Part 2 will be even more epic.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5 stars/5 stars
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great movie because adults can understand it as well as children. It can make someone sad. Its really an amazing movie. Highly recommended for everyone. It should be a movie to have at home.
B0013KTGAG|2.0|The film has no romance & no music (or very little) which would have made me care about the characters.
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I watched this at the insistence of my 17 year old son.  He liked it.  I didn't.  Probably not the movie's fault.  I, hopefully, was not its target audience.  If I was, It doesn't deserve the 2 stars.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good story.  Good ties to actual events and locations.  I live and work in LA and lived through msny events in the story. A strong foundation for a good work of fiction.  Just one loose end.  Maybe it will be tied up in the next one.  Can't wait.
B001Q2ZHZE|5.0|We cannot change the past. This movie is a cathartic look into the implications of doing so. There is also a revelation that each of us may unknowingly be the worst part of someone's life.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|My kids couldn't stop laughing through the movie. There are morals in the story and Christmas. Enjoy with family and friends
B000HEWEJO|5.0|How could this film get anything less than five stars? Just a complete classic in every way. Jimmy Stewart is amazing in this role as George Bailey, and should probably patent the phrase, \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!!\\"  where else would something catchy, touching and all around fun come from?  It's the tagline and sum of the whole movie, to show that you find what is important in your life and try and not to worry about the things you cannot change, and family is really the most important at the end of the day!<br /><br />  So in line with the movie... what if THIS MOVIE had never been made ??  Wow, what movie would be everyones favorite around the December time of year. Always so great its one of those staples they show, more than once around the end of December, and it never gets old watching it, ever.  The last few minutes are always my favorite.  But if it had not been made, sure there are some other nice classics out there, but this is one that is on the books for Stewart to show what a great actor he truly was.  We would not have our favorite taglines to use if this movie had never been made and would not have a film of this sort to really show us how each of us should really value who we are, and know the slightest act of kindness or even just our presence could totally affect someome else, its all in the stream of life, so value and cherish and be the best we can be, and be so happy we have a classic film like this to enjoy for years. so glad its on DVD !!<br /><br />  The movies of 2000 + and beyond, and really years before that seem to be lacking in movies that will be true Classics like the Black and White Films, films that have just amazing beautiful, classic, actors.  The movies current now are filled with so much violence, bad language and just silly, mindless scripts, just you have to even monitor with your children before they can watch them, to me, it seems impossible in 60 years that hardly any of these will be categorized as Classic and Meaningful.<br /><br />  The Sound of Music is on TV right now, yet another classic annual movie they show on Television, which I love !!  Lets keep the Film industry knowing we want true classics to be made, because there is a great number of us out there who want to watch them, and enjoy and treasure them, now and for years to come.  The Audrey's, the Grace Kelly's, Jimmy Stewart, all of those out there, we value and respect your work as actors !l.<br /><br />  The Sound of Music is on TV right now, yet another classic annual movie they show on Television, which I love !!

B006TLF5WM|4.0|If you like covert ops action movies, this is a must watch. And Robert De Niro is in this movie!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|An amazing story with amazing direction.  So very realistic that the next time you see an aquarium you'll try to set the fish free !
B000SW16LC|4.0|This movie is an update to the classic version and they did a great job. Everyone loves a happy ending and this one has a small twist, so it's very cute. My 19 year old loved it as well as my 6 year old!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was a real feel good uplifting movie. The music was fabulous especially the last mashups and the actors did a fine job. I would recommend it to all age groups and families. Great, cute movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I like that I wanted to read it until I finished it and was willing to ignore other things I needed to do such as sleep. I like the mystery.  Though I loved the book I did not like the ending, but who likes what would really happen if this was true.
0071766588|4.0|IIs a very goog book although this type of  TOEFL exam (IBT) is not the one I was interested in.
B007ELLDFO|5.0|This book is a classic for a reason - so many class, culture and political issues wrapped up in one package.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is surprisingly funny! It is highly interesting and because he peppers it with humor, it balanced out the seriousness and the &#34;science speak&#34; of the topic. He lays out a very logical, scientific-based reasoning as to why wheat raises our blood sugar more than table sugar and connects wheat to a host of health problems and diseases. The numerous examples of people's health improving and dropping weight were also interesting. Near the end of the book he gives practical recipes and ideas on how to navigate cutting out wheat. It's worth the read and a little self-experimentation to see how you might feel after making some food changes in your diet!
B00943SP0G|4.0|I remember rushing home to catch the series on TV after school. This is not that, except in name and vague story line and characters. This has a more mischievous comedic tone. Not to say it's bad, just that it used the original as a jumping off point then went its own direction.
0345803485|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not schooled in erotic reading. If you are expecting American Literature type writing, then pass on these. I read so many reviews about the horrible writing, I didn't know if I would enjoy them. Boy was I wrong. If you've heard about these from a friend, or TV then you should know what to expect. No, the trilogy is not American Lit., but for light erotic reading, they are good. No, its not mind blowing, but i found it nice to read a hard core love story without chasing characters through the whole book. I've read much worse is what I'm saying. Another thing, who has ever read porn that wasn't repetitive. But as I said, I'm not very schooled in the subject.<br /><br />I read some reviews about it being far fetched concerning her having orgasms 'on command' and having orgasms with him.....all I can say is that if that hasn't happened, then someone is missing out and someone is not doing something right before, during or after sex.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the story line and characters, both of which I found to be developed nicely.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Arrived quickly. No complaints about this. I'll pop it in and watch it about once every 6 months. Never tire of the movie. But then I often love movies that others dislike. Oh well.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Very much enjoyed the book and like where the series could go in the future. The only thing that I didn't like about the book was the length of it other than that I would advise reading this book!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you've seen them before, this collection is worth getting on Blu-ray. No doubt, one of the best sci-fi series made! I never tire of watching these, along with Prometheus, over and over again.
B00881VLCE|2.0|crashing all the time. pain in the b! fix it please. the game is cool but all the crashing kills it for me.
B009KKLQKO|3.0|The live concert was awesome! The video would have been just as nice if about half of it was not out of sync. Very poor production, at least mine was.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. It lasted ally longer then most games that cost twice as much. I also loved the hint button when you got stuck. I would recommend this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! It kept me interested and on edge from chapter one all the way til the end!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I read this book completely and turn aroung and immediately read it again.  It was spectacular could not imagine the ending.  Please continue to give us these great originals.  This has to be one of your best books.
B008I43DYU|3.0|Nice basic calculator. Surprised that this app did not come pre loaded . Should contain a % calculator to make it easier to obtain percentages.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was very disappointed in the book. The details were shocking descriptions that were unnecessary and added nothing to the development of character or story line. I expected the authors gift of storytelling to at least have some existence. I understand that people can live in hard times but still have character.  The details were too graphic not to mention the foul words that were way too frequent. I have only read her first Harry Potter book and knew her capability to write was a definite gift unseen in many years, (i chose not to read the other books because of the topic) but have been very happy with her success at story-telling. Just don't waste your valuable time or money on this book.
B008KW43TE|5.0|During our days when everyone has access to high quality recording equipment, so many artists can efficiently express themselves.<br /><br />This album pushes the boundaries of what is musically relevant, forcing all of us to rethink and rediscover our musical selves.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As alway Michael Connelly knocked it out of the park.  Excellent read cannot wait for the next Harry Bosh Novel.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I watched this series before I bought it.  I really think the storyline is clever.  For me it is a keeper.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|spartacus the gods of the arena is amazing, formidable and the best series the accion, Gannicus in the best moment....
B002SCKT0O|3.0|Just plain goofy!  I have watched this before and had forgotten parts.  At least it doesn't have Arnold shooting up the baby clinic!
B002VQ7PVS|4.0|Do you ever really know another person--even your mother?  This book explores this via a mystery or semi-thriller about the mothers past life.  For me it was a rather compelling read.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|More than enough room for what I carry and starts out light (unlike my first pack!)  The straps are very secure so feels good even over rough ground....
B0072OFOM6|5.0|the best series the accion, Liam McIntyre replace the great Andy Withfield, but is not the same..... sorry Liam. the serie is very good recommended 100%
B004XVMCMQ|2.0|It is not like the book.  It has some cute parts to it, but I like the BBC version better.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have worked with numerous photo editing PC programs.  This is User friendly and I will recommend to my friends.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Seriously folks...this show has everything and I promise you it will keep you wondering whats going to happen next. This show doesn't &#34;spoon feed&#34; you and &#34;baby&#34; you along. I recommend watching each episode at least twice, it's THAT GOOD!
B0020BUWX2|4.0|The book was great but the ending was very unclear. I actually cried for this book. Buy it! Must have
B002PNDEXK|4.0|I have always liked this story.  The only thing that makes me laugh is how Hugh Grant walks in the movie.  He acts like he is trying not to do the &#34;potty dance&#34;!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|When you just need to laugh this movie is for you. Don't be fooled by the cute teddy he is quite vulgar, make sure the kids aren't in the room.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This paste worked fine for me. I used it on a quad core processor that was running a little hot with the OEM paste. I put this on and the PC has been fine ever since.
B004OC07N0|4.0|This is not a book for every new manager. Nor does it offer a solution for every situation. But in most cases helps you - the newly minted manager - to take stock of what is needed to succeed in the new position. Definitely recommended.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I love Jane Austen stories and this one sticks pretty close to the real thing.<br />This version also has some interviews with some of the actors.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Very refreshing movie for those over 40! Excellent acting by these 2 vets. Somewhat predictable plot, but it really doesn't matter as its so well made. Relax with this and enjoy.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This is such a great show! If you like &#34;end of the world&#34; entertainment, you will love this show. Buy this RIGHT NOW!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|i'm a big Rod Stewart fan anyway, so maybe i'm biased, but it is a great album! His vocals are great and the duets are a nice surprise.
B002RS7HGI|3.0|I liked the Armada scene, but the story doesn't run true to actual events throughout the movie.  They picture Walter Reighly(spelling?) as a pirate!  He was not a pirate, Walter Drake was the pirate that helped Elizabeth with the Armada.  All of the actors are good though.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of my favorite authors.  One of his best books&#62;  Had a hard time putting it down once I started.
B0063M22QO|1.0|how many times does one have to complete a game before going to the next level?  I have been playing this for about a year and still have not reached it. Time to move on.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I found this installment to be over-hyped, too long, and easily forgettable.  I did not like Bane and found him to be rather excruciating to look at and listen to.  Actually, he reminded me of a villian that would have been more appropriate on the set of the 1981 movie, Road Warrior.  The story was unnecessarily complex, which added to it not be worth my interest.  I apologize...I found nothing that I liked about this movie...even the special effects were nothing new or unique.  I am not a Batman aficionado; therefore, this may be the reason I found nothing interesting or redeeming about this movie.
0307943232|4.0|Normally I do not listen to audio books; however, they were useful while recovering from a minor surgical procedure that kept me from reading for about a week.  I enjoyed those audio books and after reading a cyber friend's (K.  Corn) exceptionally helpful amazon.com review, I ordered the abridged compact disk (CD) version of John Grisham's new novel \\"The Racketeer.\\"<br /><br />An abridged, as opposed to an unabridged is a condensed version that intends to shorten a story without changing the plot.  In this case, veteran actor and superb audio book narrator, J. D. Jackson brought this 5 CD, 6.5 hours legal thriller to life.  It was the perfect entertainment for my wife and me during our 474 mile round trip last weekend.  The story was enjoyable and the drive seemed to pass quickly.<br /><br />The protagonist, Malcolm Bannister, is \\"The Racketeer.\\" A partner in a 3-man struggling law firm, this young lawyer's life changes dramatically after being charged with a white collar crime that landed him in Federal Prison near Frostburg, Maryland for a 10-year stint.<br /><br />After reading a newspaper article reporting the seemingly unsolvable brutal murder of Federal Judge Fawcett and his secretary in his remote lakeside cabin, Malcolm is back in the driver's seat again once he convinces the FBI and Attorney General that he knows who killed the victims and why they were assassinated.<br /><br />Malcolm barters for a new identity and relocation under the Federal Witness Protection Program, the reward money, immediate release from prison and his criminal record expunged in exchange for the indictment of his former jail house friend, a vindictive and ruthless leader of a family drug dealing cartel.<br /><br />The drug lord quickly penetrates the witness protection program and Banisters location and identity.  In an attempt to survive his ordeal, Malcolm uses his considerable skill to ditch the fed's and the long reach of his adversaries.<br /><br />Listeners will find themselves engaged and spellbound as the antagonist and the author via a talented narrator takes them on a mysterious and suspenseful ride that will not be unraveled until the very satisfying end.<br /><br />Enjoy!ves engaged and spellbound as the antagonist and the author via a talented narrator takes them on a mysterious and suspenseful ride that will not be unraveled until the very satisfying end.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B0085HWZDK|5.0|Was never a Led Zeppelin fan but saw this performance on PBS and thought it was great. Patty Griffin and Buddy Miller are the icing on the cake.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 11 year old son loves this game--it is hard to get him to stop playing.<br />He likes the all the different possibilities he can choose while playing.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|Hey, Im Jewish and thought this movie was incredible. Its is very brutal and defintiely not for young children, although I think the story is important for young children. If you want your kids to see it then get the edited version.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|My sister recommended this book to me. We frequently like the same books. I'm glad I downloaded this from the library and didn't pay for it. It was way too long and about 25 percent into it I was ready to be done. I ended up skimming about 70 percent of it. I read the ending and was surprised by it but I don't feel like I missed anything.
0978545095|5.0|Book has very nice print quality and contains very interesting photos from an earlier era.  Maier was able to capture some great photos... wish I had 10% of her ability.
B00005YW4H|5.0|my mom has been wanting a set of these dics again because she used to have them all and lost them so i am glad i could just come to one place and order it!
B001HQZJP2|4.0|The first 2 movies were awesome and will be classics. The 3rd movie was bad and kind of stupid. Its the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|You definately get your bang for your buck with this product. Nothing fancy. It just works. Nothing fancy. It just works.
1931788340|4.0|I can't say I am overwhelmed by the images. They are interesting and well crafted but I guess I expected more from this groundbreaking photographer. The images in many cases show great depth and sharpness as would be expected with such large format photography. Glad I have it in my collection.

B004ZN9ERI|3.0|I have all Floyd albums in vinyl. I listen to their music for decades, I really don't understand why all this effort in constructing this Myth around Syd! I keep asking, Why? He wasn't a genius, he composed just a few songs, some of them are weak songs indeed.<br /><br />His best contributions to the music are in this album, there are four songs called \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Lucifer Sam\\", \\"Flaming\\", and \\"Chapter 24\\" that are very good tunes. And there are two others called \\"Arnold Lane\\" and \\" See Emily Play\\" you can find in the album \\"Relics\\" that are very good tunes too, but from here to call him a genius there is a long, long distance.<br /><br />The problem is, nowadays people use the word \\"genius\\" indiscriminately. This word should be used carefully to designate only real geniuses. If we use the word genius with Syd Barret, which name should we use with Paul MacCartney?<br /><br />In my opinion, because of these four songs above, this is a three stars album. There is no way of giving it more. If you ask me:  worth buying? I would say:<br />yes. It is an interesting album, with interesting songs, but don't expect for the<br />high standard suggested by some fans here, this is not a Dark Side, no way. Is far from being.<br /><br /> to be honest, Syd was not a genius
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Of course I had seen this movie previously, but I had a chance to watch it again with my children! What a wonderful way to give them a fun glimpse of a more innocent era. The students at \\"Rydell\\" had peer pressure, and reputations to protect just like the students today, but fortunately a kind of innocence still existed. I had a chance to point out that the kids smoked,and did things that are now unacceptable, but on the other hand still felt fear of punishment from their principal and had a healthy respect for her. The kids cared about their reputations, but ultimately decided to achieve some of their own individual goals whether it was lettering in track, building a dream car or making the wrong choice, like Beauty School, only to reevaluate and make the mature choice to go back to school and graduate. Not everything in the movie reflected good judgement, but there were real teaching moments in an overall very light hearted manner of delivery. Lots of fun for the family and older kids!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is my favorite show, well that and the walking dead and this season so far is by far one of the best! the season finale alone Completley rocked the socks off of almost every other season! If you are going to follow a series and spend the money, this one would be it!
B000INAXGU|5.0|my mom has been wanting a set of these dics again because she used to have them all and lost them so i am glad i could just come to one place and order it!
B006O3MU96|5.0|This game is super cuts and fun.Plus, I got hos around Christmas, so it was free. If you don't wanna wait this long, just pay 0.99 torr it. It not a waste of money, so get it already.
B006O3MU96|3.0|IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS GAME IS NINTEY-NINE CENTS. BUT ON DEC. 24 IT WILL BE FREE (I BOUGHT ON THE 24th.) IF YOU WANT FREE GET ON DEC. TWENTY FOURTH.<br />About this game: The Good:<br />Nice HD graphics<br />Quality game<br />Good for Doodle jump lovers<br />The Bad:<br />Mega Jump is better<br />When you tilt it has too much swing.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Beautiful job of bringing the cartoon to the game.  Not too hard but passes time nicely.  And they seem to add levels from time to time.
B0086700CM|1.0|just kidding just wanted to get attention haha this game is so addicting cannot put it down totally recommended ya so awesome
B0012GTZC0|5.0|A friend said this was one of the most memorable page-turners she'd read...15 years ago. And it was. Shades of Girl with the Dragon Tatoo drama, great character development, and one of 20th century's darkest periods: WW II Britain. And unlike some of his later books, tautly written with excellent character development.
B00846REIS|5.0|If u liked fifty shades of grey u will love this book it's great book from start to finish loved of
B00881VLCE|4.0|Compared to an ipad, this app on the kindle freezes up frequently. A save feature for your puzzle in progress would be good. It's still fun, though. Its the only puzzle game I play because it does everything I want it to do.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|this game is mind twisting and i would not recommend for little kids because it is very hard and it gives me headaches
B0039TAHMA|4.0|The movie was great but the picture was fuzzy or blurry and it made it difficult to finish the movie.
B006O2QNOU|2.0|This looked to be a good movie but when they clean up the floor with the Lord's name it is all over for me. Had to shut it off. Shame on this production company.
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|missing a few songs that should have been included<br />kind of boring .................however i will always be a fan.  exhale  was great.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book is a very interesting, good read. Leads to good talks. Will most certainly read more books by this author.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|In many ways, this adaptation of &#34;We Can Remember It For You, Wholesale&#34; is superior to the '80s version with Arnold.  That version (of course) is still fun to watch, and has a lot of sci-fi, comedy, and action.  This one is more sci-fi, with some political drama (nothing aimed at real-life politics, thank God...) and a good amount of action, too.  There is not a lot of comedy, though there are some nods at the previous movie which made me smile (no need for me to list them here; you'll recognize them easily enough).<br /><br />The acting was good, the special effects excellent, and the plot is okay.  I say okay because one of the main characters has clear motivations, but we are not privy to them.  For the whole movie, I could not tell why they were doing those things.  C'est la vie.  Also, after the movie is resolved, if you have half a brain, you will sit there, thinking, &#34;Wait...  They still have the problem of...&#34; and it is not even hinted that there is so much as a plan to fix anything.  Then again, this is not that story.  It's the story of Colin Farrell's character, and it's a pretty good story, too!<br /><br />Last point, and I'm trying to keep this spoiler-free.  Some people are questioning whether the events in the movie actually happen, or if they are all just an implanted memory.  Here is the (spoiler=free) answer: they happened.  If the movie were only implanted memories, we would not get to see conversations that happen far away from him, and yet, we see plenty of those.  Many scenes do not have Farrell anywhere near them, nor watching them, nor listening in.  Thus, they cannot be said to be just memories implanted in him.  End of discussion.  :-)<br /><br />Now go watch the movie, and enjoy it!
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|So I don't think anyone in my family is going to become a piano master with this thing but it has been a ton of fun. My only complaint is it would be nice if there were more really easy or easy songs but the \\"normal\\" songs aren't so bad. I like that it comes with so many different songs unlike the other Piano Master that only comes with 10. Even my 4 and 5 year old enjoyed banging out the tunes to their favorite Christmas songs. I use it on the Kindle Fire and yeah, it sometimes doesn't catch that I hit a note but it still works good enough to have fun with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is one of the best games I&rsquo;ve ever played. You can get characters, outfits for your characters, powerups, and more. Plus you it updates every month. This game definitely deserves a five star rating.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Works great with the camera flash or using the screen on your smartphone. Easy to use and it comes in handy if you need a quick light
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game but hate that you have to wait for more coins! its fun to play when your bored and reminds me of the real game!
B008NABUU8|5.0|You should get this app because it is fun &amp; challenging. I hope you enjoy this app. Because I did  enjoy it a lot.<br />  Zecher. R.G
B004SBULWE|2.0|Well, you add the app and it does a cleanup. Then you cannot use it again unless you buy the app
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is an amazing book series, it has quickly become one of my favorite series. I would recommend it to just about anyone
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|this flix is long but its sooo good you really get into in if you follow dialog. i really like the series!
B007VUA7VO|1.0|I installed it and followed the directions to have the calibration done. Took almost two hours and then said it was not totally calibrated. So I did it again and same results. I removed the app
B0094BB4TW|4.0|wouldn't show up on my kindle . so I am going to try again<br />I will add the app Inc  figure it out
