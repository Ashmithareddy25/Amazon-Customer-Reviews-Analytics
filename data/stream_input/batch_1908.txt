B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game is a little challenging but very addictive. I haven't had any problems with the program as others have reported.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the moment I picked up the book hopeless I was fixated. It was an intense read and very well written I'm a definite fan of colleen and also loved the book slammed.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Another book I read before blogging. I heard rumor of a movie and so decided to feature it as my Review in Rewind.<br /><br />Very interesting book. Why it's classified as a Young Adult is beyond me. The style of writing is very different, but I liked it after I got used to it. The story centers around a 10 to 14 year old girl and her life during the time of Hitler. The narrator of the book is \\"death\\".<br /><br />These were the notes I made on my Goodreads review prior to blogging and writing full reviews. I do remember that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was definitely dark and at the point that I realized \\"death\\" was the narrator, it took on a whole new feel for me.<br /><br />I chose to read the book because I absolutely loved \\"Diary of Anne Frank\\" which was from the same time era. While the two books are very different in how they were written, obviously due to age and fiction/non-fiction, I absolutely loved both of them. Two young girls impressionable during such a time of hate and they are able to continue to show kindness. I also loved how Liesel is so taken with books and attempts at helping others during the difficult times with her love of books and reading. This book definitely invoked many different feelings while reading.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone; Historical fiction and young adult fiction readers alike. A great book with a lot of discussion elements.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is awesome but gives you a limited time trial and this game has a lot of glitches other than that its awsome
B00AMBMF1Y|4.0|Wow...what can I say?  This was a terrifically entertaining time spent with Clint, his son Scott and Ms Amy!!!  Oooops......can't forget Justin, he can act, go figure.  Another surprise!<br />I wanted to see this at the theater but missed my opportunity.  So happy it was available on Apple TV.  Corporate snakes, young athletics, and time proven heart wrenching dysfunctional family issues.  Of course it's a winner.<br />Goodman was as smooth as ever.  What a cast!!!<br />Watch it, relax and enjoy.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This movie was well done. If you like science fiction movies (or in my opinion, even if you don't), you'll like it. Turn off your phone, get a snack, settle back and watch.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|Like the two before this third in the series, A Storm of Swords delivers twists and turns, action and intrigue, with a great host of believable characters that you love, hate, cheer for and die with. This installment weaves even more interesting events and changes into what I feel may yet be one of the greatest epic fantasy series I have ever read. Highly recommended!
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|I WAS VERY HAPPY TO HAVE FOUND THE &#34;PETER'S FRIENDS&#34; DVD I LOVE THIS FILM AND NOW I CAN WATCH IT ANYTIME I WANT.

034580404X|5.0|Best series Ever!  This is a HOT story that you just can't get enough of.  You fall in love with the characters.  This is definitely one that you will read over and over again.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Get educated about just about anything with these.  There are thousands of these talks, and most are very interesting and informative.  You can tell how hard the speakers work on the presentations.  I understand that tickets to one of these events are very expensive - and I can see why.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love this show. Great casting, costumes and storyline. Very clever how they mix the characters lives into one story without it gettin confusing or cheating the viewers intelligence. Can not wait for the next chapter.
0553593714|4.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend. It was delivered before estimated time, and the quality was awesome. She loves it, and I'm a happy gifter. Great buy! Great series!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this is Stephen King at his best.  When I thought the story would hit a slow point it actually took off again. I always felt King had difficulty ending a story. This ending leaves the reader satisfied.  This is a must read for anyone.

B004U52VPS|5.0|We had hours of fun playing this game. You have four levels of playing cards. You pick a card, the higher the level level becoming more challenging and worth more points 100,200,300.first to 1,000 wins. You build the blocks and place the pigs according to the picture on the card and use the color of Birds the card requires. The plastic sling shot is sturdy and well made. It is so much fun, we had each other laughing hysterically. Good family fun !
B007TK77QE|3.0|Initially absorbing and a pleasure to read such good English, but I became bored with the subject matter. Too long to retain reader's interest
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Wonderful acting all around and very suspenseful  and intelligent writing and directing. The bad guys have much good in them, as do the good guys, bad.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I thought that Neslon DeMille did a good job of developing the characters in this book.  They all seemed real and believable.<br /><br />The disappointment (that seems to be prevalent in modern novels) was the sex scenes.  The book (story) was not advanced one whit by adding the sex stuff.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This game reignited my hope for Playstation Vita.<br /><br />Graphics style is amazing for the feel. Mechanics were overall polished and a lot of frustrating elements back in P4 or P3P are gone. Storyline is absolutely mind-blowing with coherent side-plots (something I was slightly disappointed of in P3P). Music is definitely refined and amazing with both nostalgic tracks from the P3 days and the newer ones just for P3G (Namely title song \\"Shadow World\\"). I will not add on to praises in the other review and I don't rate products that often but...<br /><br />Game of the Year, Definitely
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I have  watched the movie of this book for years and though  it would be nice  to read the original. I completely enjoyed it!! My only dislike is that it was too short!! That being said however I do not feel that much of anything was left out or left open.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Another excellent film by Quentin Tarantino. As usual the characters are rich and interesting. The acting I thought was superb.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love this game!  Not a mindless reaction based game- and levels are short enough not to get bored or frustrated by a seemingly endless quest.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|If you liked the first 2 you'll like this one also. My grand kids love it. I like it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Turned out to be a page turner. Finished at midnight to begin a New Year, hope the human race fares better than to become like the district's of Panem.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This is a clever action movie. I like how Downey Jr. and Jude Law portray Holmes and Watson as action heroes. A fast moving film. Have the popcorn ready before you start.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!  Hours of extremely entertaining fun.<br />Absolutely worth having. I am lucky to have gotten it for free.  Sweet.
B00004TDTO|5.0|DVD played perfectly fine. Viewed well, no jumps or skips. Money well spent. Glad I purchased, had been wanting this DVD for a long time.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter (age 10) and I both love these books.  All kids can probably relate to Greg Hefley's embarassments and misadventures.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like the layout of news stories that can be easily accessed. The articles are well written and gives the reader an unbiased look at events around the world. I can recommend BBC News with little reservations.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie had a lot of movement and chase scenes, just not the excitement of all the other Bourne films. Did not live up to my expectations.
0446615641|5.0|AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING--give me more like this one and will always buy these books.  Stone is awesome and very believable.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Just be sure to order well in advance, it took close to 6 weeks to get here. I didn't pay for express shipping but didn't realize it would take so long to arrive.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You can never beat a Nicholas Sparks story, ever.  He has an amazing heart and soul that goes into every book.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Tell you this  it is OK. but it I  not the greatest book in the world but there is not enough pages cause of all of the pictures.I do not recommended this  book
B006LSZECO|4.0|This would make an amazing movie.  Good read.  Could not put the book down.  That's my kind of book to read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book kept me guessing constantly. I could hardly put the book down. I must read the next book. One of the most interesting reads of this year!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|After reading both books, I can honestly say they were tremendous reading and more historical fact than I learned in school.<br />The characters were great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game!!!! I play every chance I get:) get this game you will not be disappointed at all.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I fell in love with Baldacci  after the first Camel Club series.  Would love some more like those.  This was a good read
B007FJFDXS|5.0|Edge Extended is a fabulous game which will keep you playing until conquering all the levels. The first 20 levels are easy to excel in with some patience and practice. It wasn't long until I reached the score of &quot;S&quot; in these levels which is basically the score you aim for if you've mastered the gameplay of the level. There are even bonus levels which take you in different, challenging courses proving you've perfected the edge skills. Overall this is a satisfying puzzle game for your mind  which will keep you on the edge until perfection.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The individual stories were great--War history was most interesting, but, way too long.  I did learn some history I ididn't know before.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it! Can't wait to start the last book. I wish I would have read the first book before seeing the movie.
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this show.  I think the casting is terrific and the plot is very interesting.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|4 stars because my questions from the previous books continue to be answered. Once again I am left begging for the next installment. My only dislike in the whole series, l wish the pace of the story would increase.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I didn't notice until after I had ordered this that it was only for an HD model.  I had hopes I'd be able to rig something up, but it definitely is a no-go.  The HD model is wider than a regular 7\\" Fire.<br /><br />Inside, the part that secures the Fire to the cover is actually plastic edge pieces that I while I did not have it happen to me, that I could easily see breaking.  There is an arm that runs as an over extended Y that is sewn into the right side of the cover.  I foresee that arm breaking off or even the corners breaking.  I would rather have seen an all metal piece or even elastic sewn in there instead, which is why I am rating this a 3 even though it did not fit my model of a Fire.<br /><br />The cover is held closed with a piece of elastic. It looks nice and feels nice other-wise.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I only gave this book 3 stars because I don't like the fact that there were absolutely positively no kind of modern words or international words as well. I am not very fond of the way it was organized either, there should've been a table of contents where you could've chosen the letter section you wanted to go to..<br />If you wanted to go to a D section there was a place in the table of contents for that same with the other letters of the alphabet.<br />When I suggest that there be more international words in the dictionary I don't mean that there should be more European words in it, I mean I want more Japanese words more Arabic words
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This game was bad. It was not as good as T Run or J joy ride. Do not get this game not worth your time.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Indiana Jones for kids!  Fun Fun Fun!  The animation was so realistic. WOW!  This is a movie I could watch again and again. Looking forward to the next one.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Cooking Dash is a great game to play.  I test your reflexes and speed. I can spend hours playing this game.  My family just loves it.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|The story line was interesting but with the exception of Matthew McConaughey and Juno Temple, the acting and dialoge felt forced and stilted.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I love this show! Everything about it! PLUS these two are so attractive, who wouldn't love watching these guys all the time!
B005LAII8A|4.0|Great story! Kid is scary and cute at the same time. Great acting and I can't believe Piper Perabo went topless. :)
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love this show! Everything about it! PLUS these two are so attractive, who wouldn't love watching these guys all the time!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We found ted's profanities unnecessarily excessive. We are not opposed to profanity but the story wasn't strong enough to support the language. After about 15 minutes we stopped the movie.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Let me first start off saying that I rated this 5 stars because of the movie itself (that I am currently watching right now, as I am typing this review). I will cover the box that it came in afterwards.<br /><br />I've seen the Bela Lugosi version when I was a kid, and I finally had the opportunity of making this a part of my classic movie collection (Wolf Man, The Mummy, etc). Now, I have been hearing about this Spanish version of the film, and how amazing it was in comparison to the Lugosi one. The 75th Anniversary Edition seemed to have far fewer reviews than one of the other DVD releases through another company- something about the Spanish film simply not working at all or cratering halfway through the movie, so I bought this one.<br /><br />Already, I could notice that, while the actors are obviously different than the Lugosi version, these actors seemed.. it's hard to explain. Very good acting in it's own way, but different than the American version.<br /><br />On to Dracula himself. WOW. Just.. WOW. Okay, picture Bela Lugosi as Dracula: Intelligent, charming, yet mysterious. This version of Dracula completely fills a different style. Just from the look in his eyes, he looks insane. His smile, his eyes get very big sometimes, and you can almost sense there's a whole other story behind that alone, which makes the character all the more appealing.<br /><br />Now, every once in awhile the film goes from a very clear picture, to a moment or so of heavy visual film grain and wear. Of course, this is completely unavoidable, especially considering the age of the film, etc. I don't dock any stars for this. In fact, I like seeing the age of the film like this. It adds to the character of the movie and represents the era well- it's a black and white classic for crying out loud lol.<br /><br />Also, I would  like to add the camera use in this one. People may have already mentioned this, but I thought I would add this as well. In the Lugosi version of the film, when you first see Dracula, the camera is static and doesn't move when it first focuses on him. In this version, the camera pans and zooms up the stairs to see Dracula in all his mystery.<br /><br />The women's dresses are also something to notate. The English version had the women wearing less revealing clothing. In the Spanish version, you will notice one or two scenes where a female character may be wearing more revealing clothing.<br /><br />Probably not something many people would notice, but some might appreciate the slight differences between the films.<br /><br />Okay.. that was the film, now onto the box.<br /><br />It's a mess. Not appearance-wise, like the printing on the box. That's all fine and dandy. I mean the inside. When I picked up the box after removing the plastic wrapping, the hard plastic DVD container fell out in two pieces- one piece for each DVD. At first I assumed this was just the way the box was, but then I noticed glue that was still stuck to the inside of the box where it would have stuck to the hard plastic DVD containers. What a joke.. I'll be putting these DVD's into two separate plastic DVD boxes, where they'll be much safer. Nothing worth returning two perfectly functional DVD's, just the box was a let down. The stars on the review don't include this, but I just wanted to make sure some people would keep this possibility in mind.<br /><br />That said, if you enjoy classics like Dracula, you'll definitely want to get a hold of this little gem while you can. You will NOT regret it.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|Good military style violence.  It's one of those war movies where the enemy is clear and it's good guys vs bad guys.  I thought also that the movie did a good job of depicting Marines and a Navy Corpsman.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I ordered this by mistake when I first purchased the Kindle I will have a better look at it later
B0043GAZYS|1.0|Loved the movie, purchased the blue-ray.<br /><br />But Sony decided to put eight minutes of CRAP advertising at the load of the blue-ray, that cannot be skipped, fast-forwarded through, or bypassed in any way.  Who wants to watch previews for crap movies EVERY time a disc is loaded?<br /><br />So, I'm returning the blue-ray.<br /><br />I probably won't be buying any more blue-ray discs, cause I hate this advertising crap they put in, and you have to watch this putrid crap every time you want to watch the movie.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Have not finished it yet but so far so good I will probably buy all his books in  the near future
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|When Eminem announced in Spring 2011 that he was releasing a project with Royce Da 5'9\\", many of his younger fans (who had latched on to his music only recently) were puzzled as to who he was referring to. Royce wasn't a mainstream artist and many hadn't heard of him.<br /><br />However, Eminem's long term fans (some who have been with him since his volatile and shattering 1999 debut \\"The Slim Shady LP\\") instantly knew they were in for an unparalleled gift and aural treat.<br /><br />In order to fully appreciate the album, one must be aware of the intense background information that precedes it. On \\"The Slim Shady LP\\", Eminem included a track titled \\"Bad Meets Evil\\" which featured friend and Detroit native Royce Da 5'9\\". The song received rave reviews from critics and was praised for the intricate wordplay that both artists delivered seemingly effortlessly. The track ended with Eminem boldly proclaiming to audiences that he and Royce would see them \\"in Hell, for the sequel\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately in 2000, Eminem and Royce had a falling out. It wouldn't be until the loss of Proof in 2006 that they would reconcile.<br /><br />After overcoming monumental grief at the loss of his best friend, recovering from a devilish drug addiction and delivering his wildly successful 2010 \\"Recovery\\" Eminem took a minute to do what he does best--go back to his roots of Detroit and scoop up his friends. He contacted Royce and expressed interest in putting together a collaboration album.<br /><br />12 years and a lifetime of change later, the two reunite in \\"Hell: The Sequel\\" and the results of this cooperation are unfathomable. The album far exceeded my expectations as a lifelong Eminem fan. With a host of renowned producers contributing to this album, its standout feature is what everyone seeks in rap: lyrics.<br /><br />Lyrically, this album is unlike anything else that has been released recently. Both Eminem and Royce are absolute giants and have a way with words that very few ever have had in the history of the genre. The fact that both of them graced the mic for an entire album is a wondrous treat for audiences.<br /><br />Each and every track on the album is phenomenal, ranging from the brutal single \\"Fast Line\\" (which contains a hook eerily reminiscent of the late Nate Dogg and features Eminem delivering his trademark explicit, raunchy lyrics) to heartfelt and emotional tracks such as the wildly successful \\"Lighters\\" (in which the MCs face their past demons) and \\"Take From Me\\" (in which the MCs express their frustrations at music piracy) this collection of music delivers the very best from both artists .<br /><br />The album is introduced with the frightening, Gregorian-Chant themed \\"Welcome 2 Hell\\" in which the two take turns slaughtering the mic and massacring the haunting beat, wreaking havoc on it (pun intended; it was produced by Havoc).<br /><br />Fans who have incessantly begged for a return of the violent, sadistic, controversial Slim Shady are rewarded. The track \\"The Reunion\\" tosses fans back into 1999, where Eminem is still spewing homophobic and misogynistic lyrics and joins Royce in telling the tale of kidnapping women, torturing them, raping them and then partying after. Slim Shady lingers and resurfaces on several later tracks, including \\"A Kiss\\" in which he insults pop stars Katy Perry and Lady GaGa, and \\"I'm On Everything\\" where the rappers deliver an entire song in which they pose hilarious scenarios about abusing nearly every drug that exists.<br /><br />The chemistry between the two rappers will leave fans angry at the fact that it took so long for them to resolve their differences and reunite to create such magnificent content.<br /><br />The sheer amount of punchlines and metaphors on this album delivered by both artists will leave fans reeling in pain. It is hard to comprehend how two individuals can be so successful at wording so many sentences the way these two can.<br /><br />This was the best effort of 2011 and far exceeded the expectations of critics and audiences alike. In June 2013, this album will turn two years old. No matter. It is still worth whatever you have to pay to get it.<br /><br />In the words of Eminem, \\"Royce, it's good to be back to business!\\" Indeed it is.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|and decided to give a copy as a secret santa gift.  It was a hit as most everyone in the USA is well familiar with this movie.  mine arrived quickly and was new.
B000FBJF78|4.0|I so enjoyed the HBO series a couple of years ago, but have only begun reading the series recently.  This third book has the virtues of one and two: written in simple, effective style; taking an affectionate stance towards its familiar characters; creating an idealistic, almost magical world where thoughtfulness, patience, love and determination reign, malice is treatable, and violence is heard only in muted echos.  I can't help picturing the TV actors as the main characters, but I don't mind, because they were played so well, particularly Mma Ramotswe.  Long live bush tea!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is an awesome book. This book will keep you reading. I am.  Slow reader an  read it in two days. It is full of powerful love.

B0058UXHHK|1.0|I kept hoping to be interested in what happened to the main character but finally gave up. She wasn't very likeable and her actions were erratic, it was hard to get an idea of who she was.<br /><br />However, the main reason I stopped reading this book was because in the dialogue, every single character dropped the \\"g\\" in all of their \\"ing\\" verbs. Tryin', goin', bein', etc. On one page of my Kindle, I counted nine times this was done and one \\"gonna\\". If one character spoke this way, maybe just sprinkle in a few of these dialogue traits, but in this book everyone spoke like this. It was too painful to finish.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|Quite disapointed in this film. Just a remake of the other Bourne films with different actors. Glad I didn't waste my $$ at the movies. The motor bike chase scene was SO long I fast-forwarded through a lot of it and it was so unbelievable. Glad it was on sale.
B0075LTOR2|5.0|Before I bought this set, I knew RM mainly for Avalon. A fine, but overplayed album. I also knew a few tracks from deeper in their catalog. All good stuff. I had NO IDEA that I would be as hooked on this set as I have become. After a few plays, I find myself only wanting to hear these albums, rather than the 10,000 other songs on my iPod. I can't explain it, but these albums are incredible. Hmmmmmm......

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie is excellent. I read the book first and the movie follows it almost perfectly.  The acting is excellent and the story is very important to civil rights. We may think we have given the black community their civil rights but this book illustrates how poorly many blacks experience their civil rights even in today's world.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies out there. Needs to be watched at least once a year. I love it!
B004EPYZP8|4.0|This is a very good story. The acting is very good and the story is excellent.  I spend every evening watching DVDs because television has deteriorated so badly. PBS has the only decent programming. I can still find entertaining  movies and on DVD they are more economical then going to the movies.<br /><br />This movie is very entertaining.
B001WPOPNA|1.0|I was very disappointed on the DVD. I email him about it being in English and he told me it would work, and it failed to do so. Not happy at all. Pittsburgh, Pa
B004I744AS|5.0|Get rid of all your other dictionaries this one is great ,besides being a  dictionary it has some side fun stuff
B001VNB54A|5.0|Shows  the true horror of war. The acting and the different scenes where really accurate. I reccommend this movie to people who like war movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this in one day, if you want to read a story that is real, filled with love, sadness, and healing. Read it!!!
B004RJZA1E|4.0|I was recommended to try this band by a few friends who knew I liked Nightwish and Within Temptation.  While not as good as the two I mentioned, Amaranthe has a solid sound with the male and female vocal leads sounding quite good together. A fun cd to listen to.  It was a valuable part of my playlist on a recent 700 mile drive.
B00000J048|4.0|This is a nice gear set and they allow a lot of different configurations.  I am a little dissapointed that the plastic pieces that hold the gears the gears are held together by friction; they don't actually interlock.  This is good for young, small hands but because they don't truly interlock, they flex a little too much for me.  For this reason, they are better assembled on a hard, flat surface rather than on a carpeted floor.<br /><br />They are carefully molded and the gears spin freely on their &#34;hubs&#34; so they work well even with long assemblies of many gears.  Overall I am satisfied.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|beautifully crafted and pretty challenging. I love it so far and can't wait to play the sequel. I suggest everyone who can give it a shot.
B004G600A4|3.0|This fun and updated version of the fairy tale was enjoyable, but not worth a second viewing. There were moments, such as the &#34;I Have a Dream&#34; song in the tavern among the brutish rabble, that were funny and enjoyable. But none of this animated feature achieved the level of &#34;The Little Mermaid&#34; or &#34;Beauty and the Beast.&#34;<br />Worth a watch, but not a second viewing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game totally addicting! Although it makes me crazy when I cant figure it out. lol Great puzzle game.
6305657947|5.0|The first Thomas Crown Affair starred Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway; it was beautifully shot and the music added to the complex nature of the story and the characters. Steve McQueen was surprising in his ability to portray the nuances of his character, previously using his brawn and courage to entertain audiences with satisfaction through swift retribution and justice.<br />This version has, perhaps, less muscle, but is enthralling nonetheless with the mystery of the Thomas Crown character who is willing to risk everything for the thrill of a successful caper.<br />The chemistry between Pierce Brosnan (as Thomas Crown) and Rene Russo (as Cathering Banning) is sizzling, and the addition of Faye Dunaway as the unsympathetic psychologist was inspired.<br />This second version, like the first, included lush and extravagant scenery and fabulous clothes for the female character. The music, the moody and thoughtful silences pays tribute also.<br />In the end, this was well done and worth watching - but only if you watched the original first!!
B003L77G8I|5.0|Have loved every season so far. Can not wait to purchase the others as well. Bones and Booth are so meant for each other.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My kiddo and I both loved this game. Truly different and creative this app will leave you feeling all whimsical and, well epic.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is a great game. Flow and flower are pretty good but they lack the depth of Journey. For this price, they are definitely worth checking out.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is a very fun and challenging game if you are in to these types. definitely worth taking the time to play again and again!
B006YC74E8|1.0|doesnt work hard to understand needs better instuctions should tell you more took a picture could not erace it<br /> again
B000BI0WOA|1.0|For a longtime fan of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler this collection was very poor.  Tracks varied greatly in recording quality. Often vocal tracks were almost nonexistent.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|This movie ran the gamut from laughter to tears and back again. I believe it is true to life for so many couples who struggle with communication in marriage. Tommy Lee Jones & Meryl Streep both are wonderful cast in these roles.  Worth the watching, bring your tissues
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this a great,and addicting app I hope u love it as much as me!really fun app please get it!!?!!?!!!!!!!!! GET IT U KNOW YOU WANNA
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is like a song. It has a beautiful medley and makes you feel a variety of emotions through the course of the book. It's not your typical narrative but that shouldn't make you reluctant to pick this book up. Rothfuss is an amazing writer and the story of Kvothe is shaping out to be very interesting
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I can't explain why, but I have games like zombie highway and some pretty awesome games...both 3d and 2d, but no game has ever intrigued me so much as this one. I haven't even played the other two games I payed for yet because I can't get over this one!! I can't wait to see what else these guys make. It works great on my kindle fire.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Funny and action packed. It was good to see these older guys still have it. And they all look good yet.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I seriously love  this book. My favorite by far!! I definitely recommend everyone reads the Perks of Being a Wallflower.
B008IGP8RI|2.0|I liked the soundtrack while watching the movie.  I should have stopped there. I'm not impressed with this soundtrack standing alone.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It seems to have a limit as to how many locations it allows me to save to my screen. The app works wonderfully otherwise.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Most apps don't keep my attention but this game is great! My kid loves this too. This is a must have.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Interesting game with an easy to follow story line...would recommend! There was enough challenges to keep you entertained and the characters were quirky and fun to meet. The graphics were pretty good,and easy . To see.<br />.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Easy read and very informative.<br />This is a great desk reference for anyone interested in developing a book for Kindle
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Book was wonderful from beginning to end and I finished it in two sittings. I'm downloading her other two books now
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|American horror story is the most exciting drama to come out since Lost. love the original cast and crew of this amazing story. this is a must see.
B005HSL626|3.0|I like this game. It is fun to try and beat the clock and not kill the bombs. I am not very good at it but maybe with time I will be
B009WO7NQO|4.0|my parents would not let me pay for these. so make a free version for this one and angry birds space. geez. I like it though.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I want to play Facebook games however and there is no app for that. Bummer!!!!<br />But I can access my facebook and read my posts and post my own
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got addicted to this game on my uncles ipad when I was nine.Then on my tenth birthday I got a kindle fire. I got all the apps like this fruit ninjas snake 3D and more. I played this till I couldn't beat level 7-2. Then I deleted it. I get it every so often now. like the title. fun but gets boring. I reccomend minecraft Pc version over this. I am addicted to minecraft 1.4.6 the newest version
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like playing solitaire and trying to beat the deck so to speak. It is a good game and is easy to manuever around in it
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have always loved Rick Riordan' s work. He has so much skill for writing, and this book is no exception. From the beginning to the end, readers will be captivated in the mystery and wonder of this amazing world started so many years ago. The details and accuracy are astounding and incomparable to any other work.
0316066524|5.0|I have nothing insightful to say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. A book of stunning intelligence, language, characters you will not forget for a long, long time, and as precise and insightful a view of so large an aspect of the nation we do not often let ourselves see. I am sure it is one of the greatest American novels. There are surely others, because they are not so long, not so demanding of their readers, which will be on lists of the best which are not as wonderful as this is. So, too, The Recognitions and JR. Gravity's Rainbow seems to transcend that limitation despite its length and difficulties, though I cannot say why. Anyone who loves great writing, great intelligence, great fun, and is interested beyond the book in this America, you really must read this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book I've read in a long time that I couldn't put down. It is unpredictable and captivating.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I ordered this because I have this on DVD and wanted to upgrade to a better picture. I was very pleased with the transfer to Blu Ray. This has always been one of my family's favorite movies and will be for years.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I have had this app for ages. It's my favorite for occupying toddlers; I've even distracted a room full of crying eighteen month olds with this app! I recently purchased a VERY highly rated kids drawing app, only to be disappointed. No realistic brushstrokes, like Drawing Pad? No intuitive, toddler friendly format, like Drawing Pad? I paid less for Drawing Pad and got FAR more for my money. The stickers are easily resizeable, and the cute marker stamps and variety of coloring tools make this a five star app, whether you need a quiet moment with your child, or you're a doodler yourself!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|I got his for my wife's boss as a Christmas present and he loves it. it came quickly and he says the quality is first rate, and the price was right as well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|One of the best I've played! Intriguing story and great graphics. A must if you are a fan of escape/mystery games!
B002ZG999U|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for my wife's boss and it got here very quickly an her boss loves it. The cost was very affordable.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is awesome! I love how it uses your created characters for just about everything.  This game is definitely how it's done.
B0053O89XI|5.0|My wife and I love this show and I got a very good deal. I do not have anything bad to say about this at all. Arrived quik, and was packaged very well.
B00A6N7BS0|2.0|Plot was awful. Took a long time to get to action. Action wasn't that great. Too much Granola Hippie like feel.
B0040UAYI4|3.0|I purchesed this product in the hopes that I would be able to impliment my keyboard and mouse skills into consol gaming as I prefer keyboard and mouse of controllers for FPS games. This device was easy to use and extremely easy to program when you follow the directions. Within minutes I was able to set up a keyboard and mouse configuration for Killzone 2, however when I tried to play, it was slightly more difficult to aim with the mouse  than it would be on a normal keyboard and mouse for the PC. After making a few adjustements, I was able to make make the sensativity of the mouse meet a comfortable standard for aiming quickly and accurately, but there was still a bit of delay/hang time when looking around with the mouse, so I wasn't 100% accurate with my shots, nore did it feel comfortable to use, especially for online gaming. Perhaps it would have been better used on a game like Call of Duty, but I wouldn't know.<br /><br />It's not the end all be all converter for the ps3, but it does what's advertized. Recommended for casual gamers looking to play FPS games on consols with Keyboard and Mouse, but  not very good for competative gameplay unless you tweak it just right. Will require a lot of adjusting to get the sensativity of the mouse perfect.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I had been wary of Delirium when I first read the sample, but a friend had expressed interest in reading it and at the price Amazon offered, it was worth the risk. Why not?<br /><br />The storyline is engaging and pulls you in rather quickly. The heroine, Magdelina, is a shy, sweet rule follower that is very relatable within the young adult genre. She discovers her own inner strength and bravery without losing herself as so many other characters do in YA fiction. The supporting character you find in Hana is also entertaining and realistic. And let's be real here- Lena's romance with Alex is an adorable depiction of young love under pressure inside a dystopian world.<br /><br />The concept doesn't fail to please and the first book is a wonderful start to an enticing series! NPR seems to think so too- this book is listed in their top100 ya books this year.<br /><br />I didn't give it a five only because this series doesn't quite have the sparkle and depth that another dystopian series like The Hunger Games has, but it is definitely worth your time to read.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|This one is fun to make a stickman and get him doing things. I'm still getting used to it but the more I play it, the more fun it will be.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well, I was planning on seeing this in the theater, but I didn't make it.  Downloaded it to my Kindle.  It is quite a page turner!  Well written, consistently interesting.  Truly amazing story, I can absolutely recommend it. I
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Love the sounds and action of the little pigs. I've got to get my mind wrapped around how to get those little carts designed.
B006JSXYPA|4.0|Like all transformer movies, this is a jumble of shapes and forms and noise. But also like the others (maybe a little less so with Trans-2), the movie is a lot of fun. With a good sound system (and I really do mean GOOD), the sound is ear-shattering and hugely enjoyable. On a small screen, (I found the same at my suburban cinema when I first saw this movie), there is so much going on and so much hardware moving so fast that it sometimes gets hard to distinguish the goodies from the baddies. I loved the steals from so many other movies, including (SPOILER ALERT), the Star Trek/Spock references, the various Alien and Predator looks of some of the Decepticons.<br /><br />I am glad I always/usually watch the specials after the main movie because seeing and hearing how Michael Bay directs and how some of the actors prepare for a scene, I would have been a little put-off in some places. But the specials did show the extraordinary access they were given to areas of Detroit, Chicago and the NASA facilities. The behind-the-scenes stuff on the Blu-ray edition is comprehensive, extensive and impressive.<br /><br />In general, a fun movie, good use of 3D and loads of BIG sound with quite a few very low bass that rumbles through the floor..
B0066W1AZK|2.0|I love the game of ches and I thought this would be fun, but there are A LOT OF BUGS.!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app works perfectly on my Kindle Fire HD. I just got it and have already fallen in love with it. Must have!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Loved the movie Men in Black 3...lots of action and a good story to go along with the action. The movie was actually better than I thought it would be.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|good book really enjoyed it, will look for more of her books. and I don't like all this writing. good
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great series and so much more fun to watch one right after the other instead of waiting in between each episode. This series deserves the awards it received as far as I'm concerned.

B000PEX1IE|5.0|This movie is a classic from the 80's. Kid friendly and always pleases adults as well.  Not quite sure why we needed to buy an old movie for 10 bucks.  Why couldn't we rent?  And why 10 bucks? It was an impulse purchase given that we had a mixed group to entertain and couldn't get out of the house to one of the cinemas.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Not enough levels. But, fun to play. Would like to see more levels.  Game needs to be easier to reset.
0425252868|5.0|I heard about this story via one of my favorite NPR shows, The Diane Rehm Show.<br /><br />I purchased the Kindle version of the book and was glad I did!  It's a well written story that gives a great story from World War Two.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you have any interest in the air war over Europe!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game had really good graphics easy player interface.I enjoyed playing it and was impressed that it was better than I expected.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|Title says it all. What a waste of time. It's a predicable, badly acted boring moving with a weak silly story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Teenagers who are worried about fitting in. People who feel that popularity is the only way to make it through high school should read this.
B000HKYA1I|5.0|I watched the movie trailer on this movie and thought it looked cute so I sat down and watched it.<br />Wow...now one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.<br />Great characters, great story....for young and old.<br />I will share this movie with everyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this app is really cool. I got my sister to download it and she loves it to. If you don't.have it you should download it.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|As usual, an exciting fast pace twist of self sacrificing detective work and heart ache.  I'm hoping for one more where Harry Hole gets the girl and a happily ever after.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I loved it!  The best book of the series! Everyone should read this book. I doubt anyone else could write about Greek mythology better than Riordan.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I'm a sucker for the Family Guy cast. These people are some of the most clever entertainers out there. I don't like to write reviews on movies, because what I find funny may not be the case for others. But....it's funny. What could be funnier than a teddy bear that comes to life; smokes pot, drinks and cusses. That's hilarious
B000FC13E0|5.0|This book could not have better.It was a  real \\"can't put my down\\" story; I loved every page-and I learned a little about  computer programming to!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|My husband loved to blue ray set its all he has watched since we got it great set awesome delivery completely satisfied
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I can't watch my videos that I took ggrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I really wish I could it's the whole reason as to why I got the app in the first place!!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Anyone who wants to sharpen a knife should consider this product. It is quick and easy to use and comes with clear instructions.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I enjoyed it as I always do her books, but I thought she wrapped it up a little too quickly and had a sort of weak resolution.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|I got this on my kindle and does not save the coins bo ho... my kids said it did not work.
1451638450|5.0|I've always felt that Ivan got short shrift in the Vorkosigan saga, and hoped for better treatment for him in a book with him as a focus.  Without violating his character (pretty well developed over the years), Ivan was allowed to be a hero, finally, but not shoved into a Miles-like mold.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing familiar characters and places from a different perspective, as Ivan's lady comes from outside.  I liked Tej and how she fit Ivan.  Both have many good character traits, but neither has the ambition of other members of their families.  Which is fine by me, but has led to them getting less respect in their lives. Her background has interesting interactions with familiar people and situations, without her having direct knowledge of Barrayar or its people before the time of the story.<br /><br />The families cause struggles and entanglements that are, often, hilarious.  In about 6 weeks, I have read this book twice and listened to it twice on audiobook, finding it charming and entertaining.
6305128952|5.0|This is one of my mom's favorite movies. I thought she would love to finally have it on DVD instead of having to plug in her video player. She loves it!
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Lots of fun. Not terribly difficult. Just remember to look at your notebook - it will help a lot. Will probably play again.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|There is no question in my mind that Mr. DeMille is a very good story teller.  All things considered, it is an enjoyable read.  The characters in the book are bit larger than life but  the author has a clever way of planting the seeds of distrust in some of the members in the &#34;A&#34; Team which makes the story all the more intriguing.  What amazed me ( and disturbed me) is the description of the political and economic instability of Yemen.  I not only found it very believable but was able to sustantiate through other sources that the author was not indulging in literary license.  When you read this story, as an American, try not to think of our tax dollars being spent in the name of national security.<br /><br />Note:  Mr. DeMille has adroitly left the door open for a sequel!
B0074MZSWW|2.0|It has one or two good songs. The rest is fairly mediocre. Song writing is weak, the meldies are not memorable.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|During the second level, at the beginning, when you use the dynamite to blow up the rocks, fire spreads to the one bridge that you absolutely need so I can not progress any further. How the heck do you process if you can't cross that bridge?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS WONDERFUL, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I HAVE RECOMMENDED TO MY SON WHO ENJOYS A GREAT BOOK HIMSELF.
0756666937|5.0|I got this as a gift from my 10 year old son. We have quite a fe2w Lego books but this one tops them all. Very well written and great pictures also.<br />Worth every penny.

B005QBKXSC|4.0|I like Daughtry and have his other CD's.  I was going to his concert, and wanted to hear his new songs.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Most excellent book and is highly recommended .  John Gresham has done it again  bigger and better than his last , just when you think  he can't do better , he does.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Great movie but in buying the Blu-Ray version I would have guessed it was to be the colorized version, but it was not. Even says on the back description that its in the new colorized Blu-Ray. They do have the movie in a two disc format B&W and colorized version DVD which was $2.00 cheaper, but I wanted the movie in Blu-Ray. Don't understand why they would even make a movie that's B&W in a Blu-Ray version. Out come of all this is that I wrote Amazon and they refunded my money and was able to keep the movie. Very nice of them. Amazon is the first place I look if I want to buy something.
B005KISH7U|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 7 year old son.  He was thrilled and had it assembled in 2 days.  Lego always makes quality products.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Got this for my godson for Xmas. Such a cute movie and was priced at suh a great value. Always thought this movie was a must have for kids. I am sure he will enjoy it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best series of books I have ever read. It is mistake to think this is just for young people. There are wonderful lessons for old and young alike.
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|Really the WORST ever from MR Mars! Hate the &#34;new&#34; sound! What happened?? Wasted my $$ BAD mix and sound on CD!
B0036SUQWA|5.0|good movie..loved the convenience  of instant  online purchase and viewing..was a bit concerned at slight blurriness at very start of film but it quickly cleared up..may have been due to my internet connection..
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Never played before and now I can't stop! Until I download a book on my Kindle, I'm hooked on these feathered friends.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it one of my favorite books!! Sends a good message out to children and adults alike. Very very good!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book. Very entertaining, hard book to put down. Story line is good I just wish it would have had a final chapter on the future.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Okay so today I picked up this album at Target, and I do not regret it one bit. It gives you variaties of song genres, from r&b to reggae. I've listened to all the tracks, and I enjoy them all a lot.<br /><br />1)Fresh off the runway (***): It's a catchy song, not my favorite on the album, but it is definietly a dance/club track.<br /><br />2) Diamonds (*****): I really like this song. I know a lot of peopl were dissapointed when thi debuted, to be honest I didn't like it at first, but I got to listening to it a couple weeks back, and it's gotten to be one of my favorites. I really like how it shows off her vocals.<br /><br />3) Numb (***'): I like how it starts off, and I really enjoy the beat. It's r&b/pop with a touch of island/reggae feel and I like that. But I really don't like Eminems part. It's a little too silly in my opinion. It sounds a little like \\"Just Lose It\\" by him, which I like, but it doesnt fit with the song. Sorry.<br /><br />4) Pour It Up (*****): Although the message flat (money), I really like how the song was constructed, the beat is sick, and I like the cockiness in the song. It is really catchy.<br /><br />5) Loveeeee song (*****): This song features FUTURE. Anyway this song is great. Aside from being layed back and chill, its lyrics aren't that bad either. I find this more of a FUTURE song though, so if you hate him or something, you might now be into it.<br /><br />6)Jump (****): This song is really catchy. The only part I honestly don't like the dubstep breakdowns, but whatever. The lyrics are pretty dirty. I really like the rythmn, and the way the song was put together.<br /><br />7) Right Now(***') not too fond of the dubstep breakdowns again, but the rest of the song has meaning and its pretty good.<br /><br />8) What Now(*****): I like this song a lot. Really don't find anything wrong with it. Just explains the feeling of the bad ending of a good relationship.<br /><br />9)Stay(****') not my favorite on the album but it's not bad. I like how her an Mikky collaborate.<br /><br />10) Nobodies Buisness(****): Shows how Chriannas going to stick together and they don't care if anybody thinks it's good or bad. Not bad.<br /><br />11) Mother mary(*****): This is kind of like two songs in one. I really like it. It explains that Rih didn't expect all of the fame to happen to her and how shes still trying to be in Gods arms, but she explains that its hard being part of the public eye. She also says that love has its ups and downs, and no relationship is perfect, but you have to focus on the future and try to set the past aside.<br /><br />12)Get it over with(****): catchy song. Pretty sure it's about getting high but I like it.<br /><br />13)No Love Allowed(*****): THIS SONG IS AMAZING! It's catchy. Even though a lot of people don't like it when she does reggae, I don't mind. It's great. I have to say it is my favorite on the whole album, and I will. It is extremely catchy and it a song you would want to listen over and over again. Nothing bad to say about this song AT ALL!<br /><br />14)Lost in Paradise(****'): I enjoy a lot of the lyrics in this song. Well put together point blank period.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Jerrmy R. did a great job with the acting,  considering the shoes he had to fill.  He brought the intensity needed for this movie. The story was captivating. It seems to have very little to do with the Bourne saga.  Took off 1 star for lack of wit in the movie, just my personal requirement for a movie with complete entertainment value for this type of movie.<br />I would watch it again so that says a lot.
B009GXHOW4|3.0|It is ok but it works about 2 out of 10 on my kindle.The only things its given me in the past month are a diamond sword that I had and it made 5 more and it gave me a diamond block.It doesn't work a lot.DO NOT GET IF YOU HAVE NO PATIANTANCE!!!!!!!!!Oh read descriptions people please I'm talking about the app limp.
B0033VUH6A|5.0|The casting was perfect, in depth look into the psyche was very well written and acted, not too violent, not unrealistically action packed, but very realistic (as far as a non veteran can say)
B000ENC5YW|4.0|Robert MacDougal (Sean Connery) is an art thief who hides himself away in his Scottish castle. But an art insurance investigator, Virginia Baker (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is now on his trail. She seemingly aids him in one last major theft - this time of a priceless Chinese mask - with a view to catching him in the act. Virginia manages to slip away and tell her boss, Hector Cruz (Will Patton) all about the plans; but MacDougal has the place bugged so he knows all about the double-cross. After the duo successfully complete this theft, Virginia persuades MacDougal to go for a bank robbery from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, just as the world is poised to enter the new millennium in 2000. The dialogue is witty and engaging, and the possibility of romance between the antagonists adds another dimension to the story line. There are further twists in this exciting story, but I shall say no more. Connery and Zeta-Jones play their parts convincingly.
B008FWHGYS|4.0|Brilliantly acted, the film offers vision into the lives of many. There is no plot line in particular but this should not dissuade you from watching. It's worth it and the views of Paris, London are a nice touch. It you like explosions and violence this is not for you. This film tells a basic, age old story in a myriad of ways.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After receiving the paperback copy of the book on loan, my Christmas gift of a Samsung Galaxy Android 10.1 Tab enabled me to download the Kindle Book file to my installed Kindle App on my new tablet. The e-text is eminently readable. I can bookmark the current page and obtain word definitions on demand. I am converting to electronic reading as opposed to hard copy as my likely norm.<br />I saw the film version of Lincoln twice at first and enjoyed it thoroughly as a visual and aural media experience. The book's level of detail about the full character list is understandably and impressively more detailed in its exposition about the principals' and their families' thought processes about American life in general and domestic politics in particular. It is quite evident that critical thinking about serious issues and significant personal or professional decisions occurred frequently among the main characters, their spouses, and children. It is comforting to realize that superior individual talent and innate ability resided in much of our national leadership from the period of the founding fathers through the civil war.
B001VTTRC6|4.0|Great acting, interesting plot line, unexpected ending. You will continually doubt yourself throughout the film, and your conjectures with regard to each character. Film takes place in Boston, accents and local color are well represented.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book should be available to all American History classes.  What a wonderful chronicle of devotion to country, courage, and role models that the world could sure use today!  Thank you so much for getting this wonderful story told.  Todd Serfass-educator
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really liked the book, because Greg is trying to act cool in his school so someone will ask him out on a date to the Valintine's Dance. But things don't go so well with the dance.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is amazing like how Greg got the chicken pox and how Rowley stole Greg`s date from him to .Diary of a wimpy kid the third wheel .also I don't get how Greg got Rowley`s chicken pox cause he could have pimples .also did the book say that uncle Gary tricked Greg`s Dad with the scratch paper.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I Like This CD..  Corinne Bailey is a very talented singer.  she reminds me of Billie Holiday.  Yop will not be disappointed with this CD.  Thanks
B008GXHOFW|2.0|It was great game until I lost my progress! Can I please have my money back or u get me back my progress? Thanks! Until then nobody bye this app! Please please please, rate this review good so it can be a main review so more people see this cuz I really don't want anybody else to get ripped off like I did. THANKS!
B000BISBDY|5.0|Never get tired of hearing a Cash song.  This is a great CD. Thank You very much.  ariived quickley and price was super!
0553801473|5.0|The book is much better than the HBO series.  The book came fast and was in great condition.  I enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Ok, I didn't  expect any PC Minecraft, but I certainly expected better than this. The graphics are equally appealing as both the PC and X-box versions, that is one star. But the gameplay is ruined by the to-do-easy navigation, well, in my opinion... and I know the game is in early stages, so I'll cut it some slack. Wait a couple months when the game has been improved by Mojang, like when more blocks are added, etc
0425263908|5.0|I know some have made the connection between story lines of 50 Shades and Bared to You and bashed Sylvia Day for it. Yes they are similar, but let's be honest, the girl would have to be with an incredibly wealthy man in order for him to keep tabs on her/have constant protection on her. I'm hooked on the characters and thrilled that you learn about their pasts in the first novel in this series.  The sex scenes are not as BDSM as 50 shades, but they are VERY detailed. I can't wait for book three to come out in May.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading the first book I had to keep going. I am sure I will be back to buy book three. Thanks, Bev
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Another awesome episode. What a great ending. Enjoyed the Christmas theme. This is a must to add to your library ..
B009CPJHY4|5.0|just the right amount of schmaltzy, humour and sadness - the choice of actors for each character was perfect - we moved to another country to retire - it was fun to see this played out in a movie - treat yourself and watch it - who knows, maybe you too will find your marigold
0062073931|4.0|If you have read her famous works, you may already figure out the ending. The book has a great title, but the characters are hard to like in this tale. I found myself not very sympathetic to many or any of them. This made it harder for me to read the book. I do like however Agatha Christie twists. Someday, I hope to write my own mystery book!  I think she makes up interesting plots though and conclusions. This book had a nice little wrap up.  There were many red herrings.<br /><br />I think that the book could have been strengthened if there were less characters or more background given to flesh out individual characters. Compared to Sad Cypress, there was less story telling and more narration.  I felt like I was just getting a lot of facts as opposed to really learning about the individual characters. The characters didn't seem very complex. But, I could be biased because Sad Cypress is my favorite so far.<br /><br />I also think that those who have read previous Agatha Christie works, especially the famous ones (Orient Express, Ten Little Indians, Death on the Nile) may have the ending figured out.  I kind of had an idea of what had happened. It's still a good book, but I do think if you are trying to figure out if you'd like Agatha Christie, you might want to start with a stronger work.
B0096Q543C|5.0|I first saw David Guetta on the Graham Norton Show and loved the song he performed.  I researched the other songs on the album to be sure I would like more than just the one song and I have not been disappointed.
B0030LYL88|5.0|This is a beautiful album, packed with energy, drama, and passion. I am not especially well-versed in the genre, so I don't know whether to call this symphonic metal, power metal, et cetera, but it is one of the most impressive pieces of music I've heard all year. There is nothing dark or depressing about this music. In fact, it is almost festive at times, with a bit of a medieval/Renaissance Fair flavor. Fresh, fun, and just pure enjoyment to listen to. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Ancient Bards to anyone who likes hard-driving rock music with a whimsical fantasy twist.<br /><br />There's a bit of spoken word/growling nonsense on one of the tracks, but that can easily be skipped.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Kept me interested yet had no idea what to expect.  Waiting for the sequel due out in April this year
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I Bought this didn't know what to think but I'm hooked. Literally I spend hours and hours playing super fun makes you use your brain. And is educational as well. Numbingly issue is it get so hard . Literally it get frustrating  but welll worth it to win pick it up only 99 cents and enjoy it!!!!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is a great way to deliver to the awaiting Aliens fans.<br />Greed and the search for the engineers of the human race.<br />Plenty of room for more prequaling here.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|FIVE STARS JUST CAUSE IT ROCKED<br /><br />Oh and Percy is way better than Jason.  Way better. So much better than Jason.  But Leo is my favorite.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|The sultry songstress dips into tthe classics with style and song to delight your senses with her gift of piano playing and singing.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I'm not big on these typical, same as every other romance novels, but this one made me tear up in joy at the end. I was so involved in the characters and swept up in their story. Excellent character development and storytelling by Ms. Kelly. I will definitely be telling friends to read this one.
B007X4ECMI|3.0|I just saw the movie for me I have mix feelings. The actors were good but the plot was weak. The other thing I did not care for was how many times they used fowl language. Beside these things I just said the movie was alright.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|One of the best movies with all the characters.  Look forward to a sequel.  Tony Stark really brings the movie together.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ordered the complete saga for my son for Christmas.  He loved it and MOM was a hit and he loved it!
B00992CF6W|2.0|Going from the xbox to the Kindle Fire is quite different.  I downloaded this for my kids to play on the road as they play the xbox version at home and they were unable to figure it out and when they did, they did not like this version stating the controls are difficult, the screen hard to maneuver around, and that they can not build that much stuff.  Just overall harder.<br />Kids ages range from 7-13 that feedback is from.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter is definitely my favorite application to use on the Kindle Fire HD. It's my favorite social media tool and glad to have it.
1600595871|5.0|This book is awesome!  The instructions are clear, the techniques are inovative and I have used the techniques in quite a few gifts and cards.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|This is a great app to have for reviewing and sharing your favorite type of news content. It's very simple to use and I like the layout.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Once I figured out all its features I have come to us it everyday.  I love the Plans the most, I find that I do 2 and 3 at a time.  I recently found the word search ability so now I don't have to go to my desktop for that.  And one more thing,  my church has wifi so I can use it there.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is one of the best movies! A perfect way to end the trilogy. The Dark Night Rises keeps you on your toes until the very end.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was very well written. I had to check that it was fiction. That being said,the book was very informative, especially if you have a loved one who has this terrible disease. The patient's loneliness described by the author was so touching.
B003P2WO5E|2.0|Sanderson has created an interesting original world. The series has potential, and I really do think that the next book may actually get much better.<br /><br />But it is sooo slooow! It almost felt like a quarter of the book was a philosophy lecture, and another quarter was devoted to inner turmoil. You could have shaved off 200 pages easy, and would have had a better book for it.  This is a long book with chapters devoted to a ton of characters.  I get the feeling that there just might be as many as 10 major protagonists this series will eventually focus around.  Seems a bit much to me.  The author really jumps between them from chapter to chapter in a somewhat jarring manner.<br /><br />I had an issues with names in the book too. So many names sound similar that I found it pretty annoying. Most times I don't notice that kind of thing, but it really jumped out in this novel. Sanderson also gets the award for the worst name I have ever seen put to the page.  One of the main characters dead wives is named, I kid you not, \\"Shshshsh\\".  I wish I had the paperback, because I almost threw my e-reader against the wall when I read it. Brad...really? What the heck is wrong with you? What is wrong with your editor? Man that pissed me off. My time and money is worth more than to be shoveled word slop like that.<br /><br />Honestly, about half the book is just boring. There are simply hundreds of pages where nothing really happens.  Only in the last quarter did I really start seeing the potential for this series. I only finished it out of a combination of determination and masochism. That said, I do think the series is going to get better going forward, and I just might buy the next book. I have no idea why so many people have given this 4 and 5 stars...they gotta be fake. Maybe I can see 3. In fact I was originally going to give the book 3 stars, but writing the review reminded me of all the things I really disliked about it, so I had to lower it.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|I loved this book.  It's very conceptual but uses a number of Steve Jobs presentations to illustrate how to accomplish the concepts. I'm going to admit it seemed so easy but it's much more difficult to accomplish with my presentations.  However, this book provides a great road map to make huge improvements to any presentation.
0425264351|5.0|I think I read this one already but will start again.  If it has been long enough since I read it I can read it again -- One of the advantages of getting old.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|after enjoying the movie, I purchased this kindle book for my husband, who had not read the series previously.<br />It is now part of our collection, and soon I will read it again.
0446573027|5.0|I discovered I had read this already so will be donating it to our transitional living facility for the guests to read.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Who can't love the muppets? Grandkids loved it! And the adults in the room enjoyed it just as much as they did.
1455519006|5.0|It came sooner than I expected and as always with David Baldacci books I enjoy them thoroughly and can't put them down.  But now I have finished it and will have to find something else to read.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|The Complete Sherlock Holmes (The Heirloom Collection) is better  than words can say. I just can not stop reading this classical story.
B003HZW26U|5.0|If there were more stars I would give it a 10!  I loved this book so much I ended up buying a couple of more copies for people I care for - my brother who is a Nascar fan and the friend who gave us our dog Sully (a very wise dog who I am sure is back after other trips. . .)
B009B50QOU|5.0|One of the best albums of 2012. Green day delivered another top album. Great for Green Day fan, or alternative rock music lover. Go grab it you will love it.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game looked fun but its just a copy of minecraft minus the part about harmless modeml. I think what would make this game better is time and monsters not animals over all it sucked.
B005AERS74|5.0|Marroon 5, awesome, great music for any music lovers. Great for any Marroon 5 fan or any one whom likes pop, rock music.
B008518MOW|5.0|This film was great in it's 3D visual effects. I like the subject/story line of the Men In Black movies, and this one was very well done. For those of us that are into 3D, this purchase was well worth the money, exciting and even better viewed on my home set, where the popcorn is cheaper, than in the theater.
030746363X|2.0|Why is this book so big if the title contains the words 4-hour?<br />Should be much shorter (as in mini-book).<br />As a woman I found the 15-minute O section out of place, unromantic, and inaccurate. He sites studies that were done in the sixties (Kinsey, etc.). Most womn have figured it out by now and don't want some 4-hour nut grinding on them for 15 minutes.<br />I repeat ugggh.
B005HP2JAM|2.0|This film is in 3D, one of few available. While some may find the subject matter interesting, it bored me to sleepiness.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|this is a great tuner that is very durable. though it is plastic it is as nice as the $100 competitors. would recommend to everyone
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Seem that game have colourful and exciting background. Furthermore, the easy gameplay made we fell that we can enjoy in the end. No need some special skills we can easy win. The more stage com the more difficulty we meet. Grate
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game,  it has a unique and original storyline and keeps you on your toes, in suspense.  Great graphics,  and the game is just challenging enough to make you think...
B002OSXDAU|5.0|This novel is amazingly written. I can't wait to get some free time so I can continue reading it. The author said in the introduction &#34; My basic test for any story is: Would I want to meet these characters and observe these evens in real life? Is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself &#34; Well, I thought when I read this paragraph, that I will use the very same test to evaluate this story &#34;The fountainhead&#34; and I answered all the questions the author asked above with a big YES. I recommnd everyone to read it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easy to use. Easy to repin. Easy to create new pin. I am addicted! Have found so many ideas. Very happy with app and site.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just love the book theres nothing else to say but u should read it. LOVE IT!!!!! Give it a try
B002NVTSGQ|1.0|I was surprised that this show has so many favorable ratings. I thought it was cheesy and awkward. Some parts were funny and the concept of the show is great but the execution is horrible. I feel like they exagerated all the stereotypes of the characters and none of the relationships seemed believable. Waste of my time.
B007BVOF8E|5.0|This is a thinking persons movie so if you like only mindless action, this is not for you. I thought was really well done and a great story. I would recommend it if you like complex and intriguing plots and movies with a little more substance than the traditional action-but-limited-story blockbuster type movie.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is laugh-out-loud funny! Especially recommended for fans of SNL and 30 Rock, and career-minded women. Three more words required.
B008YKRRI6|4.0|Here are alternative recordings of Beethoven symphonies 3,5 and 7 as well as recordings of the Creatures of Prometheus and Grose Fuge which to my knowledge have not been available before. There are alternative recordings of some overtures as well, with a total of at least 2 cds' worth of previously unavailable recordings. The remastering sounds better than that on some 'Great Recordings of the 20th Century' discs I already owned, and the price is hard to beat. Grab it while you can, in today's 'here today, deleted tomorrow' classical recording environment.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Even though we know the story, it is impossible to put the book down.  Once again this generation can appreciate that we've never been in a war.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The best that can be said about this book is that it's hands down better writing than the first one, although that's kind of like saying a chimp in front of a typewriter can write better than an orangutan. What disappointed me is that I expected this book to be kinkier than Book 1, and it is not. SPOILER ALERT HERE.<br /><br />Similar to book 2 of Twilight, in this book, after breaking up with Christian, the narrator (she's so boring I've forgotten her name) gets back together with him, and they try to find \\"love.\\" The sex scenes become much more generic and vague (except for one scene where they go back to his \\"playroom\\"). The book also becomes much sappier. Meanwhile, the narrator continues to be a complete idiot (not realizing Christian is in love with her), although she trips and says \\"Jeez\\" less often than in the first book, which is a blessing.<br /><br />I can only imagine a lot of women are viewing this book as \\"romantic\\" because she helps Christian get over his sad tormented past. A few plotlines that seemed like they might lead to suspense/action led to nothing much. Talk about plain vanilla....yawn. I do not read romance novels, so maybe that's why I found this about as interesting as reading a box of generic Hallmark cards.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|this movie was not good. The picture is so dark all the time and the plot was week. Remakes are never very good.
1607066017|5.0|this book recieved in a sealed package, new clean no damage very nice book, all books should be shipped this way
B009ERK1T0|5.0|They don't make music as good as this anymore. Deftones blew my mind with this dark, heavy album. Recommended to any metal/ heavy rock lover out there.
1607060027|5.0|good  read fun book came packaged well, no damage, gave it to me son to read, he loved it Thanks
B0097EWK3A|1.0|I cannot download this Hidden Object game to my KIndle Fire. Have had trouble with other games also. the one game I was able to download was pretty good, so would like to try others, but not if I keep having trouble.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I saw this movie awhile back and bought it for my mother in-law who is into cooking after she retired. I have always been a Meryl Streep fan and personally liked Amy Adams quite a bit. However, when I watched the film, I was really fascinated by all of the Julia Child's part and got more and more irritated by the other protagonist, Julie Powell. Amy Adams remains to be a wonderful actress, but all of the whines and complains of Julie Powell are just annoying. I loved how Julia Child's uplifting spirit just brightens up the film and wish it's just about her alone!
0399226907|5.0|I ordered several books for my kids for Christmas and as baby shower gifts. I wanted books that reminded me of my childhood and that I think are classics. This book arrived with no problems.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Excellent shipping, This movie is way funny and if you grew up with Alvin as I did you will love this next adventure of Alvin.

B005LAIGW8|3.0|Great shipping, but we were not impressed with this movie. It felt like a let down from the first Ghostrider. First one was much better.
0805047905|5.0|I ordered several books for my kids for Christmas and as baby shower gifts. I wanted books that reminded me of my childhood and that I think are classics. This book arrived with no problems.
B00866JL96|5.0|another great movie  and excellent movie would highly recommend to others and this is a keeper. Really like Nicholas Sparks movies.<br />Great shipping.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|It was OK. Liked the cast, but  the story was a bit weak. It is still interesting and has some good messages about what to expect and not to give up on life as you get older.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was a gift for our granddaughter as she loved Tinkerbell, She loved it and has added it to her collectuon. A sure hit for your Tinkerbell fans.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved this book. Started out slow but once I got into it I couldn't put it down. Really enjoyed it.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Granddaughter loved it, one more thing off her list. She loves country music and knows what she wants. Thank you.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a good book and I think should write more book's because I have read all your book's because they were all good book's.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It's definitely not an *easy* read. It doesn't kick into action until halfway, setting off with more than a dozen character arcs. If it was anyone but JK Rowling, I might have given up. But, I'm really glad I didn't, because the book is rewarding. The characters are deep, full of nuance. Everyone is a villain and a hero and deeply flawed, utterly, richly human.<br /><br />The book builds up momentum slowly at first, but once it gets going it becomes a tornado of emotional force.<br /><br />I'm going to read it again in a month or so, this book has layers that will need several readings to uncover I think.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|This book shows the power of love, fear, and hate.  It shows brilliant text for young and old children or adults.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Very enjoyable movie! I would recommend watching, it sends some very good messages to live by. Another great movie by Pixar.
1400067820|4.0|Nassim Taleb in famous for his easy-to-read books on complex market issues.  [...] is his web site.  Trying to explain Fragile vs Robust economic entities, he added Anti-Fragile to describe a perhaps more optimal entity that is not easily broken, but also not so robust that it never learns to adapt to stresses.  So adding new name gives focus to the book,for comparing many physical, economic, corporate, or governmental entities.  Mandelbrot, Taleb, and Sornette are my favorite writers on bubbles, and other \\"rare but dangerous\\" events.  Better than reading \\"how to\\" books on stock investment or trading.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|my son (who is 4 years old) plays with it for hours. He is obsessed with angry birds and just loves this game.
B005LAII8K|1.0|I'd love to buy this blu-ray disc, but refuse to use Ultraviolet which is annoying at best. The ultraviolet digital copy is far less useful or convenient compared to the much easier to use iTunes based Digital Copy. I hope the distributor gets the message and reissues this movie with iTunes Digital Copy.
B009H442DG|5.0|Loved them in Grease and loved them on this recording.  Old favorites and great new songs.  This was my Christmas present to me.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey<br /><br />this book is poorly written, and has the maturity level of a thirteen-year-old.  there is no plot, and endless descriptions of sex (oh my) don't make interesting reading
B0040IEVOE|5.0|I love this show.  I has everything.  Action, scares and handsome guys and the story line is riveting.<br />Welcomed in 2013 watching episodes.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|I loved this movie!! I definitely recommend it! If you have been married for at least 10 years, you will appreciate it!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game :) can't wait for #2. I wish there were a lot more hidden object games like this one, all the others I've found are far too easy or really lame or both
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is by far the best book of this subject that I have ever read! Kudos!<br />I am so getting the next one...now'
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|This is, by far, the best game I've found for the Kindle Fire.  If you miss the old fashioned Sierra type adventure games, like King's Quest, this is as close as you will come to one for your Kindle.  Not free but well worth paying for.  More of these, please!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game.  But it very frustrating to play.  I REFUSE to invest in buying the tools needed to play the game for more than 5 minutes at a time. I do not have internet access(on a daily basis) and do not participate in facebook, so I may never be able to complete some quests. It is disappointing to purchase a game for a hand held device like my kindle that cannot be used independently once it is loaded.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I'm not a big phone gamer as they are usually pretty deriative, until now. This is what fun is supposed to be like!

B004LWZWGK|1.0|This movie sucked... Already wasn't a Batman fan and this just gave me a better reason why I shouldn't be. This movie was 90% talking and 10% slow paced old man fighting. Horrible Movie!!! Don't waste your money!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game has been very fun.  The kids really get into it and even though you are trying to kill off the world it is kind of interesting and a bit of learning at the same time.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|It feels like it is written by a high school student.  The story is simple minded.  I had to stop reading it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book in 1 day.  I couldn't put it down.  Great series. Wish there were more books in the series.
B003I55BIA|4.0|Great read. Loved the storyline and the characters. I really loved hearing the story told by both Brittany and Alex.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great final book.  It was a little slow moving but overall it was a great book and an end to a great trilogy!
B00005Y23E|5.0|Can never get enough of Bob Marleys music.<br />Disc 1 of course all his great hits, Disc 2 pretty darn good covers.<br />Cant beat it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read this book twice already and I might read it one more time.  I just couldn't get enough of this book.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|The first couple chapters were a little tough to get through.  It turned out to be a great book!! Enjoy!
B009GXHOW4|4.0|This app is pretty good!  I would not rate it 5 &#9733;s because like Minecraft Pocket Edition tm more... but I can see why people like it!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The moment I started reading Hopeless, I was hooked. I read it in just over 24 hours. Im not sure how to even put words to the emotions that were portrayed through the characters of this book. It was so well written that you can see every facial expression, every conversation and setting, every flash back to that sad, lonely little girl that was trapped and hopeless in her past. One thing I would like to say about this book is the motive for the kidnapping. I really didnt even have to read the confession of her Mom to know the truth behind her Moms actions and who she actually was. Other than that what a great read. Two thumbs up for Colleen Hoover!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Decent book. Still took dome time to get into this one. They all seem to start off slow for some reason
B003QO8TOQ|5.0|it's okay
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved it couldn't put the book down.  Can't wait to start the next book very gripping story line. Love story hidden
B0086700CM|5.0|Having so much fun with this game.  So addicting - hard to stop!<br />Would definitely refer it to friends :)
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|The best combination of cast members from the original London, the Broadway, and the international casts, as well as Lea Salonga as Eponine, plus the extra excitement, and energy, and emotion of a live recording. There's just more passion and fire here than can be achieved in any studio recording, and the cast is so good that the performances only benefit from the setting. Plus you get the awesome encore numbers.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I chooses this rating cuz I like the other books in the series better, but it was a pretty good book also I think I didn't like it as much than dork diaries is cuz he's a boy and the other is a hurl and girls are really pretty and awesome!!!
0446554995|5.0|Two Graves makes me very glad that I've followed Agent Pendergast from the very beginning starting with Relic. This recent book pulls together several threads from Pendergast's world, and introduces elements that we know are the seeds for future intrigue. And judging from the way two of the characters in this novel have gently brushed aside their moments for romantic involvement, the Riverside mansion mystic will live on. I can't wait for the next book!!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|SLAMMED is really great. Well written and you really understand the characters. So glad that the story continues. I think I read some where it's being made into a movie.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|The story line is predicable, which was one of the reasons I chose it. I was also looking for great acting. It seems this was the piece where everyone said lets relax and just have fun working together. So the acting is average. The movie felt long. Have seen better romantic comedies.
1595826971|4.0|This book is definitely one to buy if you are interested in the development of a video game. Although there could be more information about the process (hence my 4 stars), this book is chock full of inspiration and beautiful, beautiful art. The different variations of Alice's dresses alone are stunning. People forget that lots of work goes in to video games. We're in a golden age of video game art, and this book is a testament to that.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Its enjoyable, easy, predictable story with singing.  The acting is average, but the voices are great. Perfect for a relaxing movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Other than intense..and amazing..and wow, I finished this book in 24 hours, crying my eyes through the last half of it. This is a MUST READ!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This mystery is not written in the cloake and dagger style. I'm  about 1/3 of the way through the book and I have no clue as to the actual crime, let alone &#34;who donit.&#34;
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Slow in some aspects but keeps your interest for the most part.  Another movie focusing on the word &#34;retirement&#34;; just like Batman and Bond this year.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Intricate and intriguing story. I hope some new installments are available soon. Some nice discoveries towards the end but still a lot of questions. Maybe I should have waited until the series was finished. Good read though.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I use this app all the time with my younger students in language therapy.  It's a great way to encourage critical thinking at an early age.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|Good adaptation of the classic Ayn Rand novel, but there is only so much a film maker can do with a book like The Fountainhead.  Gary Cooper gave a 5 star performance, Patricia Neal 4 star.  Ayn Rand fans (like me) won't be disappointed.
0061120081|5.0|It's true, when I was in school To Kill a Mockingbird was the only book that I was ever grateful my teachers made me read. Of course we had to read Catcher in the Rye, Of Mice and Men, Grapes of Wrath, etc, but none of these books ever spoke to me the way that this one did. I fell in love with the characters, time period, the conflicts that arose from wanting to do what is right when everyone is telling you to do what you know is wrong, and the perspective of this turbulent time in history from the eyes of a young girl named Scout. It's truly a classic that will never die.
B00942Y0TM|4.0|Being the father of a 3-year-old, I've recently become reacquainted with Disney classics and new films. Tangled holds up to its predecessors as a fun movie that can interest and engage an adult as well as a child. My kid has watched it at least 25 times.<br /><br />Good stuff - good music and animation, lighthearted action that doesn't stress a kid too much, recognizable stars handling voices, very funny in parts<br /><br />Bad stuff - if you want to avoid exposing a kid to violence, you might want to watch this one on your own first. People getting clocked in the head by a frying pan is an ongoing plot point. Also, I have a friend who claims the goal of all Disney films is to get kids to hate their mothers. This one may be a prime example of that theory (although the villain isn't actually Rapunzel's mother).<br /><br />We got the film via streaming HD and have watched via a Roku, iPad, and iPhone. All platforms work well with this service. I wish more Disney films were available through this means.
0439813786|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with the story of Hugo Cabret. Even though it is an illustrated story meant to capture the attention of young readers, it's story is truly meant to touch people of all ages. Hugo is an orphan, who finds himself alone managing the clock at the train station were he lives. Hidden within the safety of the walls of the station, he is able to observe those who spend their days at the station, particularly the man who runs a booth for repairing mechanical toys and instruments. It is through an encounter with this man as he tries to steal parts for an unusual mechanical man, that Hugo's real adventure begins. It is an adventure that will not only allow him to find friendship and healing, but also allow him to help heal someone else who is broken just as much as his mechanical man. This is a touching and heartwarming story I encourage everyone to read.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|If you like Norah Jones more recent stuff, this is absolutely some of the best she's done.  If you like the really early stuff, maybe not so much.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I felt like the book started off slowly but once the action and suspense picked up I couldn't put the book down.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|While I really enjoyed this book it took me a few chapters to get used to the writing style of the author. I found it a little disconnected - short and incomplete sentences. But once I got past that I enjoyed the Reacher character and the story. There wasn't a ton of surprises but I didn't see one of the characters being the bad guy...though I should have. I appreciated that the romantic interest wasn't super detailed or graphic. I'll definitely be looking for more of his books.
B005S9EK1S|4.0|Love the movie - could watch it over & over again.  A bit disappointed though with this UltraViolet Digital Copy.  I was excited for the price and assumed I'd be able to put this on my iPod for when I travel into Boston on a regular basis, but it's not compatible with your iPod.
1934030198|4.0|I bought this after running into recommendations for this book in a number of different locations around the web while training for my first IM race.  I had already bought and read Going Long also by Joe Friel and if you are training for a 140.6 distance race then that is the book you want as it goes into more specific detail about the special needs for a race of that distance.  However, if you are doing shorter distances of sprints up to HIM races and you are new to the sport of Triathlon then this is a great book and reference.  It goes into the theory of training and gives training guidelines.  The most important chapter is the last chapter on Nutrition.  I am happy I bought this book even though I have a more thorough book on what I am interested in and I would definitely buy it again.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love the ease of getting face book on my kindle and how fast it is to post and see what everyone is doing
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed the storyline, it kept me intrigued. The graphics were amazing and loved the help of the monkey. I think the puzzles should have been more challenging and the entire game only took a couple of hours to complete.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Gillian Flynn knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat. In this novel, she again doesn't disappoint - dark, unlikeable, but ultimately redeemable characters, an unsolved mystery and a few coincidences that make your mind reel.<br /><br />Although the ultimate conclusion left me slightly unsatisfied, the storyline nevertheless thrills and unnerves- which is what I have come to expect from Ms Flynn.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Led Zep rocks!!<br /><br />and this CD/DVD set captures them in all of their glory w/Jason Bonham rocking on the drums!!!
0307341542|4.0|I really enjoy Gillian Flynn's writing style. She has a fresh, uncompromising voice and she doesn't flinch away from the gory, unsettling or disturbing aspects of society.<br /><br />Not recommended for those who are easily shocked, this book deals with some unsettling issues, but never gratuitously. The main character, although not particularly nice, is brought to life so vividly that she will endure in my mind for a long time still.<br /><br />This book was just as satisfying to read as her other 2 novels to date, Gone Girl and Dark Places, and I look forward to reading more of Ms Flynn's novels in future.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I'm getting 60 fps on Black Ops ii, ON MAX SETTINGS! I have an MSI HD 7770 and 8 gigs of ram.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This book captured my imagination and my heart within a few pages. The journey Harold starts and which, unbeknownst to him, will ultimately lead him to a rediscovery of compassion, kindness, love and humanity makes for a heart wrenching read. Not only does it speak of the hurt humans are capable of inflicting on the ones we care about most, but it also comments brilliantly on how people can be so utterly self-absorbed and self-involved that the bigger picture of the initial goal is completely lost.<br /><br />Highly recommended read, for its uplifting and thought provoking message.
141659521X|5.0|We love Vince Flynn! This new book is just as great as the last. We love Mitch Rapp and we want to see the movies start coming for this series. Action, adventure, fast paced and entertaining love to read his latest adventure.
B008B3MZNI|5.0|We loved it. The sound and picture quality were great.  But most importantly the performance was phenominal. Looking forward to more Blu-ray rock n roll performances of 70's.
B000T433CO|4.0|There is something about this movie that makes me smile. The laughter the reality of the story, the people and their attraction to each other and to helping others. The crazy situations we get ourselves into and we discover more of who we are. It is a cute story with a good story line.
1416955070|5.0|I read it during the holidays and loved every page!<br />Yes, the style is a bit simple, but the plot is full of new ideas and witty remarks. I recommend it if you're looking for something easy and relaxing.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another awesome.effort by Connelly involving Harry Bosch. Couldn't wait to read it but waited to get it for Christmas and now look forward to the next installment.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My final review of 2012 and it's ending on a high note. Wow what a keeper. 5 wonderful, amazing Hopeful Stars.<br /><br />I started this book late before bed one evening. I was immediately hooked even though I knew nothing about Sky and Holder or their amazing story that was to come. All I know is I stayed awake until 4:00am reading even though I had to get up and go to work the next morning.<br /><br />Hopeless made me wish I was 18 yrs old again and had a Dean Holder in my life. He just may be perfect despite a few rough edges and mood swings. But it's all good...he's all good...he is so so good. My goodness the build up to the best first kiss ever had this old-enough-to-be-his-mom tingly with anticipation.<br /><br />I liked Sky right from the get go. Smart, a reader, a runner and totally unplugged from the technological age...no tv, no cell phone no internet...it seemed almost impossible to imagine in this day and age. And yet it totally made sense as the story unfolded.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about how much I loved Holder who seemed to be a bad boy, with a bad rep which he may or may not deserve.<br /><br />From a chance meeting at a grocery story, to the evening visits through the bedroom window so reminiscent of Joey and Dawson from Dawson's Creek, to the best first kiss ever, to the simple gesture of a pinkie's only hand hold *dreamy sigh*, so many things made me fall in \\"like\\" with Holder right along with Sky. And the meaning of the Hopeless tattoo...I didn't see that one coming or the poignancy behind it's meaning.<br /><br />But it's not all sunshine and rainbows for these two. There are devastating secrets being kept and the heartbreak and life altering changes they bring once revealed.<br /><br />I read this book at work, I read it in my car waiting for the Mall to open and I put real life aside until I turned the last satisfying page. I love it when a book absorbs me mind, body and soul. It's the reason I love to read. It's the reason I loved Hopeless.opeless.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Nothing new was added to the story. I would not bother with this unless you are RE fan, and even then only if you are bored.
B000FC10WU|4.0|This is a nice little Miss Marple story, written as a sort of joke, I think. There are a few cases of meta-humor, including Miss Marple saying she'd never be clever enough to write detective stories and a little boy mentioning he has Agatha Christie's autograph. The mystery is solid and the story is good.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a fun cool game and I could play it all day if I could but it takes longer to get coins
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Wolverine, the most popular of the X-Men and one of the most popular comic book characters in comic book history is also one of the shortest. According to thirty plus years of continuous publication, Logan - AKA wolverine - is 5'2\\" tall and somewhere around 200 lbs, with metal infused skeleton and claws, and a back as hairy as a Kodiak bear. When X-Men director Bryan Singer cast a slim 6'3\\" song-and-dance man named Hugh Jackman to play the short stocky Wolverine, comic book geeks everywhere said \\"What the f***?\\"<br /><br />Now anyone familiar with the Jack Reacher novels written by Lee Child knows that main character of the novels is a 6'5\\" 250 pound blond haired blue eye bruiser with the face of a professional rugby player. And likewise anyone who read the novels must have said \\"What the f***?\\" upon learning that the diminutive Tom Cruise was cast to play Jack Reacher. \\"He's too small. He's too Pretty.\\" My wife, who's a huge fan of Lee Child's novels, was so irritated with the casting choice that she refused the see the movie.<br /><br />For those of you not familiar with Lee Child's novels, the title character is military veteran who hobos around America with nothing but the clothes on his back and the money in his pocket. He avoids relationships, responsibilities and even posessions that might tie him down. He doesn't even own a suitcase. When his clothes get dirty he throws them away and buys new cloths. He rides from town to town on Greyhound busses. He generally minds his own business, but always seems to find himself at the center of a mystery or conspiracy that requires his investigative instinct and brutal hand-to-hand skills to solve.<br /><br />The movie begins with a sniper shooting down four people in Pittsburg. The evidence quickly points to James Barr, a former Army sniper with a disturbing past. But maybe the evidence points at Barr too quickly. No sooner is Barr taken into custody when his is beaten nearly to death by other convicts and left in a coma. Now the mystery becomes one of whether Barr will even come out of his coma to be put on trial. Enter Jack Reacher, a former military policeman who despises Jack Barr from their shared military history. Reacher is only too willing believe that Barr did the crime he's accused of. But when Local criminals try to take out Reacher, he decides to give the case a 2nd look. Soon he's unraveling a much deeper conspiracy.<br /><br />Well, having just seen Jack Reacher at my local theater, it seems that the miscast Tom Cruise somehow made it work just as a miscast Hugh Jackman made Wolverine work. Cruise is believable as a retired military policeman who really doesn't care and just wants to move on. Tom Cruise may not be my favorite actor (I would have preferred James Caviezal) but he is a superbly skilled actor who knew just how to play the character. The movie also benefitted from a tightly written script which solidly conveys Lee Child's vision of the hardened cynical soldier turned drifter. It also managed to give us just enough backs story without getting bogged down in exposition.<br /><br />One last thing: Jack Reacher sports about the best fight choreography I've seen since Watchmen.  I've had a few years of training in Wing Chun and a couple more in some other styles.  I'm not easily impressed, but the moves Cruise used on the bad guys were a hell of a lot more realistic than most movie viewers will be used to.<br /><br />As for the diminutive Cruise playing the man-giant Reacher...6'5\\"...5'6\\"...what's the difference?ma.

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Don't let your kids see this movie...no matter how much they beg to see the fuzzy, funny bear...  If you do, you should really look yourself in the mirror and reconsider the whole &#34;parent&#34; thing.  Just sayin....
1609611543|4.0|I found this book very informative.  I found the author's viewpoint on the harm of the modified wheat  to be very interesting.  He seems to have carefully researched the harmful effects of today's grains.  I have stoped eating bread, crackers, and cereals as a result of reading this book.  Along with eating less food and drinking less booze, i have dropped about 15 lbs in 5 days less than a month.  I am carefully awaiting long term results.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I watched it as a rental and loved it so much I needed to add it to our colection.  Worth rewatching with friends or alone with a bucket of popcorn and ice cream.  What a wonderful way to age.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Tour de force, one of the best DVDs I have seen, Great acting, direction and scenary, Not historically accurate, but that can be forgiven, for such entertainment,
B00914JWSW|4.0|What else is there to say.  Not her best but it's still Barbra.  If you collect you have to have it.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I LOVE MIB and MIB2.!  I've watched both numerous  times. This was a little disappointing. But you still have to see it!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|There was a lot of action but not really anything for a plot.  Not only that, but they introduced a lot of new story arcs but never really did anything with them.  The plot they did have, wasn't that great.  It just wasn't that good of a movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer was exciting and kept me wondering how the problem would be resolved.  The end fit the situation very well ankept me thinking about it long after I read it.  I would recommend this book the ystery lovers  and those who like Grisham.
0060833459|5.0|I did not know that there are management books that make you think. It remains to be seen whether this (or any) book can actually make you change, but it certainly make great strides in encouraging to change your unproductive habits. It does not shine away from management paradoxes and that is one of its strength. At the end of the book there is a discussion of the distinction between a manager and a leader - it helped me understand why Romney lost.
B00846REIS|5.0|Good read, like 50 shades but a little bit more psycho stalker like!  Worth the $10! Onto the next in the series
B009P5S11G|4.0|As a fan of both explicit and non-explicit music/ things; I can appreciate Rhi Rhi.... This album is not as good as \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" (I think any album will have a tough time beating that), \\"Rated R\\", or \\"LOUD\\", but, the overall delivery is better than \\"Talk That Talk\\" . I can listen to 85% of the album with no major issues.... Loveeee Song took awhile to get into, but, i 'love' it and Future's voice fits it.... Actually all the songs with features are good.... Pour It Up, Diamonds, Half of Me, What Now, Stay, and Love Without Tragedy (though a little short) are amongst my faves.... Any Rihanna fan should add this to their collection.....!<br />P.S. I do agree that she can do without the use of the 'N' word...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Couldn't put it down. An interesting twist on the \\"married in Vegas\\" concept that was enjoyable and unpredictable. Would and have already recommended it to friends.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This is my favorite Wes Anderson movie yet.<br />It arrived in time and the disc was in place in its case when I opened it -extra yay.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I thought that this book was very detailed. It helped me a lot. I am a lot more resourceful now. Thank you for making this book.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This was a nice game overall. The premise was interesting and the story well told. I would have liked it was a little longer or a little more challenging. But at a buck and a quarter, it is money well spent for a couple hours of low stress diversion.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This is a great tool for everybody. I will most definitely use it. I recommend teachers getting these books for their students. I chose to put four stars, because it was very well detailed, but I didn't put the fifth star, because this book was really long and had a lot of really hard words. Other than that, I enjoyed it a lot. I am a lot smarter now. You might think this is funny, but I am all about school. I love it a lot. We have a lot of good times there. When I say  we I mean me and my friends.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|So far seems very nice.  Like tones for waking.  Not sure how to set white noise, then go back to clock screen.  Would like choice of 24 hour setting, but it was free and you take what is there.  Free is always nice.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I just wish more was available for me to watch. Will be waiting for the next season to come out!
B001QOGYBI|1.0|I love movies!  We watch lots of them as a family but this one was a HUGE disappointment.  I could barely stand to finish it!  This movie was purchased for my daughter for Christmas and it was so raunchy that I wouldn't let them watch it!  Just because you substitute the word \\"CUSS\\" for horrible swear words does not make it a family friendly movie!!!  The movie itself was quality made but it was just HORRIBLE!
B000F8O2PG|5.0|This was a gift for my brother in China. He couldn't find these last few seasons there --- so sis came to his rescue. He was so grateful as he's a huge fan. Glad I could help.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I kind of get it... I think. It left me a bit unsatisfied. But 95% of the time I was captivated. I am going to read another of Flynn's novels- just to compare.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|If you just like movies with explosions, this is a good one.  My son wanted it for Christmas and he was happy to get it!
B008LH4YYC|3.0|I like this program because it has a lot of other programs to make it faster, but the startup manager wont work because you have to be in root in order to use it. It works great on Kindle fire hd.
B00866JL96|4.0|This movie was ordered as a Christmas gift for our son's wife.  I haven't watched it personally but I did read the book and loved it!  I may have to borrow this one after she watches it.
0807014273|5.0|Top quality, fast delivery, great price.  It is amazing how convenient it is to buy such worthwhile books, and, unlike a library book, you can keep these purchases for future reference and make notes right in your books.

B006O6F932|4.0|Got this for my 7 yr. old granddaughter.  It has a lot of parts to it and folds up nicely and is a fun toy....I just wish it was a little more sturdy when set up.  Definitely a MUST for the girls that love Monster High Dolls !
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like this game.  I love animals so playing a game where you take care of animals is a good one to me.  The only complaint I have is I wish it wouldn't cost so much to rescue the animals.  Other than that this is a fun game.  People of all ages would enjoy this game.
B0034G4P94|4.0|I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this film; I thought the acting was top-notch (especially from Nick Nolte). I also found the training scenes were also very well done.<br /><br />I also have to say that I was not expecting this film to be as good as it was. I was interested in this film from start to finish and the emotional climax was very well done indeed. I strongly recommend this film to all those that would like to enjoy a film that is action packed, well acted and well made.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Like many others this was my first introduction to the Doctor, his T.A.R.D.I.S, and the Whoniverse. Christopher Eccleston really charmed me from the moment he stepped into camera view. Having no Doctor Who background or even an awareness this was a reboot of a series that ran for many many years I stumbled into what is now my favorite show in television history and in all likeliness will never be replaced. I've never witnessed anything so spectacular, creatively explored, and brilliantly written with such an overwhelmingly talented cast. Doctor Who raised the bar and changed my TV watching experience irrevocably!<br /><br />For the last couple of years I've wanted to own season 1 of Doctor Who and BBC America finally made this possible - and I don't think I could be any more happier with this product. It's absolutely FANTASTIC, it really is. I've watched this DVD set many times over and plan on watching it many more. This series includes a lot of cool features like Doctor Who Confidential. Confidential is footage shot from behind the scenes that show the making of each individual episode and has a sit-down with the actors who talk about their characters, the sets, makeup, and the Doctor Who story itself. It's really interesting to see where and how they film the show. They also let you peek at the creative process behind making the special effects and even let you see some of the alien/monster makeup application. Some bonus material included are actor interviews and commentary with hours of exciting features not seen elsewhere! It's such a delight to see the behind-the-scenes with Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper - they are every bit exciting off-screen as they are on-screen!! That alone should be worth making this purchase easy because you completely get your money's worth!<br /><br />If you're looking for the best that television has to offer look no further because Doctor Who is it! The stories are compelling and complex yet simple enough to understand and thoroughly enjoyable. There's nonstop action, aliens, otherworldly creatures, fantastical worlds, top-notch acting, crazy plot twists, not-to-mention the British wit that will have you laughing out loud at the very cleverness that's presented. Spot-on EVERYTHING! This rebooted series is the beginning to what is one of the best shows on TV, assuredly you won't be disappointed. You'll immediately want to watch the following series as they only get better and better, and that's the biggest understatement. DO NOT skip the Ninth Doctor Christopher Eccleston because he's incredible and integral to the series as a whole. His portrayal of the Doctor is amazing and his adventures with Rose are the start of a bond unbroken by time and you'll fall in love with them both. Whovians if you don't own this series already then what are you waiting for?! & If you're new it's never too late to become a fan, and trust me upon watching this season you will be!thoroughly enjoyable. There's nonstop action, aliens, otherworldly creatures, fantastical worlds, top-notch acting, crazy plot twists, not-to-mention the British wit that will have you laughing out loud at the very cleverness that's presented.

Whovians if you don't own this series already then what are you waiting for?! & If you're new it's never too late to become a fan, and trust me upon watching this season you will be!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Doesn't work on my kindle fire hd. So glad I didn't pay for it. I keep running into this game it's a shame I can't play.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I actually realized while reading that I was laughing and crying in various parts. Glad I didn't give up after the first book. Definitely getting the third!
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I really liked this movie. It was fast paced and a good addition to the Bourne series. Much better than I expected.
B004BSFC46|5.0|my daughter loved the rattles for connor it was brigh a will help him find his hands and feet  was perfect for what i wanted

B003ZMF26W|5.0|The mouse was much better quality than I had anticipated. Personally, it fits very well in the palm of my hand and I love the instant dpi control. I've never owned a gaming mouse before, but so glad I have one now not only for gaming, but it makes my ease of access on my laptop that much faster and maneuverable.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This is one of those slightly off beat but fun films.  Not great but fun to watch.  Johnny Depp is his usual self, very entertaining.
B008CJ0KEM|4.0|First of all, let's get this out of the way: this is a really fun, really well-made TV show. Assuming that you don't have a problem with the premise (and that you're not expecting HBO/Showtime levels of nudity -- this is a regular cable show), there is a lot to love in Lost Girl. The premise is clever, the cast is talented and it has a very good mix of stand-alone and serialized story lines. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />The only downside to this season on Blu-ray is the set of bonus features included: they are *lame*. No commentaries, and the cast/crew interviews are edited to be nothing more than sound bites with absolutely no information whatsoever. Even worse, they are broken out individually with no way to play all of them at once.<br /><br />So: buy this show! -- Just don't expect the Blue-ray version to have anything above what you get from electronic delivery.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|This album is Kanye West at his finest!  Words cannot explain the creativity of this album and the beautiful sound that comes from it! Just give it a listen!
0547564651|5.0|Mr. Tough really nailed an important aspect of child development that we don't give nearly enough attention to in raising our kids. This book is especially important since we have placed so much emphasis on &#34;everyone's a winner&#34; and have created the notion that failure a bad thing and to be avoided at all costs. This is unrealistic and doesn't serve our children well, especially as they grow into adulthood.<br /><br />Mr. Tough notes there are seven character strengths that are directly related to a child's success; grit, self-control, zest, social intelligence, gratitude, optimism and curiosity. He also notes there are key developmental stages where parents can have the most impact in developing these character strengths; the toddler stage and early adolescence (fear not parents if you have pre-teen and early teen-age kids, there is still time to help your kids!).<br /><br />I also applaud Mr. Tough for directly addressing the elephant in the room with respect to education which is poverty, although Mr. Tough further demonstrates through numerous examples of how we as a society can help kids become resilient and successful despite their impoverished backgrounds, which directly translates into educational success. And the cost-benefit to society is overwhelming; the better educated a child is, the less likely he/she is to become a ward of the state either through poverty programs or the penal system. And best of all, this isn't some exorbitantly expensive thing to put into use at school and at home. In fact, it would probably help a lot of parents develop little more perseverance too. Mr. Tough further notes these character strengths also have a direct correlation to happiness as opposed to fame and fortune.<br /><br />This is an excellent read for parents, educators and policy-makers who collectively and individually can make an enormous difference in how we can raise our kids to be happy, healthy and successful (in the broader sense) adults.
B005H29GSI|5.0|These games occupy all the play time/free time available for the grand kids.  They love everything &#34;Angry Birds&#34;!<br /><br />I would recommend this for others.
1451695187|5.0|Nota Bene:  I am ASSUMING for the sake of this comment that the account rendered in the book is real, i.e. it is a sincere effort by a real human being with a real MD degree to relate, in good faith,  an experience he believes in good faith that he had.  I am ASSUMING that this book and story are not a cynical fabrication by someone who is looking to fool the gullible, nor an attempt to make a quick buck writing about something that will sell books.  I have not made a *substantial* attempt to verify the existence of Eben Alexander nor to verify his degree and positions.<br /><br />I have not had a NDE myself.  Whatever knowledge I have of them is strictly based on those of other people, often obtained quite indirectly.  The first NDE I had heard about while I was on a retreat in 1968.  It was a \\"negative\\" -- meaning frightening -- NDE.  Eben Alexander's account of a NDE is of particular interest because it occurred in a hospital setting while the subject was under intense scrutiny and because the subject is a neurosurgeon.  That he entered the experience more-or-less as an unbeliever makes it even more interesting.  The book is also interesting about what it says about Eben himself and his family.  He comes across as a very good man who is surrounded by a very loving family.<br /><br />Having said that, I will say that I found his account of his vision (I say \\"vision\\" as his story is an attempt to relate the audio-visual aspects of a memory of an event that was presumably not \\"audio-visual\\" in the usual sense of the word, as his sense organs were not functioning, and the experience no doubt transcended \\"audio-visual-olfactory-tactile\\" experience.) to be a bit amusing.  I say \\"amusing\\" not in a disrespectful way, but to convey the, well, amusement, I guess, of seeing a grown, educated, American man find out, via a truly extraordinary experience which certainly appears to be a gift from God, that which the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches have been trying to tell people for the past 2000 years, and Protestant churches for the past 500:  God is Love.  God LOVES us.  Eye has not seen nor has ear heard what God the Father has in store for us.  God's love is universal.  God transcends what we call time and space.  (Actually, philosophers have been telling us THAT for a VERY long time.)  There are non-corporeal beings who know, love, and serve God.  Evil in the World is a consequence of free will.  Etc. etc.  These are things we all SHOULD have learned in Catechism and had reinforced through our own lives of prayer and particular relationship with God through the person -- at least for Christians -- of Christ Jesus.  That the good Lord saw fit to arrange this particular experience for Dr. Alexander both speaks to the love of God, and to the difficulty Man has discerning His purpose in particular instances.<br /><br />While his experience and vision are extremely interesting, there are no surprises for a Christian, and probably none for a Jew either.  (I am not sure how most Muslims would think of this, so I won't try to guess.)  Also, Eben's NDE was tailored for his particular needs, apparently, as appears to generally be the case for the more credible NDEs. He saw and heard (and felt and was made aware of and was infused with) the things to which he, in particular, needed to be so exposed.<br /><br />Regarding the book itself: it is an easy read, but very moving.  Toward the end I found myself blubbering like a baby, as I related to an experience one of his sons had.  There is something like a surprise ending that, of course, I will not reveal.<br /><br />The book makes some recommendations in terms of websites (including one started by Dr. Eben Alexander and an associate) for those who wish to learn more about NDEs and other spiritually transforming experiences.  He also includes a book list that is quite broad in its scope.  It includes books by the Dali Lama, Douglas Hofstadter (a strict materialist),  Francis Collins (a life scientist and a believer) and many others in a variety of fields.  Oddly, his list does NOT include Christian mystics like St. Theresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross, nor anything about Heaven by someone like Peter Kreeft.  I suspect that Dr. Eben Alexander is not familiar with these authors.<br /><br />Buy it.  Read it.  Spend some time on your knees.
B004U52VPS|5.0|These games keep the iPhones out of their hands and action games rumbling.  These games kept them busy when the weather was too bad to get out.<br /><br />I would recommend to others.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Like the game. I am enjoying it on my kindle fire hd.  So far plays very smooth except to pop up in middle of game to rate.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved the imagination of this book...I couldn't stop reading....you grow attached to the main characters and the details of the circus makes you feel as though you're truly there
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The video transmission was pretty clear and good.  We sometimes had to wait for the streaming to catch up .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a basic no frills calculator application for The Kindle Fire that works great for monthly bill figures or grocery shopping or calculating how many miles per gallon my 8 cylinder Dodge truck gets everytime I take a loan out to put gas in it :-( !  It works great, does everything expected!<br /><br />You would think that a calculator would be a standard feature on the Kindle Fire, but I suppose not everyone needs a calculator.  There is a very limited space available for applications on the Fire, so it allows you to choose what applications you are going to install.<br /><br />I love my Kindle Fire, I am able to use it on the go for so many things with the help of applications like this one.  It is such a shame that the &#9733;MORONS&#9733; that designed this thing left out the most important application of all, &#9733;COLECTIONS &amp; CATAGORIES &#9733; So everytime someone asks me about it as an overall tool, I can't recommend it due to the lack of the most important feature you need for an E-reader library.  There are a couple &#9733;PAID&#9733; Applications available now for the Fire that allow you too organize your library but it is like double stepping all the time.  Thank God for the inventors of those Apps they saved me from selling my Fire and going back to the basic Kindle.  If I would have known it did not have this feature I would not have  purchased it at all.<br /><br />I wonder everyday what happened to good ole &#9733;COMMON SENSE&#9733;???  Imagine the library of Congress without a Card Catalog!  It would be like trying to find something in a teenagers Bedroom!
B00AGH6FD8|3.0|the video transmission was unclear at times and broke up.  We sometimes had to wait for the streaming to catch up.
0553801473|5.0|GRRM continues the greatest series ever put to paper. Although not as good as some of the past books it's still above all other novels out there. His style is unmatched and is all his own. Just patiently waiting for the final two installments and hoping they come sooner then later!
B00APUQRPC|3.0|The video transmission was unclear at times and broke up.  We sometimes had to wait for the streaming to catch up.
1558908846|4.0|Judge Dredd was purchased as a gift for my brothers collection. As I said before he collects older unusual movies and I add to his collection often.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game of all time!!!!! I like how they put in a 2 in 1 game. Creative and survival. Epic game!!!!!!!!!!
B000002VCQ|5.0|because I love it. And she was one of my favorite singer .  And those are my favorites songs .
B008BDZOZY|5.0|I really do love this, with all its quirky rhythms, unique uses of the brass bands, clever tonal textures, and of course the blending of voices - David Byrne and St. Vincent, together and alone, are brilliant.  Not a bad song in the bunch, I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.  Every listening I hear something new, something worth listening to again.<br /><br />Yes, I'd recommend it to most of my friends.  In fact, I've sent it as a gift to friends as far away as Europe.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Good dictionary .I would not give it to nobody .I like it  very very very much. I think of it as super
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I think that this book in the hunger games trilogy was second best to the first book. More information towards the end would have been better than dragging the beginning on for so long while describing life in district 13. Overall I think this is an amazing book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love jetpack  joyride because it's fun and easy to play and when your stressed out it makes you feel better and have fun
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I like it. Although yes, it needs way more time. Cuz it took me like 5 mins to finally figure out how to craft. But I still prefer buying minecraft. Its alot better. Totally worth the price. This yes acually worth buying. But the controls are hard to figure out.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is really fun but it takes a long time to get enough coins to upgrade your character I've had this game for a few months and I still haven't been able to upgrade my character
B007XIC1GI|5.0|This book takes a dive into the mind of what most people are afraid to reveal on paper, themselves.  I think each one of us can identify ourselves with pieces of Marilyn Manson if only we were honest with ourselves.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great addicting app. sure does help pass the time and have some fun in the meantime. cant complain to be honest
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Super fun game, but it is not the full game you have to buy to play the full game. I broke down and bought it, I loved it that much. LoL
B005SDDB9Q|5.0|First off, I need to state that, while I like Springsteen and his music, I'm not a \\"Bruce\\" or mega-fan. I have the \\"Live\\" Lp box set and maybe a few CDs (definitely the \\"Seeger Sessions\\"). But I really enjoyed discovering this album containing two live radio broadcasts recorded after his first Lp, but before release of the second one that skyrocketed his career.  The first broadcast is from January 1973 from WBCN-FM in Boston; the second from my local rock radio station - WMMR-FM in Philly, where the late jock (and friend of mine) Ed Sciaky promoted the heck out of Bruce's music. While two songs are repeated here they are significantly different versions. The Boston \\"band\\" was composed of just Gary, Danny and Clarence and sounds more \\"acoustic\\" while the Philly-area gig (from the small - really, maybe 75-90 people in room - \\"folk\\" coffee house, The Main Point) added drummer Vini Lopez and - as you'll heart on the last two tracks (worth the price of admission for these two alone) the band was REALLY reacting with the audience.<br />No the sound is not superb but this isn't a fancy Sony Music production either. (It's an import from the Chrome Dreams folk in the UK) And I'd like to give props to Andrew Muir who fills six of the eight pages in the CD booklet with really insightful notes.<br /><br />True-Bruce fans will want this album - unless there are private tapes out there - and I can recommend this anyone who wants to hear what \\"the boss\\" was like nearly 40 years (can it really be?) ago.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B005I6EVUG|2.0|I bought this case which was listed to work fine with the K3/fire and it worked great until one day I removed the kindle (fire) and lost one strap when putting the cover back on. Maybe I got a defective cover, but not going with the verso covers again anytime soon.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|What are these Amazon reviewers thinking? There may be fine actors but the writing is beyond bad, it is all so canned. Goes to show that it takes much more than good actors to make a great production. I tried to watch this with my wife and her parents (we are in our thirties, they their sixties) and we have diverse tastes in movies -- we all had to stop watching 30 minutes in. Do not waste your time.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|whenever I try to go in the jungle it gets half loaded and then closes otherwise I would rate it much better.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Good series, but not a great as Game of Thrones. I was reading these just to get over the fact that it'll be another few years until the 6th GoT book gets published. xP
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Exclelent flashligth replacement, in perfect condition and good package, good presentation, good accesories and easy instructions for install, you are excellent ideas, thanks for all, have a happy new year
B004I8WD6E|3.0|So, I loved this case when I first got it. It was flexible, relatively easy to take on and off, and let my white iPhone show its &#34;white-ness.&#34;<br />BUT...the case yellows over time. I clean my case regularly with Windex and when held up to a white piece of paper, you can tell its taken on a shade of yellow. o_o;
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this is the best game ever!!!!! I am too nice at this game its so fun!!!!!!! thank you for this game!!!!!
B001LF347E|4.0|A friend suggested this show so we have watched much of Season 1 and I've found it captivating. I'm a fan of \\"The Sword of Truth\\" books if not the rather sad TV series by the same name. This series is head and shoulders above the TV series of Sword of Truth and captured and held my full attention from the beginning. If you've enjoyed Harry Potter or the Sword of Truth books you will enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />The acting, scenery, directing and costumes are convincing and satisfactory. While there may be some casting questions those are of little enough significance to not compromise the total quality of the series. I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.
B00AKS656U|5.0|Great game love the graphics is challenging too. I love the garfield apps and this one is the best thus far. kindle fire hd large screen.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I got this for my husband, who is a historian and loves Doris Kearns Goodwin. He says it's fascinating and very well-written.
B0091REZMW|5.0|nice.<br />nice relaxing on the hopper. gets your mind off the matter at hand. helps make it a smother move if you know what Im talking about.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Played this in the car all holiday season. This artist is new to me. Heard an interview with her on NPR and that's what made me decide to purchase the CD. She has a great voice. Would love to hear more.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed the way the author told the story and how she created the characters.  The author brought the characters to life.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|Not for heavy text editing or using as your main application. Missing many functions that are standard on other products (ex. cut/paste/move, etc.)
B0011UBDTK|5.0|love the fuzzy cover, each season is very well displayed. tons of extra features on the bonus disc... very happy with my purchase!
B004LROMWU|5.0|After hearing really good buzz about this series, I ordered it and I'm glad I did.<br />Big fan of Noah Wyle since ER. Good storyline and great supporting cast.  Sorry to<br />see the character Michael go.  Can't wait for season 2 to become available.
B009ZE27US|1.0|I actually feel dumber for even trying this. It sucks that I have to give it one star because one star is too many.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Adorable, highly entertaining, and surprisingly challenging, Draw A Stickman: Epic delivers. This game is beautifully crafted and a real treat to play. I would have happily paid full price for it, but was thrilled to see it come up as the last FAOTD of 2012. Really pleased to see a holiday level, as well. Looking forward to playing all through the new year. Thanks, Amazon, for paying the price of admission om this one, and wild applause to the creators and developers for providing a solidly fun and beautiful product.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is the best game ever. I am totally addicted and play whenever I get the chance. Getting three stars on every level is tough.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My kids are huge fans of the show and were really excited about the app.  The puzzles are a lot of fun.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|(: (: (:  Great Game!! I could not put it down! Can't wait to see part two. Would recommend !!
B000I186FW|5.0|This movie is the best british movie ever and better than most movies made by Hollywood and it is so deep.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is delightful, charming, has perfect casting and the details for the period are amazing!!! The content and story line is thought provoking and contains much more substance than expected. Excellent all the way around!!!
B002M87V0A|5.0|I watched this because I had an audition for it a few weeks ago and after the audition I STILL could not stop watching it. The movie is truly amazing it's a MUST see movie
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Sorry I took so long to respond.....I was busy playing Angry Birds!<br />It made for a very very Merry Christmas!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Not fun at all since you have to beat certain games to play others. It would be nice if all of the 101 games were actually unlocked and working from the beginning.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I highly recommend Duhigg's book and it's examination of habits at the personal, organizational, and societal levels. Stories are compelling, the information intriguing, and the ideas are very actionable for those seeking to change bad habits or instill new ones.
B005OUARUO|4.0|I like Feist, but wow are these reviews pretentious. I don't need to read elaborate metaphors about how her vocals are like cut glass across your soul. Who talks like that? Feist fans apparently.<br /><br />The album is different than her others, but overall if you're a fan you'll probably get it anyway - which wouldn't be a bad idea anyway.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything you heard about this series is true -- the acting and writing are superb, costuming is amazing.  Well worth watching!
B00A757EFW|1.0|hard to control properly so i deleted it off my kindle it was slow as well !!! wish it was better
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Mix of boring, offensive, immature, with a few good laughs. With so many great movies available, I wish I hadn't wasted my time with Ted.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Cute game. It appears to be made for a child though. I like the other bubble game much better, do I'll stick with that one.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Hope Springs, I loved this movie, parts of it reminded me of my own marriage of 31 going on 32 years and how we grow apart over the years or really just become different people and then need to find why we really are in the marriage and try to get some of the reasons back we started the union to begin with. It made me laugh and cry. I would recommend this to family and friends.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|Eva Green is hot...<br />Otherwise an enjoyable movie with a nod to the original. Nothing amazing here but a good couple hours of entertainment.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Visually beautiful and very useful app!  It includes nice extras like barometric pressure, wind speed and so far it's worked flawlessly.  The animation is lovely as well!
B0053O89XI|5.0|As always, Big Bang Theory continues to be one of my favorite shows. I enjoy that the show has developed beyond two main characters amd that the entire cast continues to play an even larger role in the story development. A creat combination of geeky and nerdy. A show that idolizes science and education. Even my kids love it.
B000N2HCM4|2.0|I found it disappointing that after reading Obama's words, that so many people were still able to convince themselves that this was a work of fiction and with a clear conscience still able to convince themselves to vote for this man as our president of the United States. Baffling. I do recommend that everyone read it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love it ...lots of fun!&quot;enjoyable meeting other people from different States and countries! I would definately recommend this game to all my friends!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Can't believe I waited so long to watch this! Rebel Wilson is hysterically funny! She has so many one liners, I need to watch this 10 more times to catch them all.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really like this book and it might become my second favorite. But it doesn't exactly beat the last straw
B009VSW15Y|5.0|My kindle kindle fire hd did not come pre loaded with a camera. I was automatically going to get one. This was the most expensive but it works the best for sure. Definitely worth it. My favorite app for photos. great detail and lighting. Really great.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love how it is tricky but not deadly I mean its very frustrating if you miss something you flip out.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Vest book in s while couldn't th ask. Fir a better ppl lot to p layout, I loved it alot
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The app is very soothing. I enjoy layerongbthe different sounds. With the full version there are many more sounds available. I recommend the free or full version to anyone wanting a relaxing nap app.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a good book, I would recommend this book to all of y'all outta Der. Blah blah blah blah
B004J64QSI|5.0|My wife and I saw a stage production of Les Miserables several years ago, loved it very much and bought the CD featuring the original Broadway cast right after. Also saw the recent (2012) film, which features drama and realism over pure music, and also like it very much. After watching and listening to this concert on YouTube, I purchased it the same day. It is a superb cast, especially Alfie Boe and Samantha Barks; I believe they are the best Jean Valjean and Eponine yet. Boe's\\" Bring Him Home\\" is the purest, most beautiful I've ever heard and Samantha's \\"On My Own\\" is both beautiful and full of emotion.
B00122V6OE|5.0|Although Counterparts is my favorite album, Presto has my favorite song, &#34;Available Light&#34;. The rest of the album rocks as well, it's one of those albums I could listen to for months without getting tired of it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is very enjoyable.  I have no problems with the ads showing up during the games.  The graphics are nice and the game flows nicely.
B00123B9TU|5.0|For many years 2112 had been my favorite album, but Counterparts is so full of very deep lyrics that most anyone can relate to, and insane guitar, bass, and drums that it took my top spot several years ago. There are songs on this album that make me cry, songs that make me think, and songs that make me get up headbang like I was 16 again! You can't go wrong here.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|How horribly tragic. I guess I hoped for a happier ending somehow. But it was obvious that couldn't be. I hope I don't have nightmares. I will hold my children closer than usual tonight.
B000W1YYEK|5.0|Ok, this album has a mix of some very popular stuff as well as songs only True Rush fans would know. In a way that's a shame because although &#34;Freewill&#34; and &#34;Spirit of Radio&#34; are great songs, no rock fan should live another day without listening to &#34;Natural Science&#34;! Just a note, &#34;Different Strings&#34;, &#34;Jacob's Ladder&#34;, and &#34;Entre Nous&#34;, are fabulous songs as well, you really can't go wrong with Permanent Waves!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I recommend reading the first two books of the trilogy first (I didn't...).  It takes a little while to sort out the characters without having the history from the first two books.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Does anyone out there know how I can get this on a CD? I ordered this online for my mom's Christmas gift but didn't realize it was a DVD set. She listens to her iPod and wanted this desperately on a CD.<br /><br />Thoughts?
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Resembles a hybrid of PS3 and Xbox controllers. Grip material on bottom projection points greatly appreciated during long gaming sessions. It's also deep enough that it helps lessen sweating during &#34;fire-fights&#34;. It's movement sensitivity usually necessitates a dampening of stock PS3 movement/sighting settings. Responsiveness of stalks during scope siting takes some getting used to, but I wouldn't want to go back to much less precise &#34;feeling&#34; of numerous other controllers. Triggers are also much improved from a stock PS3, and most other controllers I've used. They're actually slightly wider and concave, helping your trigger fingers stay where you want while in a firefight.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it!!! But it is not the same it does not have all the blocks. like bedrock flint and steel.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Growing up I had heard all the Bogie lines: &#34;Here's looking at you kid&#34;, &#34;Play it again Sam&#34;, &#34;I stick my neck out for nobody.&#34;  But I never knew where these lines originated.  Then one evening during Christmas break one of the Tv stations was showing an old movie after the news each night.  Casablanca was one of the movies shown that holiday season, and I finally saw this &#34;Humphrey Bogart&#34; whose name I had heard most of my life, but l whom I had never seen in a movie.  The film was spectacular and I was hooked.  Bogarts's independent, tough character was engaging and the setting In a foreign location piqued the traveller in me.  Since that evening I have sought out Bogie films and never miss the chance to enjoy Casablanca--and now I have my own copy to view!  After 20 years I still love it.  Timeless.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My granddaughter loves this app.  As a two year old her attention span is fairly short on most things but she will play this &#34;game&#34; for more than one half hour at a sitting.  It requires memory, dexterity and some skill.  Your child should love the fact that you can actually see things happen as you progress through the steps in the app.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it's ok but do get bored after some time but I keep playing and could start of with more money and notes .
B008M721MS|1.0|I love using the app but I hate that I can't make Skype go into vertical and not horizontal. It's very annoying when I'm typing on the messenger I have to hold the kindle with one handed then type with the other. It gets very annoying after awhile. Whoever reads this and has had this problem and found a fix please tell me how to fix it.

B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I would totally get this app on your kindle or ipod it's so asome of a game you will love it for shore.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is for the true &#34;Sound of Music&#34; fan.  This was given to me as a Christmas gift.  I love all of contents, as you can see, in the description.  What a nice gift. A must have for the true &#34;Sound of Music&#34; fan.
0345803507|3.0|Book three was boring! I'm not sure why the author made a third book. And really, the whole series hasn't impressed me. Book three could have changed that.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|This coming of age film is for both children and adults alike.  No one should live their lives without seeing this film!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|reallyfun, especially if you share with competitive people. can be used by all ages and keeps yor brain active. we love it!
B007N6EUHI|5.0|I am a chiropractor and find this application to be awesome.  It combines many textbooks into one.  The 3D capability is amazing.  The ability to fade body parts down to the most minute detail is like pealing away layers one at a time.  I now use the application to review neuromuscular anatomy and teaching during seminars. The only thing that would make it even better would be to add abnormalities.  Great app for college students and those who want to stay on top of their learning. I highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game everybody has this game and loves it . Truly you should get it if you don't like it deleat it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I downloaded this app on my iphone and when I received my kindle, this is one of the first apps that I searched for.  The ability to have reminders and the ability to listen to the scripture makes it worth downloading.  I have used many other bible applications, even purchasing bible software for the computer.  This is the best that I have used.  I would like to thank the publisher for making it easer to keep the bible with me at all times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A really entertaining story..kept me on the edge of my seat all way through<br />Can't wait for the next book
B0098VXE50|1.0|Shut it off after the first half hour. Just gore for the sake of gore, and a bore fest galore. There's a shortage of quality movies nowadays.  Just big-budget, made-for-money crap.
B000BNX3AU|4.0|Ok, yes it is predictable but Diane Lane and John Cusack are so akwardly wonderful that you forget you already know how the movie will end. Their performances draw you in and you realize that you are rooting for them right up to the closing credits. Having such a beautiful dog in many of the scenes is an added bonus.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|&#34;Threat Vector&#34;  a good continuation of the present series, fast moving exciting book looking forward to next book with this set of characters.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|One word, Wow !!! What an original and fun game. Really awesome and creative. Kudos to the developers of this game. I have not come across a game as unique and fun as this. I highly recommend it. It's fun and cute.
0345803485|4.0|This is definitely in the erotica category, so if that is not your thing, this book is not for you.  Not a work of art, but outside the norm, and definitely captivated my attention for the few days it took me to read it, and I swore off fiction for the last 5 years until a few days ago...this has rekindled my interest in fiction, I am glad I read it...picked up the second installment today.  Wasn't really happy with the abrupt and sudden end of the first story, not because of the lack of more pages to read but by the story itself(don't want to spoil the end for anyone).  The whole story just seemed to coming to a disarmingly screeching halt, and I was left with a WTF feeling...:(
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I like how this movie balances so many things well, and doesn't overdo anything. The movie begins slightly happy, moves into deep darkness, then into light when they take refuge in the forest, and the only thing that could improved the ending would be for Snow White to thank the families of those who'd died in the fight for their sacrifices. I like how the movie has common people who get nasty because of the dark times, but also common people like the women at the lake who seem to be maintaining a community with honour. I especially like how the movie doesn't gratuitously demonize any real-world beliefs - It seamlessly blends Christian and pagan beliefs. The movie also makes a good attempt at showing how the root of evil often lies with a warped or naive sense of justice when the Queen remembers back to the raid during her childhood and asks her brother whether she treats the people of the kingdom better than she and her brother were treated when they were young. The movie similarly creates a degree of empathy with the troll.<br /><br />Also, the movie doesn't create a strained plot whereby the romantic tension completely resolves by the end - It's great to see Snow White and the Huntsman look at each other from across the hall at the end, with the audience wondering both whether they're going to get together, and even whether Snow White knows that he brought her out of death with his kiss. And then there's the childhood boyfriend the Queen's avatar of whom Snow White kissed complicating her relationship with the Huntsman.<br /><br />This is the sort of movie that creates unanswered questions in exactly the right way, and nicely balances a lot of themes. The only thing it could have done better was develop Snow White's leadership abilities. In my view, the script-writer(s) did a great job.
0307346617|5.0|I love the fact that my children love to read. So when I got the title of this book on my sons wish list I thought very cool.  He loves it!
B008KEQM3W|4.0|I don't understand why people complain about how this movie has too many storylines. Is there no place for movies that adopt this sort of plot style? Are such movies inherently bad? I think the movie did a fantastic job of developing each couple's situation, portraying a wide variety of issues that families face, and very touchingly deals with very emotional issues like miscarriage and problems with C-sections. To my mind, everyone's acting is really good, and criticism of this movie is a perfect example of the social pressure for critics not to like everything, and to start disliking what they've heard others criticizing. The movie conveys numerous important messages well, portrays people's emotional struggles well, and keeps overall a positive atmosphere that brings relationships to what seem like realistic reconciliations.<br /><br />I took off a star, though, for the movie's reliance upon wealth to make everything remain positive. Jennifer Lopez' character's situation, and the situation of the food-truck couple, are insufficiently differentiated from those of the TV and racing stars and their families. How are they getting healthcare? How are the former going to save for college or retirement, something Chris Rock's character jokes about but the gravity of which is insufficiently conveyed for other characters? Also, I don't like the way the movie continues the modern trend of ridiculing fathers and making them seem more pathetic than their female counterparts. That dynamic holds for nearly every single couple in this movie.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|My boyfriend hadn't wanted to watch a movie with singing in it.  So I liked with Amazon instant video I could sit here with my headphones on and watch the movie!  Great story of the Freshmen in college trying to fit in!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I actually thought about downgrading this a star or two.  After I read Wool 1 for free it actually stopped me from buying the rest of the series right away.  The tone of Wool 1 was just so dark.  Eventually, when I got a gift card for Christmas, I decided to pickup the Omnibus edition.<br /><br />Wool 2 was decent, it kept me reading.  I was more interested to see how things would play out with the new sheriff.  The ending caught me by surprise.<br /><br />Wool 3 had me worried from page 1.  It opens with Juliette, the new sheriff, sitting in a cell waiting for her cleaning.  I grew to like Jules in Wool 2 and didn't want to see her end up like Holston.  From this point.  I was sucked in.<br /><br />The ending of Wool 3 prompted me to immediately start reading Wool 4.<br /><br />The ending of Wool 4 had me going &#34;F*** YEAH!&#34;<br /><br />Finally, when Wool 5 was over.  I felt good.  The darkness from book 1 was gone and the story had a somewhat happy ending.<br /><br />I don't know what the plans are for movie/TV adaptation for the series, but I think this would be awesome on a Showtime/HBO or AMC.  I think the story is a little too long for a movie and the series is a little too adult for prime-time television.<br /><br />As a teenager, I was a huge fan of the Fallout series of video games and this reminded me of that.  I personally picture the silo more like a vault.  It had the same exact type of setting, dark, dystopian, evil overlords saving the last remnant of humanity.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun and I'm glad Hugh Howey has found success with his writing.  I will definitely look to read more of his work.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great series, but I hate that I have to wait till May 2013 for the next book.....what to do until then??  Big sigh!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|wonder what the movie will be.  Hard to picture that it could follow this book. all in all a good read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thanks to this book I have had a couple very long nights.. did not want to ever put it down. Amazing story and completely unexpected twist in the story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Same thing over and over. I think Ms James has only one idea in mind. After the first incident everything was the same until I quit reading after the first half of the book.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy is hit and miss with me.  I loved Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising,  They hooked me.  I loved the action, the techno goodies and the plots.  Since then his books have been unpredictable.  Some of them like Red Rabbit and Sum of all Fears seem like he is trying to be an &#34;author&#34; instead of a good story teller.  Well HE's BACK in all his glory with Threat Vector.  It is fast moving, includes the characters we have come to love, has just enough technology, and I actually care about what happens.  I couldn't put it down.  Loved it.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|this bag held up well but won't handle a ton of weight but perfect for entry level cameras or as a strobist bag which is what I use it for

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thought it was a vary good read. I'm not sure how much of things could be done by a marooned astronaut but it all sounded<br />feasible to me.  With that in mind I think it would be a book that should be brought along on missions to mars.. Crazy?  Well, yes I am but--Why not?  Who thought Author C. Clarke was crazy when he wrote about communication satellites ?
141694737X|5.0|The book is cute, my 7 month old son likes to open the flaps. I like the book and do recommended it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Enjoyed it quick read. One of the first books completed on my kindle. Couldn't  put it down hope you enjoy it as well
0689835604|4.0|I like the flaps, it's a cute book. I would recommend it. I read it to my 7 month old boy, he likes the flaps.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I decided to read this in advance of seeing the movie. It is a well-crafted tale, though not without its bouts of slowness, which makes sense given the unrelenting nature of the setting. I thought the book would get increasingly spiritual as Pi's plight went on and was a bit disappointed to discover that was not the case. The book's end was a puzzling and heart-wrenching one, providing some painful humanity to an otherwise fantastical story.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This is an awesome movie!  My 15 year old son and I really enjoyed the movie and highly recommend this all sports fans.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's performance was off the charts as always.  I'm not a Justin Timberlake fan, but he won me over in this flick :-)
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|A lot of times, I watch distracted. I couldn't get away with that in this case.  At one point, I was completely lost.  However, once I backtracked and began to realized that Option 1 was the result of Option 2 \\"failing\\", and that Option 1 was the entire movie, built upon the outcome of Option 2, I was then ready to roll.  This movie was fully immersive, entertaining,had some action, and didn't feel like a rehash of any other movie that I've seen.  It felt fresh.  Glad that I took the time to sit and watch it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What  an amazing read the second time. Cannot get enough. The girl on fire is definitely on fire. Can't wait for the second movie!
B003WJQ74E|4.0|The juxtaposition between Charlie's emotional and intellectual intelligence in this book, as well as the use of Algernon as a metaphor for Charlie's development make it more than a complex tale that's still accessible to a variety of readers.  This was a good read that I couldn't put down.
B00A8KJK7G|2.0|This film is not very good. For a Disney film it is VERY disappointing. Para Norman is a much better animated film of the genre with incredible visual effects and a much better story line.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I quite enjoyed the other two books, but I found there was dark, even for the trilogy, and packed with battlefield descriptions I found hard to visualize.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Not a waste of money, but was hoping for better. Should have known better with Kristen Stewart in it. Chris Hemsworth is surprisingly good, Charlize Theron is surprisingly mediocre and the whole thing sort of feels like it was a cut and paste job.
B006S08RLU|4.0|I enjoyed watching Amelie. It was full of surprises and quite funny! I gave it four stars because of the sexual content.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|item was as described and new in package, was definately what i expected and would definately buy items from again

B008C1O8CA|1.0|I really like Green Day. That being said, Uno is really nothing special-pretty much the same groove we've heard before. Perhaps instead of coming out with 3 CD's, one solid CD would have been a good call~

B001JIFYSA|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies for years. My VHS tape was so worn out I had to order the CD. I love British humor, it is so out there.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|i read this in a few hours. then i returned to the book description on my kindle to check i had bought the correct book - i had, but i'm at a loss to explain all the rave reviews. hated it. predictable rubbish that could have been written by a kid. waste of money
B0017TYPIG|5.0|This movie should be shown to all guys before age 12.  This movie is a classic and a pleasure to watch.
B002UZ5CHO|1.0|I would much rather watch my videos on whatever media I have invested my money in to purchase instead of being locked down to my desktop. This is the only movie purchase I will ever make through Amazon's video system. I own a Mac and was not allowed the priviledge of actually downloading the video to my iPad. &#34;Food&#34; was ok. It would have been awesome on my own terms, but on Amazon's terms it was merely ok.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Having only recently read book one in a song of ice & fire I eagerly read this & I have to say it doesn't disappoint. You can keep Tolkien & Robert Jordan, George Martin has breathed life into & reinvigorated a once vibrant genre that became over populated with dwarves, orcs & signing elves. I've yet to see the HBO series based on these works but I look forward to them. If you read a series of books in your lifetime then make it Martins series.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My new favorite game!  Easy to play but challenging at the same time!  I would have paid for this game but I am glad that it was the FAotD.
B0002TT36G|5.0|I purchased this binder for my husband and he is really happy with it. It is great sized and fits a ton of pages!  Great quality.  Would definitely purchase this product again.
0345525558|5.0|Victoria has simultaniously learned about love and forgiveness at the same time. It was difficult for her suffering through the years from childhood onto adulthood. Victoria gathered learning in a constructive manner how to live her life free from guilt. Grant has given her a second change knowing what she had previously done to him and his Aunt Elizebeth years ago. The amazing part about this book was being able to forshawdow what was to going to happen in the future from the past. This book is not much different from past authors in their writings of flashbacks, but brilliant with the meaning of flowers. It has helped me realize the meanings of the states flowers and why they were chosen, giving an individual or group flowers, what purpose flowers do carry; from insult to compliments. I would like to learn more meaning about flowers. The book ended very interesting, because Vicotoria's and Grant's daughter, Hazel was a great meaning to life and \\"reconcilation\\" to everyone in the family. Victoria learned the meaning of family as well. I do recommend this book for a comfort in reading.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book kept me captivated the whole way through.  I didn't want the story to end and really wish it was part of a series!!
B009LE7AU4|5.0|John gives an insightful look into his life and career.  While most Duran fans already know the band history, it is interesting to get an idea to what was going on behind the scenes.  If you have already read Andy Taylor's book, it makes it all the more interesting.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I liked this game... for a while. Maybe the genre is not my cup of tea. It sort of turned into a mini-job keeping up with it and the notifications popping up on my tablet were a bit annoying.
B0095EMOTM|4.0|Collaborates with a bunch of great musicians to produce a CD that will keep you alive and kicking while at the wheel!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Another great addition to the Resident Evil saga. I can not wait for the next one to come out.  I will be buying this movie for my collection.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I found this to be a very endearing film. Perfect for the family. Happily Ever After. One of those types of movies that they rarely make anymore.
B00006RAKP|5.0|The first song I danced to back in Junior High School - with Dolores - my brother's friend's sister - at his birthday party - Crocodile Rock. Daniel, Rocket Man, so many great songs over the years!

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The first to of this trilogy were really good; I was hoping for more of the same with this movie, but was a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, it was still good (hence 4 stars).
0345529057|4.0|I'm going to start my review of this 5000+ page, still-in-progress monster by saying something that will probably piss off a lot of fantasy fans. High fantasy, as a literary genre, badly needs to be reconstituted. For over 50 years now people who write in this vein have been held in the thrall of writers like Tolkein and C. S. Lewis, writers who for all their imaginative prowess, were far too obsessed with cheap religious parables (Aslan=Jesus) and linguistic messing around (made up languages) to really create and focus down on actual human characters. They fell so in love with the archtypes and mythos of their world(s) that they forgot the humans at its core, and quite simply they seemed not to care, as has often been the case with subsequent writers of high fantasy. We have all read and watched enough media about chosen ones, dark lords, tediously byzantine systems of magic, creepy sexual bonds with dragons, etc. to even pretend to be surprised or engaged by this stuff on anything more than a painfully superficial level anymore.<br />  That, to me is what makes a song of ice and fire so incredibly refreshing and engaging throughout its many many many pages. Martin puts the people in his world, no matter how awful or broken they may be (and everyone in these books is an awful, broken person at one level or another) at the center of his writing, he makes westeros about them and their struggles, instead of forcing them to revolve around some clever clever tropes that he simply regurgitated from someone else. Not only that, but he is able to sketch out descriptions that flesh out his world without burying the reader in tedious, unnecessary details but which still conjure up the dark, sad history of the 7 kingdoms. Honestly, I think his world building has more akin to the 19th century novelists like Hugo and Tolstoy than it does with his more obvious, obtusely prudish fantasy predecessors. And god, can he write women well. More serious literary novelists should take notes on the chapters written from the points of view of Catelyn, Cersei, Arya, etc. The real emotional core of these books, the profound sense of violence and loss that comes with living in such a militantly unfair civilization really comes to the fore in the chapters about women. How many writers of any kind of fiction are able to do that? Not many, and certainly not many of the kinds of fiction writers who would be inclined to thumb their noses at a fantasy epic. In terms of the immediacy of his prose, his ability to orchestrate literally hundreds of characters and seemingly tens of thousands of plot points, all while creating fully realized, fleshed out characters and giving them space to breathe and live within their world, Martin is the single best, most original writer of fantasy fiction currently active. When the dust settles and the series ends, he will probably prove to be even better than the stodgy people he owes so much to. (There, I said it.)
B001DTTG16|3.0|I see kids dressing this way again and it just reminded me of the movie.  So we had to watch with my daughter.
B000SEGTI0|3.0|While I don't think I enjoyed it quite as much as the nightmarish world of 'man in the high castle' Androids is still an effective if somewhat truncated-feeling book, the sense of menace that Dick develops in the former just isn't as compelling or fullfilled here. Yet Androids is also a much funnier, more scathing book. Dick's questioning of the nature of reality can come across as cheap and dull at times, but what's always exciting is seeing how the characters in his books react to that problem, (whether they use drugs or machine induced collective hallucinations to do so). It feels sort of like someone taking the new agey, self affirming BS of the 1970's and forcing it at last to eat itself to show the rotten selfishness underneath it.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I like they way they interlaced it with the previous movies.  Would love to see the next one where they merge the story even further.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I thought this was the WORST movie i've ever seen in my life. Horrible and painful to watch! (although to be fair, my husband liked and thought it was pretty funny)
B005IZNM0W|5.0|This car is a great addition to our set of cars. My son loves it and plays with it often.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are few words for a beautiful book like this.  It was well written, full of love & life.  It was heart-wrenching & uplifting.  It will be a favorite of mine forever.  I read it in a day.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My four year old has spent hours playing this game.  It features cute animals that come to the hospital with a variety of ailments.  While I might find it a little repetitive, my son really enjoys it.  Each of the treatments require different fine motor skills, but are pretty simple.  I like how all of the advertisements and parents utilities are upfront and can not be accessed during normal game play.
6305311463|5.0|This is my second copy.  Love this movie and all the extras that came wth the larger package version.  Each time I'm on the edge of my seat.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is everything you'll want in a book it is real happy sad and supernatural! This book is by far my favorite Nicholas Sparks book that I've read and I've read quite a few of his books probably more than half if not more!! This is a must read book!!!
078401213X|5.0|Pi is a carbon-copy of David Lynch's [[ASIN:B005KYL9LK Eraserhead [Blu-ray]]], and the influence is very evident. What makes Pi so poignant and relevant than ever, is its premonition of economic disaster that predated the global financial crisis by an entire decade. What we have here then, if viewed in this light, is a modern Nostradamus prophecy crafted in a surrealist vein, with numerology thrown in for good measure. Our narrator and central character Maximilian, swallows handfuls of antipsychotic medication in an attempt to stop his hallucinogenic delusions that always culminate in himself trying to stab his disembodied and fly-bespeckled brain. His one and only mentor and confidant dies of a second stroke, and leaves behind a cryptic 216 Kabbalic digit that predicts stock market activity. Max is never given a moments rest between the sexual advances of his Bollywood-hot nextdoor neighbor, being abducted by a cult of Hasidic Jews, and an evil Condoleezza Rice look-a-like that is quick at his heels throughout. The 216-digit is stored in Max's memory [[ASIN:B004R0MF48 Johnny Mnemonic [Blu-Ray]]] style, so the only solution is to shave his head and attempt to extract the information with a handheld power drill. Awesome movie.

B001NLKT60|5.0|I don't like to get involved with trilogies but aafter I read the first one ,I had to read the other two. this is one of those stories you never want to end.  It moves quickly and you  can't really get a feeling of how it will end. Right now I'm half way thru the third one and don't want to do anything else until I finishit. I thought it a great opener for &#34;Fifthy Shades of grey&#34;.

B006LSZECO|4.0|A must-read! A bit of a slow start but full of twists and turns that will keep you reeling! Amazing crime thriller!
1419705849|5.0|My 15-year-old grandson is too old for this, but he has the rest  of the set, so I gave him this one for Christmas and slipped a check inside.  Told him he had to read it because I was going to ask questions.  He did read it, found the check, and finished the book anyway.  Besides, Jeff Kinney visited Worzella Publishing here in Stevens Point, WI, where the books are printed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book! I never wanted to put it down.  Very exciting and intriguing!  Can't wait to read the next one!
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|For my nephew for christmas. He loved it.  He loves taking pictures and loves Lego's so what better gift than this.  He loved it..
B003TSEEDY|5.0|There are hundreds of words I could use to describe this book. But there are two words that I think could sum it up perfectly.<br />Life Changing
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I have really enjoyed the BORNE series. This movie is exciting and interesting just like all the others. Keeps you on your toes!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Well written book, unexpected ending. It really makes you think about Charlie, the protagonist, and what he is going through. Good read and I would recommend this book to high schoolers. An interesting part about the book is that you don't know who he is writing to and you almost want to assume he is writing the letters to you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I just started watching this series and I am hooked. Can't wait for season 3 to start on Sunday the 6th.
1897299214|3.0|This is an odd book. It brings together the graphic novel and North Korean austerity. Canadian animator Guy Delisle spent time in North Korea, which has apparently become the new favored source for cheap animation labor. In this book Delisle captures the absurdities of life in Pyongyang, more through pictures than through words. Only one floor of Delisle's massive hotel has electricity, there's bizarre and uninspired food, and minimal recreation activities. Delisle brings a copy of 1984 with him, and North Korea is certainly an Orwellian society.<br /><br />I think I would have found this book more effective if I didn't really know anything about North Korea. There's nothing really surprising here. I enjoyed Delisle's drawings, but I felt like there was too much drawing and not enough narrative. I think I'd have preferred an art exhibit to a book. Ultimately the book lacks depth, and the illustrations don't make up for what the writing lacks.
B009JBZH54|5.0|As an old fan, this series is a in a class of its own.  Each is bound to be classic for generations to come.  We all have our favorite!
B001MTENOC|5.0|Great book, gives a lot of food for thought. Sheds light on what we are (eternal beings) and what happens to us after we die and beyond. Could change someones thoughts on how to live this life.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|All the Hendrix re-issues I have (are you experienced) and this one are really quality 180 gram pressings at a fantastic price. Crystal clear sound, they are truly great. I look forward to buying Axis soon. Again, fantastic buy at this price!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Aca-Mazing.  LOL  This is a terrific movie.  This is an enjoyable watch with some pretty crazy characters. If you haven't seen it, grab a group of friends who like cheerfully silly comedies, with good dialogue, and great singing--there are some terrific mixed tracks on this--as a heads up, the soundtrack is amazing on the movie--the soundtrack purchase--not so much ...
B0018J2QB8|5.0|This series is addictive so after watching season 1, we needed to get right to season 2. Instant video saved the day and was quick and affordable.
B000IFQLSW|2.0|I love blues music and expected this CD to be on the same level as other CDs from KWS. He has done better than this in the past. There was only 3 that I really liked. That does not however mean that you will not like them all. To each his own.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is the biography of a SEAL, from initial training through the killing of Osama bin Laden and its immediate aftermath. Although he is careful to reveal the minimum of operational details (although not careful enough, judging by the government's reaction to the book) and some of the details seem to be deliberately distorted, this still offers a wealth of information on the making of a SEAL and the constant grueling round of training and deployment that is the SEAL's daily life. Fascinating if you're interested in contemporary military and what makes a special operations operative tick.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|Bought gift for a birthday present for my father n law it was very reasonable priced  and in perfect condition
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|my other half can't get enough of this game, i can't really get into it.  it's a cute enough game, though
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love this show. The lead character reminds me of &#34;House.&#34; He's annoying but brilliant all at the same time. I'm not a big fan of Lucy Liu but I really like her in this show.
B005HSL626|5.0|lots of fun playing this.  i like this better than angry birds!  would recommend this to everyone.  anyone can play this game
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|I found the movie a little odd, but basically funny.  The new kids were great.  It left much to your imagination though.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|I have always loved Anne Rice . The Vampire Chronicles are my favorite and now I can read them over and over no matter where I go and do not have to worry about losing them and having to buy them again
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Its pretty cool. The pudding looks like jello.... But that's okay. Still entertaining nonetheless. If you like cut the rope then try this.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|i really like playing this game but you cant buy anything accept health potions with your money.everything else costs glu-wtf-.what's the point in collecting coins if you cant use it to purchase anything but skill points and health potions.glue could have been a little more subtle about their greed and at least made you feel like your getting a decent deal.most games allow you to advance(with difficulty) without money but not this one.way to show your capitalist side glue.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not put this book down. So excited to read walking disaster. Honestly one of the best books I have ever read
1936594234|5.0|Simply wonderful, truth be told, the book will help you release yourself from the shackles that hold you down, change your outlook to win, not lose, and help you redirect your energy and focus to succeed in your deepthest desires. This book changed my life when I was a teen that needed clarity and hope, it can change yours too.<br /><br />Recommended 100%, to everyone - no one is an exception!<br /><br />HOWEVER... read the book or follow alone with the book if your decide to purchase the audiobook, because the narrator does butcher it. First of all he reads too fast and fails to break up one paragraph from another, and secondly he fails to read the book properly, even saying words incorrectly. Audiobook gets 1 star, book gets 5 stars.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Love watching this movie with my kids. We have seem it several times and it never gets old. It's so fluffy.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Very good book makes you really think and stop and wonder what does your dog think about. If only dogs could talk!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is fantastic and i can't stop playing it for heaven's sake buy it now  or else other things will happen<br />From Kevin
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|nothing can compare to the original Pc version but this is a good start to portable version...its fairly easily...and its pretty darn scary
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It just keeps getting better.  Great acting and wonderful costumes and scenery.  I can't wait for the next season to start.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|enjoyed movie.  Althought i don't like having to write a long reply.  should be able to put something short and sweet!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I record one of the most difficult instruments to record: the pipe organ. I am in the process of producing my own CD, and with this I can record in high-quality without clipping caused by too loud of an organ, while still being able to hear the quietest of sounds.<br /><br />The only con about this recorder is that it picks up only the sound that's in front of it, unless you use an external microphone or two in addition to the built-in microphones. For some settings, this means placing this recorder at the opposite end of the venue in order to pick up the natural reverberation of the building.<br /><br />The accessories are very handy. The microphone stand adapter can be used to mount this to a microphone stand, though you could also use it to mount any standard camera to a microphone stand. The windscreen seems a bit awkward to place on the recorder, but it stays on very well. The only other thing is that the power cord could be a bit longer, and it sometimes produces a high-pitched tone that fortunately the sensitive built-in microphones do not pick up.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this for good-quality recording, though I would also invest in a larger SD card than the 2 GB one provided.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoued movie.  Althought i don't like having to write a long reply.  should be able to put something short and sweet!

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I just dont like the game! I want to remove it. Thats all I dont have anything else to say!!!! Remove the stupid game
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Best movie I have watched in years!!!!!<br />The story line and actors could not be better.<br />This movie should be nominated for an award.
B003H4RDZQ|4.0|I bought this after we lost our home in super storm sandy.  the dark nature of the comedy fit my mood.  i read it every free moment and plan to re-read it before passing it on to deserving friends.  he is a detailed enough writer and my memory is bad enough that a second read will be as enjoyable as the first read.
B000F1IQNM|4.0|The DVD arrived on time, was brand new & still in its original packaging. This is a cute movie but more for kids than adults.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus Luttrell did an amazing job! What a guy! I couldn't put this book down it was so thrilling. From his backbreaking navy seals training to a ferocious gun battle and fight for survival, the book was an amazing emotional experience and thrill. It's a must read..
0800141660|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It is my favorite movie version. The actors/actresses do a wonderful in creating the atmosphere of that time.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The latest & perhaps last in the Pendergast series has a fast start (continued from the previous book in the series) leaving the reader foregoing much needed sleep just to read what happens next.  Many extraordinary situations, answers to many questions and creative masterful writing.  Looking forward to their next work together.<br />Bones
6304082428|5.0|This 1995 movie version of Pride and Prejudice is absolutely wonderful. The period costumes and the manners and speech of that time are very interesting and the colors are vivid. I cannot count the number of times I have seen this movie and how many friends I have turned on to the enjoyment of this movie. A great cast of characters but the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth are particularly well cast.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|this arrived fast ..perfect shape..like new..great.<br />and the movie itself was real good.since i didn't get it for Christmas .i got it myself.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|This is a really enjoyable movie. Many of the parts make me laugh out loud because I remember similar events in my life when I was single.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The only thing I disliked about this book is it happened too fast!!! Great read very easy to forget everything else.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. My sister & I watch it every Christmas as part of a tradition. There is a some partial nudity & a little rough language but the many individuals stories within the story line are interesting. This movie shows several different couples & the multitude of emotions they experience from and within marriage, meeting and falling in love with someone new,  betrayal and death of a loved one. It is interesting how all of the couples & their relationships are intertwined by friendship, family and/or common backgrounds. There is a great cast of characters & the overlying theme is that love and family is actually what is important in life.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Wanted to put a few things down on a paper always carry my kindle this has been good so far.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|it worked very well for me it worked very well it worked very good omg y so many words m
630463949X|4.0|I am happy with the item I ordered. It was exactly what it was supposed to be. I would have liked to get it sooner but because of weather and the Christmas season it took a little longer to get than I expected. Overall I am happy and would buy from this seller again.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This is the third MIB and it has been down hill since the second.  I would get 5 stars to the first , 4 stars to the second and  this one barely 3. I don't think there will be a 4.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Movie came in great condition and quickly (I love pre-ordering!).  When the Blu-ray didn't work I was able to send it back hassle free and received a replacement almost instantly.  I got the replacement in perfect condition but again the Blu-ray didn't work.  I lent it to my parents to see if it was the Blu-ray or my player, good news (at least for Amazon, lol) is that it was my player.  But dealing with Amazon was hassle free and had amazing turn around times.  Thanks!!!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|This adapter works very well with an Otterbox protective case. It is sturdy and easy to plug in. Connection seems very secure, no wobble.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|great action movie , watched it 3 times  loved it!!! cannot wait together the DVD!  feel good movie great special effects!
B003L77G06|5.0|it is great, what more can I say to make it 12 words or more, great  great great great loved it
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Good kids movie if you let your kids watch movies with witchcraft in it. The overall story and plot was good but it felt like something was missing from the whole story.<br />I don't know about your mom but if I did what brave did to my mom she wouldn't have easily forgotten and life for me wouldn't have returned to normal. I guess that's the magic of Disney! :)
B002UXRGLG|5.0|These dvds really kick butt. I didn't have the other version to compare, but I love this one for sure.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This version of bible app is nice! I purchased for kindle fire but I already had on my phone. Try!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I found this game to be rather fun and well laid out. It became exceptionally entertaining once I discovered I could draw the stickman as a phallus and search for the one thing they search for
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is a page turner. I couldn't put it down. I can not wait for the third book to come out.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Finally, an awesome, suspenseful, powerful, yet feel-good movie that isn't cheesy or overblown. A test and a triumph of the human spirit, it's so much more than an MMA fight movie. Though it delivers enough in that department for those who aren't looking for much more.<br /><br />I was most impressed by the acting in this film, particularly Nick Nolte's performance of an alcoholic father of two now-grown men. The scene in the casino with his younger son was particularly powerful--one of the most memorable character scenes I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />This movie is one gem in a sea of forgettable and pointless movies.
B00APUQKDG|4.0|I love Cronenberg's style.<br />Growing up I loved Carpenter, Walter and Deborah Hill, Depalma, and Cronenberg's work.<br />I just loved their style.<br />It's kind of funny to me sometimes because Cronenberg seems to have a little bit of all those directors styles and then his own rolled into one.<br /> Maybe I'm off the mark saying that but I mean it as a compliment.<br />There also seems to be a dash of David Lynch incorporated here (for better or worse).<br />Anyway, &#34;Cosmopolis' is one of Cronenberg's best works for sure.<br />I liked it better than 'Videodrome', 'A history of Violence', 'Eastern Promises', and 'Crash' to name a few.<br />It's hard to top 'Scanners' or 'The Dead Zone' as far as David's work goes but 'Cosmopolis' is up there.<br />I think the dialogue and exchanges between characters were too tongue in cheek for a lot of folks to digest.<br />I think more pretentious viewers may of been trying to extract deeper meanings from the stream of hollow banter that's on going throughout the film, but I think it just is what it is.<br />Overall the movie seemed to me to be about a cold, calloused, selfish, over-privileged, out-of-touch rich person's descent into self destruction set against the background of class warfare.<br />Sometimes the main character may appear to be looking for deeper meanings about life, but he is who he is.<br />Really, the film was like if a sociopath let me tag along to witness their potential demise for 24 hours and along the way we encounter a lot of strange people and situations.<br />Sometimes the movie can leap from comical to vicious in the blink of an eye.<br />If you're looking for a point to the film you may or may not be disappointed.<br />This film is more of a ride to me than a story. But I do like the story.<br />Robert Patterson did a great job I thought. He's perfect for the role because he's an odd fit.<br />Some people found the ending to get dragged out and a little boring, to be honest it did feel that way to me a little but not enough to hurt the film.<br />Once again, I really love Cronenberg's direction and it shines here.<br />It's a bizarre flick.<br />If you're looking for a stylish movie that sets the controls for the heart of the sun, from a great film maker, then you might be in love.<br />I happened to watch the new version of 'Tinker Tailor' (which I also liked) right before viewing this and it was oddly a great fit.ay to me a little but not enough to hurt the film.<br />Once again, I really love Cronenberg's direction and it shines here.<br />It's a bizarre flick.<br />If you're looking for a stylish movie that sets the controls for the heart of the sun, from a great film maker, then you might be in love.<br />I happened to watch the new version of 'Tinker Tailor' (which I also liked) right before viewing this and it was oddly a great fit.

B003ZMF26W|4.0|Dad has the CM Storm Sentinel Advanced II. Bought this for my son who had a lot of fun playing with the profiles and buttons on mine. My goodness, the DPI is so high on both - no real difference after 3000 / 4000 DPI. Can't really use much higher in a game, your spraying bullets everywhere. You need to be able to DOWNGRADE the DPI on the fly to even try and line up a sniper or other shot.<br /><br />Considering this mouse saved me $20+ and has just as much bells and whistles - save yourself some cash and this is all you really need (or could use). Nice hand feel for larger hands, braided cord - this is a solid, solid mouse..

B000MX7V5M|5.0|This classic movie was made when glamour and mystery were necessary for a hit.  I have watched it over and over and always see something new.  The beautiful people and locations are even better on our new TV.  I only wish movies were still made this way.

B005FISBTO|4.0|Dexter is an awesome serious.  This item shipped on time and was in good shape when it got here. it got 4 out of 5 because there are a few scratches on one of the CDs, but other than that it is in good shape.  WATCH this series!  It is soooo adicting!
B001AQT0RC|4.0|Contact is no Beautiful Mind.  But it dives deeper into another beautiful aspect of humanity, the abstract and philosophical thinking, in vivid and intelligent conversations.  Jodie Foster's aural delivery is superb.  You can almost believe that such conversation actually happened, if a bit dramatised.  Several visual sequences are stunning, although I have no idea whether special effects broke any ground.  What I like best in visual effects are the rhythm and montage.  Several unforgettable cuts literally take my breath away.<br /><br />The romance between the priest and Jodie's character is a bit artificial nearly from the beginning to the end, despite the excellent depiction of their conflict and resolution.  Although the narrative of the movie is not tied to this romance, a great deal of dialogues do derive from the relationship.  So this is a rather big defect.  The scene in the remote galaxy also feels forced and dry.  I'd rather it be shortened to allow development of her relationship.  Another weak story is the farce around &#34;International Selection Committee.&#34;  There is nothing international in the committee, but lots of important drama have to come from that story.  Since the rest of &#34;flying machine&#34; story is so U.S. centric, it may as well show chauvinism all the way through.<br /><br />Overall, the movies is beautifully presented.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Lots of great ideas.  Beautiful places to visit, love the art work, gardening ideas and cooking that can go on for ever!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wasn't sure I would be able to do well with this game, but I immediately got caught up in the challenge of beating the clock & completing levels. One of my favorite games!

B009CPJHY4|5.0|I am a great fan of English Actors and own many movies including period dramas.  Also the mixture of the Indian culture increased the adventure aspect of the film.  I found that I was smiling through most of this movie.  Congratulations to all the main characters.

0670026603|5.0|Louisa Clark (Lou) is just an ordinary woman leading her life, living with and helping to take care of her parents and grandfather. Then the job she loves at the cafe is gone. The owner has closing and moved away. Jobs are hard to come by and she tries a few. Then she is convinced to become a companion/caregiver to Will Traynor. A man who was a daredevil and astute businessman that has been sidelined by an accident the caused damage to his spinal cord. He is now in a wheelchair and can only move one hand slightly. Will is acerbic, moody, bossy--but Lou refuses to treat him with kid gloves, and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected. When she learns that Will has shocking plans of his own, she sets out to show him that life is still worth living.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to dive into this book. I had only read a small synopsis sent by the publicist before I started reading. I knew the man in the story was paralyzed but didn't really give it more than a passing thought until I read about his injury. His damage to his spine was in the C5-6 area, the exact same place as my injury. He is confined to a wheelchair with very little movement. This could have been me. I was lucky to have paralysis only claim one side of my body. This did give me pause but I continued reading. Will Traynor went through the same feelings and doubt and uncertainty that I did and still sometimes have. But he did do something I could never do. He decided to have 6 months with his family and then he would end his life at a assisted suicide clinic in  Switzerland. Lou will do anything to get him to change his mind. To say this book affected me deeply in an understatement.<br /><br />Jojo Moyes has written a brilliant story that was well researched. She incorporates spinal injury online support groups to help Lou understand what Will is going through. From experience I know the snippets in the book are credible. She has included a caregiver that takes care of the more personal and medical needs for Will so that Lou is more of a friend or companion at least at first.<br /><br />She has also created a wonderful cast of supporting characters. Lou's lower class family, working hard every day to try to keep up. Her sister, the family favorite, with her own personal battles. Lou's boyfriend who has suddenly become a fitness guru. Then there is Will's family. Upper middle class with a huge house and plenty of money. But even with their son's disability aside, were they ever happy? I truly enjoyed the chapters when other characters took over and gave their perspective. We were able to get a deeper vision of their thoughts and impressions of  their lives as well as their feelings about Lou and Will.<br /><br />This was not a book that I could rush through but I feel that is because of my personal issues with the story. I found myself setting the book aside because some parts were so powerful or when I found myself actually crying so much the words were blurred. It is not your run of the mill love story. Feelings grew in ways that I didn't even imagine. I don't want to ruin the end for anyone but I was truly hoping for a different outcome. I understood, but as a person who has actually looked death in the eye and came back, life is just too precious to me.<br /><br />An intense story, I highly recommend you have a box of tissues handy.edical needs for Will so that Lou is more of a friend or companion at least at first.<br /><br />She has also created a wonderful cast of supporting characters.

B009D5VNLS|1.0|The movie is pretty good and I generally liked it.  I purchased this movie with the intent of watching it on my TV via Apple TV and because I couldn't download a specific file I was unable to put into my apple library with all my other movies.  Similar to what I would do if I downloaded a CD.  This is unacceptable and therefore I bought the same exact movie from Itunes so I don't have to log into some stupid app that I can download but only watch the movie on my ipad or iphone.  I guess I should have read the fine print a little better before my purchase so buyer beware .
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I loved &#34;Lost&#34; when it was on the air and still love it. Having the entire series has been a delight. I now think I know what<br />it was all about.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great way to  bring the story to life, effects off the hook. RDJ brings it as Tony Stark and just makes the character larger than life.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series has so far proven to be fantastically entertaining. I can't wait to read the last book! Good read :)
B009HEMW4W|4.0|Men In Black. Good movie, not great. Did have a good ending. Not as much action or comedy as the first ones.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|this game is awesome. so different from the regular diner dash games. hope they come out with more like it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it but it can be frustrating  when you have to wait ten hours cliff it to hatch but I have got  not hurry and there are some really cool dragons my fave is my. tree Dragon get the app
B007704HO6|4.0|I couldn't put this book down, waiting to see what Bob would<br />do next. He certainly helped his owner in many way
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Unbelievable 45 dollars for just 300 bling  they can do better much much much much much much better an d I really want  that  collie And the husky
B009NPK1IO|4.0|The end always comes. Sometimes it's satisfying, sometimes it's not. Once in a great while, it's everything you hoped and more. GG's last season was satisfying, no more, no less.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Got to have more!!! This is by far the best collection I have ever read! Love this author!! Already pre ordered the third book and I feel like I am going to go nuts waiting for it. The suspense is killing me. A must read.
B009O36EO0|5.0|Loreen is one of the standout artists of 2012. Best thing to come out of Eurovision in years!<br /><br />Favorites on the album are Everytime and See You Again. Everything else is great, too. The only songs I really have a problem with are In My Head (a rather boring opening track) and Do We Even Matter. However, I love Loreen so much, and these songs will probably grow on me. I would definitely recommend this album!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she plays the disc when driving around town.  Very nice music to listen to, relaxing but not dull, very enjoyable.
B008645YH6|5.0|As much as I loved The Family Jewels, Marina has truly outdone herself. Perfect album, best of 2012.<br /><br />Favorite songs are Primadonna, The State of Dreaming, and Valley of the Dolls.<br /><br />I don't dislike any of the songs on this album. Please, buy this album! You won't regret it.
1608871452|5.0|It's easy: if you love Supernatural, you will love this book. That's all there is to it. Buy it. You won't regret it. Everything about it is GORGEOUS. The cover, the sleeve over the cover, the pictures, the pop outs, the maps and all the little goodies in between. It comes with a few really cool stickers which include a devil's trap, an angel banishing sigil, and an anti posession symbol. It also comes with some posters of Chuck's book covers and a map of a few important places in the SPN verse which puts the distance the boys travel into perspective. The book itself is very insightful and filled with fun behind the scenes stories and interviews as well as an episode guide to the series leading up to season 8. I could go on and on...but you should really just find out yourself!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My God, this author is such a genius and has been granted an amazing gift. The gift of words. Slammed, point of no retreat, and this new novel is just absolutely riveting. The twist left me \\"omg_ing\\". HIGHLY RECOMMEND.....
B008G59IBI|5.0|Very cool cd, very quick shipping. I bought all 3 of them together and they all arrived in the same package a few days later. Very nice quality and as far as the cd itself it's definitely the best of the triology. It sounds a LOT like their older stuff. A Green Day fan must have.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I was excited to get this complete collection of Sherlock Holmes mysteries, and haven't put it down since! The four volumes include both short stories and multi-chapter novellas detailing the exploits of this famous detective. I have to say that some stories are better -- much better -- than others, but there were only 2 or 3 instances when I didn't finish a story because of boredom.<br />Some of my favorites are:<br />The Hound of the Baskervilles<br />The Speckled Band (although it always makes me nervous!)<br />The Five Orange Pips<br />The Sign of the Four<br />The Dying Detective<br />If you enjoy mysteries -- or if you are interested in Victorian England -- I highly recommend these books!
B0042AGN7I|5.0|Stark in its realism.  Despite showing the extreme violence you expect in combat, the humanity of the brothers-in-arms shows through
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It was very funny and lite!  It was a fun movie, and not to serious. Mark Wahlberg is such a good actor!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|All of our families, young and old really enjoyed this movie.  The characters are interesting and fun and the music and singing was fabulous.  We will probably buy the DVD for this one.  I gave it 4 of 5 stars because of some character inconsistency that made for a more dramatic story but did not fit the character.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heavan  Too many medical terms to totally make sense of it in its entirety. Have to read again to absorb all information<br />even altho am prolific reader
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Was ok but most of the funniest parts were in the previews, story line could be improved over all not bad for $1.99 would not watch again
B007MJSQSK|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun!!!  We really enjoyed it!!  Good video and sound effects.  We highly recommend it.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I think it's okay if you're on a budget and just need a cover for your Kindle and if you don't plan on taking it everywhere you go, but it's a little flimsy and not real happy with the fit......I would have liked to have seen more choices to choose from,
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|I was at the Irvine show! Great souvenir of a great tour I went to in 2010 :-) Rock on!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The Pact kept me on the edge of my seat. I was certainly surprised about the whole episode as it came about. Jodi Picoult has a way of doing that to her readers.
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|I received this as a Christmas gift to myself... Such a wonderful box set! A must-have for Smashing Pumpkins fans! Beautiful artwork and packaging... The bonus CD's are filled with gorgeous tracks!
0439023513|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed all 3 of the books in this series. Collins creates such a vivid world. Her characters are complex with dimension. I love that Katniss is hard to like at times! Wonderfully written!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics. Very fun to play. Great puzzles, make you think but not too difficult to figure out. Good story too. Keeps you intrigued.
B004LROUNG|4.0|A very compelling story with just enough detail to keep moving. Excellent characterization and didn't run out of steam. Mr. Grisham did  not fudge on the ending this time.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Though I am, and have been a S.K. reader/collector since the beginning, I was slightly disappointed with this book.  Perhaps, as I have gotten older, I have begun to tire of unnecessary \\"fill\\", perhaps there was just too much detail.  Bottom line?  By the time I reached the midpoint of the tale, I began skimming.  I finished, and rather enjoyed the last four chapters, but unlike others from Mr. King, I doubt I will take this one off the shelf ever again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read this book in a day.... I could not put it down.  It was a great read.  I loved the intense and complex characters, it kept you wanting to read more and find out more about them.  The book is also filled with so much amazing passion for many things.  What a great read.  Will there be a second book to see what happens between Holder and Sky?
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I think the author is a good writer but de book is quite boring by repeting constantly how sexy is Mr. Grey or how beautiful is Mrs. Grey without anything new or exciting. I believe the first book was the best one because we have a young woman trying to find a life and an interesting man who become intriguing due to its secrecy and questionable behaviour. I will not recommend the book to a friend
B005EM8O8O|4.0|I read this book a while ago but still remember how thrilling it was. I was tense the whole time. A story of greed, how the market could work and the toll it takes on those who always want more. Instructive too.  A good buy.
B001O5LVPI|4.0|The movie was in great shape. Our family really enjoyed the movie. However, the plastic holder for the DVD was broken.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great, great book from the trilogy. I recommended it to many friends and relatives and three friends have already started reading it! Didn't want it to end!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This book incorporates all the best things: dogs, Marines, difficult relationships, and shows that true love can always win out. A haunted Marine, Logan follows his heart and his friends advice and helps to mend broken relationships. Just a beautifully written book, much better than the movie. One of my all-time favorites!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Reading this Harry Bosch novel makes me want to seek out more!  Well developed characters and suspenseful ending!  I have read other Michael Connelly books and now I will definitely read more!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|This book is a very long one but it is very interesting but was very boring to read the whole thing <br />What was it about really it was only a bunch of words who wants to read abook with just a bunch of words thats so boring i mean really think about it a book with only words and there meanings
0812992784|2.0|It just took way to long to get involved in the reading and never kept my attention. . . .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is extremely intense, fast paced, and an easy read! I recommend it for all ages. Can't wait to read the second one :)
B0091REZMW|5.0|It works well on the kindle fire. I will say that if you like games like this. Then this is a choice.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|I find this doesn't work very well.  But since Micheal C Hall rocks I will keep trying and if nothing else its not a hardship to see Dexter on the Kindle whenver I want.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book is creative and just interesting and I recommend it to anyone! They give the definitions to the hard words and give very little pictures. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a long book, but I could hardly put it down once having begun. It's a very impressive work about a fascinating man, whose story is almost beyond belief. But Jobs's accomplishments are real, and his impact on the world tremendous. I'm sorry I've completed it.
B008D36INE|3.0|It's nice to experience a movie right as you buy it but the quality of the image was bad. The movie itself was a continual down ward spiral but it did spark some points with me that I hadn't had before. It was a good experience but I wish that the movie would have been of better quality (visually).
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is truly one of the best books I've ever read. I loved all the suspense and how detailed it was. I hated the fact that Gale isn't mentioned very often. I would recommend this book for any teenager the likes fantasy, drama, and just a dash of adventure.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Luckily, I got this app when it was free, which it is very worth the $1.99 that is cost.  Other than the fact that it is a great adventure game, it is a pioneer in the future of tablet/phone gaming.  My favorite feature of this game is how you can draw and create your own characters.  I love how you can change your character without having to start over. To anyone who is hesitating about buying this game, even after you try the free version, GET IT. Trust me, it's worth it.
1607066017|5.0|I first heard about SAGA through my dad, of all people.  I think the only graphic novels my dad has ever read are ones that I gave to him.  But he saved an article about the Wall Street Journal about the cover of the first issue for me, just because it sounded like my kind of thing.  Yep, my dad knows me.<br /><br />Because SAGA is definitely my kind of thing.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm hoping it's almost everyone's kind of thing, because it's fantastic.  The basic set up is very Romeo and Juliet-ish: Marko and Alana are fighting on opposite sides of a war when they fall in love and run away to start a family.  It's a war that spans several wars, having been outsourced from the homeworld of the original groups who had a problem with each other.  But now several freelancers and a prince have been set on the task of killing Marko and Alana.  And, fortunately, the actual story has little in common with Romeo and Juliet.  Marko may do some stupidly idealistic stuff, but both of them are willing to make hard choices to survive.  And they are very aware that they're parents and must protect their daughter.  Marko and Alana do not lack responsibility.<br /><br />SAGA is narrated by their baby daughter Hazel once she's all grown up, which at least let's the reader know she survives the craziness of their lives.  The device is done very well, and I like that it gives Hazel a voice since she obviously can't talk as a baby.  Her narration promises lots of bad things to come, and I can't wait to read about them.<br /><br />Fiona Staples art is colorful, clean, and dynamic.  The backgrounds are detailed by the characters still pop in the foreground.  Some of the designs are rather grotesque, and Staples' art really sells the images.  And for all the monsters on display, the creepiest-looking character (in my opinion) looks totally normal if you just look at her young, smiling face.<br /><br />This is just the first volume of a comic that will hopefully live up to it's name in length when it's done.  But I have high hopes for SAGA, because the first volume is near perfect.  It's a family drama, a war novel, a romance, an action-adventure story, and probably more.  It's got layers, but above all else SAGA is extremely entertaining.<br /><br />Thanks for putting this on my radar, Dad.th when it's done.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'm a huge fan of singing and dancing, and then add in Rebel Wilson, and she has a brand new fan!  LOVED her!  Thought the story was cute, with a great ending.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is funny, sweet, and a story of friendship. Recommended to anyone who likes a good laugh or a story that really speaks to them.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Best soundtrack EVER. It definitely does not have all the songs in the movie (just the &#34;highlights&#34; of the musical), which makes sense. The whole thing is in song, so the full soundtrack would be like 70 songs.. But the ones on this are just amazing, and I have it on repeat daily.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a fantastic touch to a brilliant classic. There are some things I'm not to fond of in the game play, however, that's built on more personal opinions than a general consensus. I'm really enjoying the game so far and look forward to what's to come in game play. Fun graphics, perfect time consumer ^_^
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My daughter and I both just dearly love this app. She does especially. It is a lot of fun. We will play it until the battery goes dead on the tablet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|addicting and fun!!!!!!!!! cant ever stop!!! its really fun to try to pass all the levels and get new pages
034580404X|5.0|This series was awesome from begining to end:)<br />A total MUST READ!! Wasn't my style but way too good to put down!
B009GEBBNQ|2.0|100 minutes of special effects. No real plot. I didn't expect a great movie, but this was a waste of time.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  You will love this book for years to come.
0062073281|4.0|I really liked her previous sequel, so I couldn't wait to get to her latest one! And I really liked it too! For me it's like going back to the days when Laguna Beach and The Hills aired; it's like reading about the real life that you saw on those shows. And I recommed this book for people who had liked her previous works so you can really enjoy the novel!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Love Jack Reacher! Smart and thinks fast. Great read. Best of the best!  Great job. I am hooked on Reacher!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have this game on my phone and was so happy to find that it was available for my kindle fire.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose to give the book 5 stars because it was funny and I never got bored! Anyone who reads it will love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a fun game but the update took all my process ten games away and they deleted all of it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I started this book simply because I believe in reading a book before I see the movie based off of it. I was amazed at how easily I related to Charlie, even though we truly have nothing in common besides a love of books and the movie \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". But his perspective on the real life issues he is forced to deal with is refreshing and I enjoyed getting to know him.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This is the second time I've read the book and still loved it! Just like the first time I read it, I couldn't put the book down.
044980691X|5.0|Haven't listened to it yet.  We're saving it for a long trip.  But I can tell you<br />this . . . I've read only a couple of John Grisham's books that were not a<br />great read.  Love his books.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not quite what the previews made it seem like, but still worth watching. Not Johnny Depp's best movie despite his flawless acting.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I downloaded this a couple of hours ago and I can't put my phone down.  Its so much Fun.  Its the cutest program I've seen since angry birds.  And it doesn't need but a couple permissions to download.  Just the type of app I prefer.  Go ahead its really fun!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is destined to become a classic coming of age novel. Charlie is the new \\"every kid\\" who has suffered trauma at the hands of adults and lived to tell the tale.
1401216676|5.0|If you say you are a fan of batman this is quintessential reading. There would be no batman as it is today without this story. Enough said. Go read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is THE best game on my Kindle Fire!  I play it all the time.  It's not as good as the Xbox or PC versions, but it's still really good.  I got this because I couldn't get the other versions.  It's really good since you can take ut anywhere without needing an Internet access.  Really good game!
B004132HZS|5.0|it has been a very nice surprise. I alreaddy bought the season 2 and I hop a third will be soon made
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Good special fx, but not much for a storyline.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have time to kill.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I have been using Evernote for over a year now.  This needs the folowing features found in the desktop app:<br /><br />- Undo feature.  Nothing more annoying than an editor that does not have this basic essential feature.<br />- Encrypt text feature.  This is only available on the desktop version.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|i love this movie very much and the book wooooooooooooow! i think you guys should get it! its the best
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love jigsaw puzzles but don't have the space for them. The puzzles here are excellent and difficult(like I like them)<br />I gave them four stars because the pieces can be awkward to handle  on the kindle version.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Our family thought this movie was just as funny and enjoyable as the previous sequals.  It was fun to see the mismatched herd again and them setting out to a new adventure.  We meet some new characters including granny and as always we loved the squirrel.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read many of Michael Connolly's Harry Bosch books, but this one is among the very best. As always, Harry is believable, real likable - not glamorous, just real. The investigative story in Black Box is so well woven that is a joy to unravel - like a gift.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Entertaining, suspenseful, and always completely unexpected twists and turns. There is no other show like this on TV. It's even better than season one.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I eagerly await each of the Clancy novels that follow the Ryan legacy. Sure, some are better than others, but this was an enjoyable read.<br /><br />FYI, a BMW car is known by owners as \\"Bimmers\\", not \\"Beamers\\". \\"Beamers\\" refers to a BMW motorcycle; or the football coach at Virginia Tech.
1449410243|4.0|Short, fun and silly, any readers of Inman's online comic The Oatmeal will find plenty of familiar material here. The collection is enriched with a series of \\"The Bobcats\\" cartoons, featuring two Dilbert-esque cats and their hijinks at the office. Cat lovers are sure to appreciate and nod their heads knowingly at some of the sillier cartoons highlighting cats disdain for their human servants.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|All in all I found the movie very humorous and a great ending to the story line. The adventures of K and J are back in a whole new light, which makes this movie great from start to finish.<br />Boris, a creepy alien, tries to take down K as vengeance for the past. This main idea spawns the story around J needing to help fix the past as well as save a friend.<br />In all honesty, this really helps explain a little about both of K and J's backgrounds. However, if you watch the movie all the way through you get to see a connection between K and J, which is always interesting to me.<br />All in all, it's a great movie, very fun to watch. It's a little suspenseful. It adds a lot of great elements and funny ideas.<br />I highly recommend this to people. Especially those who have seen MIB parts 1 and 2.<br />Alright, I hope those that watch it enjoy<br /><br />To list a final note concerning my review: I left out some specifics due to spoiler avoidance. Hopefully this isn't a problem, but if you want me to go over something, I'd recommend commenting on my review and I'll try and go over it.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a great game to play I loved it<br />I loved the graphics and the hints helped a lot!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this book and it was from his point of view. Great read couldn't put it down. Romantic
B0044DEAUA|4.0|This unit is pretty good, pairs up instantly without a hitch and has an unbelievable range.  Sometimes I'll forget to disconnect from the unit and my phone will still be connected to my car in the driveway while I'm in the house causing me to miss a call.  (So it is possible to have long range Bluetooth devices ! )<br />Anyway the only issues I have with the buddy are sometimes the sound is distorted and I can't understand what is being said. Second is people tell me I sound like I'm in a bubble. Third is Due its placement on the visor i seem to pull the unit off as i pull down my visor... don' get me wrong on this, the buddy's magnet is very strong so the unit will not fall off when you go over major bumps and such.<br />Overall pretty good but guess I just think it could be better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. It couldn't have been any better! It's amazing the way Suzanne placed the events that took place.
B00136JQMI|5.0|Miles Davis is the epitome of jazz and the coolness of it. Kind of Blue makes me more than kind of happy!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|What a fun game!  My only complaint is it could be a bit quicker loading & between turns. So happy I could play it on my Kindle Fire
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always liked solitaire. It's fun and easy to play on my new kindle.I especially like being able to play it anywhere I go.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|Movie arrived when promised.  It has a little bit of the scare factor, but not jump out of your skin scarey.  Love getting discounted movies.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This movie is not what the audience thinks it's going to be from the previews. I don't want to ruin it, but it turns out to be more like a Japanese anime than anything else. The plot, is about as intelligent as a Japanese anime for kids. It insults adult intelligences. The movie was juvenile. Simple as that. It felt like a teenager made it. What was the point of altering Joseph Gordon Levitt's face, by the way? Absolutely none. This is not how Bruce Willis looked when he was 30! LOL. What a waste of special effects money. They put all that effort into his face, but then had the characters drive cars from the 90's and first decade of 2000. Unreal. I was also bothered by the fact that trained killers would use archaic six shooters. Ludicrous.<br /><br />I was on the fence about this movie, but then I realized that I can't recommend it in good conscience. It's bad. It's juvenile. Skip it.
B007TUAHVQ|4.0|This is a very good product.  Our almost nine year old grandson said it is cool but not as cool as bionicles. On a scale of 1 to 10<br />he gave it a 7 or 8.  He did have fun putting it together.  Guess we need to look for next stage of toys.
B007FRHZ4A|2.0|We purchased this game for our son for Christmas. The structures are very hard to build because the pieces don't stand well on their own (they are somewhat rounded versus flat) and, if your trying to build them according to the game instructions, the thin edges don't line up well. The game should award points for being able to build the structures, not shoot them down!!!<br />Overall, I would not recommend this game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you are a fan of any of these movies...this is a must buy!!!!  I already owned the 1st 2 on BluRay and was only going to buy the 3rd on its own, but for 5$ more I got all three in this case!!!!!  Traded in the old 2 and now have a sweet box set!!!  The IMAX looks incredible in HD and Bain is Villain of the year!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|sometimes I get bored and just need something to pass the time and this game helps me do that. It is also good for brain development.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The author made me feel as if Charlie was writing to me at times. As if the letters were addressed to me, and I was his \\"friend\\". Definitely not a light read. Really meant for High School and above. Anyone who has ever experienced life from the outside, or as an audience rather than a participant, will find themselves connecting to the main character.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it helps me to stay up to date with family and friends.  It is fun to see what everyone is doing.
B007N5YJYS|5.0|The Criterion Collection version of &#34;The 39 Steps&#34; is an excellent example of a film that had everything going for it except a decent copy to view.  If you like this movie you will love this version.
B009329Y30|5.0|I love this movie.  Great Bought it for a gift.  So I received it in time. Wish I could have got a better price.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I'm not afraid to admit that I was sad to have finished so soon. Bobby Singer has always been one of my favorite characters since they first introduced him. There was so much that we never got to k ow about him, and this was a good way of doing that. This book was so very insightful. I laughed loudly enough to catch the attention of my husband (this is his account) and convinced him that he should read this for himself.<br /><br />I loved how David went into full detail about what happened to his wife, what happened with Rufus, and where he went after the death of his (Bobby' s) wife. To learn about his time in Japan wad fulfilling!<br /><br />I recommend this book to any Supernatural and/or Bobby Singer fan!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|its ok a little on the trivial side but not a bad game by any means I would recommend as a good time waster
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Tried it out a bit, then planned to come back to it later.  Couldn't shut it off.  The sound kept playing even tho I was running other programs.  Didn't want the app to keep running and wear down my battery either.  That said, I am new to the app world, and what I did play was fun.  Ended up deleting it because I couldn't figure out how to shut it off.
B005THRTEY|5.0|Excellent !!!!! Great songs, great songwriter. Enjoyed every song on CD, want more of ED. Will buy next CD for sure!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game. I actually like it better than Bejeweled.  I like the sounds and the graphics.  They are not the gloomy sounds of Bejeweled. Good game.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|NOT ONLY WAS THE MURDER WEAPON DIFFERENT BUT SO WAS THE KILLER.  IT TOOK SEVERAL CHAPTERS BEFORE I REALIZED THAT I HAD SEEN THIS SHOW ON TV
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I absolutely loved that I could get all the movies for a great discount. I was able to buy this set while it was on sale, so it figured out to be like $5 a movie....<br />I had originally bought all of the movies as they came out, but in a recent move I lost all of them. So this was a great way to replace my set in a cost efficient manner.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is my first Dictionary app and I love having it available.  I teach SAT prep to Marines and they all have dictionary apps but now I have one too.  Thanks for the free version!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|i like the game but irritated that everytime i leave and come back,i have lost xp point.... they need to work on that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love reading the Bible and now I can do it without taking the actual book around.  This free version is very nice and I will use it often.  Thank you so much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this kindle edition book for only $3.99.  When I started reading it I thought, \\"Oh brother! It's a high school romance novel!\\"  I am a 45 year old married woman with teenagers. I almost put it down because I was worried it would give me nightmares about what my own kids are doing. Ha! I went back on Amazon to read reviews to see if it was a waste of my time.  Sometimes you can read a review and realize a teenager wrote it.  That was not the case for these reviews.  So I decided to go ahead and read a little bit at a time and trudge through it.  Well, I couldn't put it down.  I started reading it at 10:00am and finished it at 3:00am.  I did put it down but it was hard.  Sky and Holder are characters who have had to mature way beyond their years which is why I think it will appeal to an older audience.  As a teacher, I was always taught that the age of the main character is the intended age of the reader.  This book will appeal to a wide age range of readers.  Take a chance on it.  It is definitely worth your time.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I'd heard bad reviews for this movie so was skepticle. Overall, not a bad movie! Good pace, lots of action.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Movie about an old man struggling with failing eyesight who bickers with his uptight daughter.  Not a great movie with a cheesy ending that feels a bit too contrived.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is fun to play and doesn't require much attention, therefore making it a nice way to pass time.
B0031RS64G|1.0|This guy can't write prose. Poorest written book I've had the misfortune to read. Plot wise it might be okay, but the presentation is exceptionally poor
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I couldnt agree more with almost everything Kaio said. This is a standout app in an otherwise bleak market filled with knockoffs and crap asking for way too many permissions. I never review apps (mostly because I'm just too lazy and I don't care), but the controls are easy, game play is intuitive and challenging, and its one of the best FAOTD's that Amazon has put out in a long time. Thanks to Hitcents, Amazon and Kaio
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved all 3 books! One was not better then rest. Great story , so sad they ended! Would deff recommend
B000002C2E|5.0|i see why he won a bunch of grammy's that year,because its his best album since &#34;blood on the tracks&#34;.The song &#34;make you feel my love&#34; is the most gorgeous song he ever sang.You can hear&understand every word he says,and thats the truth.I love it,i love it,i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007XIC1GI|1.0|i am a big fan of his music but this book shows a differnt side he is nothing but a bully and a losser if any of the stories are actuly true that is but one thing i do know is he drinks alot of his own bath water nothing like being your own biggest fan
B00A8ECU24|4.0|So far,  this little game has been rather enjoyable. The progression has been steady and even, for the more part. I did end up having to farm my shops for about a day to finish the Applejack quest, but that was my own fault, as I cleared all the small clearables really fast. Most of the voices are directly from the show or at least extremely close to them.<br /><br />All in all, I am addicted!
B0038YWPZS|5.0|I've liked everything that Patrick Swayze was in - but this was the BEST!  Wish he was still here to make more.......
B003JTHXOK|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL READ.  IT HAS A SUSPENSEFUL PLOT WHICH MADE IT HARD TO PUT DOWN.  READ OF YOU ENJOY LOVE STORIES.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|Love these two together - great chemistry . Just wish it ended happier. They make great music together too. Must see.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best on kindle fire because you win points and it doesn't cost anything and with the points you earn you can get more games.
B000031EGV|4.0|This movie keeps you wondering what will happen next. Robin Williams is great in all his movies. Good for family nite.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was great loved the twists and mystery. I was ready to kill Gideon myself and tell Eva to move on. Great ending can't wait till May.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|great movie i love Clint great cast and outstanding performance i love baseball so this move was great for me
B007EECSFA|4.0|Kept your attention right from the start. Very good read . Hard to put down. Your emotions changed from one page to the next.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|After reading the first book, I just had to see where the relationship between Eva and Gideon was going to go. It was great and very mind twisting. It's interesting to see things from other perspective. Can't wait to read the third book.
0316212377|3.0|I like the science fiction genre, and Iain M. Banks seems to be a capable writer.  I prefer books written about humans rather than AIs with avatars.  But, it'll do.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not quite as good as the first book in the series, but I enjoyed Mockingjay. Couldn't put the book down. Thought it was a good conclusion to the series.
B00127RAJY|3.0|just ok. jillian is good and the tape is decent. would not be my favorite but it is good to switch up my routine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read - thoroughly enjoyed this book and could barely put it down. Much better than the movie. A must-read!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great read by Connelly.  Bosch never fails to keep the pages turning and as always leaves me sad when I finish.  Only wish Connelly could write them as rapidly as I read.  Here's hoping he is working on another .
B008XCPO2Q|4.0|Magic Mike is great for eye-candy, and it makes an attempt at a decent plot. Not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was entertaining.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Of course, music tastes are very personal.  We love Bob Dylan and this is yet another great album.  That says it all for me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not quite as good as the first book, but a good read. Definitely recommend reading the entire series. Catching Fire helps set the stage for Mockingjay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is cool and awesome I love it. It is like Temple run and Raze. I like Mystery or Question.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me on my toes the entire time. Can't wait to read the third book.  Can't wait to see if they make a movie out of this book.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Preface: I love Les Mis. I've seen it on stage several times. I've been listening to various stage recordings for years. I watch YouTube clips of the anniversary concerts. No matter how much a fan loves to see Les Mis finally on the screen, it's clear the vocals aren't theater-caliber. And that's OK! (I've given this 3 stars, not 1.) I love seeing great film actors with admirable vocal abilities put their stamps on these roles. I especially love watching the performances on screen. With stage recordings, I feel like I can relive the performances through the music alone. With the movie soundtrack, I am left yearning.<br /><br />I yearn for the divine range that the likes of Colm Wilkinson's Jean Valjean or Phil Quast's Javert possess. I do not mean to slight Jackman, Crowe, et al. But when I yearn to listen to Les Mis, I put in the London or Broadway or anniversary cast CDs/playlists. I knew what I was getting when I ordered this CD, and I was hesitant. I've listened a few times, and I enjoy it. But I enjoy it as an \\"OK/3 stars\\" work.<br /><br />And, as many have said, I yearn for the whole she-bang, which also knew I wouldn't be getting with one disc of highlights. As a fan, I'm so cognizant of what's being left out that it detracts from my enjoyment of what's there. I know they'll release a 2-disc set at some point, and I'm disappointed with myself for not being able to wait. I rarely purchase CDs anymore. It would have been just $5 for the MP3s versus $12 for the disc. I should not have invested in the disc.<br /><br />Finally, and I do genuinely feel apologetic with my 3-star review, because I love the material, and I love the performers who put their souls into this work, but listening to this CD and then listening to stage cast CD is like listening to a rock band's tribute group before hearing the real deal.<br /><br />You do get a rich grittiness from these recordings. Anne Hathaway is more devastating than any Fantine there ever was. I will not be critical ofany of the others, whom, again, I enjoy. But just OK/3 stars.
B005LAII12|4.0|Got this so my sister and I could watch it. We both were rolling! It was so funny. Great movie!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Excellent as always. Let me move on so I can buy this book and read it. Then I will review it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never saw the movie, absolutely loved this book.  The characters have such depth and the imagery so believe able.<br />I can not wait to read the next.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The plot in &#34;the Last Man&#34; is not as interesting as in his  previous books, however this one is still well done and well worth the read.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|it had two caculators on the screen need only one that would do margins and precentages. kind of like this review dumb requiring so many words when the right amout will work just fine.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Once you start playing you cannot stop, watching your own art be part of the game you are playing is so much fun! It is wonderful! I highly recomend it
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Awesome movie!!!!!<br />Funny.....<br />Mark Wahlberg was great in this movie.....<br />The thunder song was the highlight of the movie......<br />Definitely recommend
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Perfect for my Harry Potter fan. Everything is in one case, so all of the discs are together. Probably not what a collector wants, there are no special features, but great if you just want to have the entire collection of movies.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The ups and downs drove me crazy. Crying type crazy. But in the end I knew why. Wow! Loved it!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Just wondering.<br />And what is the story with the giant revolvers?<br />The drug use was a plus. eighteen nineteen words.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Little unrealistic things distract me and detract from what could be a great movie: holding pistols sideways, &#34;forever&#34; magazines with no reloading, and clothed sex. Real people get naked during sex. When I saw the list of actresses that were considered vs. Blake Lively I thought &#34;any one of them could have done better and would have gotten naked for the part&#34;. Even if I could forgive that the ending really sucked. The fake ending was slightly better than the real one but still will leave you feeling cheated.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun and tough at the same time. takes some thinking to evolve your bacteria in a way to 'kill the world' - and humans do get smarter
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best Angry Birds among its series ever.  I wish they had other themes about Angry Birds besides Star Wars, perhaps now that Disney owns Star Wars, maybe Angry Birds could do a crossover with Disney themed stuff in the future.
0767020308|5.0|A charming adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, with believable characters and a good pace throughout.  I highly recommend this version.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|i'M NOT SURE WHAT SEASON I WATCHED CUZ I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING NEW IN OVER A YEAR.  DOES THIS MEAN THAT SEASON 6  HAS NOT BEGUN YET?  i GUESS SEASON FIVE IS OLD AND OF COURSE I LOVED IT.  I TUNED IN ONLY TO DISCOVER I HAD ALREADY SEEN THE EPISODE... WHAT'S NEXT????
B00364K6YW|5.0|A very intriguing and well-acted production by all of the actors.  Beautiful scenery and sets.  A memorable version of theJane Austen classic.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I never cared for cats (had them on the farm I grew up on)....BUT this movie and all the sounds & great animation is awesome!<br />I may have to consider a furry friend in the future!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was AMAZEBALLS!!! Colleen Hoover is brilliant. It was such a great story! This is one of the best books I read in 2012!!!  Holder is awesome. One of my top ten book boyfriends :)  I loved Holder & Sky's relationship from the beginning.  This book was really touching and it had twists & turns throughout the entire book. 1 Click this book now. It is amazing and you will not be disappointed!!<br /><br />Loved it!! :)
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|An inspiring book about survival from a monster.  Jaycee ordeal  reminds us to have faith in the darkest times.  A must read!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Son is big fan and loves catching up on all the missed episodes.  Would seek season episodes again on this site..
B007DIQAXI|4.0|awesome upbeat album. I really enjoyed the music and the different types of instruments they play that you usually don't hear.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Son is a big fan of Marvel anything and was glad to recieve this as a gift.  Would seek similar items for future purshases.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|enjoyed this book from start to finish taken from different angle so the suspense was exciting and the end unexpected
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story!! I just love peeta and katniss=) he is so sweet! Cannot wait for the rest of the books!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A little too far fetched, but kept me interested until the end. I would recommend this to others. Not bad overall.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|It was good, really good. It was intense and dysfunctional and beautiful at the same time! The title is apt, and I'm looking forward to reading Walking Disaster when it is published. I think that the book showed how much Travis was willing to \\"grow\\" once he found Abby. It wasn't always easy and there were many bumps in the road.
030758836X|3.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Gillian Flynn's books.  She knows how to explore the extreme darkness in people in such a way that you have to really shake it off after you are finished reading one of her stories.  I read a lot of mystery/thriller types of books and it is maddening when the story is intense, but the writing is poor.<br /><br />That is NOT the case with Gillian Flynn.  She is an excellent writer.<br /><br />I am still reeling from the detailed, twisted story she created in Gone Girl.  I was literally left speechless.  I've honestly never encountered such a dysfunctional marriage/relationship in literature before.  The major twist in the story was a huge one - and one that I did not anticipate.  I would have given this book 5 stars just for that twist.<br /><br />But, oh, the ending.  I turned the page after the last sentence and expected something.  Another page.  An epilogue.  SOMETHING.  I was so let down, saying \\"wait - that is it? NOOO.\\"<br /><br />I still think it is a worthy read.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Could not put the books down.  One of the best I have read.  I love the main characters.  Will recommend to friends
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids love the game. Very similar to Temple Run. Works well on our Kindle Fire. Give it a try today.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is a great movie. It definitely is a different Bale than I was expecting, but it still satisfies. I would recommend it to anyone old enough. And Amazon's streaming service is excellent. We don't have the best internet connection, but it didn't need to buffer at all, unlike netflix. Very satisfied with my experience with Amazon.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Excellent game. Much better than Birds. I especially enjoy the aiming feature. Graphics are very good and very rich. 5 stars even though nothing is perfect.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|so much fun! it is just a little bit harder than diner dash because you have to watch how you pull the food out. it doesn't auto pair orders so if you're not watching you could have to throw away a lot of food which will hurt your score.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|It was good and had a lot of snow in the scenes. I like snow..<br /><br />Also, had a nice dog and cabin in the woods.<br /><br />If you like snow, dogs, or cabins, this movie is for you
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a great book full of love, scandal, humor, wit, and drama. Whether you are young or old, I am positive that this novel has an aspect of interest that will catch your attention right away. Set in an 18th century English society, Jane Austen does a fantastic job of adding comic relief and wit to a society where men have almost ultimate control. The estate of the Bennet family is entailed to Mr. Collins, so the five Bennet daughters must find suitable husbands if they wish to have a home or property in the future. The book revolves around conversation and thoughts the characters have about each other. Austen never gives a complete physical description of the characters, so the reader is left to make an opinion on each character based on their first impression of them. This style of diction and syntax eventually leads to the discovery of a major theme: do not always trust your first impression of someone. Irony is another common device Austen used in the novel. The Bennet's second daughter, Elizabeth, and Mr. Darcy end up falling for each other despite every obstacle that was thrown at them. Problems with social status, money, Mr. Darcy's pride, and Elizabeth's refusal to settle on a man caused drama in the beginning stages in their relationship. The novel's ending proved that one should not judge a person on a first impression and that true love truly can conquer all. Those facts will always make to novel relevant to current times, contrary to those who call the novel out of date. Read this novel and fall in love!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I downloaded this for my granddaughter.  She didnt know what to do to interact with the app and I even thought it was boring.  Not for a small child.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|All of us went through the entire year, and guess what? NOTHING HAPPENED! I would figured that it takes further than 2012, maybe between 5-20 years.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|A really fun little hidden object/puzzle game. I like that it isn't just hidden objects. Just started playing, hopefully won't stop me 1/4 in and ask me to pay.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Action packed finish to the fast paced adventures of Katniss and the rest of the Hunger Games participants. A must read for all those who enjoy action thrillers.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|If ever you think you've been dealt a bad hand, after reading this book you will be so thankful for the life you have.  This is graphic and not for children.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys fairy tails. This film is NOT blood and guts fantasy like most of the movies today. It has humor and action but NOT gore. For a low budget film the acting is first rate and the Trolls are amazingly done. The ending is a little weak but not to bad. Highly recommend this to anyone that wants to just see an entertaining film.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|I purchased this for my daughter but found that I loved revisiting an old friend!  Whats NOT to like when you have a good book to read?  Thanks for the opportunity to reKINDLE (HA!) an old friendship!
B0014NDXGA|1.0|Item itself is not the issue.  I received a factory reconditioned rangefinder, not a new one.  This was not indicated in the online posting.  Additionally, the item was poorly packaged...the bubble wrap was deflated and the item was not well protected.  My husband elected to keep the item as it was functional, rather than even attempt a return.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Would like it better if I could pick several different games to play not just 10 at a time. Not being able to go to a different game until finishing the first 10 is annoying. good time waster, but not worth a lot of time.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great story line and we found it to be entertaining throughout.  Cast did a good job with acting and signing.  The ending completed the movie.
0307346617|5.0|I love this book so much!<br />have a good new year! :D<br />I how fast it came in the mail.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is a great way to get to your PC or laptop desktop. You have full access to the files and applications on your \\"mother ship\\" from anywhere in your house. Haven' t tried internet access yet.<br /><br />Note: it's critical that you set Splashtop to use your computer's native screen resolution. Otherwise, it reverts to 1024x768, and then you have to reset the PC/laptop screen resolution after disconnecting.<br /><br />I' m running this on my Kindle Fire HD, so the screen res issue is important. Expect your PC/laptop to operate a little sluggishly, but this is a great app and I'm glad I found it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Was a wonderful book very interesting kept me on my toes reading. Much better than the movie lots of more details. I would strongly recommend anyone and everyone to read it.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon.  The cheesey (and canned) music score.  The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon.  The also overused helicopter shots.  The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust).  The inept plot.  Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting.  Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels.  The endless stream of former A list actors showing up.  Etc.<br /><br />This movie is another train wreck.  Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.<br /><br />Ugh.
B0073U2F12|3.0|Some interesting 3D views of Moscow (as mentioned by someone else, great crowd control during shooting to create some nice scenes of the city). The plot is so-so, but I bought it for being one of the reasonably priced 3D Blu-rays available.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Best $.99 I have ever spent!!  I'm totally addicted ... I admit it freely and proudly!!  I lost a few of my favorite games when I got my Kindle Fire HD, but now I have a new favorite!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|having a lot of fun with call of Atlantis ... the different levels are fun and each city changes things up the keep it interesting. great game.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie depicted a &#34;gentler&#34; time as well as the story of Beatrice Potter.  The manners and mores of the time were refreshing and the movie was beautifully done.  Beverly Reynolds
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A great bible. It works very well with my kindle. Easy to use and has all the translation I need.
0810994739|5.0|I am one of &#34;those&#34; moms.  My kids are not allowed to see a movie until they've read the book.  So when my daughter asked if she could see the Wimpy Kid movies, I said no.  Her twin brother had read all the books (but had no real desire to see the movies for some reason), but he had taken them out at the school library and since these books are so popular, she was having trouble checking them out.  So I relented and bought this for her.  She devoured it and went on the the next in the series.  These books can't come out fast enough for my kids!
B007HO392S|5.0|I love the artist, her music and her style of music.  The packaging was strong enough to keep the CD undamaged but was also easy to open.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|I wanted my kids to experience this movie as I did when I was their age and it still is adorable after all these years!  I even remembered a lot of the songs, much to my children's chagrin!  I got this on a lightning deal for 8.99 but I would definitely have spent the $12!  So glad these classics from my childhood are being put on DVD format!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Limited free coins make the play time too short.  Like the real machines the game odds are stacked against you.
0810993139|5.0|I am one of &#34;those&#34; moms.  My kids are not allowed to see a movie until they've read the book.  So when my daughter asked if she could see the Wimpy Kid movies, I said no.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|Of course this retelling of Cinderella is just as much fiction as the fairy tale itself, but this one just could be possible which the fairy tale can't.  I also loved the part Leonardo Da Vinci plays in bringing the two lovers together.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great deal for a great game. I am loving playing through the different levels. It's fun. Highly recommend this game
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I love the book A Christmas Carol and have read it every year for over 40 years.  I also like many of the adaptions.  I tend to judge an adaption not by how closely it sticks to the book, but how closely it makes me feel when I read the book.  I really like this adaption.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|This is just as fun as the original angry birds, with a dash of my favorite geeky franchise thrown in. What's not to love? I did give it a 4 because the instruction isn't quite as good as the original angry birds. I had to do some online digging to figure out how to use the force...
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|There are no instructions with this ap except occasional boxes of info. Goodness knows how it actually works...it is anybody's guess. I am going back to pen and paper!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Killer deal. I don't have a Blu-ray player, but this combo was cheaper than the amazon digital download. So.... my bf gets the Blu-ray, I get the dvd and the digital download. It works well. The movie is FANTASTIC too, but that should be obvious. ;)
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have been reading Rick Riordan's series since The Lightning Thief, and I never cease to be amazed. The twists he takes you on, the way he switches between the characters, and the story he packs into his work make you feel as if you are there. It's impossible to put down!
0345505387|5.0|This is a graphic novel. Which is pretty much a long comic book. If you don't like comic books, don't get this. I happen to enjoy graphic novels, and I love Diana Gabaldon, so I really enjoyed this. I crave any additional information about Jamie and the rest, so this was a nice little taste. As far as graphic novels go, I didn't love the artwork, but that is a personal taste. It was still very good, just not a style I loved.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|Like any movie about cancer, the end was really heartbreaking, but the lead up to the end was a thought provoking and wonderful journey. The movie starts at James' 29th birthday, his last because cancer will take his life before his next birthday. His three best friends agree to take him camping to his favorite place on Earth. Their trek to the site is full of mishaps and a meeting with a truly interesting beachcomber. There are plenty of laughs, as you would expect with four best friends, but there's also some truly touching and sad moments as well.<br /><br />It's a very heavy movie, grab some tissues.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Love this band. The single &#34;It's Time&#34; is extraordinary, but the rest of the CD is great as well. I don't think you will be disappointed!
B001G7HKZ4|5.0|I really love this movie. From the setting to the costumes to the script to the actors. I think this movie is really well done. Amy Adams is lovely as the bubble-headed actress, Lee Pace is wonderful as the stilted lover, Frances McDormand is fantastic as the down-on-her-luck Miss Pettigrew and Cirian Hinds is charming as the love interest for Miss Pettigrew. I truly enjoy this movie every time I watch it.
B007FEGH7Y|5.0|I saw this band open for Metric in September. I really enjoyed the set, so in between them and Metric, I purchased the album. I listened to it the next day and was blown away. The live performance was killer, and this cd was even better. I listen to it often. The only complaint I have is.... I want more!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I tried another &#34;drawing&#34; app but found that it just doesn't work so well on a Kindle device that is solely for an adult.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I adore Phil Collins music and when I bought this album for 3.99. Using mp3 rewards from AMAZON it only cost me 99 cents. Now I adore Phil's music and Amazon.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I got this just before the winter storms were arriving for the holidays and it was great to see what was current and expected in the forthcoming days.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great on my Kindle Fire, I can add many towns and wheel from on to the other.  Has all the information I need to view the weather for the next few days.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|I like having the extra battery life and the shooting buttons on the sides make shooting in vertical mode much easier.<br /><br />Extra weight makes it a 4 but everything else is a 5!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Has all the information you need to connect while on the go.  I have it on my Kindle Fire and I love it.  Use it everyday and can't be with out it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very much fun. Keeps you challenging yourself to go faster.<br /><br />I recommend it for all ages. Great fun for all.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Loves this program it keeps me interested for hours.  Great tiles and programs it has not disappointed. You will love this program.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Very Creative Concept FOr A Game, Make YouR Own CharacteR To PLay With.Story Board Adventure With Your Own FLair. Great Fun
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was so much better than the movie. It was both romantic and exhilarating. It gave you a glimpse of who the characters really are and the love they have for each other.<br /><br />I rated it 5 stars because it was one of The best books that I have ever read. I did not dislike anything.
1250006341|5.0|It arrived in perfect condition.  And..it's a great book!  It was a gift, and she loved it.  Thank youvery much
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I first played this game when I was...well...I wasn't thinking clearly due to certain beverages. I was able to easily understand the game even then, and when I was no longer impaired I liked the game even more. I keep my set in a little bag and just take it with me when I go out. It passes time in restaurants, during meetings, and other activities where you're sitting on your thumbs and forgot a book or whatever. It's also good if you have friends with kids because it's just so easy to pick up.<br /><br />Overall 5/5
B0076DEJMO|4.0|I feel fortunate to have stumbled on Joe Abercrombie a few years ago. Beyond Tolkien, I've read precious little fantasy--the first of George R.R. Martin, Stephen King's The Dark Tower series, and not much else.<br /><br />On the other hand I've read a lot of Larry McMurtry's novels on the American West, and make no mistake: \\"Red Country\\" is a western. Many tropes of the genre are there: a cattle drive, a gold strike, a wild frontier town, fear of attack by \\"Ghosts\\" (Abercrombie's stand-in for American Indians, complete with necklaces of human ears), the theme of who are the \\"real savages\\", etc. There's a lot of Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" here along with \\"Deadwood\\". Of course, Abercrombie's work has always been slight on \\"high fantasy\\" elements but they're completely absent here; practically the only concession is the characters still carry swords. (That said, Abercrombie had already previously introduced gunpowder into his universe, and when you consider that in a recent interview he said his next trilogy would jump ahead about 25 years and include elements of industrialization, I'm certain pistols aren't far off for his characters.)<br /><br />So it's not fantasy. Is it a good western? I'm pretty sure it is...but I have to admit my bias--I'm a fan of Abercrombie's prior work and this one stands on the shoulders of it to a great degree. There's long stretches where things move slowly, especially as the more charismatic of the two popular returning characters seems to disappear for a couple hundred pages. Of all Abercrombie's books I've found this to be the most pure as a page-turner, yet he stumbles for tense climatic moments. Antagonists come and go as the book rolls on, none proving to be as stout or menacing as first perceived, to say nothing of how poorly they measure up to Lamb, Abercrombie's barely-disguised most famous character who returns here. Ultimately I think it is Lamb that makes this hardest for me to review: the cast of characters is much weaker here than I've grown accustomed (new character Shy is one-dimensional) but Lamb is such a beloved force of nature I couldn't wait to see what happens next. (Although Abercrombie loyalists will spend the whole novel either anticipating or dreading Lamb's confrontation with Caul Shivers, either way, it seems a letdown.)<br /><br />In the end, I read this book faster than any I have in a long while. I laughed out loud several times, including at a clever allusion to one of Obi-wan Kenobi's lines in the original Star Wars. Abercrombie writes violence exceptionally well. And yet, I just don't think it's as good as his other stuff. If Lamb hadn't been you-bloody-know-who I wonder if I would have been as engaged?<br /><br />One more point: while Abercrombie cleanly nicks the Saruman-in-the-Shire bit from LOTR as part of his denouement, he also avoids in my opinion a problem he's had with deus ex machina. Readers of his prior works know that in \\"Best Served Cold\\" a completely overpowered character in the end nearly ruins the climax while the seemingly omnipotent wizard Bayaz walks the same line in not only the First Law trilogy but shows up with the mechanism that turns the tide in \\"The Heroes\\". Abercrombie avoids this tendency in \\"Red Country\\". Maybe that's because the enemies don't measure up, but I prefer to give Abercrombie the credit, especially since he sets up one such too-perfect-to-be-believed resolution...and then cleverly reveals that it wasn't so perfect after all.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's Angry Birds. Shoot birds that are angry at a green pig or pigs and quietly curse yourself for missing shots you should have made and then get embarrassed because you weren't as quiet in your curing as you thought you were.<br /><br />It's cute and simple, and I think that is the draw for me. I can pop it on when I have a few minutes, like at a restaurant when waiting for my food, or for something to do before a movie starts. I don't feel invested, and that's exactly what I want in diversion.<br /><br />4/5 Good enough for what I use it for, not as good as other things.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I Love this game as much as I love where's my water. A lot of fun and with a Phineas and Ferb theme even better.
0062060562|3.0|The reviews of this were mixed with many I read scoffing because the author of the review figured out the end before getting halfway through it. But really. Is figuring out the plot twist of a novel all that bad?  I had figured it out about halfway through the novel as well, but rather than blame the author for it, I continued to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the ride. For doing so I was rewarded with an entertaining read. No, it's probably not something I would reread, but for a holiday weekend it was a perfectly good waste of time. Don't expect it to be shelved between of the great literary works, or to be a great mind expander. But for a novel picked up casually and read for pure escapism, this one will definitely meet those needs.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have red all 3 of Ms. Flynn's books.  Sharp Objects is still my favorite.  This one I really liked because of the twists and turns as well as the ending. My only real regret is that I read the table of contents (even though my Kindle starts me at the beginning of the book, I always go to the cover and read as if I'm holding a printed book). The TOC actually lessens the impact of the plot.<br /><br />So, read the book, but not the TOC and you'll love it!
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought the collection for my wife Christmas and she really loves she watches it every chance she get...So I would recommend this gift for your woman
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this puzzle app, unlike so many other apps you don't have to worry about the pieces being in your way.....the sideboard for the puzzle pieces are awesome.  So many others I have downloaded does not give you the choice to increase the puzzle pieces...this one does..love it!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is very exciting and a great passtime without causing any anxiety.  I love playing bejewled, and this game adds an extra challenge!  I haven't gotten very far on it yet, but have enjoyed every level I have played so far.. it *does* get more challenging as you proceed but you can earn extra little bonus's that allow you to add time, bomb some of the screen if you are stuck, etc.. it warn you when you are running out of time too, and it comes in handy!  I would definately reccommend this game!
B009E9QOEO|2.0|Let's all be honest for a moment and set aside our Zeppelin worship to give this CD an honest review.<br /><br />We all love Led Zeppelin.  They changed the course of rock and their sound is as fresh today as it was 40 years ago.  Their songs still strike awe in those of us who appreciate composition and a rock-solid rhythm section.<br /><br />This CD is not worth 10 cents.<br /><br />In the booklet that comes with the double-CD, the musicians tell us that they rehearsed for 6 months to prepare for this concert.  Six months?  Sounds more like 6 minutes.  Professional musicians with 6-months time should sound much tighter and cleaner.  What were they doing all that time, telling war stories and talking about the good ol' days?<br /><br />Jimmy Page's playing is so messy and sloppy it almost seems that he didn't show up for the rehearsals at all.  To be certain he's always been a sloppy player which is a shame because he's a fantastic musician and songwriter.  Too bad his guitar playing skills never matched his genius.  He had 27 years between Zeppelin disbanding and this concert to become a better guitar player.  I don't know what he did during that time, but it is apparent that he didn't work on growing as a musician.<br /><br />Robert Plant seems absolutely lost in Whole Lotta Love and seems to sleepwalk through much of the other tunes.  For a guy with such a gifted voice it's sad to see what's happened.  The harmonica solo in Nobody's Fault but Mine is embarrassing.  It's OK Robert - you can get back to the music you really want to sing because it's obvious you didn't want to do this.<br /><br />John Paul Jones - where's that passive Jazz bass sound that defined Zeppelin for so many years?  His bass sounds sterile and without character.  His playing is outstanding however, and it's the sole bright spot on on this CD.<br /><br />Jason Bonham does a serviceable job, but he's overplaying throughout the whole show.  He shows us that he's a very good drummer but he does not fit with Led Zeppelin (even this sad version of Led Zeppelin).  Sure - the bright lights and enormity of the moment likely got to him as it would all of us, but he's playing too much, too fast (not tempo-wise - his timing is solid).  His drums lack the tone that defined John Bonham's and Led Zeppelin's sound.  To compare anyone to John Bonham is unfair to be truthful - his playing was so unique and difficult to duplicate - but I expected Jason to come close.<br /><br />Celebration Day is a poor performance that perhaps should not have been released; I've heard Zeppelin cover bands that sound much better than this.  It gets two stars from me *only* because of the brilliance of John Paul Jones and the inclusion of In My Time of Dying and For Your Life in the set.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|If you like angry birds you will love this game.  Runs smooth on kindle hd fire and is challenging but fun.
1400049628|3.0|Okay...it was a mistake.  I read War World Z and then picked this one up.  Not a good idea.  If you are looking for something as a gag gift, here you are.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I could not put this book down and finished it in one day.  To say it simply, and to echo what another reader said, this book is straight out of the Twilight zone....this was a great read.  Blake Crouch is a masterful writer.  I will definitely be reading more of his work.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Loved it. It was exactly what i was looking for. Arrived promptly in great condition.now i dont have ti suffer until the season resumes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|luv the app luv I can also pin it directly to my kindle so I can use even w/o wifi
B009VB97EY|1.0|This was the worst movie. Acting was horrible, story line was ridiculous. Can't believe I wasted my free rental on this. The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I got to see Joe Manginello.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I had Bruno's first album playing in my car for nearly two years, so I eagerly awaited this new release. I've listened to it for three weeks now and I think it's fantastic. The songs really get under your skin. The two hits (I'm assuming \\"Young Wild Girls\\" will be the next single and another hit) are great, but it's the songs that showcase Bruno's voice and his softer side that I like the best--\\"If I Knew\\" and \\"When I Was Your Man.\\" Bruno Mars clearly is the genuine article, and he will be around making music we love for a long long time!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some people want action and story, but don't want the details.  I've always been disappointed in readers who would take out that which makes a story deeper, rounder and more personal.  So much of an author's philosophy is written between the lines of detail.  It's how we become acquainted with the intimate sides of the characters' personalities, intentions, and quirks.<br /><br />Each of Hugh Howey's stories took me deeper into his world.  His writing just gets better with each story.  Then, in \\"First Shift - Legacy\\" he writes, \\"And like the field of psychology, or any field that involved human nature, the things that made no sense usually served some deeper purpose\\".  I read that quote four or five times - savoured it's insight into the universe of a gullible society functioning blindly, from carefully crafted & cultivated fear and superstition; these being the tools of survival of the species through control.<br /><br />I agree with the reader who said that this series in destined to be a classic.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Product arrived on time as described.  Rush is a great band.  This album is TOTALLY worth having especially if you are a completist-type collector.  I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He loves RUSH.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I am very happy with the sound track. It has all the songs the girls and guys both sang not other background songs.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Good show just not as good as the fist one.  Still lots of action actors and the jokes they make are too funny!!!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Sad that this serious had to end but the was a good movie and great AMAZON purchase. it (the movie) was not better than part 2 but Part 2 was a classic and should not be compared with. Please pick it up (or rent it through AMAZON) if you are a Batman fan.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|If one could leave out all the &#34;sexy&#34; details, you will love this story.  It is a beautiful love story and one really needs to read all 3 books to understand and learn what kind of person Christian is.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I rented this movie for a date night and it was a perfect ending to the night. I would recommend others who are interested in the mission impossible brand to check it out.
030758836X|5.0|Even though we have our elecronic devides to read books etc. on, I appreciate a paperback book at times.  Amazon has the best prices, and it is my &#34;go to&#34; place to shop.
B004G8QHKO|4.0|This CD is great for working out, though a bit punkier than I expected.  Still a wonderful CD and I would recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was so amazing i once read for five hours strait!<br />Three words to describe this; romantic, thrilling, amazing.<br />It was just so cool how Suzanne Collins described how peeta or katniss would give up their life for eachother just so that one or none can win. :D
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Everyone in this movie is hard to understand.  Batman and his silly \\"disguised\\" voice and Bane and his mask, make this movie \\"unhearable\\".  And...why can't batman keep his mouth closed?  His mouth is always just hanging open...Is his mask too tight, does he have a cold?<br /><br />Bad long movie!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is addicting, its stable on the kindle fire hd 7&#34; but not on my zte warp but hey a larger screen is whats needed to play this game best. It does need more options in weapons (eg. virus, fungus, and nano-virus) Just something different, maybe a mix.
054520707X|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. I like the fact that the voice of Sam was replaced in this book. Sounded more like I imagined him.
B0058YPILY|5.0|Great season, great quality.  Of course now that we have &#34;streaming&#34; I don't buy many seasons of my favorite shows but it is still nice to have the &#34;hard copies&#34;
B000FC2OHA|5.0|The first five chapters are the most significant practices, to be done daily.<br />Talking about the basic concepts with others will help big them to life.<br />Look for at least 4-7 applications for each chapter, and you'll have lots to practice.<br />Create mind maps of each chapter as you go and dip back into into the ones where you're having problems for quick solutions.<br />The four questions from Dan Kennedy's program in the relationships section are AMAZINGLY effective. I've asked them of everyone I care about.<br /><br />Edit: Jack has put out a new book, Tapping Into Ultimate Success, which greatly helps the process of integrating the success principles. I recommend it also.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Again, this was part of an Angry Bird package for a grandchild who loves them.  The game arrived in great conditon, looked like it would be fun, and did, indeed, bring laughs when opened at Christmas.  It was in perfect conditon, and the shipping was fast and packaged well.  The price was good and I just knew that it would bring lots of fun for the family to play.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Chose one new Christma album this year and Rod Stewart does not disappoint. Every song is incredible with Stewart's unique voice, perfect arrangements and incredible background instruments. I listen while showering, waking up or going to sleep, in the car. And I'm not ready to put it away till next Christmas.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|My husband is a vet, and loves these kinds of movie's, he was very happy with it. And enjoyed it A LOT
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game! Great graphics and when you tap something the action happens immediately. I just played cake mania main street and was so frustrated! I almost broke my kindle screen from tapping it so hard! This game has great graphics and its easy to maneuver. Great job!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Recommended by my nephew. Took his advice and it was a great decision. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Great to see Harry Bosch back in action and causing trouble again in his quest to find the truth. Towards the end it was hard to put down. If you like Michael Connelly and Harry Bosch you will enjoy this novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing!!! Couldn't have asked for a better book... can't wait to watch the movie!!! Hope everyone else liked it as much as I did
B008602KQI|5.0|Love it!!  The fact that this movie actually follows the book blows my mind.  I loved the book series and was hopeful when I heard about the movie.  Well, I wasn't disapointed,  Jennifer Lawrence delivers and is perfect as our Herione.  Also, can I just say, I'm a grown woman and I totally think that Josh Hutchenson (sp?) was such a cutie!  Well played on both parts, I can't wait to see the next movie! :-)
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Another gameloft game that was released before all the bugs were worked out. Only reply from costumer support when I tried to contact them some issues &#34;We know about it and are working on it&#34;. That was 2 days after the release of the kindle version. so if they knew about the issues why did they release it before fixing them?
B00APUYWYA|5.0|So, this was funny, more funny than I expected originally.  The singing is great too, so if you like musicals, glee, singing in the shower, the car or in general - this is a good movie choice for you.  The &#34;Fat Amy&#34; chica was in Bridesmaids as well, but we didn't get a real sense of her acting or comedy in that movie.  After seeing her in this I'm a total fan, she was hillarious.  This is a complete chick flick, but that being said, it's enjoyable and fun for anyone watching.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Don Draper gets a toothache. Mad Men is awesome and you know it.  I would recommend you watch the episodes sequentially.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|The game play was ok the fx I have to say wow, but the end is just blah in my book and no real story....idk the last 2 games are better I would say...but like I said good fx
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is a great experience in creativity and is fun to play it both in a serious and in a trolling manner. 5 stars for those who will put forth the effort to try something creative.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|a most modern tale of aliens yet to last, thought provoking & techno stunning, excellelant storyline! and yet there are still more qustions that need answering but there will be a sequel.....a must buy!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Wow!  This book kept me guessing if the true bad guys would get away with it, but about 3/4 of the way through it became clear they would not.  Love Vince Flynns writing but needs to hide the ending a little better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a adventurous and exciting book which is also a romantic love story. Definitely an amazing book by Suzanne Collins
B001JIES4Q|4.0|Charming story. This is enjoyable for light entertainment.  A bit disconnected but still a favorite.  It is a &#34;chick film&#34; but that's OK.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This was one of the first apps I downloaded for my Fire and it works great.  I really like the weather map!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is compelling and thoughtful. It causes one to think about the impact of war on children and the people who must live in a war zone.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|awful, amazon streaming stinks, near the end of the movie the streaming is interrupted . the last ten minutes takes about 30 min to complete Horrible
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The poor writing style of this book caused me concern, espcially since it is targeted to young adults.  The author and editor(s) should have modeled good grammar.  As an adult I also found the story insipid.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|This was just something to kill the time, would not recommend. Also the movie stopped repeatedly at the end so I don't know what happened in the end. Thanks amazon
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read the other books by this author and really liked them. This book was to date the best she's written. The characters are dynamic and witty. I felt genuinely sad when the characters  were etc. Without giving away the plot, be prepared for the twists and emotional rollercoaster.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I have always held Stephen King's &#34;The Stand&#34; as my favorite book of all time, until now. it's that good. Buy it now, you will not regret it! Btw the audio book on Audible.com is superb!
B008NMT684|4.0|This one is good, but both of my toddlers ran through it very quickly. There aren't a bunch of puzzles to do. This was more challenging for my 2 year old, for my 3 year old it was a bit beneath her level. She completed the puzzles in minutes and was looking for something else to do. For my 3 year old, the best part is popping the bubbles that come onto the screen after completing a puzzle. We use this app on the kindle fire.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I love all of the Angry Birds and Piggies, however I am disappointed with this one because I can't play it. As stateted above I purchased the ad free.....no go, so I down loaded the free version.......Again to none avail.<br /><br />I have uninstalled several times still .........&#34;no fly zone&#34;.....Please help!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The movie was great.  I grew up reading the comics and watching the cartoon. The spaecial effects were killer!!  Great cast in this movie also.  If you like super heroes then this is what to watch.
0061673730|5.0|The journey has no destination, very deep.  &#34;A Culture Carrier&#34;. Representitve of the time when we were tired of the &#34;Status Quo&#34;
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This is just a stupid action movie with all the stars from yesteryear.  Don't expect anything more and you won't be disappointed.  It's got some funny moments and surprise appearances that I enjoyed.
6305882592|3.0|It was a very bizarre and strange movie! It had<br />a strong 60's attitude. It did have a really cool<br />Car in it!
B000GL1BHO|3.0|This item was a bit smaller then what I had hoped for but our child loved it anyway. The colors are very realistic and the material is very durable.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much, Kare Morton takes you with her as she tells the story of this family.
B004JQN4WM|3.0|This item was a bit smaller then what I had hoped for but our child loved it anyway. The colors are very realistic and the material is very durable.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Not your normal romance loved it!! Really knew how to reel in her audience, will be looking for more of her books
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best card game. Easy to use and it's great on my new Kindle Fire HD. The big screen makes it even better.<br /><br />When I don't have my Kindle I play it on my IPhone 5 Too.<br /><br />Love it.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|This book is packed full with great information.  I've been doing CFE for about a year now and have seen my two mile time GO from a 14:30 to a 12:44.  Being able to apply the running mechanics I have learned in this book has me thoroughly excited about reaching my goal of a 12 min two mile and to complete my first half marathon this summer.  Buy this book!
B008469DGY|4.0|Great app, great graphics a lot of fun. Due get this app you will love it. You won't get bored .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I give this book 5 stars! It kept me very anxious and I couldn't put it down. I'm very excited to see the movie in February.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like that with one click Facebook is right at my finger tips and everything is very easy to use. I do wish that you could do a few other things but we won't get into that on here. MUST DOWNLOAD!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a book that I couldn't put down. Many will say it's like 50 shades and it kind of is but this book is so much better! I would tell all my friends about this book. I fell in love with Gideon<3
0393320928|4.0|Feynman is inspiring!  His books are fun and easy readers! This was a well written second book to follow, Surely Your Joking...
030758836X|4.0|FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES A MYSTERY.  A TWISTY TURNY STORY WHERE NO ONE IS WHAT THEY SEEMS TO BE.  SURPRISES AT EVERY TURN OF THE PAGE.  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE LARGE BLOCKS OF TIME TO READ, YOU WILL NOT WANT TO STOP.
B002GY9F9K|2.0|The writers of the screenplay used names and objects from the book, then adapted it to a weekly sitcom format.  They stole sub-plots from older sitcoms and sci-fy/fantasy shows in a haphazard way.  This was a so-so series.  If someone had never read the book or was completely illiterate, they might enjoy it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Graphics are good, like the way you can turn the music off (altho it's oddly comforting and relaxing), sound effects are pretty funny.<br />Recommended.
B009CG9CXO|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Showed my kids this movie for the first time... They loved it!! Canceling our beach vacation for this coming summer...... Jk.
B0055SWM08|3.0|Yep it is a game of which I feel that I can sometimes see it out of the corner of my eye
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift has mastered the art of clever lyrics yet again.  She never ceases to impress as she continues to excel as a lyricist and a performer.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|It was like watching a bad family guy episode. Even at $1.99 it cost too much. Don't waste your money
B005HSL626|5.0|Great fun! Not quick enough yet and still using the zen level but enjoying it yada yada yada yada yada
030716327X|5.0|Purchased this for a baby shower because it was my kids' first book. The book is just as sweet as I remember, but the bunny made it even more so. Excellent gift for the price too!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is the first hungry shark I've played. I had a little trouble with the download. I think it was just my horrible wireless network (it's a little slower than the others ) other than that IT'S A GREAT DEAL
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Perfect! What... you expected less??? This is the first book I actually enjoyed reading on my Kindle more tyhan a traditional paper copy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Many people don't seem to like this book because it's so different from the first two books. And I have to admit that I initially hated this book when I finished it. But it did the one thing that most books fail to do, it made me think. When I finish most books I feel happy, complete and content. Not this book. I felt incomplete. Which is the way Katniss felt at the end. The ending was so real. I've never felt so connected to a character after a book. It wasn't the ending I hoped for but one that I needed.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|The songs are extraordinary but who in his right mind thougt that \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" was not a Higlight?  The music is great but I think that we should wait until a \\"Complete Recording\\" is available.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The much anticipated movie adaptation of \\"Les Mis&eacute;rables \\" has arrived, and director Tom Hooper deserves praise for infusing Victor Hugo's iconic story of Jean Valjean with drama and profound emotion.  Hugh Jackman is superb as the former thief who is pursued relentlessly by his nemesis, Inspector Javert (a ruthless and bitter Russell Crowe), but Valjean focuses on redeeming himself by treating others with kindness.  Anne Hathaway is affecting as the desolate Fantine, forced into prostitution in order to support her child.  Valjean mercifully adopts Cosette, Fantine's daughter, after her mother's untimely death.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen are deliciously over-the-top as the Th&eacute;nardiers, greedy innkeepers who steal from their customers and extort cash from Fantine for Cosette's upkeep while they keep the lonely girl in rags. Samantha Barks's show-stopping solo, \\"On My Own,\\" is thrilling.  Eddie Redmayne and Amanda Seyfried are appealing as Marius and the adult Cosette.  Finally, the wonderful Colm Wilkinson lights up the screen in his brief appearance as the Bishop.<br /><br />Why see this film if you have already taken in the Broadway show?  First, Hooper distills the essence of the plot without getting bogged down in extraneous exposition.  He elicits terrific performances from actors whose faces and voices are beautifully expressive.  Since much of the dialogue is sung, it is worth pointing out that the sound quality is excellent and the performers take pains to speak and sing distinctly (not a given in today's films).  Claude-Michel Sch&ouml;nberg and Alain Boublil's score and Herbert Kretchmer's lyrics are often soaring, at other times tear-filled and poignant, and always unforgettable.<br /><br />The audience with whom we viewed \\"Les Miserables\\" was visibly moved by this tale of self-sacrifice, love, and salvation.  For an expensively mounted musical production, it is surprisingly intimate.  We grow to care about the characters and are transported from the darkened theater to the turbulence of nineteenth century France.  Vive \\"Les Mis&eacute;rables\\" and bravo to Tom Hooper and his exceptional cast.transported from the darkened theater to the turbulence of nineteenth century France.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game absolutely rocks. It doesn't hammer you with constant popups like most other freebies. The game play is very smooth and I have yet to notice any glitches. There is an option to purchase extra coins, but it is not necessary to have a blast with this game.
B0097HSS4M|2.0|I found this application to be too limiting.  I ended up removing it from my device as soon as I found a different application that met my needs.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have been using the ESV Study Bible for several years now, and have just used it extensively while studying for ordination.  It has extensive charts (like a chart that puts all the kings of Northern and Southern kingdoms in relationship to the various prophets and major events), maps, introductions to individual books which interact with the most recent scholarship, and tools for considering the text from a literary perspective (what was an author seeking to accomplish by giving a book the shape he did, how does the OT inform our reading of the NT, etc.).  I have recently purchased the Kindle edition and, despite some fears that it would be hard to get the same value out of a digital edition have very much enjoyed the experience; now it's not only searchable, but also I get all the benefits of the print edition without having to lug it around on a hand cart!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I normally do NOT like zombie stuff.  However, this series is awesome!  there is a killer story line behind all the blood and guts that makes it perfect for either gender.  Totally worth you money to add this to your collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started reading this book at 10pm...and was still reading it at 4am the next morning.  I literally could not put it down.  I was very intrigued with the main characters, Sky and Holder. The mystery of how they are connected and the way in which their relationship develops is confusing, heart-breaking, exciting, tender, and heart-racing at times.  (Some of the subject matter and language is too strong for children.)  Colleen Hoover is a great writer and I can't wait to read her other books.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Beware. The rating on this film should be R instead of just PG-13 because of nudity and strong violence. I don't know how it managed to only be rated PG-13.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Excellent - can't wait for the rest of the trilogy.  Very historical and the romance is wonderful.  Good  Good Good
B007D2XSW0|2.0|This application did not live up to my expectations and was removed within an hour of opening.  I found a much better application.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a good book. Suspenseful and heart warming.  You won't want to put it down.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Great music and very enjoyable stories.  Love the actors also.<br />One of my favorite movies in general and I enjoy watching at christmas time.
0307592731|3.0|Cheryl Strayed.  That is a complete sentence ... with a subject and a verb.  It is also both the adopted name of, and a self-avowed characterization of the author of `Wild:  from Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail'.<br /><br />'Wild' is not so much a book about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail as it is an autobiography, using the vehicle of a hike, with ample flashbacks, to tell the story of the unraveling of Cheryl's life following her mother's sudden death.  And the hike was not so much a hike as it was a retreat, allowing her time for ample reflection to begin to repair that life.<br /><br />`Wild' was selected by Oprah Winfrey as the first featured book for her re-launched book club 2.0.  As a result the book quickly catapulted to the top of the New York Times Bestseller list in July 2012.  Oprah's 'bully pulpit?' - meh.<br /><br />`Wild' is a book about a tough woman doing a very tough thing, written for women who want to be tough, or at least to feel tough vicariously.  It's not for men, and it is definitely not a book to give a hiker who wants to learn about long distance hiking, or about the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  It's a carefully crafted story, and most of it does not even take place on the PCT.  Cheryl hiked pieces of the Pacific Crest Trail in 1995, skipped the High Sierras because of heavy snow cover, and bypassed several other smaller sections.  Her actual trail descriptions are well-done prose, but for the most part they are generic - the kind of stuff you find yourself wanting to skim through quickly.<br /><br />Again, the book isn't really about the hike.  The most memorable part of the book for me took place a year or so before her hike began.  Presented in the vivid detail that is her style, it is a description of the shooting of a horse.  It made me cry uncontrollably.  This was even more heart-tugging than the prolonged and agonizing description of the death of Cheryl's mother, which just made me a bit misty.  More on her mother in a moment ...<br /><br />Despite the accolades, I didn't like 'Wild' very much.  It really is targeted to women--a shrewd marketing choice, since polls show that women read more than twice as many books as men these days.  Women writing stories for women about women-with-grit sells big.  (That's rather disheartening for me as a man writing a book about a man).<br /><br />But more important than the gender bias is the fact that I just don't like Cheryl Strayed as a person.  I can't look at a photo of her without cringing - those eyes just creep me out.  When I read `Outlander' I had the same reaction to its author Diana Gabaldon, though for different reasons.  And I've had the same negative reaction to a few male authors, notably Isaac Asimov.<br /><br />Personality of the author is something that matters to me.  I sense it in their prose on many levels from subtle style cues and references to choices of emphasis and subject matter in individual scenes.  Strayed is fundamentally a slut and a mental cripple, permanently damaged by her mother and the life her mother lived.  As a result, she's a `one trick pony' when it comes to writing, or at least she has been so far.  She burst on the literary scene with her debut novel `Torch' which is a thinly veiled recapitulation of her personal trauma at the death of the mother on whom she was (and remains) cripplingly dependent.  And `Wild' is little more than a variation on the theme.  Her mother's life, death, and cloying presence permeates the story.  Cheryl's hike was an attempt to force direction into her out-of-control physical life, and that succeeded, at least superficially.  But the text of `Wild' is testament to the fact that she's still as dependent on the cancerous relationship with her mother as she has ever been.ent ...<br /><br />Despite the accolades, I didn't like 'Wild' very much.

B00992CF6W|5.0|After playing both the Pc and Xbox versions of the game minecraft, I have been excited to find it on the Kindle Fire platform and I have been impressed with the game and how smoothly it runs on portable devices. The well- loved game of placing blocks, fighting monsters,  and surviving has only one flaw for all of those die- hard Minecraft fans: The crafting recopied that allow you to create objects are given to you, and not all of them are there from the Pc platform. Otherwise the game is beautiful, and if you don't already own it, you're missing out!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It has been around a long time and we still enjoy watching it every year.  It makes us laugh even though we have seen it many times.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for our son and was a big hit. Great for Batman fans of all ages.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It had some laugh out loud moments, but a little predictable. Great family fun overall. Recommended for kids of all ages!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a fun, challenging game that captures the silliness and the skills of Angry Birds in a new way.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We love Amazon Videos on demand.  There is a great selection, it always works as expected and, of course, has totally replaced renting and/or purchasing DVD's for us.  So convenient and such a great selection.  I had wanted to see this movie and saw in on Amazon Video on Demand one day..so we watched it!
B0062OCNAI|5.0|As a mother, this was a thought-provoking book. It is a story of a mother's love, manifested in both positive and negative ways. To what lengths will a mother go to save her child?  What would I sacrifice? I was left with these questions at the bittersweet ending.  I look forward to reading anything by Lupton after this book and her previous one, Sister.
1433502410|5.0|English Standard Version is fairly easy to read and understand.  This Bible is full of resources, maps, charts and theological explanations.  The introduction to each book along with solid commentary gives the reader a better understanding of the story and the context of each book.  Even if you own a study Bible this is one worth adding to your library.
B0094M2OPY|5.0|This movie is a classic.  My young daughters love the story and the characters.  They also really enjoy experiencing the theme around Halloween at Disneyland.  Might be just a bit scary for really small kids.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This movie is down right hilarious, pure entertainment! It may be my new favorite movie. Too many laugh out loud moments to count!
B0053TMP24|5.0|The son of Neptune has been a very enjoyable book, and had kept me on the edge of my seat every chapter of this book. I loved it!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Have to say I didn't think I would like the game at first but it is very addictive and entertaining. Very glad I got it. One of my favorites now.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I am a big Kate Morton fan and love this type of book. I like how she weaves in history, as well as great characters and some mystery. I also liked that the narrator of this book was a mature, modern woman, rather than a 20-something. The ending was a surprise that I did not anticipate.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Classic Malcolm Gladwell which is always fascinating. A look at judgment, and when we should trust our instincts over our more considered thinking and when we should not.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|I've heard so many good things about this concert over the years that I suspected the recording could not live up to the hype.  I could not have been more wrong as disc 1 completely blew me off the planet.  Page, Plant and Jones bring all their musical growth over the years to laser focus as they hammer classics Good Times Bad Times, Ramble On, Black Dog and Nobody's Fault.  Jason Bonham's playing would make his dad proud and really delivers a strong & driving engine for the others.  It all comes together to pound one of the best live recordings of In My Time of Dying I've heard.<br />Disc 2 gets a little stretchy but they deliver the songs much tighter then they did in the past.  Gone are the long improvisations that could get a bit drifty.  Instead you get song development that provides a nice showcase for all the band members.<br />They were firing on all cylinders that night.  Treat yourself and get this CD package.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I could not put this down. Held my attention thru the whole book. I have already recommended this book!!!! Intriguing
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book will have you on the edge of your seat! You'll start the book and finish at 3am because you couldn't put it down!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|By far one of the best books I have ever read. Hit very close to home for me but at the same time may have just changed my life forever. This book has taught me to except and embrace the past so that you can move forward to the future, and this is just what I intend to do. Definitely one of my favorite authors can't wait for her next book...until the next review, I lived this book and I'm butterflying out of here ; )
B000SEI230|5.0|Started off a little slow for me, but I'm so happy I kept reading!! Well worth it and a tear jerker!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|KaPow! This batman is a great film to add to the dark knight trilogy. It has all the bat basics, cats, money, and Mr Wayne is a pimp!
