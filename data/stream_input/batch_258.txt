B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is a very talented artist.  Her image is part of what makes her unique in her particular genre.  She isnt as shallow as Britney or as abrasively flamboyant in her actions as Pink.  Besides that her music pumps along at a very great rate and fills her niche as a punk/pop hybrid that accomplishes satisfaction better than punk or pop could do alone.  I like it.
B00006GFAB|1.0|Yet another greatest hits package. It looks like Kiss are trying to set a record for number of times they can re-sell the same songs. The first 17 of 21 tracks date from before 1980! That should tell you something. If you really want &quot;the very best of KISS&quot;, buy Alive. If that's not enough, get Alive II, or possibly Destroyer. Their live stuff is better than their studio stuff anyway. If you want a greatest studio package, get Double Platinum, it covers much of the same material but at least it's remixed a bit.

B00000IXL1|4.0|Dionne Warwick is a gifted singer, her long musical relationship with Burt Bacharach and Hal David produced a string of hits for her, all of them except \\"Don't Make Me Over\\" are included in this CD, and many are today timeless pop classics.<BR> Their musical relationship had a gap in the 70s and early 80s. In this period Warwick recorded with some other producers or songwriters as Holland-Dozier-Holland, Jerry Ragovoy and notably the album \\"Heartbreaker\\" produced by Barry Gibb and others with songs written by The Bee Gees, which stamped her voice in the 80s and gave her a new profile that continues up to now. She joined again with Bacharach as a songwriter and producer, and also with Bararach and David for a new song in the 90s.<BR>This CD also contains some cover versions of Bacharach-David songs which were hits for other artists as \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with myself\\" (Dusty Springfield), \\"Trains and Boats and Planes\\" (Billy J Kramer and the Dakotas), \\"Raindrops Keep Falling in my Head\\" (B J Thomas) or \\"Only Love can Break a Heart\\" (Gene Pitney) to which Dionne Warwick give her personal approach. Very good collection, not 5 stars because the sound quality  could be very much better.
0446608955|5.0|I've read it 7 freakin' times! And I love it everytime. It's about Landon Carter, a 17 year old high school senior, who's known Jamie Sullivan since they were both knee high to a grasshopper. He signs up for Drama Class, because he figures it will be easy, little does he know that he'll end up being cast for the lead in the Spring Play, having to walk Jamie home EVERY night for 3 weeks, and falling in love with her by the time the play is over. I'm not giving away the ending but it's a book worth reading.

B000002KNI|5.0|The sound quality for live albums is either great or awful - seldom is there middle ground. These 2 guys are such absolute perfectionists, you would guess that the sound would be excellent - and it is. But the choice of songs, the world-class back up band and the tight Simon and Garfunkel vocals are the real draw for me. I really like the fact that they don't do note-for-note copies of their album takes on these well-known songs. There are enough twists here and there to keep the songs fresh and interesting. Also, the fact that this disk perfectly captures an event that could have only happened in NYC doesn't hurt. I find it hard to believe that this all happened over 20 years ago. If you like these guys even a little bit, have a listen, you might just like what you hear.

B00003CX9E|4.0|the cinematography in this movie may be the best of all time.  the deep focus cameras used here are STILL not in widespread use (why? i have NO idea), but seeing the foreground and the background in focus at the same time is something that separates this movie from almost all others.  it really creates a feeling that is laregly unmatched.  buy the movie, you wont regret it.
6305265488|4.0|One of today's acting greats stars in this tale of Cinderella..&quot;the real one&quot; says the old lady in the movie,the old lady who is supposed to be &quot;Cinderella&quot; telling her story just like the old bird did in that dreadful movie Titanic.This telling is a little different to the usual..In this,Cinderella -or Daniella- meets and falls for the prince long before the ball.Drew Barrymore has made it very clear that she dislikes the original versions of Cinderella.(eg;&quot;You get married and then you get to know eachother?!!I could never understand that.&quot;)She also hated the way Cinderella sat around,mopping floors waiting for her prince to come.&quot;This time Cinderella goes out and gets her prince.&quot;(These are Drew quotes to the best of my memory.)This is a fun romantic movie for all ages.
6301025083|5.0|This is among my most favorite films. Fellini's Guido is a director with an identity crisis effecting or as a result of his professional and personal life. The various scenes are powerful examples of what Fellini can do when he's operating at his full artistic capabilities. Part magical realism, part autobiography and done in a style that only Italian film was once able to do, watching 8 ½ has always been a great experience for me.<br />Fellini's self-conscious artistic manner and self-absorption, which can drag down some of his later works, become the strengths of 8 ½. His dreams, doubts and visions are the film itself and delivered so masterfully that Fellini never again was able to match (though he came close) this sort of narrative.<br />There are so many great scenes in this film. Among the best is the imaginary \\"revolt\\" of the women in his life, where Guido's home is full of a \\"harem\\" that all turn against him.  Equally great is the circus scene where freaks and mirrors reflect the turmoil and confusion in his life.<br />Some might call this an \\"artsy\\" film, which I think is a back handed complement. I don't I think it's film being \\"artsy\\", I think it's film telling a story the way a great novel can. Along with \\"La Dolce Vita\\" this is Fellini's greatest work.
6303614493|5.0|This movie in which a ghost chaser(Pullman) and his daughter (Ricci) move into an old haunted mansion,where Casper is living is incredibly fun every single time you watch it.A classic that will never get tired.
B00004YYWI|5.0|This is an awesome album to own. The extra track is definitely cool and a great bonus. I really enjoyed having the extra track because it had a riff or two from the song Advent, which is on their second album Morningrise. None the less, this is one of my favorite albums of all time(with or without the bonus song).
0140157352|4.0|Roger Fisher and William Ury are responsible for breaking new ground on the subject of negotiation with this best seller.  They are also co-founders of the Harvard Program on Negotiation ([...] the pre-eminent think tank on negotiation based at Harvard University. Rather than focus on negotiation tactics, this book uses decision making skills and analytical skills to resolve conflict.<br />Also known as the \\"Harvard Approach\\" or the \\"Harvard Five Step Approach,\\" Getting to Yes provides the reader with a five step approach to negotiation.  Step one is to \\"separate the people from the problem.\\"  Put another way, don't get personal when you negotiate.  Most books on \\"win-win\\" negotiation stress this point, so there is nothing new here.  Steps 2 through 5 completely redefined negotiation strategy, however and deserve close attention.   Step two is to determine the underlying needs or interests of the parties.  The premise for this point is that negotiator's positions in negotiation are rarely consistent with their underlying needs.  Step three is to develop options to address these needs.  This \\"solution\\" section is where the rubber meets the road in negotiation.  The goal here is to exploit the differences in each parties underlying needs so you can achieve a \\"win-win\\" result.  Step four is to determine your BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement.)  Your BATNA is your deadlock or \\"walk-away\\" point.  Put simply you will be able to determine when to deadlock if you can determine what your alternatives to negotiation are.  If the other negotiator's offer is worse than your best alternative to negotiation, then you should turn down the offer and go with your alternative.  This step provides you with an objective, non-emotional approach to making rational decisions during the negotiation process and justifies the price of the book.  The last step to to develop \\"objective criteria\\" or independant standards to resolve conflict.  An objective criteria is a solutionthat is independent from the control of both persons (such as using the CPI to determine the rate of inflation in a rental agreement, or using a property appraiser to determine the fair market value of property at some point in the future.)<br />Like all collaborative negotiation books, Getting to Yes is a valuable book IF there is a relatively free flow of information between the parties and if the parties are willing to collaborate.  If these conditions exist, you can come up with \\"win-win\\" solutions that will stand the test of time.  But I wouldn't take this book onto a car lot...or for that matter into any negotiation where the other party won't take a collaborative approach to the negotiation process.
B00005JK1C|5.0|I like movies-  period.  Having said that,  I love this movie. I really like a movie that I cannot figure the ending. Man oh man,  is The Usual Suspects one of those! Kevin Spacey may be the best actor going today. It's either him,  or  Morgan Freeman  OR  probably Dustin Hoffman. When you get as good as these guys are, it's really hard to tell who is the absolute #1. Anyway-  The Usual Suspects is one of the best and the music is really good too. I know that this is a review of this movie but one way I can describe how good it is is to put it along side of another that is way up there in the catagory of  WHERE IN THE HECK IS THIS MOVIE GOING  and that other movie that is comparable to The Usual Suspects is The Game. What a ride! I just wish I could watch each for the first time. I love Hollywood's movies  ( though I detest Hollywood )  figure that one out.
B000068OCS|4.0|First, I have to say I'm a bit disappointed in the print quality of the DVD version - quite a few scenes show evident wear and tear on the print used. I have to keep reminding myself though, that this movie was made TWENTY years ago... the negative and master prints have certainly had quite an adventure during the past 2 decades. (If ever there was a perfect argument for film protection and preservation, Koyaanisqatsi is IT.)<br />I'm also wondering about the aspect ratio. It seems incorrect at 1.85:1 - I could've sworn I've seen a version that was 2.35:1, but since it's been so long since I've actually seen the film, perhaps I'm mistaken. If however, this is not the full aspect ratio, then that's a ridiculous choice by the DVD makers - I mean, fans of a movie like this are the LAST people on earth who would be \\"scared off\\" by wide letterboxing, something the studios still seem to think consumers are terrified of.<br />Ok, so how about the movie itself? Koyaanisqatsi came out the year I graduated from high school, and it was an extreme influence on me (and others - it's become quite legendary and has been name checked countless times everywhere from MST3K to The Simpsons). But after not seeing it for well over 10 years, how did it affect me when I watched it last night?<br />Hmm. Maybe for the very reason it's become such an icon, it was just a bit of a letdown. On a superficial level, I am AMAZED at how much has changed in just 20 years. Many things in the film are downright quaint now - the cars, the hairdos, the fashions, the huge old mainframe computers, Ms Pac-Man, billboard ads for Betamax players! And MAN, Times Square really was totally squalorous, wasn't it!?<br />On a deeper level, one of the inadvertent profundities of Koyaanisqatsi is that, in watching it now, the relentless march of time is all too apparent. When compared to the mountains of Arizona or the layers of the Grand Canyon, everything we do as a civilization seems thoroughly disposable. 5000 years - big whoop.<br />One thing that hasn't changed is our relentless consumption of the planet's natural resources, and that's only accelerated since the early 80's. We were all well aware of the risks we were taking with the environment back then and we knew we had some difficult choices to make. The decision of the majority since 1983? Buy a 12-mpg SUV, build a McMansion and participate in adding another billion people to the world's population. Good going.<br />OK, I'll get off my soapbox and back on the subject at hand :-) Koyaanisqatsi is still quite marvelous to behold - one thing that I've built an appreciation for over the years is how important EDITING is, and Koyaanisqatsi is BRILLIANTLY edited. And last but certainly not least is the absolutely astonishing music by Philip Glass - it can stand-alone from the film as a separate work of art. \\"The Grid\\" portion of the soundtrack is, in my mind, one of the towering achievements of 20th century music. (I can highly recommend the 1998 recording of the soundtrack which is even better than the version made for the film.)

6305546789|5.0|I really like this movie.  It's a pretty good plot, although I feel the plot is a little incomplete, but that's why there's the the t.v. version available.  I wouldn't necessarily say this is scary, but it spooky and definatley the scariest slasher movie that I have seen, besides Halloween II, although I like Halloween more.  It's definatley worth viewing, and it's good all throughout, and the last half hour is really terrific!
6305622825|5.0|This is my favorite movie's. This is an action movie. Now why do I like this movie because the Petronas Twin Towers are in it. Good story. For parents out there is some stuff that you might not want to let you kids see but that is only 25% of the time.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This is a strong album. It has the same somewhat-formulaic, simple charm of the last album, but there's enough variation in each song for the entire recording to stay fresh as you listen. The band has not sold itself out. They still sound like Queens of the Stone Age...slightly evolved, maybe a little more seasoned and experienced if anything. Different enough to show growth and development as artists, but the same enough to remind you of why you liked the last album. Songs for the Deaf is pretty much listenable all the way through. There are maybe 2 or 3 songs I could do without, and in fact their absence would solidify and tighten the album. I'm all for less filler. I'd rather listen to 11 good tracks back to back with no BS in between, but that's just me. For that, I give this album 4.5 stars........but considering that QOTSA is an oasis in the vast desert of modern-rock-suckery, I have to give them all the more credit and round up to five. They deserve it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|It's hard to seperate truth from hype when there is so much written about Pixar's movies, but the truth is, every single one of them is a classic. And the DVD release of Monsters, Inc. is not only a novel story, but an incredible deal when you add up all the extras you get in this 2 disc set.<br />For the benefit of the two adults in North America who haven't seen it, Monsters, Inc. tells the story of two friends, Sully and Mike who work at Monsters, Inc. generating Scream to power the city of Monstropolis. Sully (the big blue one) accidentally lets a live, human child back into the factory, endangering all life in Monstropolis. Pandemonium ensues as our two heroes try in vain to get her back to her world, and other forces try to stop them. I don't want to spoil the plot be revealing any more, but you will be just as spellbound as your kids as the plot unwinds. The characters and world they live and work in is so well-constructed, you'll be able to enjoy the story again and again.<br />The DVD contains not only this excellent story, excellently animated, but so many bonuses that you'll be thinking the price tag is wrong: 3 extra animated shorts, outtakes that are hilarious, backstory and information about Monstropolis that will engross children and adults alike.<br />Monsters, Inc. is a great movie that everyone will like, and the DVD is well-crafted and full of stuff that makes it a great buy also. Don't hesitate to get this new classic!
B00003CXI1|1.0|I don't quite understand this &quot;Harry Potter&quot; phenomenon. My husband rented this DVD and I found it absolutely wretched. The child actors were positively awful, especially Emma Watson. Is her father a producer? Why the entire cast is British and the director is American - the man responsible for thrusting &quot;Home Alone&quot; upon us - is beyond me. Surely there is more literate, more inventive stuff out there for the general masses. This film is a complete travesty. And more are planned! I'm sure subsequent efforts will pad Ms. Rowling's pocketbook even further. And further dumb down those who watch them. Roald Dahl where are you when we need you?
1587990717|5.0|Many angles of thought on an often overlooked cornerstone of  investing and life.  Taleb presents a fantastic viewpoint while reminding of us of our past reading of the classics.  Simply obsessed with a concept, clearly presented, the author shows a well rounded view of life from his vantage point, and a roadmap for questioning that which we infer to be reality.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Having grown up on films such as \\"Krull\\" and \\"Dragonslayer\\" I was excited yet hesitant to see \\"Reign of Fire.\\" (We've all been burned before on these types of films.) But since I'm a huge fan of the very talented Christian Bale, I decided to take the risk. Wow! The dragons sent chills from my head to my toes. As did Bale and his side kick  Gerard Butler. (He was the best thing about \\"Dracula 2000.\\" Probably the sexiest vampires EVER! Can't wait to see him in \\"Tomb Raider 2.\\") But the actor who surprises the most was Matthew McConaughey. With biceps bulging and shaved head, he came off as a real force to reckon with. What's even more impressive about the story is its unique combination of genres, fantasy and sci-fi. It's a clever concept. <BR>Any fan of Rob Bowman (\\"The X-Files\\") will appreciate this effort. And the closing song by Mad at Gravity is fantastic. Not without some holes, but a very enjoyable 1 hour and 40 minutes well spent. I'm certainly going to buy the DVD even though it doesn't look like it has many extras.

I was a little thrown off at the ending, thinking that she had the chance to put her family at ease at last and getting justice, but I guess that is just what I would have done in her position.  I loved the book nonetheless.  After having read a lot of different types of books, I feel that this is a great original work of fiction and am very upset that I might not get the chance to read something of this type again.  <BR>Wonderful!

B000001E8P|5.0|How did I miss this CD for seven years until an internet radio station streamed \\"Common People\\" to me recently?  On the strength of that song alone, this would be a four star CD even if everything else was along the lines of Freddy Fender singing the Best of Barbra.  It's not of course, but let's begin with \\"Common People,\\" one of those rare songs that in its lyrics, its music and the vocals of Jarvis Cocker recaptures the anger, revolt, sex and danger that rock promised back in the borning days of Elvis and Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Eddie Cochran.  Pulp may never again do a song as good as \\"Common People.\\" Most bands labor for years and never come close.  But it doesn't matter if Pulp does not approach the pinnacle of \\"Common People\\" a second time; what matters is once they did. <br />Think of Different Class as an aural Gosford Park, stuffed full of sensuality and muted class conflict, told from the perspective of the \\"downstairs\\" class.  Once you get beyond \\"Common People\\" (and that can take some doing -- on any number of occasions I've played it a dozen or more consecutive times), Mis-shapes (they've got everything, but we've got our minds), Disco 2000 (boy never gets girl), Something Changes (boy gets girl), Underwear (how DID you wind up naked with this person in this room), and Bar Italia (if we can only get home alive...) boost Different Class comfortably into five star status.  <br />Bowie's here, Clash is here, Cure is here, but most of all Pulp -- funny, mad and brittle -- is here.  This is a great CD.  Nuff said.

B00005B364|4.0|This is a 3-1/2 star album, but I'm happy to round up to 4 because it's good to see these albums available on CD.  When I looked two years ago, I couldn't find anything by Focus for sale.  Focus is a Dutch progressive-rock band that mostly does instrumentals, centered on Jan Akkerman's guitar and Thijs Van Leer's flute.  &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; is as good a novelty single as prog-rock ever produced, with its combination of power-chord guitar, yodeled verse, a vocal bridge that sounds like Popeye on uppers, and Tull-like flute solo.  &quot;Janis&quot; is a lovely flute-based piece.  &quot;Eruption&quot; is a long piece with several repeated riffs; in true annoying prog-rock fashion, each riff is given its own name.
B00006AW2F|4.0|Call me a \\"throwback,\\" but I long for the days before MTV ruined rock and roll and all that it stood for, to a time when Mick Jagger and Keith Richards could put their heads together and actually write a song as memorable as any on this collection of cast-offs and misfits, which sees its first release on CD as part of an extensive reissue crusade by ABKCO.  Even though all of this recent gaggle of reissues are worth the scratch (despite a dearth of bonus tracks), \\"Metamorphosis\\" is the crown jewel, hard to find on vinyl and long sought after by collectors.  Despite most of these songs being deemed unacceptable for a Stones album proper, this compendium towers above anything the band has released since, oh, 1978's \\"Some Girls,\\" especially \\"Jiving Sister Fanny.\\"  Pretty cool cover, too.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The story of Joseph Merrick was not exactly like David Lynch portrayed it in his masterpiece. Nevertheless, a movie for the ages- an absolute tear-jerker with that familiar Lynch spooky twist. I speak solely on the movie itself (not the DVD). The DVD has no chapters, which is a joke! A contemporary classic such as the Elephant Man deserves better! For anyone who is only familiar with the famous movie quote &quot;I am not an animal....&quot;, I advise to read/study up on the Joseph Merrick the man and watch this wonderful movie.
1559409010|5.0|Like so few others, LoB is a film that only gets better with time and repeated viewing. It is often unsurpassed in wisibility, and is as intelligent as it is funny.<br />Originally opposed by the church, the film is an excellent look at the stupidity of people in masses - whether within the film or around the time of its initial release. The DVD provides some great insight regarding the latter - including mention of a quote from some newspaper &quot;columnist&quot; insisting that &quot;Monty Python himself was crucified at the end of the film&quot;. Really? From what I know, Monty Python was never an actual person.<br />The film is fun to watch alone, or with fwiends - call Woger, Wodewick (the wobber and wapist) and the others, and see the film. That is, assuming that you've been living under a wock for the last twenty or so years and haven't seen it already.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|i'm a prince fan but i can differentiate between the good and the bad. prince is without question the most talented instrumentelist/ singer songwriter in the world today. you can never write him off because he'll just keep coming back again and again. this isn't the album that a lot of his fans hoped it would be and will doubtless gain him new followers but it is a worthwhile album regardless. if you want you can forget the messages in the songs- they can mean whatever you want them to mean- and you can also ignore the treated vocals that introduce many of the tracks if you so wish, but in my personal opinion we are in the presence of a great album here- not just a collection of songs, but an album that flows along almost seamlessly. the production on here is probably the best on any prince album- just listen to that speeded up guitar solo on 1+1+1=3- how the hell did they achieve that? <br />my guess is that you will either love this album or will discard it as a piece of worthless pap, but it does beg to be listened to in its entirety and more than once at least.
B000002N3J|5.0|This is my favorite Madonna album, from both a music and sound standpoint. The recording quality is pristine -- some of the best in my 1000 albums. Whenever I audition new high-end equipment, this is one of the albums that I use (I typically use 10 to 12 albums). Babyface, the producer, has generally produced high quality albums, but this is one of his finer works. From a music standpoint, it is some of Madonna's most emotional music. Unfortunately, in this case, quality and emotion did not fire up the cash registers like the commercialized material of the like-a style songs. If you want to hear a better side of Madonna, and better sounding, try this album.
0316666343|4.0|I purchased this book because there was so much buzz about it, however, to me the ending of a book is important.  The author must disagree with me.  Although this book is a real page turner and very well written with a very interesting point of view, it leaves you at the end wondering what happens???  I can't stand that!  Plus, with the book being a murder mystery, you would think that the author would give us more closure.  I would recommed this book, however-it's one you don't want to put down but one that will let you down in the end.
6305132984|3.0|This 1961 film version of of Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein's stage hit begins hopefully. The camerawork, editing, choreography (by Jerome Robbins) and, most of all, music, pulsate with dazzling energy. Then, after a vibrant and exciting ten minutes, it all begins to full apart. It all becomes static and uninventive, failing to live up to the grand promises of that first reel. Most of the musical numbers (especially with the two rather bland leads) are executed with little imagination. A few of the songs fall prey to gimmicky visuals which nowadays look trite.<br />An at times compelling drama is soured by mediocrity which should never have surfaced, given the immense talent involved here (chiefly Bernstein, Sondheim, and Robbins). What a disappointment!
B000000WA4|4.0|This third album from the smashing pumpkins was one of the first cd's i ever owned. Obviously i loved it then, but since 95 i have put it away, and only every know and then i come back to it. Whenever i do i am amazed at how much of an accomplishment it really is. Being that the pumpkins didnt put out anything after worth any merit, and this album is far superior to anything they released before it, this is the essential smashing pumpkins cd. its a shame things fell apart with jimmy chamberlin right after this cd, because his percussion is superb, particularly on the soft and epic songs. all in all this is a great cd, with many of the best tracks never recieving any air play. too bad they out played the radio cuts too, because they are also strong songs
B000068IEU|5.0|Nothing comes close to this intense film, except maybe<br />&quot;Last House on the Edge of the Park&quot;, which David Hess<br />also starred in (without him, the movie would lack<br />the full impact it has); Hess is also in a new release called &quot;Nutcracker: An American Nightmare&quot;<br />(he plays another psychotic but one with a wide range, showing the accumalated skills of many years of experience).
B00006AFUR|5.0|i bought this CD after hearing 30 Seconds to Mars in concert 6 months ago, and they don't disappoint. The band puts on an excellent live show, and captures their energy very well. The songs are well written, the music was artfully crafted, and the finished product will have you humming the songs after your first listen, and you'll want to listen to the CD as much as you can so you can learn the lyrics, and learn more about the band. All in all, and amazing CD, and a very good buy. Well worth your money.
B000068TPN|5.0|We've all seen Hollywood's anti-Vietnam War, anti-Vietnam War Veteran films from \\"Platoon\\" and \\"The Deer Hunter\\", to \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and \\"Good Morning Vietnam\\".  In each, the director could not help but poke fun at our soldiers or their leaders, could not help but contrive situations to get their political point across, and in the end ruin the reputation of hundreds of thousands of men and women who served their country honorably during the Vietnam War.  If such films as mentioned above make you feel good about not getting drafted, not serving, or for dodging the draft, then please don't watch \\"We Were Soldiers\\", it will ruin your day.  <br />However, if you believe in Duty, Honor, Country and how, even during such an unpopular war as Vietnam, the American Citizen Soldier defines heroics, selfless sacrifice and love of country, just as history taught us of those who fought during the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WW I, WW II and Korea, then don't miss this film.  In \\"We Were Soldiers\\", you will witness a battle between four (4) regular North Vietnam Divisions and one Division of US Army 7th Air-Cav troops.  Outnumbered 10 to 1 during this battle, the US Army's 7th Air-Cavalry Division was dropped into the middle of a fixed enemy position and the mayhem that followed.  In a true depiction of the \\"Fog of War\\", with a realism of events and the truest form of espirit de corp., this movie will transport you to the edge of your seat and senses. What adds to the power of this film is that it is a true story, the events depicted actually took place, and it is told by retired Lt. General Moore, who led these men into battle as a Lt. Col., at the time.  This is a wonderful tribute to not only the men of the US Army 7th Air-Cavalry, but to all 58,000 Americans \\"Who Gave All\\", in this most unpopular War.
B00005YUPO|5.0|Shortly after my daughter was born I purchased Baby Mozart.  She started watching it at 1 1/2 months and loved it.  After watching it over and over I decided for a change, so I purchased the Baby Bach DVD.  My daughter also really enjoys this one.  She smiles every time she sees the caterpillar at the beginning of each DVD.  On Baby Bach she likes the ducks and when the little girl laughs. I have decided that these are a great buy.  We certainly have got our money worth.
B00006BTCA|2.0|i wasn't afraid to give the strokes a listen b/c i didn't care whether or not their hype was due to &quot;daddy&quot; or legitmate buzz, so i approached listening to these guys the same way.  the music is ok, but i wouldnt say they're bringing anything new to an old game.  for what its worth, if you like listening to joy div, the cure, or the smiths, then just keep on doing that.  if you need another band in that genre that doesn't seem to push anything forward, then you can be cool caught listening to this...
B000056PWV|5.0|Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' is a 50s classic. It's almost everything - a romance, a thriller, a mystery and a comedy - all at the same time.<br />With some brilliant performances, especially by James Stewart, this movie is about how a man observes his neighbors, only to find that each experience is only a reflection (to varying degrees) of his feelings towards his girfriend (Grace Kelly).<br />This is a thoroughly enjoyable (and less scary) Hithcock movie!
0380788624|5.0|This book starts very slow, and you're wondering how these characters and timelines are related.  But patience really pays off.  After a couple hundred pages, you are deeply involved in these characters.<br />I explain to my friends that this book is not written as science fiction.  The tech/science mentioned is either today or near-today.  What is science fiction is what it make you THINK.<br />The science is rock solid, one of the few authors who doesn't treat computers (my business) as a magic black box that does wonderful things for you.  The main characters are pleasantly solid, yet excentrically unique.  They are unfortunately the only characters with any depth.<br />My business partner is a huge fan of the author's, and has pushed me to read several of his books.  This is the only one I have liked.<br />As Clancy made 250 pages of how to construct a nuclear bomb interesting, Stephenson makes you WANT to understand how cryptography works, and gives you increasingly complex explanations over the entire length of the book, fleshing out the explanations and definitions of many of the critical concepts.<br />The characters he creates leave you with the sense that they are true to life, but shown in a twisted way leading to many different levels of humor.  I found myself laughing at a joke three times.  Separate times, in three different places in the book, as the events in that place further illuminated the joke told several chapters back.  There were surprises around every corner.<br />Highly recommended.
B00000373U|5.0|When I first bought this album, I had just began my musical revolution into the previously uncharted indie scene.  Either/Or, being my first cd of his, I found to be well crafted and well written, but not until toe or three years later did I find that I could not go more than a few days with out listening to it.  It is geniusly crafted, and the guitar, however simple, is intensely effective.  The lyrics are amongst the best that I've heard in years, and still now, three years, and equally as many copies of the same album later, I still find myself discovering new, inteligent, and fantastic metaphors on this album.<BR>While obvious comparisons from Nick Drake, and other &quot;sleep rockers&quot; are a given, I drew other comparisons to genius songwriters, such as Ben Folds, and Belle and Sebastian.<BR>This was just the beginning of my conquest to conquer all of the best music, and have found that elliott's talent is not limited on one album, as other artists have only been able to summon their creative picque on one or two albums.  Elliott Smith is able to do so on all that I've heard.
0679735909|5.0|I am stunned.<br />How often do you finish a book, slowly turning the back cover to close, as the hair on the back of your arms twitches upward with the electricity of mingled pleasure and sadness? This happens less often for me as I grow older, but at this moment I sit stunned for I have just finished this wonderful book by Ms. Byatt and I am not yet willing to surrender the feeling. Yet, I also am urged to write this. The best writing--storytelling--does this to me. Even as I marvel at what I have just experienced, I also am goaded to try my hand at miracles as well, like the child who sees the magician at school and rushes home to ask the parents for a magic set. Like a child I am, to want to sit at the same table as Ms. Byatt, but yet I must, for maturity begins by imitating adults.<br />Possession is a book about words, so how unsurprising that I was thinking of these words that I would write upon finishing its words. I made mental notes to myself--&quot;remember this passage&quot; or &quot;here, here is a meaning not to be forgotten.&quot; I can only hope to do justice to my past impressions of this book in this first impression. First of all, this was not an easy book to read. As I commented to some people when I was only a hundred or so pages into it, the plot so far is the ultimate in boring, yet the writing is so good that I find myself continuing to read. Then I got stuck.<br />But I must stop and give a little summary of the actions in the book for those who haven't read it. There is a story within a story. The outer story is the discovery by Roland Mitchell of an instance in the great poet Randolph Henry Ash's life previously unaware to scholars, namely a connection with a little-known poet named Christabel LaMotte. The story of LaMotte and Ash forms the inner story. As a character says,<br />&quot;Literary critics make natural detectives...You know the theory that the classic detective story arose with the classic adultery novel--everyone wanted to know who was the Father, what was the origin, what is the secret?&quot;<br />What is the secret, indeed. The need to know the secret, to possess it, spurs Roland to track down the elusive link between Ash and LaMotte.<br />While the story of the two poets is beautiful and complex in its own right, the meta-story of Roland and the rest of the Ash/LaMotte scholars has a lot to commend it as well. Although the beginning seems to be about boring, dry academics, Byatt is actually setting up the characters in the best way, showing you what they are like, and when things start moving later, nothing seems unnatural.<br />The title says so much. This is a story of &quot;possession&quot; in all its myriad meanings, just as words so often do double and triple duty in the best poems. I am tempted to go through every definition of the word in the O.E.D. and then cite an example from the book, but instead I'll just do a sampling. When Roland discovers the letters that begins the search (and the novel), instead of presenting them to his supervisor, Prof. Blackadder, he keeps them in his possession. The possession of the letters and memorabilia from Ash's life is a consuming interest of the American counterpoint to Blackadder, Mortimer Cropper. Ash declares himself to be possessed by LaMotte; Roland and his partner, Maud Bailey, are possessed by the search. These are just a few of the many aspects of possession in the book.<br />I said before that I had gotten &quot;stuck&quot; in the book. About a hundred pages in, Roland and Maud discover a correspondence between Ash and LaMotte that fills about 35 pages. Byatt captures the Victorian letter style perfectly, almost too perfectly for this modern reader. Full of run-on sentences--often connection by dash after dash--the letters are of utmost importance to the plot, just as the Ash and LaMotte poems that grace the beginnings of each chapter. However, a modern reader understands how to read poems. The letters I tried to read as part of the novel rather than as letters, and immediately found myself frustrated and bored. I put the book down and read something else before returning to trudge my way through the letters. After that, the book was a joy to read. The poet Christabel LaMotte is quoted in the book as saying, &quot;A writer only becomes a true writer by practising his craft, as a great artist may experience with clay or oils until the medium becomes second nature, to be moulded however the artist may desire.&quot; This could very well be the reason why I write these impressions.<br />I looked at Possession in the store when it first was published and several times after. I had finally made a decision that I wasn't going to read it, based on my perception of the subject material and its length. However, Mike Godwin recommended this book. I'm glad that he did, and I now pass on his recommendation with my own. This is a wonderful book.he novel rather than as letters, and immediately found myself frustrated and bored.

1881273156|3.0|In my quest to find out what keeps happening in my relationships, this book was recommended to me by a friend. I did not find it very helpful. I find Chapman's view of there only being one or two areas that we need to have fulfilled in our life to make a good relationship rather simplistic. While I do agree that some of the things are more important to me than others I have found other books to be far more helpful such as Are You The One For Me? And You Just Don't Understand Me. To me a relationship is a complex thing and it takes two parties working at it full-time in all areas not in just one or two and sometimes the issues are much larger and more complex than the five simple ones presented in this book.
0393316041|3.0|Although I'd heard of Feynman for years now--people I know were excited by the Feynman Lectures volumes--I didn't really know who he was. Oh, I could probably have given you the fact that he was a physicist, and maybe that he had won the Nobel prize, and just recently Jill told me about a Feynman anecdote that she had read by Stephen Jay Gould. After Surely You're Joking, I know much more about Feynman, and why he interests people. As far from the stereotype of the scientist that you can get, yet still having some geeky characteristics that he wasn't afraid to admit to, Surely You're Joking is a portrait of the man in his own words. In fact, the best way to approach this book is as if you had stumbled on to it in a dimly-lit bar, sat down next to it, exchanging turns buying drinks and talking about each other. Just like a conversation, some things are funny, some things don't make sense, and--as a one-sided conversation--they all revolve around a singe subject.
6305364648|5.0|Like him or not, everybody can acknowledge that Arnold Schwarzenegger is a breed apart - and I mean that in a positive way. He has made a few movies that can be forgotten, and some that may be remembered. I think True Lies is his best movie, for several reasons. The storyline of the movie is quite simple: secret agent discovers some bad guys (and a good looking bad woman) and chases them in an spectacular style (ever see a Hawker Harrier land on the highway?). Director and production team had a good vision on how to give the public what they wanted to tell: some suspense, some violence and a lot of action, but sure enough more laughs than you might expect. Although much of the action scenes are highly exaggerated in various ways, this movie might be the landmark on big action scenes that do look very realistic. At that time the digital domain wasn't as good as it is nowadays but it does the job. The scene in which a truck with baddies is shot off a bridge with a rocket launched from a helicopter is legendary. And if you don't have a big laugh after the events that follow then, just turn the movie off.
B00005Q45W|5.0|The old master Leonard Cohen presents another batch of poems set to music, with his usual air of indifference to fame and fortune. He enjoys a very loyal following, and little wonder. The songs here are wired straight back through to 'Suzanne' and 'Hey, that's no way..' For people with whom those first essays struck a fine echo, this is more of that same slow drug - one song a year. <BR>Cohen's work is solid, which is why it sounds better and better the more you hear it. Production here is minimal, with tinny synthesizers and clunky drums, but you find yourself singing these songs days later, which is the mark of a true craftsman. The one time Cohen entrusted himself to a serious producer - Phil Spector - the results were pretty dire; the lily gilded till it bowed and snapped. This time out, he's content to have someone do the basic minimum needed to bring his songs to our ears, and for her part she wisely doesn't intrude much. <BR>There's a famous picture of Joni Mitchell hugging Laughing Lenny at a festival somewhere, about 30 years ago. I'd pay a whole lot to hear them duet now, both singing their recent songs.
B00005V9HH|5.0|... beautifully remastered edition with the proper sound quality... ... buy it if you like a really good crime thriller (oh yeah, and a good plot).

B00005JL3A|3.0|I'm not even a big fan of this genre of video game -- or of gorefest flicks -- but a friend convinced me to watch it. The special effects were good overall, and there was plenty of beefcake (especially the now-hunky Eric Mabius) which made it worth watching.<br />Overall worth a rental , maybe even a purchase for a repeat guilty pleasure.
B00003CXRM|4.0|While seeing this movie, a feeling of relaxation came onto me. We see three men escaping from prison (time setting somewhere around 1920) and start looking for their fortune. This brilliant movie (Joel and Ethan Coen, director and writer brothers, made Blood Simple and other great movies) does not explain much to the viewer, but gives you time to enjoy the adventures of these simple minded guys. And that's where Relax! comes in - there's no need to hurry to the plot because there isn't one. After half an hour I started to suspect that this is the truth, no plot? And shortly after that I realized: no problem because it's just a lot of fun. It is a crazy story, with crazy guys. Beautifully shot, nice performances and great props. There are some people in the movie that have to be as crazy as they appear on screen - I couldn't believe my eyes sometimes.<br />Have some time off and laugh your socks off with O Brother!

B00000J2PH|5.0|All I knew about Carole King for a long time was that she was a member of the Brill Building's stable of songwriters in the Sixties.  I didn't know very much about her singing career until someone showed me this album.<br />My favorites are &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;It's Too Late&quot;, &quot;Where You Lead&quot;, &quot;Smackwater Jack&quot;, and &quot;Out in the Cold&quot;.<br />While &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; and &quot;It's Too Late&quot; are both very good and deserve the radio play they get on oldies radio, &quot;So Far Away&quot; is the best song on the album.  I am puzzled as to why one never hears this gem on the radio.<br />Among the less impressive songs on the album are those which were first recorded by other artists in the Sixties, like &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow?&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel) Like a Natural Woman&quot;.  Even though Carole King had a hand in writing both of these songs, I will always think of Aretha Franklin's performance of &quot;Natural Woman&quot;.<br />I do like her version of &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot;, which she gave to her good friend James Taylor, who scored his only #1 with it.<br />Overall, this is one of the best albums I own.  It won four Grammys, and it deserves every one of them.

Coraline is a bored little girl who likes exploring, so she heads (a la Alice) into a \\"wonderland\\" of sorts, only it is a rather bleek and scary place.  There she encounters various characters and has an adventure.  She ends up having to fight to make it back home.<br />I am an adult who loves children's fantasies.  Coraline was a short diversion.

0345440900|5.0|What a great book.  Enjoyable to read AND provides a wealth of information.  This is so unlike many baby-how-to books... Tracy not only tells you WHAT you should do, but HOW to do it.  This is the perfect book to read a little at a time when you get up in the middle of the night to nurse.  After reading this book, my husband and I both felt so much calmer about everything we were doing... we felt like we had an expert on hand whenever we needed her.  This book has become part of my standard &quot;congratulations you're pregnant&quot; gift.  It is absolutely my favorite baby book, hands down.
020530902X|5.0|Almost everyone has to write things sometimes--reports, memos, term papers, a number of things.  Writing is an essential part of professional (or student) life.  This book is a must for anyone wanting to write well--not just for professional or aspiring writers.<br />The book is less than 100 pages, yet it is so packed with useful information and advice that it will drastically change the way you look at writing.  The central theme of the book is &quot;Edit!&quot;  The first sections deal with the need to omit needless words, to trim and cut your writing to the bare essentials.  After reading these sections, you will find yourself ruthlessly attacking your own writing, striking needless words, phrases, and paragraphs, and significantly improving your technique.<br />There is also a section on the misuse of words--ways we typically use words out of context.  There are many examples, and I don't doubt that even the best writer will find himself guilty of quite a few of them.<br />All these sections were written by William Strunk.  They were later edited by E.B. White (a student of his), who then added the fifth and final section of this book.  White's is perhaps the most useful advice.  He gives us a list of &quot;reminders,&quot; rules to help us improve our writing.<br />He counsels us to avoid clutter, avoid using too many big words, eliminate &quot;qualifiers,&quot; and be clear, to name a few.  This is wonderful advice, and an able conclusion to an already fascinating book.<br />This work is absolutely indispensable to the writer, and extremely useful to anyone else wanting to write well.  As Charles Osgood aptly put it, this book is &quot;small enough and important enough to carry in your pocket, as I carry mine.&quot;  Don't miss this one.
B000066F6H|4.0|I enjoyed it...what's bothering me right now are all the people who call them \\"the saviors of rock 'n roll\\"...i don't dislike it because i dislike them. but what IS rock 'n roll? nirvana? hanson? the hives, the vines, the strokes, the white stripes, elvis, the eagles, the who, the beatles...? you can't pin rock 'n roll down and say \\"THIS IS ROCK 'N ROLL\\". That's everything rock 'n roll ISN'T. rock is about being different and expanding, i've studied it...it progresses, it changes. started in the fields when the slaves were singing. evolves to jazz, blues, r&b, pop, rockabilly, everything. there is no \\"rock 'n roll\\" - it just is what it is but you can't really define it. it's edgy but it can be calm and mellow, it's rebellious but not. it's everything. it changes.<br />so it was a good album, and i'd say it's a rock album...but don't use it to define as the epitome of ROCK 'n ROLL. that's a strong statement for those who think rock is only about smashing guitars, heavy, complex drums, and drug overdoses.

I ended up downloading the entire album, and now am off to buy the disk.   <BR>I find I'm beginning to like even Barrett era Floyd, and post Waters is no exception.  <BR>I'd describe this as simply - a more &quot;mature&quot; sounding Pink Floyd.  Gilmour's unmistakable voice, and some very, very soul inspiring songs.  <br />As far as ALBUMS go, I don't think anything will top Dark Side, or The Wall.  But I must say I am loving this album.  <br />Now....if we could only get the band together for one, final concert tour.  C'mon, there are plenty of us young Pink Floyd addicts who weren't born in time for any of their concerts!!

So I was thrilled when I got it for my birthday. I just wish that the theatrical trailer was included on the special features section. But I am glad that the music video Gangsta's Paradise is on the DVD. This film is one of Michelle Pfeiffer's best movies. If you like this movie you should also watch What Lies Beneath which stars Michelle Pfeiffer.

B000006TRV|5.0|The movie this soundtrack is from is possibly a work of genius, and I really do not use that word lightly. But at the same time I dislike it. &quot;The Wall&quot;'s imagery is a creepy mind-trip unlike everything...um...ever made. Yeah.<br />I disliked it because it disturbed me and made me feel ill, which is unusual because I'm a dark sort of person. But it certainly was worth seeing once, just because even though I didn't like it I was amazed by it and couldn't stop watching until it was over. Similar to a fascination with staring at a rotting corpse you are disgusted by but cannot take your eyes off of.<br />But wait! We're talking only about the soundtrack here, not the movie it's from.<BR>There are quite a lot of tracks on this classic CD, which range from unique but annoying (only 2 tracks) to wonderful (most of the rest) to awe-inspiring, phenomenal music that will be permanently emblazon itself in your mind (something like 5 of them).<BR>This music gives you a feeling you can't experience with any other music. It's that unique, and perhaps one could say &quot;mind expanding&quot;.<BR>But if you are unable to understand it, you will not be able to enjoy it, like classical music.<BR>This really is classic rock. And it's far more fresh and vibrant than the modern pop music of today.

B000002KFJ|5.0|I don't know much about music, but I know what I like. Black Sabbath has been the cornerstone of heavy metal for years (I'm talking the ORIGINAL Sabbath group, mind you) and they've produced a lot of good stuff. But this has to be one of my all time Sabbath favorites (along with \\"Volume 4\\") and is a must have for rock enthusiasts. Ozzy's poetry is out of this world...My only complaint about this release on CD is that they cut the hidden track that appeared at the very end on the original LP and cassettes. You had to turn it up real loud, but about 30 seconds after \\"The Writ\\" you could hear Ozzy do a 12 to 20 second piano solo and sing \\"Blow on the Jug\\".  Not rock, but trivia only true Sabbath fans would know about that shouldn't have been left off. In all, excellent tunes that reminds people of today what metal REALLY sounds like. I played it and my teenage daughters were saying \\"Hey Dad, that's jammin'... who is it?\\". Were they ever shocked.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar is a poignant autobiographical novel about a young woman's road to irreversible insanity. The novel takes place in the sixties -- a time in which depression hadn't been delved into as much as it is now. While her mental condition worsened, Plath escaped her bizarre life by writing poetry. She'd also written this book. Even though she'd lost her battle with depression, Plath left this wonderful book as her legacy. The Bell Jar is poignant, twisted, surreal and, more importantly, insightful. By far, one of the best books I've read all year. I highly recommend it.
B000021Y77|5.0|I watched the version that is not dubbed.  I know many people who refuse to watch foreign films if they're not dubbed in English but this is such a huge mistake.  One reviewer for this movie said &quot;he didn't speak Kraut&quot; and that he fell asleep.  I find it hard to believe anyone could fall asleep with this film.  Not only is the action non-stop, but the main character is such a good actress, as well as extremely attractive that only someone with an extrememly limited attention span could fall asleep on this one.  Great story, original idea, cinematography, etc.  If you've shied away from foreign films thinking that it's too hard to read subtitles, try this one.  You'll find after awhile that you don't realize you're reading them at all.
B00005NEZ3|5.0|This CD definately gets a 5.  The music has their own style and then some rap, hip-hop, and it's all thrown together for this album.  The song 19-2000 is a great song to listen to in the car on trips or just anywhere.  Clint Eastwood is a GREAT song, and the music video is the greatest.  And lets not forget Left Hand Suzuki Method.  This is the greatest.  Buy IT!
B000069CWE|2.0|Linkin Park are one of those bands that I thought would sound perfect doing a remix CD. They have the right sound, and their songs are getting so darn worn out, it would be nice to have a change. However, this CD (sans a few cuts) is just plain awful. Even the respectable guest list can't save this tragedy, including the Roots' Black Thought, Korn's Jonathan Davis, Staind's Aaron Lewis, Pharoahe Monch, Sneaker Pimps' Kelli Ali, The X-Ecutioners, well, the list could go one for miles, it would be quicker if I told you who WASN'T on this CD (even Marilyn Manson did a remix of By Myself that didn't make the cut). All of the songs just sound like pure cacophony. The songs in their \\"reinterpreted\\" form are just plain useless. Lyrics are turned upside down, completely changed and overall, GHETTO-IZED! To be honest with you, the only remixes I enjoyed were Wth>You (LP's own DJ Hahn & Aceyalone), 1stp Klosr (Humble Brothers & Jon Davis) and the absolutely STELLAR Krwlng (With all new vocals by Aaron Lewis of Staind, he really saves this CD from being a throwaway. This is better than the original version). I don't really get much out of this CD. It's sort of like a good idea gone very, very bad. It's also sort of a cop-out to the fans. I mean, c'mon, the ... CD has been out for 2 years, you've squeezed like 6 singles out of it already, now go record something new. I'll be waiting.
B00003CY0V|4.0|All the so-called critics and some others don't get it. Every time a strait action movie comes out with lots of explosions, high body count, and lame cache frases the critics always say the same thing,\\"why can't they make a different kind of movie\\" well, this movie is out of the standard field of action movies, it has a great plot twists,interesting charactors, the good guy is a little dirty and the bad buy has a good goal, but the cry baby critics still wine.<br />It's a different kind of movie then say the movies that always win the \\"Emmys\\" and \\"Oscers\\" for no others reasons than the people who chose the winners for those awards are locked into a extremely norrow view of what makes a good movie to such extreme as is if the movie doesn't have a so called \\"deeper meaning\\" the whole movie is judged to be inferior, this makes me sick. <br />Judge the movie for what it is, not compare it to dusty \\"safe\\" movies that have a million clones that are exactly like it.
B00005MNP8|5.0|I own this record for about 25 years now, and I'm glad it's remastered. This beauty in the new century technology !<br />Don't care much for the bonustracks: this album is a pearl of it's own!!!!!

B00005JKDR|5.0|What can make you feel better then sharing stomach holding, cheek aching laughs with your kids...?  Simply put, &quot;It doesn't get any better than this.&quot;  Children, parents, and grandparents should all experience Monster's Inc.  This movie is by far one of the best animated childrens films ever!  This DVD is worth every penny, because the joy received from viewing it with friends and family is priceless.  Don't miss the experience, purchase this DVD for your family collection!
0780622553|1.0|I wanted to like this movie, but I was stunned by how bad it was.  Did I watch the same movie as the other reviewers?  Basically, &quot;Dark City&quot; steals ideas from several much better movies (&quot;Brazil&quot;, &quot;City of Lost Children&quot;, &quot;Bladerunner&quot;, &quot;Element of Crime&quot; to name a few) and  throws them together without much imagination.  What did &quot;Element of Crime&quot; in was it's sluggish pace.  &quot;Dark City&quot; has the opposite problem.  It is done at such a frantic pace that it's themes are not developed properly.  It gives away too much in the beginning, rather than gradually revealing to us what is going on.  This gives the film a repetitive feel.  Rufus Sewell just blunders about angry and confused and Hurt and Connelly, usually fine actors, sleep walk through their roles.  Hurt's character is unneccesary, but he's there to retain a film noir feel that the film so lamely strives for.  And as far as the visuals go, I wasn't all that impressed either.  The morphings around of the buildings were kind of cool, but the whole dingy 1940s meets the future thing was done 20 times better in &quot;Brazil.&quot;  Now a lot of people like this movie, so I guess you shouldn't take my word for it.  I do suggest you see &quot;Brazil&quot;, etc. before you see this.  All of the films I mentioned before will satisfy fans of dark cinematic fantasy, and are much more imaginative and thought provoking.
B00006AG9J|2.0|This was the embryonic Tangerine Dream's first record release, originally by a very forward-looking (to say nothing of brave) German record label, Ohr. It was recorded in October 1969, a couple of years before even the name Tangerine Dream had been heard in the UK, and some five years before their signing to an upstart record-publisher, Virgin, gave both their own and their record company's careers such a tremendous boost.<br />Bear in mind that 1969 was only five years or so after Robert Moog and David Buchla almost simultaneously released the world's first commercial electronic music synthesisers. Such instruments were still rare, expensive, and of fairly limited capabilities back then, and the 'electronic' of the title refers not to the use of any such instrument, but rather to the treatments applied to the sound produced from the standard acoustical instruments-guitars and piano (Edgar Froese), cello and violin (Conrad Schnitzler) and drum-kit and metal sticks (Klaus Schulze)-using an extremely crude electronic effect device, an additator-basically, just a ring modulator as far as I can tell-and the use of Farfisa organ. The music itself is difficult to describe unless you're already familiar with the cult experimental free-form rock that was prevalent across continental Europe (especially Germany) in the late 60s. If you imagine three guys hammering and scraping away and generally torturing their instruments, often with little or no seeming regard for what their fellow group members are doing at the time, then you'll have a pretty fair idea! But don't let that put you off; this is important music, which at one time had a huge cult following and it deserves to be heard still. And, who knows, you may even discover that you like it!<br />Be warned, however, that this disc runs for fewer than 35 minutes. (Hence the paucity of stars!) And it was recorded 'live' in an old warehouse, using less than the highest of fi recording gear, so it has a much lower dynamic range than we're used to hearing these days, and in parts sounds positively muddy. Which was probably intended...nge than we're used to hearing these days, and in parts sounds positively muddy. Which was probably intended...
B000025RAU|5.0|Polanski's CHINATOWN easily makes my Top 5. A complex, mysterious, and brooding movie, it is impeccably flimed in-period and is really the penultimate of film noir. Each character is an odd mixture of ambiguous qualities: reprehensible, charismatic, trite, mysterious, empathic, craven. John Huston plays what is easily one of the most compelling and evil roles ever put on film. Faye Dunaway is magnetic as both the remote ice queen of wealth and the vulnerable beauty whom Nicholson's PI is understandably drawn to. An absolutely marvelous film, it will leave you feeling emotionally wrought by its end.
B000000OXH|5.0|It became very difficult for me to wait from the time the first Asia album appeared to the release of 'Alpha' as Asia's first album created an emotional impact on me that I still feel today when I replay it. Forget the one sided reviews of 'Alpha'which continually compare it to the first Asia album; there is no reason to compare these albums as both represent a progression of emotion and passion from four multi-talented musicians.<BR>I cannot explain the voice of John Wetton..it can be joyful and forceful at one moment while the next brings an element of sorrow and despair as in 'The Smile Has Left Your Eyes'. Listening to 'My Own Time', I also find my spirit searching for the days of my youth as the music remains lively and symphonic.<BR>I found myself being absorbed into each track on this wonderful album; Geoff Downes' keyboard arrangements are atmospheric, energetic, and full of unique pleasures that I rarely find in 'today's' music.<BR>{Keith Emerson, Andre Andersen, and Steve Walsh also reign in this territory.) 'Eye To Eye' is the ultimate example of this..one of my favorites.<BR>If you are still not taken in by this album after listening to it, listen to it again. The majestic compositions and passionate combinations of John Wetton, Steve Howe, Geoff Downes, and Carl Palmer will have you wondering why this album never achieved a well-deserved higher level of success.
B00005MNP7|5.0|This album showcases to what kind of music Blondie stands for: Power Pop. Eat to the beat is produced by Mike Chapman, like their previous million seller Parallel Lines. The album is sensational!A topseller in the UK, it spawned two #1 hits. It's not as dark as Plastic Letters (more radio friendly).<br />The bonustracks are really enjoyable: Fantastic live versions of Die young stay pretty, Four Tops cover: Seven rooms of a gloom , David Bowie's Heroes and the Johny Cash cover Ring of Fire .<br />Great buy !! For occassional fans too! This album won't dissapoint you !
B000002ADT|5.0|Are you trying to study in your dorm, but can't concentrate because of the loud hip-hop coming from the next door? Are you looking for a good albume, that will introduce you to real jazz? Whatever your aim can be, I definitely recommend &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; for all jazz-lovers and some-peaceful-music-seekers. I know, this is not a technical review, but you don't need a technical review, do you? Just order it, you will not be disappointed, but instead gratified for purchasing such a valuable piece of music.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This CD rocks. 30STM has been compared to Pink Floyd, but they stand in a spotlight of their own. While &quot;Capricorn&quot; gets airplay, the rest of these amazing tunes get neglected on the local stations. Why? I have no idea. But it won't be long before songs like &quot;Buddha for Mary&quot;, &quot;Oblivion&quot;, and &quot;93 Million Miles&quot; are rockin' the streets, backyards, and the world! If you get the chance to see them in concert, do so. At all costs. And with Jared Leto as the front man and voice of 30STM, you just can't go wrong. This is some of the best cash I ever spent.
B00005JL3A|3.0|'Resident Evil' has me wondering if I should lean towards personally classifying it a Sci-fi rather than Horror.  The movie was teeth-gratingly full of tension, however, I did not even think to jump with suprise once. I was impressed with the fluidity of the CGI animation, this coming from guy who scoffed at the inconsistent skin movement of the Jurassic Park dinos (I was a School of Visual Arts NYC computer animation major.)  The story line had very few flaws and did a great job of setting the premise for those who had no idea about the game. Movie viewers who are jazzed by the idea of flesh eating undead must seek out and watch 'Return of the Living Dead,' which should satisfy the urge for horror with a splash of comedy.  Great sound, dazzling visuals and a good score make this movie an attractive addition to your DVD collection.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars is an excellent up and coming band - having seen them in concert and listened to the album, I know they are the real deal.  A relief from nu-metal that has been clogging up the airwaves for years, 30STM mixes synthesizers, loud guitars, catchy riffs, and emotional vocals.  Just listen to Capricorn, the first track, and you will be convinced that this band is the \\"next big thing.\\"  If you have any interest in modern rock, then 30 Seconds to Mars is a must-buy.  Trust me, you won't be disappointed if you purchase this album - it is filled with eleven amazing songs.  You NEED to check these guys out!!!
B00005JKWJ|4.0|`Blade II' was one of the few movies that escaped the classic pit-fall of &quot;part twoers,&quot; it did not disappoint. The action sequences were eye widening and the new improved vampire dissolve effects were welcomed. The story line was clearly written and had a few well enjoyed twists.  If you came to see Blades' car, you will be disappointed, as it holds all of 8 seconds of the movies frames. Sound was well mastered and the CGI animation impressive, however, this is not a soundtrack worthy of the same recognition of `Blade I' fame. I tend to buy part two's, part three's, etc., purely for the satisfaction in owning a complete series, but in this case, `Blade II' won't suffer from &quot;shelf dust.&quot; If you enjoyed the first `Blade,' buy this DVD.
0792841344|5.0|I've always adored this spooky,nightmarish movie!I had this one on VHS,but the DVD looked way cool,so...I was not dissapointed!As well as a great looking and sounding transfer you get some super extras:insightful and entertaining commentary by Don,Mike,Bill,and Angus.a 1979 interview with Don and Angus.A Fangoria TV commercial.an Australian TV promo,promotional stills,etc.A must for Phans!
B00006AFUR|5.0|It's so rare to find a band that can express a genre of music in different ways. 30 seconds to mars are unique and not typical, which attracted me. The music was amazing, unlike overplayed electric guitars that sound like a jumbled mess. The sound captured me and the lead singer's voice is beautiful. When one finds out that the lead singer is an actor, you can't help but gasp. How can so much talent exist in one person, and in one band? The whole band makes the cd, it's perfect to me. I can't comprehend the brilliance of this cd. It's a rock classic everyone should own.
B00006G8G4|5.0|This was the best movie that i have seen in about 5 years. The great cinematography. The wonderful editing, it is pure genius
B000067CPX|4.0|You know I do not even like the RHCP. When Under the Bridge comes on the radio goes off. I NEVER want to hear that sucky song again. But I bought this disc. I like it. Go figure. So if you like the RHCP you may not like THIS.
6303234844|5.0|I have a lot of music videos on DVD but none compare to Secret World Live.  I attended this concert when it was in my town and the video truly captures the experience.  It was one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  I have also seen it on Laser Disk.  It was awsome.  Will the DVD version ever be released?  It doesn't make sense that it's not out in this format.  Please let the world know when the DVD will be available.
6301007360|1.0|How could anyone cast the greatest diva of the 20th century in this disgrace? No wonder La Divina never made another picture. Compared to \\"Revenge of the Zombies\\" or \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\" this one is a step down. Understandably, Callas never made another motion picture. Who could have faced a camera after this catastrophe? See it only to know how beautiful Callas was--and how deeply she was humiliated after her career had ended. Sad, sad.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Pixar has done it again.  First came the two Toy Story films, and now comes &quot;Monster's Inc,&quot; a surprising treat for kids and adults to share.  <BR>When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I wasn't sure what to make of it.  Pixar has a brilliant way of not giving away much in their previews so audiences are drawn with curiosity to find out what the writers could possibly do with monsters.  I'm pleased that they came up with a good idea.<BR>The plot of &quot;Monster's Inc&quot; is light enough for kids to enjoy and imaginative enough to keep Disney/Pixar's reputation for great movies solid.  There are plenty of sight gags to keep the movie consistently funny and some touching moments to add a &quot;human&quot; element to the monster characters.<BR>Also, some great actors lend their voices to this one, including Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the main characters.  These two have great chemistry (even if it is only vocal) just like the kind Tom Hanks and Tim Allen shared in the Toy Story movies.  And look for other comical stylings from actors like Jennifer Tilly, Steve Buscemi, and John Ratzenberger.  <BR>I don't mean to keep going on about Pixar, but, let's face it, their animation is stunning!  Example: Just look at Sully's fur and notice the VERY fine detailing.  The DVD offers a crisp picture so one can fully appreciate all of the hard work that went into each frame of the movie.  <BR>Overall, &quot;Monster's Inc&quot; is a wonderful family film and a great DVD with loads of extras.  So check it out....and don't go in the closet!
B000002G0P|5.0|I don't know why this album was so under-rated. It has everything except the usual mindless love songs that everyone must be sick of by now. Bordering on brilliant, this is a thinking person's album. I am especially impressed with the sound quality. The sound engineer really earned his money here, this has great dynamics and solid bass lines. You will probably  find this in the [place] at a great price, due to it's intelligent writing and impressive musicianship(it's way over the kiddies heads). Buy and ENJOY!!!
0811836363|5.0|So very many books were written about the Beatles, and so many TV documentries were made about them. Anthology is definitely the best one yet, and I don't think there will ever be another book as complete and sincere as it. For the first time the Beatles tell their own story (yes, even John - material from old intreviews with him are beautifuly collected and edited into the book), along with some help from George Martin, Derek Taylor and Neil Aspinall and some old quotes from Brian Epstein, Mel Evans, Pete Best and others, and that makes Anthology a truly unique experience. The story is told from such a personal viewpoint that you will feel like you're part of the band. George, Ringo, Paul and John will become your closest friends for the period of reading the book.<br />Anthology covers every (well, probably almost every) aspect of the Beatles' life and musical career. It starts as four seperate stories as every band member describes his childhood, then melds into the story of the band. All the interviews from the wonderful Anthology TV series are in the book, but so are many more. There are far more details - especially about the music itself, which was neglected in the series. While in the series some albums were hardly mentioned, in the book the Beatles refer to almost every song, telling a thing or two about its background. Also, more touchy subjects which were avoided in the series appear here - such as, the (phony) death of Paul McCartney, the (real) death of Stuart Sutcliffe, the unfortunate Hell's Angels incident and the terrible case of Charles Manson and his connection to the White Album. The photographs and documents shown in the book are facsinating as well.<br />And no, it's NOT too long. The only problem with the book is its weight, which makes it quite uncomfortable to read. Anthology is a superb book, which reminded me why I used to love the Beatles so much and got me to hear all their albums again - twice.
B00005YW4H|5.0|this CD really grew on me. Like some of the other reviewers, the songs sounded very much alike at first. But after keeping it in the car a few days, it quickly became the ONLY CD I was playing. The songs are catchy and mellow. Suprisingly, even my pop/rock coworkers ask me to replay it constantly. I don't know that I'd compare her to Ella or any of the greats, a little early for that; but she certainly has a wonderful and distinctive voice. I'm glad I bought the CD, it'll stay in my heavy rotation.
B000005K67|5.0|I'll start by stating the obvious - This is not Led Zeppelin's best album. Not by a long shot. I could never quite decide which is the best one, but IV (aka Untitled, aka Rune Album, aka Zoso) is not that. It's extremely commercial, designed to be successful (and that worked, by the way; another problem of the album is that so many of the songs - especially Stairway To Heaven - have been so terribly overplayed on the radio and, well, anywhere else.) In order to achieve that, the band cleaned their act a little, smoothed some rough edges. The blues influences, very powerful on the first album, are present, but very lightly and moderately. The music still rocks, but not half as loud and rough as LZ II or III. Instrumental segments are kept to a minimum, because that kind of stuff doesn't sell. Sure, the four minute drum solo that is Moby Dick and the long jamming on Dazed And Confused are two of the highlights of the first albums, but how many of your avarege rock-pop fans have the patience for that? Also, the production is dreadfuly clean. Some of the best songs on the album could have benefited a lot from a rougher sound, and indeed sounded a lot better when played live (see the Black Dog performance on 'The Song Remains The Same'.)<br />It's just because of this that Led Zeppelin IV is the perfect Led Zeppelin album for the non-Led Zeppelin fan, or, on the other hand, the perfect introduction to the band for someone who thinks Led Zeppelin equals Stairway To Heaven. Those are sure to enjoy singing along to old favorites like Stairway and Rock And Roll, as well as the lesser known Going To California and Misty Mountain Hop while When The Levee Breaks and Black Dog prepare them for the real Led Zeppelin (albums I-III). Later they can listen to 'The Song Remains The Same' to hear those songs performed like they should be, and hear the brilliant playing of Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John \\"Bonzo\\" Bonham at full power.<br />There is, despite everything, a wonderfulselection of songs here. Black Dog, a slightly bluesy track, is a marvelous song (though it sounds much better live), with powerful, soulful singing from Robert Plant. Rock And Roll is a fast, catchy rocker, the kind of tune that gets stuck in your head and gives you a strange, irresistable urge to sing along, tap your feet, or, in more extreme cases, play your air guitar or drum on the nearest available solid object. Lacking the depth of heavy metal classics like Whole Lotta Love and Immigrant Song, Rock And Roll is still extremely fun. The Battle Of Evermore is a brilliant, unusual turn for Page and Plant, and probably the only song which sounds fantastic in this clean, smooth production. It's the height of Led Zeppelin's Tolkien and mysticism obsession, and sounds like nothing else they've ever done. Stairway To Heaven, while it is one of the most overplayed songs in history, is still an excellent epic song with some great moments.<br />Side B is slightly weaker; Misty Mountain Hop, Four Sticks and Going To California are all great tracks, but none is especially original or memorable. Misty Mountain Hop is a song which was probably made to be heavy metal but was softened and cleaned. Four Sticks is heavier, but nothing exceptional. And Going To California is a sweet little ballad, a nice song but really too smooth for Led Zeppelin. The whole thing, though, is saved by When The Levee Breaks. Some of the negative reviews on this album said that the best song on it was When The Levee Breaks and it wasn't even their song. Yes, it is the best song on the album. No, it's not a Led Zeppelin original.  the brilliance of this track is Led Zeppelin's arrangement, which turned a good old blues song into one of Led Zeppelin's heaviest, dirtiest, most powerful pieces of music. Bonham, Page and Jones did a brilliant job, not to mention Plant who brought out his harmonica for the recording. After hearing this album, try to find a live recording of the song. It's guaranteed to blow your mind.<br />Whether or not you're a Led Zeppelin fan, this album is a must, an essential part of every collection. There's something here to please anyone, and if When The Levee Breaks is tough on your eardrums, listen to Stairway To Heaven again, or try Going To California. If you are a fan, don't have a grudge against this album because it was so successful - there's nothing wrong with compromising a little to expand one's audience.
B00006BTCA|3.0|This album is decent and worth hearing. But, I think the Joy Division comparisons are a bit misleading and lazy. True, their vocalist bears an uncanny similarity to Ian Curtis' gruff, low voice, and there's a dark, stiff, brooding, minimalist feel to many of the songs. However, musically this is closer stylistically to early 90s English bands, like a more straightforward Kitchens of Distinction, or an artier Adorable.    What initially drew me to Interpol were their English post-punk and early Brit-pop leanings. It's refreshing to hear a band attempt a style so inherently fresh, energetic, yet poppy; elements which much of the era's indie-rock and emo sorely lack. One can hope more bands pick up on this trend and inject some new life into indie-rock's bloated corpse.    However, when placing this puppy under the microscope for serious criticism, it doesn't always hold up. It lacks the subtlety, melodicism, emotional depth, and the Martin Hannett-produced atmosphere (a CRUCIAL element to JD's sound), which is why I think the Joy Division comparisons don't hold water beyond the vocals. Plus, the melodies aren't quite as sharp and infectious (nothing as hooky as \\"Transmission\\" or \\"Disorder\\"), and the bass is not as melodic or inventive as Peter Hook's.    But there are some good, solid tunes, like the bouncy, manic \\"Say Hello to the Angels\\", the cool \\"Obstacle 1\\" and \\"PDA\\", and the lush atmosphere of \\"Hands Away\\" (the latter two reminiscent of the Chameleons), which all offer some of the finest listening 2002 has to offer. But there's still a monotonous feel pervading many songs, preventing them from really jumping out and igniting the kind of sparks bands like Joy Division did over 20 years ago.    Indie-rock has become such a stale institution that the best we can do is re-hash the glory of pre-indie, post-punk sounds. I guess I can live with that (being the new wave obsessive that I am), but let's hope these neo-new wave bands can expand on what their forefathers set in motion and put their own personal stamp on it. Compared to much of what passes for indie-rock today, this album is good. But when placed alongside the music of Manchester England two decades ago, it sorta pales. Still a band to keep an eye on, though.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I am quite fond of this album, and I have been listening to it continuously for months after a friend receommended that I give John a listen. I find that some of the songs toward the end of the album seem to drag a bit for me, but the vast majority of this newcomer's music is upbeat, humorous, and well crafted. Personal favorites would include &quot;Why Georgia&quot; , especially for while driving, and &quot;Neon&quot;, for its jazzy influences. All those who have a taste for quality singer-songwriters should lend an ear to John Mayer.
0783225733|1.0|I cannot believe that this movie meant anything to anyone.It was so fake and the special effects were terrible.Tom Hanks is brilliant but not in this movie.If you watch this it will be wasting 2 and a half hours of your time.
B000000WHH|5.0|In many respects, &quot;Colour by Numbers,&quot; the second album from Culture Club, is a perfect record.  It's a crowd-pleasing mix of soul, reggae, and pop that richly deserved its multiplatinum status.  There's the Motown flavor of the delectable &quot;Church of the Poison Mind,&quot; the reggae lilt of their signature hit &quot;Karma Khameleon,&quot; and the disco twirl of &quot;Miss Me Blind.&quot;  Boy George may have assumed top billing as the group's lead singer, but backing vocalist Helen Terry made a pretty strong impression on the album as well.  Her vocal contribution to the showstopper &quot;That's the Way (I'm Only Trying to Help You)&quot; makes this one of the best songs Culture Club has recorded and still stands as an underappreciated album cut.  For all the media attention concerning George, his turbulent relationship with drummer Jon Moss, and the reports of heroin addiction, Culture Club were among the most vibrant groups of the 1980s.  Isn't it time you started to add some &quot;colour&quot; to your music collection?
B00006AFUR|5.0|Music trends come and go, bands are idolized and quickly forgotten by the dominantly teenage consumers, and most will make little or no impact on society or secure a place in music history, eventually becoming a 5 minute spot on VH1's Where Are They Now... if they are lucky. As we advance further into the new millenium, the rock music scene has progressively gotten worse. Most bands on mainstream rock radio aren't even coming close to the original sound or the defining style they claim to have. It seems now that music is more about image than anything. Very few realize that alternative music was born from a rebellion against the exact same pop culture exploitation it embraces today. After looking at all of the overrated pop rock groups and always wondering if there is ever going to be another amazing talent that will revolutionize the music world once again, I almost gave up on rock music because the plauge of conformity involved disgusted me. However, after the purchase of this album, I am convinced that there is some hope for the future of rock music. There is one band out there keeping it alive. There is one band that will spawn many more great musicians through inspiration and originality. 30 Seconds To Mars is the future of rock music. The band name itself speaks for the theme of the album and is an instant indicator of the uniqueness of the group. Diversity is the main characteristic of this release: The intricate guitar riffs, pulsating drum beats, and soaring vocals are opposite anything I have ever heard. The cd has been lodged in my cd player since the first day I bought it, and will most likely remain there for many moons. So if you haven't bought this album, I hope my review has been helpful to you and I trust you will come to the right decision and make your contribution to the future of rock.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This has got to be the best album I have listened to in a long time. 30 Seconds to Mars has an extremely unique sound. The vocals are powerful, and the lyrics are thought provoking. It's the kind of music that lets you travel in your mind. I highly recommend picking up a copy if you're sick of all the disposable ... music out there...come on, you know you want to.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Someday, when the Harry Potter fad is back in perspective and adults no longer wet themselves with excitement about the impending release of every children's book, this movie will be remembered as an inocuous kid flick -- nothing more. I admit the casting seems to have been excellent, but then I never bothered with the book, so I had no preconceptions regarding how the characters should look. The special effects were all right -- especially the flying sequences. As for the story, any comparisons to Cinderella were purely intentional.  Listening to 50-year-olds go on and on about how magical this film is stimulates my gag reflex. If you're looking for an &quot;adult&quot; fairytale, buy a Lord of the Rings DVD. Any grownup who spends his/her allowance on this Harry Potter silliness should be spanked and sent to his/her room without supper.
B000002IWQ|4.0|After the lack of bottom end on \\"Presto\\" and \\"Roll the Bones\\" (which were still, respectively, five and four star efforts), Rush enlisted Kevin (Caveman) Shirley to engineer this baby, and he earned his money!!  Turned up the same volume as another Rush CD, it will blow out your speakers, which for some is a good thing.  Songwise, the loud sound lets Alex's guitar come front and center, as \\"Stick It Out\\" and \\"Alien Shore\\" have some great, distorted lines.  Lyrically, Neil is his usual, amazing self, finally tackling a subject that's just a LITTLE overplayed, Love.  Of course, he does it in his usual, non-cliched way, so it's a fresh take.  The schizophrenia exhibited in \\"Cold Fire\\" is LOL funny.  Additionally, his ride cymbal during the chorus will make your jaw drop.  Elsewhere, \\"Double Agent,\\" \\"Cut to the Chase\\" and \\"Leave that Thing Alone\\" are rocking, worthy additions to the Rush catalog.  The only song that doesn't work for me is \\"Everyday Glory\\" because for once, Neil's lyrics DO lapse into cliche, and the instrumentation is a little TOO ordinary.  There aren't too many Rush songs that I DON'T like (\\"Turn the Page,\\" \\"Neurotica\\") so that's why this album only gets four stars, but with Rush every album is like Xmas, so how can you go wrong?
B0000024V2|5.0|It's unfortunate, I suppose, that so many great musicians put out their best stuff when they've run their first string of drug/alcohol abuse out close to the end (eg. Clapton in Cream into Blind Faith).  By all accounts, Johnny's SERIOUS party lifestyle (which some who were around at the time say made Keith Richards look like Leo Sayer), from a young age, was nearing it's first bottom-out point during the recording of this album.  Still, one listen and it's clear that he hadn't hit bottom yet.  <BR>I think there are good arguments that Johnny was about as good a guitar player as you'd find by the time this album came out....this is stone-cold junkie blues rock at its pinnacle.  There is no way to improve upon this album in that regard.  The blues rock guitar playing is simply mind-boggling...the songs are great...the band is deep in the pocket....and there is a very enjoyable variety on the disc:  from the definitive version of \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (seriously!) to 50s revival (\\"Miss Anne\\") to a blue psychadelic treatment of the oldies (\\"Slippin' and Slidin'\\") to 4am studio balls-out rave up of naked, screaming guitar (\\"Fast Life Rider\\").  Of course, the real magic, though, is on the junkie blue rockers...the whole running order starting with \\"Memory Pain\\" is about as fine a stretch of songs on an album as you can find.  This is the real deal, and I think it rings so true because Johnny was taking his personal \\"blues\\" down to the bitter end at the time.  I've always assumed that growing up a near-blind albino in Port Arthur, Texas in the 50s and 60s must have been a blues-inducing experience to the nth degree.  I can't profess to know what demons Johnny was (and, by all accounts still is) carrying around, but the pain, filtered through hard  drugs, comes screaming full-bore out of his fingers and wonderful voice in these dark blue rockers.  You can feel and smell his pain, and it is the furthest thing from someone faking the blues as you can get.  He has the chops (no one will ever touch the guitar he was playing back then) and the authenticity.  Johnny had already shown on various releases prior to this album that he could play any traditional blues style with ease, sounding authentic because he really WAS authentic, when you get down to it.  On \\"Second Winter,\\" Johnny used those blues as the launching pad for dark experiments in playing, songwriting, arranging, and studio trickery.  I've never understood the idolatry of Stevie Ray Vaughn when there are so many albums by Johnny Winter to pick from that show (at least in the late 60s into the 70s) superior guitar playing, much greater variety, and most importantly, a MUCH greater willingness to take chances.  Johnny could have done the Stevie-thing and just played blues shuffles, by and large, for album after album....but Johnny's string of 60s/70s albums eschewed that boring, lazy approach to take blues guitar playing and singing in many directions, always trying new things and taking changes.  That's why Stevie could never carry Johnny's jock.<br />I saw a bill several times in Austin in the early 80s that made this point again and again:  Little Charlie Sexton and the Nightcats would open, and people would say \\"Hey, that little 13 year old kid dressed like a 50s greaser is pretty good!\\"; then Stevie Ray would come out (playing a much more varied set than he did once he started putting out albums) and people would be duly impressed with his prodigious chops.  Then Johnny would come out, launch into space with guitar monstrosity that wouldn't stop for about 1 1/2 hours (despite the fact that at every Johnny show I've seen over three decades, some [person]always throws a beer in his face by the end of the show from the crowd), and no one would leave the place remembering anyone else on the bill AT ALL.  Johnny ruled, and this album is his best bar none.  This will always be one of my top ten albums, and I find myself reaching for it repeatedly no matter how big my record collection gets.<br />ps.  Johnny, PLEASE take the retirement from the road that you have so richly earned, and stop tarnishing your wonderful legacy with shows that show how far your playing has slipped, given  your health and on-going habits....You've earned your rest on the porch.
B000002IOW|5.0|Like others have said, there's really no big huge hit song contained in this baby, but the songs are so consistently strong (and do become SOOO catchy over time) that it's not a problem.  Some of Neil's best lyrics are found here that show us the wide-eyed wonder of life.  &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; and &quot;Available Light&quot; are two that immediately spring to mind, two of the most moving songs Rush has ever done (goosebump city!).  Additionally, like always, the guys shine on their respective instruments, with Neil adding some very groovy drums to &quot;Scars&quot; and &quot;Superconductor.&quot;  His ride cymbal on the chorus of &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; is the smoothest I have ever heard a ride cymbal played and just melts your rhythmic heart.  The sound could use a little more bottom end, but that's a small complaint when listening to these amazing songs.  I think Presto might just be in their all-time top 5 best album list, cuz it's so &quot;magical.&quot;
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This is one of the best live cd's I've ever heard. The highlights are the extended jam version of Rock Bottom, Doctor, Doctor, I'm a loser, Let it roll, shoot, shoot, out in the street they simply come off better than studio versions of the same songs.The other performances are excellent too. The two new tracks are good especially hot and ready.
B00004U56N|5.0|until now, jazz fans have had to suffer <BR>the inferior audio mix and post-production<BR>that characterized the CD version. one of <BR>the finest works in jazz is finally presented<BR>with the audio engineering it deserves.
B000005J56|5.0|I don't even listen to Cuban music, but I work at a music store and one evening happened to put this on.  I literally stood there for 20 minutes completely in awe of what was coming out of the speakers.  You don't just listen to this album, you experience it.  It is amazing.  'Chan Chan' got my attention and the rest of the album held it.  I highly recommend this album...even if you're not into Cuban music. It's an unbelievable work of art.
B00005JKNF|4.0|Robert Altman's film is set in a country estate in England during the 1930's.  A group of wealthy people is assembled for a hunting weekend, accompanied by their various servants.  The contrast between the life-style of the people who are upstairs and those who are downstairs serving them is made very clear.  However, within the two groups there is also a hierarchy and a very definite line of authority.  There is sexual dalliance within and between the two groups.  When a murder occurs, the atmosphere suddenly changes to one of suspicion and mutual finger-pointing.  The sets and costumes are lavish and lovely and this movie is a real treat to the eye and the ear.  There are many talented and well-known actors in the film, many of them playing small parts brilliantly.
B000056VJ7|5.0|WOW REALLY FAST SERVICE WOULD FOR SURE THROUGH AGAIN <BR>AND CD USED WAS IN GREAT CONDTION WOULD NEVER KNOWN IT<BR>WAS USED AND PLAYS GREAT THANKS
B00005QDW1|5.0|I love Gwen Stefani and have liked some of No Doubt's songs over the years starting with Just a Girl... This album is as much pop and synth as reggae, I really love it, except for maybe 1 or 2 songs, which aren't terrible either.  Underneath it All (w/ Lady Saw), Don't Let Me Down, Start the Fire, and Running, are some of my favorites. My absolute favorite though has got be the last track, Rock Steady - I can play it over and over and over! Good song to listen to on a rainy day, it will transport you to the beach!
0671015206|4.0|I recently read somewhere on the internet that, according to a late 1990s study conducted by the Federal Government focusing on the top twenty percent of all wage earners, almost all of them have more invested in their cars than in either their homes or their investments.  Please bear in mind that cars depreciate in value, while homes appreciate.  Given these two sobering facts, more people of affluent backgrounds in America actually face declining net worth, and based on the latest research, including Stanley and Danko's Millionaire Next Door, the situation is steadily growing worse every year- especially now with accelerating bankruptcy rates and short-term consumer debt at an all-time high.  This state of affairs is most unsettling when one ponders the implications associated with many college-age people who are graduating with outrageous debt burdens accumulated from school tuition, expensive car purchases and profligate credit card use.<br />The Millionaire Next Door eerily shows how those who live in expensive homes and drive fancy cars often do not have real wealth, while those who are wealthy often do not live in expensive homes and drive fancy cars.  Many people who are not wealthy have what can only be called a stereotypical view of the wealthy.  They believe that millionaires wear expensive clothes and watches, drive expensive cars, live in mansions, and actively acquire other status artifacts.  Although they may qualify as `affluent' based on their lifestyle and income, many highly educated, high-income, and hard-working people are not millionaires, let alone financially well-off.  Many of them are in fact surviving from paycheck to paycheck.  Almost all of these people ask themselves the following question- how come I am not wealthy?<br />While it may be rare to run into a person who derives a million dollar plus income, it is more common than many people think to run into people who have a net worth that is one million dollars or more.  Many of us buyinto the get rich quick stories we often hear on television- instant lottery winners, hard scrabble ordinary people turned real estate moguls, and even the techie dot-com employee turned venture capitalist overnight with a successful IPO.  The reality however, is far more mundane and startling.  Many of those whose net worth exceeds one million are not only self-made, they also tend to come from a variety of backgrounds, more than a few of which are commonly thought of as `dull-normal'.  These individuals typically achieve millionaire status over a period of three decades or more, and typically reach millionaire status after the age of fifty.  As a group, these high net worth people amass their wealth slowly and steadily over time, meticulously plan and budget their consumption and their investments, and seek the advice of specialized professionals (accountants, lawyers, and financial planners) when making financial decisions that will affect their wealth.  Although they do engage in the same consumption activities- buying cars, homes, and clothes and such as their more `affluent' counterparts, they do differ significantly in their pattern of consumption- that is, they tend to differ significantly in their manner, type and quantity of consumption.      <br />The authors describe in clear and simple terms how ordinary people can become wealthy.  Wealth does not have to be inherited or won in games of chance, such as gambling, lottery tickets, and the stock market.  Wealth is more often the result of hard work, perseverance, planning and most of all- self-discipline. Surprisingly, luck, inheritance, advanced degrees or even intelligence often has little or nothing to do with it.  Although many of us would like to believe (including myself) that these aforementioned things will make it easier to obtain wealth, a disturbingly large amount of literature actually has found that large amounts of pre-exisiting wealth actually has an adverse effect on wealth building, especially among offspring.<br />The authors clearly define qualitatively for themselves what it means to be wealthy, and a means to quantify wealth- that is how much money does it take to be considered `rich'.  The single biggest demerit of this exposition is that the authors judge wealth purely from a financial standpoint; no other criteria are considered.  Readers of this and other texts on wealth-building strategies should stop to consider this interesting proposition: Given homeownership free and clear, which would you rather be at age 65- fit as a fiddle with 200K in the bank, or in extremely poor health with a cool million in the bank?  For those who would choose the million and poor health, here's a hint to the real solution: ask yourself just how long you will stay a millionaire given the dismal state of affairs and high cost of care (read HMOs) so disturbingly characteristic of the United States medical care system.<br />One should bear in mind that being financially independent does not necessarily mean being a millionaire.  Being financially independent and building wealth both take discipline, sacrifice and hard work.  If you are willing to make the necessary trade-offs of your time, energy, and consumption habits, however, you can begin building wealth and achieving financial independence.  In the end, I believe that true wealth comes from making three ongoing and critical investments in good education, good health and good nutrition.  These three ongoing investments are absolutely necessary for optimum performance and maximum productivity in one's chosen career or avocation, and for ultimate wealth with well-being.
0316666343|3.0|I thought the story line was well done and even uplifting (I loved the ending) and the viewpoint - a murdered girl relaying the action while watching from Heaven, as she grows and matures - is wonderful. But...<br />I have to say that the book was very poorly edited. There were signs that the author had worked out a scenario for the murder - how Susie was killed, how her body dealt with - and then scrapped it and went with the scenario that is central to the story.<br />Not a problem: authors do it all the time, except that I kept tripping over pieces of the older, earlier scenario that just didn't make sense in view of the fact pattern that was given. They needed to be cleaned up.  As an example (without giving too many specifics), right after she was killed, in an underground location that was apparently never actually found, the killer dealt with her body using a waterproof bag, put it into a sort of box, and threw everything into a sinkhole.<br />And yet, they find a part of the body, lots of blood, articles of clothing. And there is a mention of the body seeping through a garage floor?  Definitely an example of the need for a timeline and a map in writing crucial scenes and setting up a plot.<br />As another example, the science used for a 1960's - 70's murder is 1990's science. If you know anything about that subject, it detracts from the story, making you raise your head and say, \\"Huh?  They didn't know that sort of thing back then!\\"<br />That's just picky stuff that writers are supposed to be concerned with. And editors. (Why didn't someone work with the writer to 'tighten it up', I wonder...)<br />Overall, this is a book with a deep understanding of character that seems to be due to the author's own experiences.  The point of view is great, and the descriptions - for example, a moment when Susie's bereaved father catches a glimpse of her in the shards of broken glass - are sometimes breathtaking.  Its popularity is deserved.<br />But if you're a nit-picker and get annoyed with sloppy editing, you may wish to be ready to grit your teeth.cker and get annoyed with sloppy editing, you may wish to be ready to grit your teeth.
B00006CJOY|4.0|Well, it is differant. It is a whole lot more energetic than his former albums. I do like it, but I guess like most people I have grown used to a more &quot; Tranquilo Manu &quot; which this album is not. I would deffinatly buy it though. Great live version of &quot; Por el Suelo. &quot;<br />Viva La Mano Negra y Chao,<br />Arturo de la mota buena ( EE.UU )
B00006AFUR|5.0|5 stars.... man five isnt enough for this album. yes, the young actor turned rockstar has given all of us a new gift. with the birth of his new album he has already made a name for himself. each song seems to get better and better. with each one better then the last. and people this isnt one you'd get tired with. yes this young man has a great talent. out of all the ablums that came out this summer this is one that most be in your collection. bring Leto and his amazing album home you wont regreat it.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars debut CD is truly amazing.  The first single, &quot;Capricorn&quot;, caught my interest as soon as I heard it.  Their sound is unique and edgy enough to be different from other bands, but not so out-there that you're wondering where they came from.  I've found that the more I listen to it, the more I like it, and I've been having a very hard time even taking it out of my CD player to listen to anything else.
0345350499|5.0|If you love the legends of King Arthur, this is an amazing book.  If your a child of the Goddess, it puts a different perspective on the story of King Arthur.  Some say it's a feminist view of the Legends, but anyone that loves the Legends would enjoy reading this, regardless of the view!  It certainly does not hurt to read the Authors story of the Legend of King Arthur from a different perspective.  It's a book worth reading over and over again.
B00006AFUR|5.0|What an amazing Album. I have only been a fan for a short time (about a month), but already I'm a 100% fan. I think 30 Seconds To Mars is one of the greatest bands out today and their first album is a perfect example of this...
B00005BL2A|2.0|I rushed to buy this album the first day it came out (like many of you). I listened to it several times, let it rest , came back to it again and it simply doesnt grow on you. The sound is flat, it doesnt offer anything new much worse it lets you wishing for the old DM albums. The songs 'Shine' ''Freelove' and 'I feel loved' save this album from being a major dissapointment.'The Dead of the Night' is the worst song ive heard from this group, i skip it (something i never do with DM albums). After such a brilliant album like ULTRA im amazed they came up with this tracks, i still wonder what happened . This goes way in the bottom of my DM album list(being all five and four stars this one is a two). Still is an album every DM mode fan should have and buy.
B00006AFUR|5.0|It's not very often that an album comes by that grabs your attention like 30 SECONDS TO MARS does. From the soaring riffs of their first hit &quot;Capricorn,&quot; and into the depths of &quot;Oblivion,&quot; 30 SECONDS TO MARS is an achievement of sonic complexity.<br />Blending their own futuristic brand of techno with searing guitars and soaring vocals, Jared Leto and brother Shannon have offered a break to the monotony of standard pop-punk and aggro-rock.<br />This album is not to be missed.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I hear Mr. Altman enjoyed working in England so much he is seriously considering spending the rest of his days there; only making English movies.<BR>From watching the film, it is obvious that enjoyment was had, for this is an impeccably crafted tale by a master director, and fully deserving of it's Academy awards.
6304711875|5.0|Yes, &quot;Scream&quot; launched the career of Kevin Williamson (creator of &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;), and yes, we're all tired of the ironic, self-referential, semi-spoof teen movies that swarmed theaters from 1996 to 2001.<br />However, &quot;Scream&quot; is ultimately successful because mixed in with its ribbing of the slasher-flick genre, it's a pretty darn scary movie. The first sequence taps a lot of raw nerves: prank calls, being home alone, scary guys in dark cloaks with spooky faces, etc. Later scenes of the killer flailing up the stairs after Neve Campbell are suitably chilling.<br />&quot;Scream&quot; not only winks at slasher S.O.P., it adheres to it effectively--you can laugh at the fact that you're falling for all its tricks, but you fall for them nonetheless.<br />Most disconcerting of all: seeing Matthew Lillard without Freddie Prinze Jr. anywhere nearby!
B00006IUL7|3.0|This was a quality film, no doubt about it.  Christopher Nolan does a superb job of capturing phobias and psychological elements of characters with the obstacles he sets in play.  However, I think that in the case of \\"Insomnia\\", the photography did not capture enough of the delirium that Pacino's character was experiencing.  This left Pacino blinking his eyes and doing his best drunken performance.  Why not let the glare of the sun flood the camera?  There wasn't enough first person point of view shots to show you how the lack of sleep was affecting him.  Particularly in the scene on the back of the boat when Robin Williams character is practically programming his mind.  I just didn't \\"see\\" the Insomnia as much as I would've liked.<br />Hilary Swank does a decent job of playing the suspicious police officer and Martin Donovan has a chilling raw moment out in the fog that leaves an impression.  For the record, I think that a Howard Hughes biography by Nolan is a bad idea.  I really hope he sticks with fictional narratives and remakes a Hitchcock film like Vertigo.
B00005RYLE|5.0|I saw the Evil Dead movies backwards,from 3,2,1.I don't know which one is my total favourite because all of them are great,but I can tell you this one is the sickest of them all.It starts off slow,but builds up as it goes along.I thought is had a claustrophoic look to it,it feels like you're with those five people in the cabin.I really loved the look of the movie,dark,gory,funny and the deadits look really cool,well I was 11 when I saw it.It's one hell of a ride.There's neat bits of Texas Chiansaw Massacre and Night Of The Living Dead in this classic horror picture.Why can't they make horror movies like this anymore.The DVD as alot of cool special features.I recommond this film to anykind a movie fan,you'll love it

0671027573|5.0|This was my first Linda Howard experience ... as I can see from other fans, I am not alone in that it was definitely not my last.  I thought it was everything a romantic mystery should be.  Funny, entertaining, sexy ...  She's a writer without pretention and snobbery.  I have since bought and read almost every LH book I can get my hands on - this is one is still my favorite, if I had to choose one!  I've caught myself recommending it to complete strangers while browing in a book store!
B00006AFUR|5.0|Regardless of your opinions of actors venturing into musicianship, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. 30 Seconds to Mars' debut album is simply too powerful to be ignored. ... There isn't a weak moment in the album. From the opening chords of \\"Capricorn\\", right down to the last seconds of \\"Year Zero\\", there isn't a dull moment. A beautiful guitar crescendo kicks in between \\"End of the Beginning\\" and \\"Year Zero\\"...it lasts only a few seconds and serves as a segue, but even THAT is well crafted and important to the album. Buy it. Now.

B000066NW0|5.0|I love listening to Let Go, because I can relate to all of Avril's songs. It is an amazing CD and I recommend it to everyone! For all of those people who are dissing Avril... Look at yourself - are you famous or significant in anyway? I didn't think so. So stop putting down someone who actually made herself into something. She made it. You are all just messing around with your little garage bands and are too afraid to go for anything....<BR>I'm proud of what Avril has done with her life so far, and I'm proud to call myself a fan of hers!
B00006AFUR|4.0|In an era of boy and prefabrocated studio bands, it is a nice change when a band comes along with as much power and feeling in their words as that of 30 Seconds To Mars.  Their self titled CD is a welcomed change from the angst driven and lovey-dovey songs that are being played over the radio today.  The first song on this album, \\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name), sets the pace and feeling of this band.  They have given rock music a \\"Brand New Name\\", and have shown the listening public that there is more to music then they are used to.  30 Seconds To Mars is an album that you can play from start to finish and never get bored with what you are hearing.  The entrancing lyrics mixed with melodic guitar and auxillary rhythms takes the listener on a new journey with every song.  This album will shoot to the top quick and if you miss the rocket, you'll never get to Mars.
020530902X|5.0|This is the standard guide for writing English correctly.  Admittedly, English has no rules, and what rules she has are ment to be broken; however, this book is for poor mucks like myself who are not Shakespeare.<br />The first part is quick guide on stlye with 11 rules on how to write clearly, with hints on punctuation and syntax.  The second part deals with rules of composition, as for an essay or paper. The fourth part deals with matters of form, or better put, which word to use, and using those words in the right way.  Part four deals with misused word--I know that only anal people are concerned with this, but anal people tenmd to be our bosses and overlords, so humor them!  Part fivbe deals with the tone of writing, and what type of voice to use.<br />New for the Fourth edition is a glossery, which I actually found useful.  Net being an English major or a grammart Nazi, the defitions help me immeasurably.  There is also an afterword by Charles Osgood, of NPR's \\"Osgood Files.\\"  It is more of an appreciation than a new list of rules.  IF you are a fan of Osgood, you will enjoy it.<br />Personally, the key to style is find your own, and that only comes by practice.  Admittedl;y, people like David Horowitz or Orson Scott Card have good styles that develop early on, we each have that spark of divinity in us.  This book can help us find our own style.
B00005OAIE|4.0|...Mayer's sound is excellent in it's own right. Funny thing is, when a friend played this for me, he mentioned the simularity to Dave Matthews' vocals. I replied yes, but the voice is better, ... It is great to hear \\"kids\\" making music like this again.If you like classic rock with a touch of the bluesy sound, buy this one.

6305949980|5.0|In this movie, there are is a town for each holiday, and the denizens of each town spend all year getting ready for the day when they go out into the world and celebrate their holiday along with the people of the real world.  This movie focuses on the antics of Jack Skellington, the ruler of Halloweentown, a.k.a. The Pumpkin King.  Anyway, Jack's been feeling a bit depressed lately.  He feels as if something's missing from his life.  When Jack stumbles onto the doorway that leads to Christmastown, he decides to do Christmas for a year and let Santa Claus(or Sandy Claws, as Jack calls him)take a break.  Jack and the other denizens of Halloweentown mean well, but they comically mess up everything up and make toys that are frightening instead of fun.  Also, to make matters worse, Jack has Lock, Shock, and Barrel(Halloweentown's three most mischevious citizens)kidnap Santa, they take him to the Boogeyman, the one truly evil resident of Jack's kingdom.  After Jack finds out that Boogeyman's got his claws on Santa, it's up to Jack to rescue him.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars is currently touring with the band Incubus.  They are gaining many fans, along with myself, on this expedition.  Their stage preformance is amazing, the group has tons of energy and puts on an awesome show.  Their debuit CD is equally great.  The sound is very unique and keeps me listening the full way through.  I was not dissapointed at all, a few songs i was particularly drawn to were &quot;Capricorn&quot; &quot;Buddah for Mary&quot; and &quot;Oblivion&quot;.  These show the bands full capibilities and give u a preview of their full cd.  I reccommend this CD to anyone who enjoys music made with energy and creativity.
630204135X|4.0|Although I don't find this movie quite as awe inspiring as other reviewers here, I'm certainly not going to argue it's not great film making.  I found it perhaps just a little too much of an intellectual puzzle; Cries and Whispers (my personal Bergman favorite) I find to be more sensually involving, even more philosophically probing (because it is less intellectual, more human).  Well--it's an opinion; feel free to disagree.  Now here's the question:  What the heck is going on in this film's final scene?  First we see the nurse as she sees the actress packing.  Then we see no more of the actress, but continue to see the nurse packing up and catching the bus for home.  Then a quick shot of cameras in the process of filming, and a glimpse of a woman being filmed; who she is, what she's doing, I cannot tell.  After having seen the nurse convince the actress to speak that one fatal word, \\"Nothing,\\" I was left wondering if perhaps the nurse had, in the end, committed murder?  Perhaps this is an absurd conclusion to reach--perhaps the actress had already left and that's her we catch a glimpse of, having returned to being an actress again?  Or perhaps she's symbolically dead?  I dunno--but here you have my problem with the film:  as an intellectual puzzle, I find it impossible to satisfactorily solve.  I don't mind chewing on intellectual PROBLEMS for months and years on end--that's what life's about.  But PUZZLES it seems to me ought to have solutions.  Anybody got one?
6301599977|5.0|Five stars is not enough for this movie.  It is absolutely excellent.  The film is about baseball, but also the love of family and believing in your dreams.  Kevin Costner gives a stirring performance as Ray Kinsella, an Iowa farmer whose love for the game of baseball changes his life forever.  Amy Madigan plays Costner's supportive wife.  One day while working in his field, Ray hears a &quot;voice&quot; tell him &quot;If you build it, he will come&quot;.  Brushing this off, Ray lets the episode pass.  However, he continually hears the voice, and finally has a vision of a baseball field in his cornfield.  Ray remembers that Shoeless Joe Jackson was his father's hero and one of the infamous 1919 &quot;Black Sox&quot; who threw the World Series.  Jackson, however, didn't alter his play during the series and wound up hitting well over .300.  Meanwhile, Ray figures out what the voice was telling him; build a baseball field and Joe Jackson will come back.  Ray plows under his corn and builds a magnificent baseball field on his own property.  Finally, Jackson makes his appearance.  Shortly thereafter, the voice speaks to Ray again.  This time, the voice says &quot;Ease his pain&quot;.  Coincidentally, Ray and his wife attend a schoolboard meeting that same night.  The parents are upset about some of the books that are being used in the local schools, some of which are written by 1960s leader Terrance Mann.  Ray makes the connection; ease Mann's pain.  So, he sets off for Boston to search out Mann. Mann, Played superbly by James Earl Jones, was a baseball fan and once gave an interview expressing his disappontment at the destruction of old Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn.  Ray and Terrance attend a Boston Red Sox game, and the voice speaks to Ray again.  This time it says &quot;Go the distance&quot;.  There is also a message about &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham, a player who played only 1 inning of 1 game his entire career.  To Ray's surprise, Terrance also sees the message.  Nowthe two head to Minnesota to track down Graham.  Upon arriving, they discover Graham never played baseball again and became a local doctor. Ray steps out of his hotel room and is transported back to 1972, the year Graham died.  He finds Graham, played wonderfully by Burt Lancaster, walking down the street.  The two converse about Graham's playing days.  I was truly moved by Lancaster's portrayal of this character.  His conversation with Ray was excellent.  Ray asks &quot;Doc&quot; Graham to return with himself and Terrance to Iowa, but Doc declines.  However, later in their trip, Terrance and Ray pick up a young hitch-hiker, who announceds his name as Archie Graham!!  So he really did end up going with them after all, although he was much younger.  The group arrives back at Ray's farm in Iowa, and Archie happily joins the players on the field.  He told Ray that his one wish would have been to bat in the major leagues, for he only played the outfield in his one appearance.  He got his chance on Ray's field.  Terrance has a vision of his own.  He envisions people paying money to come and see Ray's wonderful &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;.  In the end, Terrance walks off the field and into the corn with the players, and Ray is left with a row of cars stretching for miles to see his field.<br />I can't explain enough how wonderful this movie is.  The actors are top-notch, and the storyline is excellent.  My favorite line from the movie is when Joe asks Ray &quot;Is this Heaven?&quot; and Ray answers &quot;No, its Iowa&quot;.  The sense of family and going all out to accomplish your dreams is truly heartwarming. If you are a baseball fan, or if you just like good movies with morals and values, then this is the movie for you.  Watch it, you won't be disappointed.

0812548094|5.0|Unlike some of the previous reviews I have never read Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan so I cannot compare it.  In a way I am glad I can't as I totally love this series, as soon as I am finished with one I have to go out and buy the next.<BR>This 2nd book made me laugh - Richards friendship with Gratch is excellent and the descriptions of the conservations and Gratchs reaction to things was funny at times.
B00006AFUR|5.0|You like the sound of some awsome keyboarding? Think space rock is the next greatest genre of music? Want to hear something totaly origional and unique?...CHECK THIS OUT! This isn't your usual rock LP, you'll find it difficult to stop listening once you purchase this.<br />One of the greatest albums released yet this year will blow your socks off and take you to stellar heights like the name entitles. 30 Seconds to Mars has amazed hundreds with their live shows and finally the masses can enjoy them at home. <br />Check this album out, join the revolution. You won't be disappointed.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Though seeing this movie in a theater at midnight with a hundred other fantatics just like you is a downright amazing experience, I never tire of watching this movie over and over. Invite you friends, sing along, say the lines with the characters and you'll find yourself not wanting to ever turn it off or see the movie end. Hilarious and wickedly sexy and twisted. You'll love it from start to finish, and on the dvd, the added features make it all the better!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I am a fan of the books and enjoyed this movie a lot.  Few things were left out of the book and I thought the casting was all dead on.<br />The movie part of the DVD is spectacular.  Great crisp video and audio.  The only complaint I have is that the special features on the DVD are for kids only.  I didn't get any real enjoyment out of them, but I guess being 26 years old I wasn't the target audience and it's only a minor inconvience.  <br />Would have absolutely loved a commentary with the actors that played Harry, Ron and Hemione but still the DVD was a great value.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is a group that is deffinently going to be the next big thing. The whole band actually know what they are doing and can do it well. You can actually relate to this group and get a meaning out of their songs. They have their own style, they don't sound like anybody else around, but it actually sounds good. Their first single off the album is \\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\\". Other songs like \\"Edge of the Earth\\", and \\"Buddha for Mary\\" are just a few of the 13 track cd that are addicting songs. <br />I saw this group live twice, and they were really good. I couldn't believe just how good they were. They definently blow away alot of CD's that have come out this year. Definently not a waste of [$$$] So in my oppinion this is one of the best groups to come around in years, but you'll have to see or rather hear for yourself for your own idea of them.
B000066JES|5.0|Manowar is, without a doubt, one of the best metal bands to grace the planet.  In their most recent effort, they maintain the brutal crushing metal force that made them popular and throw in some new elements as well.  I never thought I'd say this, but the best track on this \\"metal\\" album is an opera song!!  The opera classic \\"Nessun Dorma\\" is performed by Eric Adams, and [wow], does it rule.  I personally do not care for opera, but I was familliar with this song before I'd heard the Manowar version.  The song is incredible, the vocals are absolutely amazing.  As I listened to it for the first time, in my mind, I was thinking: \\"Please let this erupt with metal guitars.\\"  Sure enough, at the end of the song, the metal axe appears to climax the song.  To top off an otherwise serious, operatic performance, Adams unleashes [a horrendous] scream at the end of the song in true Manowar fashion.  Other great songs include Call to Arms (...), Warriors of the World (feel-good metal crowd pleaser) and Swords in the Winds (majestic classic Manowar).  The last three songs are heavy as ... with incredible double bass drumming and viscious vocals.  Hand of Doom is probably the best of the three, but all are good.  I love the vocals on \\"House of Death.\\"  Between the sound of the song, the speed, and the subject matter, this is the most \\"metal\\" song I've heard in some time.  The end of \\"House\\" has a electronic vocal segment that is downfright frightening.  Unfortunately, this album will catch a lot of flak because of two songs \\"Fight for Freedom\\" and \\"An American Trilogy.\\"  Regarding \\"Fight,\\" I find no problem with the patriotic subject matter, though some foreign fans may not like it.  Regarding the American Trilogy, it will be labeled as \\"cheesy.\\"  Well, maybe it is cheesy, but after 20+ years, can't the guys have a little fun?  The best part about it is the fact that the song is very well done.  The harmonies are great, as is the actual music.  Let the band have some fun, let themshow their patriotism.  The album has incredible sound quality, the musicianship is top-notch, and the use of keyboards is perfect.  It is a truly great album that you can listen to all the way through.  The drumming is massive, as are the guitar and bass parts.  There are some great guitar moments here: the solo in \\"Hand of Doom\\" right before the middle section comes to mind when Karl hits a really high note amid a bottom heavy section of the song.  My favorite guitar part on the whole album, however, is the solo after the bridge in House of Death.  The bridge is a slow, acoustic type thing, and then it just explodes!  I hope that Manowar will be around for many more years, becuase metal albums this good are becoming rare in the modern metal scene. ...
B000068TPN|5.0|I'm amazed at the number of critics who have said this film it too melodramatic, that dying soldiers saying things like \\"tell my wife I love her\\" is overdone.  The movie used direct quotes Lt. Herrick and Jimmy Tokagowa (sp?) as they died, that's exactly what they said according to Hal Moore.  Perhaps he should apologize for the dying soldiers who couldn't come up with something more clever to say as they bled the ground red.  Critics who charge this movie as inaccurate need to read the book.  This movie follows it accurately and warmly.  In fact, if you like this movie, you will like the book it came from.  The N. Vietnamese were slaughtered in wave after wave according to the book, often charging directly at soldiers.  Lt. Herrick's platoon on the knoll reported seeing soldiers standing up in the brush just to laugh at them.  They were often shot by our forces.  Besides, what do any of us writing these reviews know what that battle was like?  Were any of us in the 7th cavalry that day?  This movie is excellent.  It's filled with great drama and characters we can identify with.  Proof that war is dramatic enough as it is.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This band has definitely made a breakthrough in the music industry.  Thier style is creative and unique, and keeps your interest throught the whole album.  My favorite type of bands, are the ones who not only have talented instrumental abilities and write great lyrics, but aren't afraid of trying something new and out of the norm, using there talent abilities to the fullest, and not just trying to make radio friendly music to sell big and make money.  I was truely impressed by Leto's vocal talent, and have to admit I was a bit skeptical thinking he was just going to be successful with his band because of his already known reputation in the entertainment industry. <BR>  The real creative music like the kind from &quot;30 Seconds to Mars&quot;, you couldn't even classify it into a specific category of the style of music..it makes it's own category..and that makes it a breakthrough in music!
B000002HRE|3.0|Reload sounds more like their B-sides from Load, with the exception of fuel, memory remains, unforgiven II, and Devil's Dance.  Low Man's Lyric is one of my favorites off this album, a total surprise from the masters of reinvention.  Some of the others sort of all run into each other, making it difficult to tell them apart.  Someone (a lifelong Metallica fan, been with them since 81, right) said that the lyrics to fuel were too complex, that they should stick to writing about what they used to.  I would point out that fuel is very similar to motorbreath from kill them all.  In fact the two have an identical subject matter and analogy.  Perhaps that lifetime \\"hardcore\\" fan should get his copy of kill them all out and listen again.  Or perhaps they should actually buy it.  A decent album, but I recommend almost any other Metallica album over it simply because I skip too many tracks on this one.
B000066NW0|3.0|Although Avril Lavigne is not quite punk, her music is an interesting infusion of pop and punk rock influences. If you're looking for true punk, don't buy this album, but if you're looking for a break from mainstream punk, this is a CD for you. The CD has an interesting mix of upbeat and more reflective songs, but the lyrics sometimes feel forced, as though they are not truly felt. Overall, I considered the CD good, but not great.
0060975768|5.0|I admit, the book does not flow well.  In fact, it reminds me slightly of Catch-22 in that is seems to jump around, even though it doesn't, even though Catch-22 did, and now I've gone cross-eyed.  The point is, it reads like a report to a general.  And that's probably more what it is.  Hal Moore is not an author, he's a retired Lt. General.  Galloway was a reporter, not a novelist.  They aren't going to write a nice neat book like Tom Clancy.  The reality of the battle is to me reflected in the reality of how the book was written, namely in a manner I expect from a soldier, not a writer.  The book is compelling because it's real, and it's never been told this way before.  A must read in my opinion for anyone curious about Vietnam.
B000063S6Z|4.0|Here is a set of generally fine tracks that never quite works as a coherent album. Much of &quot;18&quot; has more to say, and says it more interestingly, than anything on &quot;Play,&quot; Moby's previous album and masterpiece. But where &quot;Play&quot; offered lush, warm soundscapes and intimately passionate lyrics, most of &quot;18's&quot; tracks share a colder sound of numbness and alienation.<br />Unfortunately, these new gems do not fit together very well. Moby describes the album as an assortment of recent work. &quot;Assortment&quot; is about right. Even in terms of track order, there are several whiplash points: The dark confessional &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; is followed by the throwback hip-hop party track &quot;Jam for the Ladies.&quot; The koan-like &quot;One of These Mornings&quot; takes what sounds like a sample of a mundane Motown I'm-gonna-walk-out-on-you song-&quot;One of these mornings/ Won't be very long/ You will look for me/ I will be gone&quot;-and repeats it until it becomes a meditation on mortality and the immanence of death. But Moby undercuts himself by following with an overt I'm-gonna-walk-out-on-you track, &quot;Another Woman.&quot;<br />There have been a slew of albums in the last half of 2002 that were clearly affected by the events of Sept. 11, 2001, and so far &quot;18&quot; succeeds best at reproducing sonically what those frightening days of the empty sky felt like. There is anger here, and confusion, and a lot of pain, but mainly an emotional distance reminiscent of the numb shock shared by millions a year ago. Even the few boisterous tracks sound more like a studied reaction to sadness than authentic joy. It is as an artifact of this time that &quot;18&quot; succeeds best. The Sept. 11 references become more overt as the album progresses, from the implied timestamp of &quot;Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)&quot; - Sept. 11 is Moby's birthday - to the direct lyrical references to sudden death in the air on &quot;Sleep Alone.&quot; This allows the last 8 tracks to build to a sort of emotional crescendo that only offers starker contrast to the scattershot feeling of the first 10 songs.<br />There is some irony, perhaps, that an album dominated by sonic and lyrical alienation and distance is so atomized; the songs themselves seem alienated from one another. Perhaps this is deliberate, but it robs &quot;18&quot; of the coherence that could make it a truly great record. Instead, it is a good record containing some of Moby's best songs. This is not &quot;Play II,&quot; as most seemed to hope or fear, but &quot;18&quot; represents an incremental evolution in Moby's work. &quot;18&quot; could easily have been the superior record, had Moby worked harder at assembling an album instead of selecting favorite songs. As such, &quot;18&quot; and &quot;Play&quot; are good companions, and offer reason to hope that we are hearing only the beginning of a long run of masterful work from the diminutive ascetic.&quot; This allows the last 8 tracks to build to a sort of emotional crescendo that only offers starker contrast to the scattershot feeling of the first 10 songs.<br />There is some irony, perhaps, that an album dominated by sonic and lyrical alienation and distance is so atomized; the songs themselves seem alienated from one another.

B000002HMH|5.0|Metallica has never made things easy for people to swallow.  This is demonstrated by the fact that there are over 300 reviews for this album.  Some hate, some love it, a few are right in the middle.  Influenced by a blues style and even a little taste of country, the album is not ... 'em all.  It isn't Master of Puppets, or ...And Justice for All, and it's not the Black Album.  It's something totally different, which is what Metallica has always been about.  They were the loudest and fastest band in the early 80's (or at least one of them) and now they are still doing what they do best, reinventing themselves and making headlines doing so.  It's a solid album, the lyrics despite what others say are miles ahead of even the black album and the music is more than just cranking out palm muted E's as fast as they can.  There's thought and feeling on this album, I like every single track on it.  But at it's roots, it's Metallica.  It's uncompromising, just like them.
B0000029DD|5.0|Alas, Jeff only left us with &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk&quot;. These two cds are the most regularly played I own. Grace contains no weak points, and each song fits into place.  Of course there are stand out tracks such as &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Lover You Should Have Come over&quot; being such sincere, desperate admissions. Jeff's powerful, emotional &amp; thought provoking lyrics accompanied by his outstanding vocal range and not forgetting such diverse use of instruments make this cd stand the tests of time. We miss you Jeff RIP....
0767849493|4.0|Chris Rock and Salma Hayeck make this movie, but everyone does a great comedic acting job.  Kevin Smith's facial expressions are priceless, and Matt Damon and Ben Afflect are good.  Also, the English Dude (sorry, don't feel like watching the credits right now) is great!  Lots of totally dumb but funny, obscure references.  The ending is kind of lame.  I like Alanis Morriset normally, but it's just kind of dumb and anticlimactic.  Still, this movie is one of my faves, and I watch it all the time.  Big fun for those with a penchant for the conundrum that is organized religion.
B000006O7C|5.0|Unfortunately Jeff died before this album could be completed so it doesn't sound as polished as &quot;Grace&quot; but makes it all that more charming.  A great accompaniant for &quot;Grace&quot;, which I promise will not leave you unsatisfied.  The tracks &quot;Everybody Here Wants You&quot; and &quot;Morning Theft&quot; are so honest, it breaks my heart. Jeff's songs are just so full of emotions, you cannot be left untouched. He was one of the most talented musicians/songwriters/vocalists and will be sorely missed.
078401213X|5.0|I enjoy watching this DVD movie in wide-screen.<BR>I saw also the DVD region 4 in full-screen, but region 1 has more features and is my favorite.<br />I think that could be good for all the people if all DVD comes with many sub-titles as possible.  This DVD does not has English subtitles ( Spanish neither) but the sound is the original.<br />If you don't know English very well, this DVD is not for you.  I need to watch 4 times the movie.  I enjoy it, but was a little hard to understand all the dialogs.<br />Saludos!
0345409671|5.0|This book is fantastic.  A real standout in the vampire chronicles.  Not for the devout christian whom I doubt would be reading these series of books but contains such thought provoking ideals about the devil that they would benefit from. Lestat grows up in this book as well as being disillusioned.
B00006AFUR|4.0|Actor Jared Leto has a band. Don't let the words &quot;actor&quot; and &quot;band&quot; together discourage you though. This band is actually very good. <BR>Their debut album kicks off with their single &quot;Capricorn [A Brand New Name]&quot; and sets the perfect mood for the entire CD. From the opening riff that hums like a starting engine to the final chord struck in &quot;Year Zero&quot;, this album is a wild ride of rock. <BR>Highlight songs to pay attention for are &quot;Capricorn&quot;, &quot;Buddha For Mary&quot;, the fabled &quot;End Of The Beginning&quot;, and the song &quot;Echelon&quot;, where the 30STM street team got their name.<BR>I first saw 30STM at a concert in Houston. They blew me away; they were the pride of the secondary stage. I got the honor of meeting them after their set and even got an autographed sampler disc. Whenever this album hit stores, I ran out to buy it. I suggest you do the same. Believe me, if you are a fan to alternative/rock music, go and get this CD.<BR>It will not disappoint you.
B000009EUM|3.0|More artistic control over the shaping of this album is evident with the title track &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; being a hint of the toll of their new found fame with previous album &quot;Hunting High &amp; Low&quot;. The boys had a lot of fun making this album demonstrated in the tracks &quot;I've Been Losing You&quot; and &quot;The Swing Of Things&quot; which contain the rawness their first album lacked. Last, but not least &quot;Manhattan Skyline&quot; is just a beautiful ballad, my personal favorite off the album.  Unfortunately, a-ha will always be plagued by the success of &quot;Take On Me&quot;, don't get me wrong, I love that song but they have made so much better.  To hear a-ha at their best check out the album &quot;East Of The Sun &amp; West Of The Moon&quot;.
B000063S6Z|5.0|At the time of this writing it has been one year since the terrorist attack of 9/11, and four months since Moby's album \\"18\\" was released in May 2002. Initially I had no idea this review would have anything to do with last year's tragic events, but once I realized how much of the music here is related to the event, connecting the two is important and inescapable. It also helps explain the album's enigmatic lyrics and somber tone.<br />Moby, whose birthday happens to be September 11th and who lives in New York City, is very public about his political, religious and personal views. In his wildly successful 1999 album, Play, he talks extensively (and wisely) in the liner notes about the dangers of fundamentalism of any kind.  In the liner notes to 18 (written in February 02) he revisits the same topic, but also talks a bit about the state of the world since 9/11.<br />But unlike the blatantly opportunistic patriotic commercialism that followed 9/11 (artists actually redesigning their album jackets with American flags, flag tank tops, patriotic themes, etc.,) what Moby deals with here is the pain he has witnessed. If you only liked the pop songs from Play (Body Rock, Southside) then this may not be your record. If, however, you were more impressed with a song like Porcelain, you will understand how Moby can take a single musical element, often just a Blues phrase, and build an entire sweeping soundscape around it. On one song he has Dianne McCaulley repeatedly sing \\"one of these mornings - it won't be very long - you will look for me - and I'll be gone.\\"  On another Moby himself repeats \\"at least we were together - holding hands - flying through the sky...\\" It begins to sink in that many of these songs are like testimonies, unsaid or imagined, but certainly plausible and heart-felt. Some have criticized this album for not having more pop appeal, but I think that is missing the point. Here he is dealing masterfully with the deep underlying emotions of loss, sadness, pain, shock and tenderness that have affected many if not all of us since September 11th. <br />The first song (and single) We Are All Made Of Stars is a triumphant, 80's-like rocker, but even a catchy song like this develops more meaning... \\"people they come together - people they fall apart - nothing can stop us now - because we are all made of stars...\\" He asks in the liner notes that the album be listened to in its entirety - that of 150 songs written he carefully crafted this album from 18 songs. \\"a record is a kind of lifeboat for songs. The 18 songs on this album made the life-boat.\\" The title track, 18, is an instrumental piece that begins with a delicate piano phrase, like dawn breaking over a new day, but in my mind then captures the sadness on the day of 9/11 in music. Near the end of the album there is some hope and healing- beginning with Harbour featuring Sinead O'Connor.  There's the gospel-y Rafters, and the final blues-influenced song I'm Not Worried At All.<br />Moby is a man confident in his views, in control of his music, and he comes with a message. Despite having recently eluded the super-sales of Play (10 million), years from now we may realize that Richard Melville Hall has created a great musical masterpiece with 18 - just as his great-great-great-great uncle Herman Melville had written the great American novel 150 years ago.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|After a seven year break, a-ha have definately grown up and matured. Due to their hiatus, the album is a little inconsistent. Morten Harket's tracks &quot;To Let You Win&quot; and &quot;I Thought That It Was You&quot; are surprising good. &quot;I wish I Cared&quot; is Mangne Furuholmen successful contribution.  &quot;Velvet&quot; a previous hit for Paul Waaktaar-Savoy's band Savoy works well. &quot;Little Black Heart&quot;, &quot;Summer moved on&quot; and &quot;You'll Never Get Over Me&quot; are also stand out tracks. Overall a great reunion album demonstrating that the members of a-ha have become great individual artists. a-ha never fail to move you in some way and this album is no exception. I suggest listening to this album at least four times before you decide you like it or not, it really grows on you.
6300267997|1.0|... I tried to like it , I really did, but just can't. Miss Streisand is so full of herself from shot to shot she makes me sick. How can anyone love themselves so much? I saw it in the theater years ago and decided I would try it again. Sorry I just can't make it through this film ...The musical numbers are suppose to be rock n'roll? HA HA HA! .. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it -100! Get Funny Girl if you must see Streisand at her best! Ciao!
B00006AFUR|5.0|If you're expecting to hear the same drab rock music you hear everywhere today, then you're in for a suprise with 30 Seconds to Mars. Yea, sure, a lot of times when an actor attempts to start a band, they fail miserably..but that is not the case with this band folks. <BR>Front man Jared Leto (also guitarist) has astounding vocals. His voice is almost mesmerizing, fitting perfectly with the music, created by the highly talented Solon Bixler (guitar), Matt Wachter (bass), and Jared's brother Shannon Leto (drums). <BR>Their sound is like no other that I've heard. Atmosphereic, yet heavy, relaxing, yet energizing, with lyrics just as intense as the music, taking you on ride that never gets boring.
0679746048|4.0|I would have given this book five stars, if it just hadn't been so depressing.  I opened this book and closed it within a day, finito.  Not having seen the movie, the book was a great read.  It was so sad to learn about these young girls, who are already struggling with adolecence, being in this home away from family and friends made to contend with their individual disorders.  The scary thing is many things they were feeling, each of us has felt at some time, though many of us arent self destrcutive and I suppose that is the difference.  The book was surprisingly humorous at times as well, and Susanna Kaysen took a big risk to expose herself and as you go on you learn she has come a long way.  She is solid and very likable.  Dont pass this by.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This band is like a breath of fresh air.  Finally, rock the way it should be.  This album is great from start to finish.  If you are sick of this same droning music over and over again, pick up this CD, you will be an instant fan.
B000066NW0|5.0|Again! Avril rocks, this album has EVERYTHING! The slow songs, the rock songs... everything... Songs like Losing grip, My world, mobile and Naked should all be released as singles .. all the songs are great and I actually havent even put in another CD in my cdplayer since i got it in June/July :) Go Avril :)
B00005YW4H|2.0|This CD is for those who have trouble sleeping. The first release song&quot; Don't know why&quot; is the only good thing about this CD. I wanted to love it but could not get past the monotone vocals and sad music.
0316666343|4.0|I was expecting something different from this book. Maybe I was expecting something like your average run-of-the-mill murder mystery. This is definitely not another James Patterson serial killer book. It was well-written and thoroughly enjoyable. I'm glad I read the book...and didn't even read it because of the hype. It's definitely worth the time to read it.
0380973839|2.0|The William Morrow  Hardcover Edition (February 1, 1997) appears to be missing a story: \\" Way in the Middle of the Air \\"<br /><br />Mr. Bradbury wrote a story where all of the black people get fed up with the south, and the way they are treated, load up the rocket and leave all of the bigots behind.  Incredibly some paper pushing editor must have thought this story would offend our sensitivities, and took it upon him or herself to remove it from the chronicles.<br /><br />Strange that the work of Mr. Bradbury, a champion of free speech, is being edited.<br /><br />Do not get this version!

0425173755|5.0|As a kid, I skipped right past Nancy Drew and went straight to Agatha Christie because her books were in my mother's library.  Murder On The Orient Express was my first Christie book and it hooked me on mysteries for the rest of my life.
B000069AUI|5.0|This year's been a dissapointment both in the movie scene and the music industry. We had such film disappointments as Star Wars Episode II, Austin Powers: Goldmember and of course the ending to Spider-Man. <br />Music wise, there was Will Smith's album which unlike previous works wasn't the least bit inventive lyrically or musically. There was the Goo Goo Doll's album which sadly was also a terrible rehash of thoughtless melody. I really liked the Goo Goo Doll's before their latest album 'Gutterflower'. There's more but I don't want to bore you.   <br />Anyways, not to be too cynical on the lovely North American entertainment industry, there has been 'some' good things. Can't think of anything at the moment but I know one of you will prove me wrong. <br />So you're thinking, 'Why is the title of this review about Coldplay's latest album when all he's writing is how bad the year's been in entertainment'. The reason is quite simple. All things to come out this year that was any good wasn't (surprisingly?) North American. <br />Coldplay. A British band. Their second album was released a week and a half ago. What can I say about it? Or more to the point, what can't I say about it? Well, for starters I am listening to it right now. I haven't listened to anything else in my cd player since I got it two days ago. <br />'A Rush Of Blood To The Head' is truly a revolutionary album. You might hear it on first listen or you might not, but eventually you will realize what I'm talking about. This ain't no traditional rock. Sure it's got the guitars, the drums, the bass but the band puts emphasis on piano and keyboards. It's a very different sound for a rock album. The lyrics too, are insightful and emotional. This album was a total surprise for me. <br />I have a certain standard when it comes to music. I hate rehashed and repetative pop. If pop music was written and composed by the artists then I wouldn't have a problem with it. The reality though is that it's not, or at leastrarely done. That's why I can listen to pop music by artists like Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson. <br />Every track on this album measures up to a certain standard of originality. No track sounds like the other, the track arrangement fits to tell the larger theme of the album (as in 'The Wall'). This album shouldn't be classified as 'rock'. It just shouldn't be classified at all. Maybe 'Music as it should be' is a suitable title. Nothing else, though. <br />My favorite tracks: Politik, In My Place, The Scientist, Clocks (should be their second single), Green Eyes, Warning Sign, A Rush Of Blood To The Head and Amsterdam. <br />Just do yourself the favour and pick this up. This is music at its finest. We won't see the likes of this in a long time. In any genre. This compares to other revolutionary albums such as 'The Wall', 'The Joshua Tree', 'Dangerous', 'OK Computer', 'Nevermind' and 'Ten'. <br />Five Stars. Definately.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This is a brilliant album. jaret is the first movie star to make a good band, and its not just good, its BRILLIANT. The album is everything any rock fan could want from an album. It varys from being quite heavy in places to being a lot lighter in others. The brilliant single capricorn has a sound which is similar to incubus bt heavier and at least 10 TIMES BETTER. if you only have enough money to buy 1 album right now make sure its THIS ONE. if you have money for 2 albums buy THIS ALBUM TWICE AND GIVE ONE TO YOUR FRIEND!!! that is how good the album isif you like incubus and hoobastank then make sure you buy this because it is similar but a lot better.
0805062971|5.0|Wow...what a novel.  This is where Holden Caufield would have ended up had he remained a young man for fifty years.  I made the mistake of reading Choke prior to this novel and it almost made me skip another CP book, but boy am I glad I read it.<br />Fight Club is a story about all of the anger most young men of this generation have bottled up inside--and it is told with deep, rich layers of satire and humor that made me want to reread the book when I was done.  How Chuck managed to come up with idea after idea, line after line for an entire novel, I'll never know.  It had to be exhausting.  And when you're finished reading this book, you'll be exhausted too.<br />Buy it!  Worth every penny.
B000062Y98|5.0|First of all, I'm the kind of guy who thinks that the phrase \\"over the top\\" is completely absurd when it comes to music...especially metal. While I believe that lyrical themes can be over the top (i.e. Rhapsody), music can never be that way. <br />I love the fact that every song has a massive \\"choir\\" singing along to each chorus. I love how there is orchestration to spare on this album. And I love how every musician feels the need to show off at various times. I love the pounding double bass drums, obscure guitar solos, and chugging riffs all doing their own things at times. If this sounds \\"over the top\\" to you, then by all means, stay away from this album. However, if this description sounds interesting or exciting to you, by all means go buy this immediately.<br />This album has some of the greatest composed music I've heard in a while. The melodies contained within are extremely memorable. Not one song on here is forgettable at all. Every instrument is played with great competence. And no, the vocals are not shouted, they are sung, but in a harsh voice. The vocals are quite engaging because they have such passion. If you want to hear \\"screamed\\" vocals, listen to hardcore music. Give me a break if you think this is screaming. <br />There are harder edged songs like \\"Precious Jerusalem\\" and \\"Sadly Sings Destiny,\\" as well as more melodic ballads such as \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight.\\" Then there's \\"Battlefield\\", quite possibly the best track on the album.<BR>The fourteen minute \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" is an epic closer to this album, incorporating most of the themes used in the album.<br />So, again, if epic symphonic metal is a style you enjoy, or you are willing to give it a shot, give this album a listen. You will most likely be blown away.

0064400557|5.0|I checked this book out of the school library when I was about 8 years old.  I can still picture clearly, it's exact location on the shelf in that library.

Have your kids read the book and skip the movie.

0385720920|3.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who has an affinity for today's edgy satiric novels.  And, on an entertainment level, this book produces, and produces big.  My first reading of a Chuck Palahnuik novel (advocates tell me I made a big mistake by not starting with either Fight Club or Survivor) and I am hooked on his style.  He writes with a sarcsatic tongue that, while it could be considered excessive, never fails to induce an audible giggle.<br />However--he was way off on his subject matter.  The topic of a true sex addict going to sexaholic meetings to hook up with women makes as much sense as an alcoholic going to an AA meeting to get hammered.  Chuck should have at least interviewed a few men and women who attend these meetings to through some authenticity into the mix.  His characters are bizarre, which is fine, but the outside world should still stay in balance--otherwise you are now writing science fiction.<br />That said, it is a good read, and it will keep the pages turning.  Not for those with a shy eye to sex or those who hate depressing narrative.
B00004YRQA|5.0|No complaints easy to use, just plug it into to the memory card slot on your PS2 and forget about it. It works like a charm. I hope they come out with a larger card soon though...
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to mars is one , if not THE best band to come out in quite a long time, their music is highly explosive and full of emotion, I've been listening to them for awhile now and after 6 months of continuous listening I never tire of any song. I still get chills listening to &quot;fallen&quot; and &quot;welcome to th universe&quot; Their lyrics are so powerful and emotional you can't help but fall in love with them. I highly recommend this to all who love rock. Something new, refreshing, and definetly worth a listen..2 big giant thumbs up
0385720920|4.0|&quot;Choke&quot; was my first experience into the world of Chuck Palahniuk.  I am probably in the minority in that I have not read &quot;Fight Club&quot; or seen its translation to the big-screen.  So based on what I did know about that work, my expectations were set for a gritty, darkly humorous reading experience.  Palahniuk not only delivers on grittiness and dark humor but also throws in a generous dose of shock value too.  I believe I am not prudish or easily shocked, but I will readily admit to a raised eyebrow and a dropped jaw on several occasions while reading &quot;Choke.&quot;  However, I often felt that Palahniuk was simply competing in a game of self-one-upman-ship.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I do not think I will be recommending to a whole lot of folks in my circle who prefer more &quot;traditional fare (which may just be 95% of fiction out there when being compared to Palahniuk).<br />Palahniuk is certainly worthy of being included in the genre of &quot;gonzo&quot; fiction - experimental, pushing the edges, no limits.  Some of the scenarios Palahniuk's protagonist, Victor Mancini, finds himself in and around are pure genius.  However, they often just seem strung together in an attempt to form (maintain?) some semblance of a narrative.  If given the opportunity, I would rate the book -- 3 1/2 stars.  Palahniuk certainly deserves kudos for his originality and sheer brashness -- but I can not help but believe he has better stuff in him than &quot;Choke.&quot;
0792841344|5.0|This is a gem from 1979, an absolute joyful expression of one filmmaker's vision. Don Coscarelli wrote, produced, directed and edited this bizarre tale which combines alien worlds, aliens, body snatching, fortune telling, Jawas, car chases and buddy-movie antics all into one. There are bizarre moving postcards, flying silver spheres that drain your blood, a threatening tall man (Angus Scrimm), femme fatales, a Tubular Bells-inspired score, and more. Michael Baldwin and Bill Thornbury are perfect as the brothers (Mike and Jody) who investigate the macabre events at Morningside Mortuary (the same house was the setting for Burnt Offerings) and a find a sinister \\"Tall Man\\" who seems to be crushing dead humans and using them for slaves on an alien world. Phantasm's plot is a mish-mosh of various standard horror film trappings, but is so engaging, thanks to the winning leads, that you don't care. And the surprises are many. This is a cult favorite and one of the most inventive and notable horror films of its time. Ignore the sequels.
0316666343|5.0|After the first 30 pages, I could not stop reading. Found her (Sebold's) description of heaven to be new and fascinating. While some of the plot was gruesome, it was also real. Feeling her family's emotion's throughout the book was a tug on the heart. The father stands out as the character with the most emotion and was a welcome change from &quot;perfect mother&quot; writing.
B000069AUI|4.0|Perhaps the most underrated rock album of the 90's was Catherine Wheel's &quot;ADAM AND EVE&quot;.  Critics and fans alike seem to compare Coldplay's sound only to Radiohead or Travis, but on A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD, I hear the dark moodiness of Rob Dickenson's Catherine Wheel in their more soulful moments.  My favorite tracks on A RUSH.. are the last four (&quot;Warning Sign&quot; through &quot;Amsterdam&quot;) which really hint at the emotional depth the band is capable of achieving.  This is a band that will be around for the long haul.
0790733900|5.0|This movie reminded me a bit of \\"Papillon\\" in that it shows us a convict continually trying to be free.  Whereas Papillon was looking for freedom from incarceration, Cool Hand Luke is looking for freedom of spirit.  He also realizes that he is a symbol to the rest of the inmates.<br />Luke represents the American spirit.  He has had enough of rules and regulations and just wants to be.  He feels he has paid his debt by going to war (where he was a decorated hero).  Once he is incarcerated, he begins to set an example for the other inmates.  He is independent and he will not quit.  The other inmates grow to depend on his spirit to hold up their own.  When he appears to have failed, they all turn their backs on him.  This is a lot like we do famous people whom we idolize.  Once they have transgressed, we ignore them.<br />This is a great movie, and I highly recommend seeing it.
B000060K4O|5.0|Ghostbusters has to be one of the smartest comedies if not the smartest comedy ever made. It is an inventive and original concept that his brought to the screen through the unmatched comedic skills of Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramos. Each of which play very different characters who come together to rid New York City of it's pesky ghost problem. Throw in a Babylonian er Sumerian God (Big difference) who is intent on destroying the world and you get one wild hilarious ride.<br />My favorite parts are Venkman and Dana's gone spoked date because Dana is possesed by Zule, the entire rooftop sequence where every line said is a classic, and the ballroom encounter with the beloved Ghost Slimer.<br />I think one of my favorites is when they first see the Marshmellow Man and Ray is babbling on about his childhood and Venkman says: &quot;Egon, Ray has gone bye bye. What have you got?&quot; Egon: &quot;Sorry Venkman I'm terrified beyond the capacity of rational thought.&quot;<br />Try as some may I don't think there ever be another movie quite like Ghostbusters. Men in Black was close but not quite. The movie is so good you dismiss some of the less than ideal special effects. Even Reitman and Ramos make fun of some of the effects on the commentary track which I highly recommend because they are as funny with their commentaries as the movie itself.<br />Ghostbusters has to be up there on the funniest movies ever made list.
078062369X|4.0|I have to admit that I love this movie more than is probably warrented.  It's a guilty pleasure more than anything, I just get a kick out of it and not for the reasons I should, I don't think.<br />Blade isn't a horror movie in the typical sense, it's an action movie with a pretty well-worn sort of plot.  But the plot isn't what makes it so much fun and so we can forget about the holes in the plot which are never filled (such as how Whistler can read the piece of the prophecy while no one else seems to be able to, why Quinn doesn't disentegrate when Blade impales him through each shoulder with a silver stake, etc.) and get on to more important things such as how GOOD this movie looks.<br />The acting is pretty run of the mill for the most part, with the standout acting being done by Stephen Dorff as Deacon Frost, spoiled brat and complete maniac (and vampire of course) and Udo Kier (even though he isn't in the movie for more than 5 minutes total) as Dragonetti, the head of the pure blood vampires.  While Frost isn't your typical buff, brawny villain, he makes up for his conscipicous scrawniness with his intelligence and ruthlesness (and his inhuman strength).  Dorff gives a fantastic performance, bringing Frost off as disturbingly creepy and quite frankly, very cool.  And of course he's easy on the eyes too, which is one of the other reasons Blade ranks high on my list of guilty pleasures.<br />In short, the acting is so-so, the plotline could be more original, but the film itself looks great and it has its moments (namely when Dragonetti backhands Frost; that's priceless).  On the whole, the visuals and baddies make up for the shortcomings making Blade well worth watching.<br />The verdict: A guilty pleasure well worth indulging in.
0385503954|2.0|Wow, some people really like this book.  I am sorry not to be one of them.  I wanted to finish it and had the best of intentions to do so, but I just kept falling asleep.  I wasn't all that interested in any of the characters, honestly, and didn't really care what happened to them.  <br />I have to say I thought Amsterdam was much more engaging.  <br />I regret spending all that money and buying the hardcover version of this book.  Hopefully other people will get more enjoyment out of it than I did after I donate it to my local library.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|...and that's about the only thing that's good about this movie.  A thin plot, tired cliches, poor acting and directing, and a lousy ending are just a few of this movie's problems.  HG Wells must be spinning in his grave after watching his wonderful book turned into a silly action flick by his grandson.  Good sci-fi usually makes a statement about the human condition, as Wells did in his book, which warns the reader of the dangers of communism and fascism.  The movie has no such lofty goals, and there is no statement here, just typical hollywood tripe aimed at the masses.  It gets 2 stars for the nice special effects, most notably the time travel sequences.  An okay rental for a rainy Saturday afternoon with plenty of cold beer, but I'd never actually buy this one.
B000007RYQ|5.0|This is still Uri Caine's best album.  I'm convinced that years from now this will be pointed to as his seminal achievement as a musical artist.  He's tried so many things, and has had success with so many musical genres/styles.  Yet this is the topper.  You must own this record!
B00005YW4H|3.0|norah's voice and timbre are truly beautiful on this recording.  the honest expression of maturity is astounding for such a young musician.  and her writing (although sparse) speaks beyond her years.  the only thing that i take serious issue with is the absense of jesse harris on some of the tracks.  everyone that owns this record should go buy his album 'crooked lines'.  right now.  jesse provides much of the soul in this band, not to mention the most exceptional writing, and without him the album suffers.  so, please do the right thing...don't sleep on jesse harris.
0876852630|1.0|Chosen by my book group, so I stuck with it, and honestly hoped it would get better, only to be disappointed.  I have to say I really can't belive how many people give this book such high ratings.  I thought it was tedious, pointless, and uninspired.  I found a certain bits of it mildly interesting (very few and far between), but mostly I felt like I was being beaten over the head with the descriptions of his ineptitude, and mocked for being a productive member of society.  So the guy's a drunk who can't keep a job.  I got that before I was a quarter of the way through.  Why should I continue to care for that many pages?
B00006690G|5.0|Yes, I have a mere COPY of the \\"Eminem Show,\\" Eminem's third solo album. - No, I don't have his other albums ~ I read a lot of reviews saying that that album was dirty--even the edited version. So I never bought it (and it never appealed to me either, so that's not a bad loss.) ... So, this album looks awesome. The thing is--I'm making the copy now.<br />My FIRST AND MOST MEANINGFUL COMMENT IS that I am shocked and grateful that he recorded \\"Hailie's Song,\\" on his daughter's behalf of simply living--and also that he cut down severely on the cursing of this and \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy,\\"--not like it's a bad thing. They edit a lot also on \\"Without Me,\\" being a strange noise being in place of the word [expletive] and a kissing mark on the [expletive]. The songs so far that I enjoyed the most on the disc is the international smash \\"Without Me,\\"--I never got tired of hearing it on the radio until like maybe early August when the 2nd single, \\"Cleaning Out My Closet,\\" begun getting airplay on rap & regular radio stations. I also enjoyed \\"Superman,\\" \\"Hailie's Song,\\" and \\"Cleaning Out My Closet.\\" My least favorite is probably \\"Say What You Say,\\" and where they curse the least--\\"Hailie's Song.\\" MOST: \\"Soldier,\\" or \\"When The Music Stops,\\" or \\"Cleaning Out My Closet.\\" Stupidest songs were probably the skits though I did like track six--although not the message. Well-skits are really annoying in the rap albums, and this didn't change my opinion. Oh well, this is an excellent album besides the cursing and skits and negative messages. Pick it up--but if you don't like this genre, stay away from this album. ...
B00003CXI1|5.0|Who wouldn't want to revel in the wonderment of an 11-year old boy whisked from his dreary existance to discover his potential among magical creatures and equally mysterious people.

B000069HKH|4.0|Bruce Springsteen is getting older...and what about his music? It´s always the best! Just listen to \\"The Rising\\" and tell if I´m wrong...<BR>As you hear this song for the first time, your attention will probably focus on the contrast between the cheerful melody and the sad events it talks about. It may be difficult to accepte the fact that the collapse of the Twin Towers, and the death of thousands people from all over the world, are sung on such an happy rhythm and with such \\"lalala\\"...<BR>Nevertheless I think that Bruce Springsteen  has found a very good way to talk seriuosly about a difficult situation, because he also manages to give hope and faith in a better future to his nation: That´s his mission, his responsibility towards his nation! And that´s why, like the fireman of the song, Springsteen wears \\"the cross of (his) calling\\", too.<BR>The message of the song is a very positive one, also because it doesn´t mention neither anger nor will to revenge. \\"The Boss\\" tell us that terrorists have not won, that America could \\"rise up\\" and overcome this tragedy if its people will be UNITED, if they will stay \\"together as one\\". Through the music and the lyrics of \\"The Rising\\", we can only perceive the amazement and the sorrow of a shocked nation, that has now the need to be encouraged. <BR>Furthermore this text is an important tribute  to many unknown heroes who have lost their lives to rescue other people: the firemen.<BR>To sum up, \\"The Boss\\" has given us, with this song, a further demonstration of his ability. And I can only say, once again, that<br />THE BOSS\\" IS STILL A BOSS!!!
0316666343|4.0|I wish I could write a novel -- any novel, let alone a debut -- as good as THE LOVELY BONES.  Perhaps it's not totally original to tell a story from the view of a murder victim or to explore in print the possibilities of the afterlife, but Alice Sebold's story is at once charming and challenging, as well as beautifully written.  Watching -- through the eyes of the dead child-- a family and a community grow, change, and cope with the untimely death of one of their own, is a beautiful and painful journey.
0790729725|5.0|Martin Scorsese has an eclectic collection of truly great movies under his belt including 'The Last Temptation of Christ', 'The Age of Innocence', 'Taxi Driver', 'Mean Streets', 'Casino' (this movies sort of sequel) and many more, but for me only two come close to being this films equal, 'Cape Fear' and 'Raging Bull'. 'Goodfellas' surpasses even these with the sheer truth of it. This was the film Ray Liotta was destined to make in my opinion. This wise-guy imparts his whole world for our delight and delectation, laughing at us as he does so. The entire cast are superb so I won't bother to name them individually...no point in that whatsoever. 'Goodfellas' is immensely funny, shocking, kinda' sexy and wonderfully suspenseful. I totally feel the fear Henry and Karen Hill are experiencing as they bow to the weight of the inevitable and sign themselves into the 'witness protection programme' at the end. I'm also extremely glad he, almost alone, by dint of a charmed life, is saved...though dammed to a prosaic life of hum-drum tedium like the rest of us that almost manages to wipe the smile off his face. I like this guy. ... excellent movie from the opening shot to the righteous end.

0446677450|3.0|Robert T. Kiyosaki is a multi-millionaire.  After starting with relatively little and becoming a millionaire in his twenties only to lose it all and start all over becoming a millionaire for the second time in the eve of his forties, there are few that could surpass him in knowledge about generating wealth and holding onto it.  <br />In the right young hands, Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a brilliant book.  It maps out a blueprint for becoming rich, maybe not Bill Gates rich, but creating enough wealth to live comfortably in this country and provide for one's family while doing a minimal amount of work, especially as the wealth builds. The young and non-cynical can benefit more from Kiyosaki's message more than anyone else, because Kiyosaki's message is so simple and accessible that only the truly optimistic will accept his words at face value and get to work.  The cynical reader will call the book a crock and a get rich scheme for the author (even though Kiyosaki was already rich when he wrote his first book.)  The older reader will recognize him/herself in the profiles of the middle class mentalities, but may have already developed too much inertia to overcome being content with working for the rest of their lives and if they are lucky being able to retire on a modest 401k after thirty or more years of working for someone else. Kiyosaki breaks down the misconceptions many people have about achieving wealth, all the while relaying his personal biography and his own personal realizations about money along the way.   The fact that Kiyosaki talks about his mistakes and successes makes this book more honest than most, and the reader gets the impression that they have learned from standing over Kiyosaki's shoulder while he suffered the viccisitudes of his own financial education.  <br />One of the more subtle psychological lesson of Rich Dad, Poor Dad is Kiyosaki's treatment of the negative associations people have with the rich, namely avarice and materialism.  Kiyosaki is probably right in asserting that greed and superficial materialism (especially mixed with fear) are more likely to DETER somone from ever building a sizeable net worth. I five Kiyosaki credit for valliantly trying to defeat the moral arguments that its wrong to spend one's time trying to amass wealth.  He avoids venturing out into any religious arena and I think he may at least convince a few fence sitters to come to the dark side of accepting that they desire comfort and the liberation of wealth and the know-how to keep it.<br />What really makes Rich Dad, Poor Dad worth reading is how comprehensive it is in covering multiple models for suceeding in wealth building and dealing with all the traps (corporate jobs, diversification in mutual funds, buying a primary residence as a tax break, etc.) that keep people from being financially free in such a short book.  I doubt a person could read this book and seriously say after reading it, that they lack the creativity and intelligence to go out and become financial free.  Of course this takes a little sacrifice and courage and unfortunaltely that is where this book falls flat to me.  Perhaps Kiyosaki did not want to address consumerisim and American psychology....  A person not investing their time or their money in themselves can probaby never hope to be financially free and Kiyosaki does not have a solution for snapping the average American out of his/her middle/working class wage (make-it-spend-it-retire-at-60) mentality.  <br />Well Kiyosaki has one idea, we should get to our children while they are young and be careful that we at least don't infect them with our self defeating attitudes when it comes to money.  There is no reason that a sixteen year old cannot have internalized all of the lessons in this book before he goes out and earns his first nickel (or tries to mint it as Kiyosaki did in his youth)<br />Kiyosaki gets a little too altruistic at times especially when he believes that we should look to the educationsystem in American to start teaching financial freedom.  As long as you understand that corporations have the majority of the power in this country you will understand that they aren't going to support a government that doesn't turn out good little consumers.<br />Regardless, this is a good book for any young person to get his/her eyes opened about being more self-aware when it comes to personal finances. Its probably a good book for anyone over 35 too,...  Notice that I only gave it three stars.  My reason is that as logical and convincing as this book is, I cannot say it is all that effective.  I have known six people who have bought and read this book including myself. ...
B00000JZC4|5.0|I never get tired of listening to this CD.  &quot;I will lead you&quot; is a classic tune.  This CD is unique in the fact that Filter can be heavy but at the same time give you emotionally driving music.  Not the same old screaming and power chords, it makes you feel.  A cut above the rest.
B000066NW0|4.0|Wow, Im shocked at all the bad reviews I've read of this album here!  Im very hard to please when it comes to music these days.  I have to resort to overseas music to get any jollies because the American music scene is just so horrid lately.  If I have to hear anymore same-old, same-old R&amp;B and hip-hop, I will just throw myself...  So many young artists are just wasting their talents on that junk, and it all sounds the same.  Avril has a fresh sound, and great lyrics!  She's a rock n' roll gal, and there's so few of those anymore. Im sick of all the whiney R&amp;B women out there, it's sooo good to hear some rock again.  I think Avril's music is great, and I think her voice is even better.  You can feel her emotion, and she doesnt have to overdo it.  Her lyrics, in some songs, are a bit juvenile, but so what?  She's only 17 right?  Give her time.  I think we've got a real star being born, loved the ablum!  Avril rocks, even if she's not true punk, who cares.  Music is music.
6302293553|4.0|Another Monty Python marvel, The Holy Grail has a delightful spontinaity to it (which stems from the fact that the leading actor was drunk for the entire duration of the filming). Like all Python films, it is a wonderfully confusing mixture of slap-dash storylines, the obscene and ridiculous, and a satiric view of Celtic history. This film, however, is unique in its \\"simply silly\\" approach to one of Britain's most loved myths... Killer rabbits, three-headed knights, naked ladies, snobbish Frenchmen, and flying cows abound, so sit back and enjoy the show!
B000002NAK|5.0|For those who think Madonna made it on sex alone and no talent, listen to this sountrack.  Madonna trained hard for this role, and the evidence is on film and on compact disc.  Her voice has never sounded better.  While she'll never be Streisand or Eder, Madonna delivers on this CD.  She IS Evita.  Her vocals breathe life into this biography of Eva Peron, deftly exhibit the character's heartache and hedonism.  Choice cuts are \\"You Must Love Me,\\" \\"Rainbow High\\" and of course \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina.\\"  No one could have asked for a better performance.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. and the obstacles he overcomes to make the achievement of a lifetime. Although it does not include all details of his life, it is a great story of triumph and love. The movie starts at Princeton University, where John struggles to come up with an &quot;original idea&quot; to change the world. He finally invents a win-win situation for competing businesses and takes on a job as a code-breaker for the government. John meets and marries Alicia, but he soon discovers that marriage and the pressure of his job are too much. He must overcome extreme obstacles and pain, including the risk of losing more than a job. A Beautiful Mind stars Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris. IT IS AWESOME, if you haven't seen it you should. Awesome directing and acting, winner of 4 Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and a powerfully moving story about the hardships and triumphs of one man.<BR>~Lizzie
B000005JA8|1.0|I BOUGHT THIS ON LP MANY YEARS BACK.  THE TALK THEN WAS THAT THE MUSICIANS HAD NOT HAD THEIR RESPECTIVE INSTRUMENTS IN THEIR HANDS AT ANY TIME BEFORE RECORDING THE ALBUM AND IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS AS SUCH.

B00006AFUR|5.0|listen to 30seconds to mars' self titled debut album and get the feeling of breaking away into infinity. it's as though you are passing through &quot;oblivion&quot; and beyond, searching through a maze filled with talismanic vocals, wonderfully forceful drums and bass, and beautifully melodic guitars to bond these substantial elements together. from the moment you hear the first seconds of &quot;capricorn&quot; right down to the last note of &quot;year zero&quot; you will be tied to this break-through album, leaving you oblivious to all outside events. with lyrics hidden by cryptic messages of some sort of escape you will find you self anaylizing every detail, making this album all the more enjoyable. however you decide to interpret the music of 30seconds to mars, i guarantee you will not be dissapointed with this beautiful album.
0316666343|3.0|I read this book in a day and a half. The characters were believeable and the prose was beautifully written.  The approach of the story was fresh and I can see the novel being made into a fascinating movie(think, The Sixth Sense or Ghost).  The girls perspective on everything is surreal.  I did find myself feeling somewhat let down at the end of the story, I wanted more clarity and more closure.  But I suppose that is the way &quot;victims&quot; and their loved ones feel most of the time.

0060090367|1.0|People seem to love this book - I do not know why.  I bought Watermelon at a regular bookstore, so I have no excuse not to have perused the contents prior to making the purchase.  I tried valiantly to finish this book - but few things have struck me as such a waste of time.  I had removed the price tag when I began reading, by soon found myself finding the discarded piece of sticker, unfolding it and sticking it back on the book in an attempt to return it to where I purchased it.  Alas, I neglected to do that in a timely manner, and now am just an embarrassed owner of this book...I will never finish it - but will always be reminded of the foolishness of buying a book based on the concept and raves of everyone around me - or maybe it was just the clever product placement.  To be fair to the author I think it would make a better stand-up comedy routine than a novel.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Amidst the morass of carbon copy, one-trick pony bands that seem to populate the air- and video-waves, enter a new universe of sound with the debut album of 30 SECONDS TO MARS. Produced by Bob Ezrin (who worked with Pink Floyd), the band's sound might be reminiscent of a few musical styles but they have managed to own their individuality with a vengeance. Layered vocals, unexpected melodies and metaphorical lyrics propel 'the Mars sound' past the monotonous concentration of pure-rhythm and angry-[***] yelling that seems to be overtaking modern hard rock. The vocal style pulls you in with alternating whispers and driving, almost accusatory throat-rips; intimacy and emphatic seduction both. From the powerful, almost primal drum work to the balanced use of synths and operatic guitar riffs, 30 SECONDS TO MARS draws it all together to weave a musical sound -- and paint a cinematic picture -- that holds up to multiple cycles on your player.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I bought the album from amazon.com after seeing them live, and the album brings the live show into my own home.  The album starts off hot with the amazing single \\"Capricorn\\".  Capricorn is my favorite song on the album, and I can listen to it any time of day, no matter my mood.  The album continues to build in energy through songs like \\"Buddah for Mary\\" and \\"Welcome to the Universe\\", then finishes with \\"Year Zero\\" which will make you wish for more.  I don't forsee this disc coming out of my CD player for a long time to come.

B000000OXH|4.0|this is the best of the three asia albums and it has my favorite track on it, 'Midnight Sun'. At the moment i am saving up for anthologia which has all the tracks from asia, alpha, astra and then and now! it is only 14.99! I am 13 and my dad has all three, but he thinks the first one is the best. Ihave written a review for astra, click on 'more about me' and you will see all my other prog-rock reviews.

B00005QIPH|4.0|i really enjoy this album, stop listening to what everybody else thinks (critics, would be critics, the media, and your friends). you dont have to rely on that anymore. listen to it. if you like it, buy it; if you dont, stop trying to ruin it for everyone else. its your money and your ears. some bands do become successful because of their talent, and the strokes recorded an excellent first album. i hope they continue to make good music, but if even if their next effort doesnt live up to &quot;expectations&quot; it should not affect the quality of this record. nuff said.
B0000024SI|5.0|An essential capsule from the sixties,HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED is DYLAN reaching his peak.Remember 1965,it was the year THE BEATLES started to write more meaningfull lyrics to their songs.JOHN LENNON admitted having been influenced by DYLAN.The electric conversion had started with the previous lp.This disc has probably BOB's two greatest songs:LIKE A ROLLING STONE and the fabulous DESOLATION ROW,but the record is vintage from the beginning to the end.Forget those endless greatest hits packages that makes the industry roll and buy this,one of the truely recognized classic of an era.Who can forget lyrics like :HER PROFESSION IS HER RELIGION,HER SIN IS HER LIFELESSNESS preceeded by ON HER TWENTY SECOND BIRTHDAY SHE ALREADY IS AN OLD MAID.I mean that is strong my friend.

0790731983|5.0|To begin with, this musical is not for the golly-gee-whiz, Mickey Rooney, feel-good fans. It's a downbeat film from beginning to end, albeit with lots of excitement.<br />The story pertains to pre-war Berlin, its seediness, desperation, decadance---and how it affects two very dissimilar people who happen to fall in love. Minnelli's character provides ample comedy relief in this film, however, and the abundant musical numbers underscore what's happening in the film.<br />The astute observer notices that the musical numbers pertain very specifically to what's happening in the film at the time. The editing of these numbers, in conjunction with the dramatic events, equals pure genius, in this reviewer's point of view. Repeated viewing always has brought to light previously missed nuances.<br />Not to be missed is Bob Fosse's unique choreography, Liza Minnelli's exuberance, as well as her dramatic performance, and the wonderful, unforgettable musical numbers. This is a film that will remain in the viewer's consciousness for decades---a masterpiece, a must-see for any serious film student.

B00006AFUR|5.0|Music.<BR>The Final frontier. In this endless space, where no-talent, no-message groups find such popularity..

There Comes a new band, like a shining light. That Band is 30 Seconds To Mars.<br />Armed with a two mean guitars, a versitile bass, and some amazing drums, 30stm have every possible reason to be considered a canidate for the trendsetters of tomorrows music. - Artistic, explosive, and most importantly, dripping with wisdom.<br />Youve been waiting all this time for the future of music to arrive.

B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus is by far one of the greatest albums of the past couple years.  The songs are emotional, but it's the kind of emotional that you can relate to and helps you through bad times, unlike other bands (Staind) who just sound like they're complaining.  It's not the catchiest album though, it takes a few listens to really apprichiate it.  The best songs on this cd are The Grudge, The Patient, Schism, Parabola, Ticks and Leeches, Lateralis and Reflection.  The rest kind of sounds like filler but it still beats everythig Korn is responsible for (nu metal).  Sick of the radio?  Buy this cd!
B000069AUI|4.0|Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes&quot; came into the mainstream in the midst of a vast expanse of mediocrity; the countless droves of mind-numbing anger or the insincere faux-emotion and fluffiness of pop music.  Sure, &quot;Yellow&quot; was a goofy and sappy pop song, but it's unconventional melody, piercing lead guitar, and raw emotion set Coldplay apart from the rest.  For me, I felt excited to hear a new band to get excited about, who played music that meant something to me.  <BR>That being said, Parachutes is far from flawless.  It's predecessor, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; is better, but like Parachutes, still feels like a hint of things to come.  With &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head,&quot; Coldplay seems to be feeling more of an influence sonically, politicaly, and topically from the world at large, having toured the world for a seemingly endless amount of time.  There is still the introspection and melancholy spliced with a little bit of hope that permeated Parachutes, but now the characters in the songs are much more diverse, and thankfully, less apologetic.  <BR>Musically, Coldplay have grown a much needed edge, taking their instrumentation to places much more experimental and colorful than on Parachutes.  Politik kicks in with a repetitive two-chord pattern that continues until it explodes into a beautiful, anthemic huge ending.  &quot;In My Place&quot; bridges the gap between Parachutes and the new material, with it's simple lyrics, beautiful melody, and driving musical hooks.  &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot; feels like the first deep look at the new Coldplay.  It's jerky rhythm it's the perfect background for the lead guitar's feedback drenched melody.  &quot;The Scientist&quot; is a more standard Coldplay song, with it's slow piano driven beat, but what really drives it is the combination of instrumentation, strings, and some of Chris Martin's best lyrics.  By the time &quot;Clocks&quot; hits, this album reveals itself as an exciting and emotionally charged development from it's predecessor, once again hinting at things to come.  <BR>Where does Coldplay go from here?  It's hard to say, but this is proof that they won't sell out, and that they are going to continually give us the best they have.

6300213668|5.0|This movie is one big smile. It isn't intellectual, it has very little to say, and the ending will ruffle the feathers of any feminist. Who cares??<br />From the moment the first notes of the theme song blast over the credits, the viewer is solidly hooked. The cast is remarkable, one of those lucky ensembles that are pure serendipity. Young and supple John Travlota plays the 50s hero to the hilt--the guy looked great in black leather and a ducktail hairdo, and not only that, his singing and dancing aren't half bad! Olivia Newton-John is perfect as the innocent heroine Sandy; she's just plain beautiful, her singing voice is clear and sweet, and she's the perfect foil for VERY bad girl Rizzo, played magnificently by Stockard Channing.<br />Comedy great Eve Arden camps it up as the school principal, Jeff Conway, of later &quot;Taxi&quot; fame, is bad boy Kinicki, and there are many other recognizable faces. But the star of the film is the catchy score. It works even though it's sappy, and the choreography is wonderful. This is just plain fun, and so well done that it manages to surmount every cliche it gently lampoons.
B00005J4HH|3.0|ok ... I think muse has got a loooong way to go before they make a really good album. Showbiz was a great debut....it was pretty much strong the whole way through, and had great energy, but they were carbon copy radioheads. This one has some absolutely wonderful tracks, but a lot of problems to be worked out. New Born is a great huge dramatic rocker, Bliss is really cool and bouncy, Hyper Music rocks, Plug in Baby is hands down their best work ever, and Feeling Good is really unpretensious fun. ... equal parts poofed up prog hair metal and liberace opera, matthew bellamy needs to kick his helium addiction.....write more songs that don't sound like aimless art ...and then we'll see what kind of great band they can be.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Easily one of the greatest TV mini-series of all time...simple as that.
0060506989|4.0|This is a carefully written and professionally crafted tome jointly written by two eyewitnesses and participants in the events described therein. The two authors, Harold Moore (a retired Army Lt. Col) and Joe Galloway, then a UPI reporter, met on the battlefield of Ia Drang and became lifelong friends and associates. Moore actually commanded the U. S. Army force dropped into a remote rural area of South Vietnam controlled by the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) in November of 1965 in what became the first recorded engagement between the U.S. Army and the NVA.<br />Firstly, the field tactics employed by Moore's men were experimental in nature, since the was the first time Air Cavalry had attempted to systematically employ attack helicopters to quickly deploy men to and from combat. Since this tactic meant consecutive serial moves of portions of the attacking force to the forward area, it meant those dropped first were, by the very nature of the tactical strategy, left in an extremely vulnerable position in terms of their openness to enemy attack during the initial period of time, before their numbers and strength were reinforced. Of course, the NVA understood this weakness and sought to exploit it to the maximum extent possible, attempting to quickly overrun and overwhelm the sixty some soldiers already on the ground.<br />Thus the battle was joined, and the Air Cavalry troops were quickly surrounded and portions of the force cut off from the others. Moore painstakingly describes the escalating set of circumstances that brought the force to a crisis point, and details how both they and the NVA systematically attempted to deal body blows to the opposing forces. From the beginning the casualties on both sides were considerable; in the several weeks of its duration, almost half the U.S. Army forces were either killed or seriously wounded, while on the other side, there were as many as 1,800 NVA casualties.  There were literally bodies of dead enemy soldiers stacked like kindling at various points of the campaign. In the end, the superior firepower and sole control of the skies by the U. S. Forces served to balance the otherwise overwhelming numerical superiority of the NVA units in the area. Once the smoke cleared, the NVA forces had (at least temporarily) already evaporated, while the U.S. forces returned to the main staging base, leaving the battlefield deserted.<br />This is an absorbing and interesting book to read, both because of the subject matter and because of the personal beliefs and values of the men who authored it. One comes way from the reading experience convinced these men honestly cared about the men they fought beside, and that they tried to do the best they could to win the engagement and bring everyone home safely. Of course, in war this is something no one can succeed at, yet one appreciated the sentiment and the kind of honest values and degree of integrity such sentiments represent. This is a book I can heartily recommend, as I know you will find it as intriguing and provocative ad I did. Enjoy!ndling at various points of the campaign.

B00006AFUR|5.0|This cd is one that will blow you away from the opening track to the very last one.  I first got this cd the night after 30 seconds to mars was in my city (Denver).  I wasn't able to go to the show but my fiancee went and actually got the cover of the cd signed for me.  I have been forever grateful ever since.  Not because she got it signed.  But because she got me this cd.  This cd changed my perspective on the world and how i think.  I got the cd in the morning at school..popped it in my discman and was on for the ride of my life...ever since then that is one of the only cd's i've listened to .. and that was at least a month ago almost.  This cd is a wild ride to be taken ladies and gentlemen.  As it opens with capricorn..on of my favorites..the song blasts you through space taking you out of this world and into theirs.  The cd proceeds to blow you away with songs like Edge of the Earth, Oblivion, Echelon, and the mission and many other great ones.  The secret track i guess you that's what you could call it..the struggle..closes the cd and leaves you wondering if there is another world waiting to happen out there.  Even now as I listen to the cd I am still amazed at the power they hold..and i can only imagine they know it.  Once you heard this cd you too will be blown away i have no doubt in my mind about that.  Well, all I can really say is that this cd is phenominal and to go get it asap if you don't have it already. and gentlemen (30 STM) all i have to say \\"Rock on and take this world to the place we belong\\"
B000068TPN|5.0|This film represents a wonderful example of how well Hollywood can sometimes transform the truths and spirit of a book into a moving and inspiring experience. It is a terrific period piece in the sense that it captures the essence of a now long-gone spirit of concern and empathy that older and compassionate senior officers had for their soldiers. Mel Gibson seems to be aging very well as evidenced by his wonderful characterization of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, a career Army officer who lives both fully and well, but who is at the same time also totally devoted and committed to meet the responsibility he's entrusted with in terms of the welfare of his officers and men.<br />The movie, based on the historical fact of the first large scale engagement by American soldiers with the regular North Vietnamese Army (NVA), as opposed to the clashes with the guerilla-style Viet Cong later on, traces the extensive training and preparation of the regiment in the experimental use of helicopters to transport soldiers rapidly into enemy-held areas. The risks associated with this new style of tactical warfare quickly becomes apparent; eight to ten serial efforts are required to fully mobilize the unit, and the men first dropped find themselves dangerously exposed in the event a vastly superior enemy force engages. Of course, this is exactly what happens, and the brutal exchange that then ensues is the backdrop for the movie.<br />Over a period of some five days, the encircled American forces lose almost half their personnel, yet are able to kill more than 1,800 of the attacking Vietnamese soldiers. Seen in the cold light of day, this exchange becomes a de-facto documentary on the inherent risks of combat, and the quicksilver nature of modern warfare. The cast helps here, for veterans like Sam Elliot (as the Sgt. Rock-like Sergeant Major) and Barry Pepper (as the UPI reporter who forges a life-long friendship with Wallace and helps to write the book) add to the sense of gritty reality the film captures so well. Madeline Stowe is also very good as the enduring wife of the Colonel who also acts to lead the women of the organization in the men's absence. Like another recent movie, \\"Black Hawk Down\\", this film helps to de-mystify modern warfare without glorifying or judging it. This is a wonderful film, and one I heartily recommend.

B00005QZ7U|1.0|I know it's been praised by fans and critics.  It got the Oscars it deserved (Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design).  It was totally undeserving of its Best Picture nod, as well as all the acting nods.<br />Where does it fail?  Oy vey...The story, for one thing.  One cliche after another, to the point where it becomes boring and predictable.  Within a half hour of the movie's beginning, you know everything that's going to happen and how it's going to end.  Yawn.<br />The acting?  Kidman is good (but not Oscar-worthy...she was far superior in THE OTHERS) and her singing is not bad at all.  But she shouldn't quit her day job.  Ewan McGregor was OK, but as a couple, they failed miserably.  Zero chemistry.  Just not believable as a romantic pair.  The rest of the cast just stood around and looked grotesque.<br />The direction?  What a mess!  MR fans whine about Luhrmann not getting a Best Director nod.  Guess what?  He didn't deserve it!...  The movie lurches drunkenly between comedy and tragedy, and never fully succeeds at either.  The tragedy is too contrived and artificial, and is weakened by the attempts at comedy.  The comedy doesn't work because it's very forced and cartoonish, and is undermined by the tragedy.<br />The editing?  Another mess!  It looks like it was edited with a Cuisinart.  I found out recently that this movie was heavily re-edited several times, and its general release delayed for almost a year, while they fine-tuned it.  A lot of continuity was probably left on the cutting-room floor.  The first 30 minutes is the most maddening film ever put on celluloid or DVD; when I saw it in the theater, half the audience walked out during the first half-hour.  And what's the use of all those gorgeous sets if you can't focus on them for more than a nanosecond?<br />This film also pretends to celebrate love, but never explores it more than on the most superficial level.  Christian and Satine are never truly in love, only infatuated; we never get to see their love develop into any real maturity, and never get any sense of an intellectual or spiritual connection, just physical desire.<br />And that gawdawful line...\\"The greatest thing you can ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.\\"  BARF!...  What a treacly, mawkish, manipulative piece of garbage!...  Obviously a cynical attempt to appeal to the Lydia Languishes of the world.  (For those who don't recognize the name, it's a character from the play THE RIVALS, a girl more interested in the glamor and intrigues of romance than in actually having a deep, mature, enduring love.)<br />MOULIN ROUGE is horrendously smug and inordinately pleased with itself.  Watching it is like having Baz Luhrmann sitting next to you, nudging you with his elbow and saying, \\"Look!  Look at how I did that!  Isn't that cool?  Aren't I so hip and cool?\\"<br />This movie pretends to celebrate its oversimplified version of Bohemian values: Love, Freedom, Truth, and Beauty.  But it ends up making a mockery of them.  There's so much grotesquerie...it wallows in artifice and contrivance....love is never realistically explored...and expressing your freedom comes at a horrible price.<br />And how about that ending?  I found the end of the film profoundly depressing.  Not only was Satine dead, but I was personally left with the feeling that Christian was going to kill himself.  The Moulin Rouge cabaret was closed because of him.  His friends were now all unemployed because of him.  He had ruined so many lives, just so he could pursue an adolescent crush.  The final message MOULIN ROUGE gives is not that love is wonderful...the message is, \\"Don't fall in love.  You'll just get hurt, and hurt people around you.  You'll just end up abandoned and alone, ready to put a bullet in your brain.\\"  I'm amazed that this film's fans ignore that, or aren't able to pick up on that.their love develop into any real maturity, and never get any sense of an intellectual or spiritual connection, just physical desire.<br />And that gawdawful line...\\"The greatest thing you can ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return.\\"  BARF!...  What a treacly, mawkish, manipulative piece of garbage!...  Obviously a cynical attempt to appeal to the Lydia Languishes of the world.  (For those who don't recognize the name, it's a character from the play THE RIVALS, a girl more interested in the glamor and intrigues of romance than in actually having a deep, mature, enduring love.)<br />MOULIN ROUGE is horrendously smug and inordinately pleased with itself.  Watching it is like having Baz Luhrmann sitting next to you, nudging you with his elbow and saying, \\"Look!  Look at how I did that!  Isn't that cool?  Aren't I so hip and cool?\\"<br />This movie pretends to celebrate its oversimplified version of Bohemian values: Love, Freedom, Truth, and Beauty.  But it ends up making a mockery of them.  There's so much grotesquerie...it wallows in artifice and contrivance....love is never realistically explored...and expressing your freedom comes at a horrible price.<br />And how about that ending?  I found the end of the film profoundly depressing.  Not only was Satine dead, but I was personally left with the feeling that Christian was going to kill himself.

0553573403|5.0|Initially, when I first read this book I thought it was pretty good. Maybe 3 1/2 to 4 stars good.<br />However, I have almost completed the second book and my opinion of the entire series, and the author, have risen much higher. I will have to give it some time to digest after the next novel, but so far this is the *best* series that has ever graced my eyes.<br />I was a bit disappointed that there was very little magic in the first novel, but just wait. The presence of magic grows stronger as the story continues in the second book. I was also disappointed that this series is not a trilogy, but rather a 6 book mammoth. I thought that I would be able to read the entire series together, which I tend to do with triologies. Now that I am hooked, I will have to wait with the rest of the peasants to read it all. I guess this is a good thing, if your only real complaint is that the entire story is not coming out quick enough. I only hope that I live long enough (longer than GRRM characters at least) to read the ending.<br />The first book sets the stage for an immense undertaking. There is intrigue, prophecy, cunning, evil, good, lust, rape, etc -you name it -This series has it all! You will hate some of the characters, cry when horror strikes, and sometimes rejoice. On the surface, there is a good story. But the true genius of this book goes much deeper. If you search the internet for Fire and Ice theories, you will find all kinds of websites with musings about what happened in the past, what is happening now, and what will happen in this series. Much of this story is a mystery - I found myself going back to different passages to see if I could figure out what will happen based on characater's thoughts, dreams, prophecies - some false & some true. The author has given us clues here and there as to what truly is. He is an artist to say the least. His study must be littered with plot after counter-plot to keep it all straight. As a reader I have a hard enough time. As an author - oh my! Anyway, this series has become my life - I love it so much. I read and read and read until my eyes go blurry. It is highly recommended!or - oh my! Anyway, this series has become my life - I love it so much. I read and read and read until my eyes go blurry. It is highly recommended!
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is by far the best album I've bought this year. If you even THINK that you MIGHT like coldplay, buy this album and you'll love them. These guys really show the talent they have through this album. With &quot;Parachutes&quot;, you could see they had something, but the excecution wasn't quite right. &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; not only blows &quot;Parachutes&quot; out of the water, but it shows what lies ahead for coldplay. They're the next U2. <BR>BUY THIS CD!! THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU HAVEN'T READ BAD REVIEWS OF IT.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What more can I say about this movie? It had me rolling on the floor with laughter from opening to closing.. <br />In this movie we have our main character Shrek who is a loner due to his situation (his is an Ogre).  And he seems to be happy that way.. now introduce a Donkey (with the voice of Eddie Murphy) and a king with some ego problems (must be trying to make up for something) and finally a princess locked in a tower protected by a female dragon and y ou have the makings of a fairy tale gone awry..<br />Shrek our hero is sent out to find the princess so our king err prince can truelly claim his title.  Now once Shrek get to the castle with the donkey ( and some well placed puns) we run into a love hungry dragon and the princess who has some set notions as to what needs to happen when she is rescued.<br />And it is there that I will stop...<br />i will add that this movie is full of action, fun, romance, humor, and drama. .(and this is all within the first 1/2 hr of the movie)..<br />It is a must see for kids and adults alike..
B00006AW2P|4.0|With the release of the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material), there is now some confusion as they have released some of the early albums in both US and UK versions.<br />This is the later May 29, 1964 - U.S. London Records vinyl version of The Rolling Stones, often listed as England's Newest Hitmakers.  The UK version has not been released on CD.  Here is how you know the difference:<br />April 17, 1964 - U.K. Decca Records vinyl version<BR>.....includes Mona (I Need You Baby), does not include Not Fade Away<BR>.....Tell Me version 1 (long 4:08 version without fade out but with guitar break)<BR>May 29, 1964 - U.S. London Records vinyl version<BR>.....includes Not Fade Away , does not include Mona (I Need You Baby)<BR>.....Tell Me version 1 (short 2:59 version with fade out but without guitar break)<br />You will find Mona (I Need You Baby) on the CD release of The Rolling Stones, Now!<br />The album was originally released in the UK without any title....the Band wanted people to ask for \\"the Rolling Stones album\\", but the U.S. record company execs added \\"England's Newest Hitmakers\\" to the cover.  Some of the Amazon reviews of this album sound like the reviewer is hearing the Stones for the 1st time.  Come On!.... this one features no less than *5*  signature songs!  The best version of Carol done until the Stones themselves topped it with the live versions in the 80s, the classic Route 66 (which  they still do), Mick's 1st signature song in Buddy Holly's Not Fade Away, Willie Dixon's I Just Want To Make Love To You (years before Mick would make headlines mouthing the much less controversial Let's Spend  The Night Together on the Ed Sullivan Show), and the 1st Jagger/Richards composition Tell Me (which is still hard to get out of your head). And this doesn't even get into the 2 Motown groove pieces Can I Get A Witness and Walking the Dog.  Now, try to think of  another band that came anywhere near this on their 1st release....not many....perhaps the Beatles,  but jeesh, at least the Stones didn't do any Broadway hits! <br />This is the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material.  ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog after Allen Klein became their manager in 1965.  The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.  With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio.  I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just our tiny little World.<br />The tracks were recorded in 1964 as follows:<BR>Jan 3, 1964 at Regent Sound, London<BR>.....Carol<BR>.....Route 66<BR>.....Walking the Dog<BR>.....You Can Make It If You Try<BR>Jan 10, 1964 at Regent Sound, London<BR>.....I Just Want To Make Love To You<BR>.....I'm A King Bee<BR>.....Honest I Do<BR>Jan 28, Feb 3-4, 1964 at Regent Sound, London<BR>These were the famous sessions with Phil Spector, Gene Pitney, & Graham Nash that also produced the profane \\"Andrew's Blues\\" and the drunken \\"Spector & Pitney Came Too\\" that were never released.<BR>.....Little By Little<BR>.....Can I Get A Witness<BR>.....Now I've Got A Witness<BR>.....Tell Me<BR>.....Not Fade Away<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own<BR>collection.
B00005JKDR|5.0|That is the question I kept asking myself as I watched this movie for the first time on DVD..  It is outstanding with it's comedy, moral views (well hidden), and touching moments..<br />i so do admire a movie that shows a community go from fear and distrust of someone because they are not like them to showing care and concern for the same group of people..<br />This is a A++
B00000AOUD|5.0|After the highly successful \\"Aqualung\\", Jethro Tull felt they had something more to prove to themselves and to their fans. The result is this masterwork chock full of ascerbic wit, mayhem and musical introspection - all of which come to the forefront in grand Tull fashion on \\"Thick As A Brick\\". Anderson & Co. extended their repertoire from their last effort by displaying a barrage of musical stylings, complete with a plethora of riffy rock, mixed in with a dash of folk and flute introspections masterfully done by Ian Anderson. These ingredients make for a uniformly veritable \\"passion play\\", and contain every artistic method kown to mankind, all of which are found in both heavy-duty \\"Bricks\\" featured here. A stripped-down live version (performed at New York's Madison Square Garden, circa 1978) is also featured here - another extra brick thrown in for good measure. Ah, but the fun doesn't stop there, for, as an extended bonus, there's an interview featuring Anderson, Martin Barre and Jeffrey Hammond revealing all concerning the making of this very special masterpiece, a crowning touch added by the folks at Chrysalis. Please allow a number of listens in order for all the melodrama to sink in. One will discover a whole new set of sounds with each passing listen. You'd have to be mighty \\"thick\\"-headed not to include \\"Thick As A Brick\\" in your must-have artistic CD collection. Do yourself a favor, and purchase your \\"Brick\\" today!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Ever wondered what life would be like if you had no short term memory?  Then check out this haunting movie..<br />I will be honest the plot is not the best at times but, the movie sucks you up into it.<br />Like some of the more alternate genre movies this one starts at the end of the movie and leads you back to the beginning in steps..  It helps you to distinguish between past and now using black and white photo and color photo both..<br />Sit back and enjoy this one folks..
B0000033P0|4.0|Continuing on in the tried and true ELP fashion, Keith Emerson, Greg Lake &amp; Carl Palmer create a stellar and unique masterpiece that is &quot;Tarkus&quot;. The title suite has a lot to offer for the serious progressive-rock die-hard, complete with an Emerson/Palmer synthesizer/keyboard and drum clinic in the middle section [from the d) &quot;Mass&quot; to f) &quot;Battlefield&quot; sections, where both Keith and Carl play off one another beautifully without upstaging one another in the process]. The g) &quot;Aquatarkus&quot; section eases the listener out, courtesy of a Palmer military styled drum coda. &quot;Jeremy Bender&quot; is also done in a similar style of &quot;Benny The Bouncer&quot; (from &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;), except &quot;JB&quot; is more evenly and smoothly constructed, with Lake's velvety vocals sung over the top. &quot;Bitches Crystal&quot; and the first half of &quot;The Only Way (Hymn)&quot; are spiced with some mellow pastoral flavorings, which feature religious lyrics sung by Lake (with the passion of a choirboy!) in both tracks. &quot;Infinite Space&quot; contains yet more down-home ELP jams, with the boys doing their craft, and doing it well. The dominant &quot;now or never&quot;-like tones of &quot;A Time And A Place&quot; are evident in Greg Lake's gruff powerful vocals - sung like a fury of hellfire! &quot;Are You Ready Eddy?&quot; (a &quot;sort-of&quot; ode to Eddy Offord, who engineered this album, and would later produce [and engineer] several albums for Yes as well) shows Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's willingness to want to just rock out, and in grand 1950's fashion, too, although the Beatles-esque lyrics are a bit on the wild, nonsensical side (although one has to admit it is a bit keenly different!)!!!With a magical display of perks, quirks and a variety of musical styles present on this, ELP's 1971 sophomoric wonderwork, it shows just how far this dynamic trio would and could go to make &quot;that one supersonic opus&quot;. Fast forward to &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; - but not before you make &quot;Tarkus&quot; (and don't forget &quot;Trilogy&quot;!) an all-important choice for your CD library!;.

B00006FDCD|5.0|I love this movie. It's the story of 7 kids trying to destroy something that nobody can see except them. If you love stephen king lovels you'll love \\"IT\\"
B00006AFUR|5.0|Thirty seconds from Mars album is great. I seen them at the Incubus concert in Buffalo. I instantly fell in love with the band. And who would have thought Jared Leto would be the lead singer of a upcoming band, who are on their way to stardom.
B00003CXC7|5.0|\\"Rear Window\\" came to my attention 20 years ago, courtesy of my mom. She and I were talking about our favorite scary movies, and mine, of course, were confined primarily to blood and gore. She then told me about this amazingly simple story about \\"a man confined to a chair who may or may not have seen a murder.\\" When I asked her how he could've seen a murder from his perspective in an apartment wheelchair, she told me \\"that's where all the suspense comes from.\\" The movie was then rereleased in theaters, and I saw it for the first time. To put it simply, I was floored; no film with such a simple skeleton should have this much flesh and blood packed in a running time of 114 minutes. I went out and purchased it the moment it became a home video. The single-set confinement, the sub-stories involving the other neighbors, the cat-and-mouse interplay (not just with Jeffries and Thorwald, but with Stewart, Corey, Kelly, and Thelma Ritter) is spellbinding. (Sorry, that's another movie.) It's also a wonderfully adult movie, with more than a little sexy entendre betwixt James Stewart and the gorgeous Grace Kelly. One of my top ten favorites, I can honestly conclude that it is Hitchcock's masterpiece.
B00006AFUR|5.0|In a clear display of originality and incredible artistry, this new band forges ahead and creates one of the most beautiful and unique albums yet recorded.  Standing out in sharp contrast to the monotony of contemporary rock music, this CD features not one but eleven astounding songs with an encompassing, out-of-this world sound.  You may have heard their single, &quot;Capricorn,&quot; which gives you a bit of a taste as to just what this band is all about.  30 Seconds to Mars created a stir among critics months before this album was even released, and they have already acquired an extremely dedicated fan base.  Both of these are for good reason, for rarely do I find a band with such a capacity to create amazing, intelligent music.  The face of music itself is changing, so be a part of it.  This band will no doubt have tremendous impact on rock music.  Provehito in altum.
B000002KHH|5.0|it would be hard to deny the fact that black sabbath invented heavy metal.  paranoid is evidence enough for me.<BR>not to take anything away from their self-titled debut, but this is the first black sabbath album i ever heard.  i was probably 7 or 8 the first time i remember hearing it.  my dad was playing a tape of it in the car.  i still have not gotten over the feeling that this album gave me.  i imagine thats what sets this album apart for me.  all i ever remembered hearing in the house growing up was progressive rock such as yes, ELP, styx, etc.  needless to say, paranoid was a shock to my young ears.  paranoid inspired me to pick up the guitar.  i guess it inspired everyone to pick up a guitar, come to think of it.  its really hard for me to put this album into perspective (since i was born in 1979).  there was absolutely nothing of this sort out at the time.  as much as it has affected my life, its hard to imagine what this felt like in the early 70's.  everything else is secondary to this album, as far as heavy metal goes.  dont deny your roots.
B00006AFUR|5.0|i had just barely heard of this band... i bought their cd, and i don't regret having done so. 30 seconds to mars is a band that i think many people could listen to and actually like. i not much of one for writing reviews.... but they seriously [aren't bad]... 30 seconds to mars is a band that i will listen to alot, i will never put their cd up on a shelf and forget about it... this band is not a phase in my life, i actually enjoy listening to them... they rock... i listen to lots of music... but when i bought their cd... it was the only cd in the store that i really wanted to buy.... that must say something about how good i think that they really are
B000003N7G|5.0|my exposure to jazz is very limited, i guess you could say that generally, i am a metal head.  thank God i had the good fortune to hear a love supreme.  from the opening seconds of the album, it is a beautiful thing to behold.  it is a short album, 3 tracks clocking in at around 30 minutes.  this album has no choice but to reach out and grab your attention.  it takes away all of your preconceptions of what music should be.  i admit, i find most jazz to be tired and boring.  its really probably a disgrace to even label this as jazz.  its just a masterpiece, beginning to end.  and i suppose it is timeless, and will continue to be, as it gets sweeter with my every listen.  beautiful.
B000005IU2|5.0|This is by far the best rock and roll album ever recorded. From the first feedback drenched crunch of Down On The Street through to the last saxophone squawk of L.A. Blues, there is not one false note.<br />This is perfect. Absolutely perfect.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Often seen these days is the cross. Britney Spears gone actrees, JLo gone singer, and so on and so forth. But none of these acts can quite live up to 30 Seconds To Mars. Jared Leto(Requiem For A Dream, Fight Club, etc.) compliments his acting brilliance by demonstrating his multi-instrumentalist musical talent.<br />Accompanied by his brother, Shannon, as well as Solon and Wachter, 30 Seconds To Mars embark on a musical odyssey on their self-titled Immortal/Virgin debut. In it's first week it sold over 10,000 copies.<br />The CD enters with &quot;Capricorn [A Brand New Day]&quot; with the ability to instantly lose yourself in the music, accompanied by outstanding vocals and lyrics.<br />30 Seconds To Mars easily has the ability to be the best CD released in 2002 so far, maybe possibly even the whole year. From &quot;Capricorn&quot; to Year Zero you are lost in the music, it itself having it's own addicting ability to having it spinning in your CD player for months.<br />My personal favorites from this CD are &quot;Obilivion&quot;, &quot;Buddha For Mary&quot;, and &quot;Welcome To The Universe&quot;.<br />Definently a recommended buy.
B00000JZIK|4.0|A multi-layered story of rapacious greed and ambition, \\"Usual Suspects\\" puts together a great cast and a story-within-a-story plot.  The Suspects include Keaton (Byrne) a disgraced ex-cop; Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Spacey), a club-footed petty criminal; Hockney (Pollack) the explosives expert; McManus (Baldwin) who's something of an explosive himself and Fenster (Del Toro).  I'm not sure what Fenster's role is, but given the hushed and marble-mouth tones that he speaks in, nobody else seems to know either.  The story is told in flashback by Verbal after the rest are either dead or presumed dead.  The film begins with the explosive destruction of a freighter in southern California.  Only one other man, the freighter's horrifically burnt passenger, survives.  He knows nothing of our heroes, instead ranting about \\"Keyser Soze\\".  Recognizing the name of an international criminal who murders almost on whim, and connecting him to the Suspects, a federal agent (Palmintierri) who's made a career of investigating Keaton, puts Verbal on the grill, forcing Spacey's character to recount how the boys came to know each other.  Gathered weeks earlier by the police as suspects or line-up fillers in the hijacking of a police truck carrying guns earmarked for destruction, the suspects (Verbal being one of the \\"fillers\\") are initially strangers, yet join together and form a plan.  Released when nobody gets pinned for the truck rap, the Suspects go into business - targeting for robbery various high-level smugglers who pay to keep the police at arms length.  Soon their rep brings them to the west coast, but we also learn that they had already come to the attention of Keyser Soze - by virtue of how their crimes have come at his expense.  Blackmailed by Soze through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Posthlethwaite, looking and sounding more Indo-Pak than Japanese), the suspects reluctantly follow his orders and shoot their way into a docked freighter loaded (says Kobayashi) with a fortune in cocaine.  By now, Verbal has recounted what he knows of Soze - less a man than a force of nature gone bad; a Hungarian criminal who killed his own family rather than let rivals hold them hostages against him; a mass killer who not only hunts down those who had tried to hold his family hostage, but their friends and families as well.  Soze's is the name that that career criminals utter to themselves when they need something to keep them up at night.<br />Okay, that's as far as I can go without spoiling it.  Sure, you'll probably figure out the big secret within the first few minutes (once a police sketch artist is brought in, the secret will practically leap out at you).  Nevertheless, the script works some great magic.  The ultimate trick isn't Keyser Soze secret identity but how the story gets you to root and care for a crew of wretched, murderous and greedy losers who'd be fodder in a more upstanding story.  The biggest mystery of all, when I saw it, was figuring out what kind of movie this was.  I had an idea that it would be some buddy-buddy picture of good-guy criminals - a sort of \\"Brinks Job\\" for the 1990's, but the result is much more satisfying.
B00006AFUR|2.0|These guys are amazing on recording.  Songs like 93 Million Miles, Echelon, and Capricorn are amazing, but if you saw there last tour, your wouldn't be buying this album: You'd be buying recording time with their producer because he can work MIRACLES!  I'm so dissapointed in Buddha for Mary, they changed all of the good old parts to be \\"PC\\"...
0446677450|5.0|Great book that helps you think outside of the box. More &amp; more people need to read it to &quot;enlighten&quot; them about the &quot;traditional&quot; thinking of -go to school, get good grades, get a good job. This no longer exists in our society. Doctors may earn more money, but they are so greatly in debt from student loans &amp; then malpractice insurance, you'd have to truly love being a doctor to stay being in practice.<br />If you are living paycheck to paycheck, this book IS for you!<br />It can &amp; will help if you really listen (read) what is being said in the book.
B000067D8W|4.0|At first the idea of another Roswell/Buffy with a superhero twist doesn't exactly bode well for a genre that is already being done to death in the marketplace.  So it was with no small amount of apprehension that I found myself viewing the pilot episode of Smallville one sunday afternoon on UK Television.  Although familiar with the comics I was and am no big Superman fan yet within 20 minutes the show had me in thrall and I thought - Jesus, this is actually a good show.  Sure the X-Files villian of the week idea couldn't work forever but that soon became secondary to the characterisation that the writers and actors bring to this show.  Clark alone is a contradiction of Freudian proportions - strong yet insecure, handsome but lonely, secretive (out of necessity regarding his powers) yet warm and open.  And then their are his parents - brilliantly portrayed by veterans Annette O'Toole and John Schneider who provide a caring and supportive backbone to Clarks 'different' adolescence.  But out of all the characters none holds the show quite so well as Lex Luthor played by Michael Rosenbaum.  In direct contrast to Clark, he is the one character that we all know will one day become the villian of the show and yet you cannot help but feel sympathetic to Lex.  Michael Rosenbaum brings an overwhelming humanity to the show that stems from Lex being unloved by his father and the unenviable position of outsider as a result of this and the meteor crash that left him bald.  My upbringing was similiar to Clarks but in one episode when you see Lex stare at Clark and his family hugging after a life threatening incident you can't help but feel his pain and envy.  Yes it is that good a show - even the coldest heart will find comfort here.  The DVD is a nice transfer and the extras a pleasant surprise considering Warner normally limit such things especially on TV Show DVD's (Babylon 5 The Gathering springs to mind!).  The commentary is a bit dull though with little given away, insteadthe creators just rehash what the viewer could gleam from watching the pilot themselves.  Perhaps if they release the first season as a box set (the smart money says they will) the actors themselves could do the commentary as I'm sure this would be more entertaining.  Saying that its a nice little DVD and exclusive to canada as well.  Recommended.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved this movie, as well as my 3.5 yr. old son. I explained everything to him of why &quot;Boo&quot; was afraid of Randall (he's naughty) &amp; that Mike &amp; Sully were the good monsters. We also associate nice monsters with Sesame Street characters(Elmo, Oscar, Zoe, Cookie Monster, Grover, etc.)<br />Plus, we watched &quot;Mike's New Car&quot; before the movie so I could explain what would be coming up. Besure to also watch &quot;For The Birds&quot;, it's funny &amp; very cute. <br />If your child tends to be a little on the scared side, then do not allow him or her to watch this...without you right next to him or her. Also watch in in the day time...before bed. <br />Monsters, Inc. DVD set is fun, has great out takes &amp; would be a nice addition to your video collection.

B00006AFUR|5.0|RS, what were you thinking? They did not give the Band the proper credit for what they have done on their album. I know criticism is meant to convey an opinion, but Peter Relic's review was absurd. 30STM is an overall great band, and they have blown me away. What more do you want in music than something to be easily related to, it's about conveying a message, not how simple lyrics are. This is why critics have a tendency of becoming highly ridiculed, because they loose touch of things as a whole and critique small insignificant things, turning potential listeners away from something they never had a true representation on. I caught a promo copy of the album and then bought a presale after I listened to it 1 time. I'm one who looks for music that speaks feeling and conveys it, so I listen to everything. There has never been a better album, overall, to hit the scene in at least 4 years. Everything on the album is almost seamless, somewhat conceptual, but each song is it's own entity. Oblivion should be the second single for the album, it rolls all the feelings up and pushes it out into an easily digestible song. If you have the chance, and have not, check this album out, listen to a sample or two, and I promise you will not be disappointed.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The album, kind of new to the stands has received massive positive reviews. In light of the frontman's acting fame, the band decided to promote the music without getting too personal. The mystery that was 30 Seconds to Mars, achieved an ample fanbase immediately. Surely, this says something about the band. Like, that the music is first and foremost. And they want to honor the music, and center the fans around this, rather than the singer's fame.<br />This too, says the music must be pretty DAMN GOOD to create such a sizable fanbase. The first single, &quot;Capricorn&quot; is a mesh of intense, hard riffs, melodic vocals, and superb drumming. To me, the song represents starting over, renewal. Some other equally good tracks on the CD are &quot;Oblivion&quot; and &quot;Buddha For Mary.&quot; So, if you feel that you need some inspiring, and soul-capturing music, listen to this album. You will not be disappointed.

I caught a promo copy of the album and then bought a presale after I listened to it 1 time.  I'm one who looks for music that speaks feeling and conveys it, so I listen to everything.  There has never been a better album, overall, to hit the scene in at least 4 years.  Everything on the album is almost seamless, somewhat conceptual, but each song is it's own entity. Oblivion should be the second single for the album, it rolls all the feelings up and pushes it out into an easily digestible song.  If you have the chance, and have not, check this album out, listen to a sample or two, and I promise you will not be disappointed.
B00005TT77|5.0|Really nice takes on a bunch of awesome songs. <BR>Also a very touching movie.
B00006AFUR|5.0|From the first word uttered out of Jared Leto's mouth on the first song, you know this is not your mother's version of rock.  This is a down and dirty mix of fresh and exciting guitars, vocals and synthesizers.  Capricorn grabs you right at the beginning and you find yourself unable to stop listening until you get to the end of song 11.  <br />Rest assured, 30 seconds to mars will take you on a ride you will never forget.  Thanks Jared!
0316666343|3.0|I enjoyed the book.  It was pretty hard to put it down and I finished it in 2 days.  The first few chapters were excellent but as the book progressed, I was screaming for justice for Susie.  Were they ever gonna find her body, and catch the murderer? ...  Her body was never fully recovered, I felt something was missing. She came back to earth and did what...  She could have done more than that.  The author did not move me as much as I thought this book would.  I guess in the end her true objective was to see how the family would cope and what they would do with their lives.<br />It was worth my money...but I thought it would do more.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|I consider myself a fan of sci-fi/fantasy stories but I found this movie laughable. The first 1/3 of the movie looked promising but the plot just took a nosedive. It just reminded me of one of those hokey sci-fi channel shows that never became successful, or an episode of the Twilight Zone which got scrapped.<br />Unless you're a diehard sci-fi geek don't buy this movie, rent it first.
078322947X|2.0|I hate giving this masterpiece a 2 out of 5 but it is the DVD that is in qeustion...not the film. Will a full aspect ratio version of this gritty film ever come out? Will we ever see a remastered copy? A Friedkin commentary? Probobly not. We see mounds of BAD films filling the shelves with dir. commentary and making of's. They have transfers that are impecable, yet worthy films are set aside, mastered from rotting prints. We know that Sorcerer is NOT a marketable DVD, the profit margins are too low. But when we see special editions for forgettable films that made little to no money at the boxoffice, it makes one wonder how these companies view their provocative films, what their scale of worth is. <BR>Maybe, it only adds to the film's flair; forgotten, but wicked, wicked cool.
B000002C25|4.0|[****] the critics! This is a good rock 'n roll album. I hate it when people compare this to their first two albums. <BR>This is the first Oasis album I brought. I didn't like it when I first listen to it, but the songs stay with you. <BR>This album has replay value even years after I brought it. After listening to the songs, read the lyrics and you see what I mean.
B00006AFUR|5.0|From the chart-climbing &quot;Capricorn&quot; to the sizzling &quot;Buddha for Mary&quot;, from the heart-pounding &quot;Oblivion&quot; to the crowd-thrilling &quot;End of the Beginning&quot;, this CD is a non-stop mix of everything you could possibly look for in an incredible debut CD.  Turn the bass up high.  Turn the lights down low.  Now sit back and immerse yourself in the experience that is 30 Seconds to Mars.
0871294273|5.0|The Hobbit is one of the best books you will ever read.  It starts off when the wizard Gandalf came to Bilbo Baggins (a hobbit) with a band of homeless dwarves on a journey to try to reclaim their home.  Bilbo gets drawn into their journey facing many evil creatures like orcs, giant spiders, and even worse dangers.  Finally, it is all up to Bilbo the hobbit to face their worse danger yet. <br />Once you start this book you can not put it down until you are done.  You can even read it a second time it is so good.  I recomend this book to everybody who can read.
6304493738|5.0|Perhaps the best suspense/crime movie ever made.  A+ Plot.  A+ Writing.  A+ Acting.  A+ Music.  A+ Everything.  The Godfather of its category.  A true achivement of moviemaking.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I can't say enough great things about the movie and the excellent DVD edition, so I won't bother here.<br />But beware, if you own a Pioneer DVD player, odds are that it will freeze at the layer shift at 84:01. Read all about it in the DVDtalk forums. ... Otherwise, it's perfect, and I couldn't ask for a better release of this fantastic film.
B0000046W9|5.0|Ran into this a couple years ago at the public library and hit the Bossa Nova mother lode. Realized that it would make a perfect gift and serendipitously found it on special sale. Should've bought all the copies I could!<br />This has to be one of the best box sets ever, both from a musical and an archival point of view. Since the other reviewers have described so well the contents of this collection, I only want to exhort you, the prospective buyer, to keep a sharp eye out for an opportunity to grab it at a favorable price.<br />In the meantime, let's hope Verve prints more copies. This is music that will never go out of style.
B00006AV2A|5.0|A must buy cd, people be talking about ya p.diddy and &quot;we inveted the remix&quot;. Yo Sean if you really want to know how to remix linkin park is what i gots to say to you. The remixes in this album are off the hook, and you probably know what im talking about when i say that everyone has one particular song in this album that they like.<br />The whole effect of the cd case and the names of the songs made me go for it as well as the bands music. Don waste ut time lookin at dis review go buy this cd.<br />Peace, Cav
B00005JKJA|3.0|It was hard for me to get into this film, and understand it!! Most of the movie revolves around two women trying to find out where one came from and the owner of a lot of money. They end up falling for each other, and the movie only gets weirder from there. I would deffinately say watch it, if you are in the mood for a different type of movie!
B00006AFUR|5.0|this album is absolutly the best album i have purchased in a long time. the music is awesome, the lyrics are better and jareds voice is out of this world. i am proud to say i am a proud member of the mars army and the echelon. ROCK ON!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I am a big fan of this particular director. I enjoyed his last film PI immensly and I was pumped up to see this one. This movie ventures into the world of drugs as well as other addictions. It focuses on what happens when you lose control which is what drives the film. Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connely, Jared Leto, and Ellen Burstyn are all great. If you are looking for an educational but enjoyable film, I reccomend this one. Even though it is nc-17, parents should deffinately think about watching it with kids, so that they can give proper motivation to avoid drugs!
B00005O3VC|5.0|I've been watching &quot;Holy Grail&quot; since I was 3 years old. On DVD, &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; is one for any DVD collection.<br />The first disk includes the movie with some great commentaries by the surviving members of Python and subtitles. This disk also lets you peak into the mind of Terry Gilliam with some of his original animations as the menus. Finally, to show that they care, Monty Python has added a special feature for the Hard of Hearing.<br />The second disk is all extras. My personal favorite is the &quot;Quest for the Holy Grail Locations&quot; documentary where Michael Palin and Terry Jones visit some of the locations for the film and give you a play-by-play of making the film. There's much more, but I don't want to give it all away.<br />I recommend &quot;Holy Grail&quot; for anyone who loves comedy. It's one of those movies that you just never get tired of.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a beautiful &amp; well produced movie about the Scottish peoples' revolt from England with William Wallace (Gibson) leading the strike. The story line will keep you in your seat and eyes glued to the TV. If you like movies about events that happened and are somewhat documentaries of the event (i.e. Titanic), then you must see this. I promise that this one will not disappoint.<br />-RB
6305388458|5.0|I rented \\"Life of Brian\\" because I wanted to see if Python could follow up the phenominal success of \\"Holy Grail\\". To say the least, \\"Brian\\" lives up to the hype.<br />\\"Life of Brian\\" is the story of Brian of Nazareth, a poor peasant born suspiciously close to Jesus who helps the Jews fight the Romans. Though a little weird in places, \\"Brian\\" is typical Python lunacy. I found myself on the floor laughing at some points.<br />The DVD version is really nothing to gawk at. It's just a few special features, a menu, and great graphics from a VHS. So I guess that the heart and soul of the DVD is the movie itself and that's enough for me.<br />I recommend this for any Python fan. \\"Life of Brian\\" is a fun hour and a half of comedy, religion and course language. ...
B00006BTCA|5.0|Take a few parts of the Kitchens of Distinction, especially the vocals.  Now combine that sound with a bit of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, add in some NYC dirt and alleys, throw in a dash and a pinch of originality, toss with some of the Strokes, add the spark of actually being decent, mix and serve.  <BR>They mimic the influences well enough to be respected, but don't copy them enough to be derided. <BR>The band is going to remind you of some other band. Probably a good one you liked.  They're going to be similar, but different enough to warrant you taking a chance. After all, that other band they remind you about probably isn't making decent new music anymore.  Worth a listen, worth some money, worth supporting enough that they stay around for awhile.
6302256704|5.0|After setting the police profession back 100 years with the &quot;Naked Gun&quot; movie, director Jim Abrahams decided to set his sights on the military with &quot;Hot Shots.&quot; And the military will never be the same again.<br />What makes this movie so much fun are the sight gags that are in almost every scene. As with all good slapstick comedy movies, there are too many sight gags for you to be able to catch them all the first, and even second, time around. Every time you watch this movie, you will find another sight gag that you hadn't noticed before.<br />The movie also comes with a great comedic cast. It stars Charlie Sheen who for the first time really gets a chance to show how funny he can be (his previous comedy movies are pretty much forgettable). He is supported by Jon Cryer, Lloyd Bridges, and Cary Elwes. Each of these people have a great track record on their own when it comes to comedy. Together, they make the movie work.
B00004TDTO|5.0|If you consider this movie as a Horror or an Adventure movie, it is still great. The movie is about a 25 foot Great White Shark(Bruce) that terrorizes a Summer resort town. When about three attacks occur, Police Cheif Martin Brody(Roy Scheider) and Marine Biologist Matt Hooper(Richard Dreyfuss) think the beaches should be closed fo the Fourth of July, the Mayor(Murray Hamilton) keeps them open. After another attack happens, Brody, Hooper, and Fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw) are sent to kill the shark......
B000002BQK|3.0|Luke Warm. Lots of the tracks are fillers such as &quot;babydoll&quot;, &quot;close my eyes&quot;, and &quot;fly away&quot;. the only tracks i think are worth listening to are &quot;butterfly&quot;, &quot;my all&quot;, &quot;the roof&quot;, &quot;the beautiful ones&quot;, and &quot;outside&quot;. &quot;honey&quot; is awful and pretty much the only upbeat song on the album. of course, she realeased &quot;honey&quot; as the first single to try and decieve people that the rest of the album is similar. this album is part brilliance and part garbage.
B000002UD1|5.0|This album is extremely underrated, but I think a lot of John's work is seriously overlooked and unjustly criticized (I'm talking about solo. When he was Beatle John, it seems you just can't touch him). I kind of wish everyone would just love John Lennon's music, like people like TV or reading the paper. It just seems like it should be a normal, natural thing. But I guess not. The songs on here are really amazing. All of them. I give it 5 stars because when I got Mind Games, I wasn't expecting it to be like POB or Imagine or Double Fantasy, or even Walls and Bridges, or any of those John albums held higher than it. But, after hearing it a few times, I was amazed at how beautiful it is.<br /> I love it more than W&amp;B's and the songs on here are so heartfelt and beautiful. I Know (I Know) is absolutely gorgeous. One Day At A Time...perfect. The only song I would ever call &quot;weak&quot; is Only People. But that's only because of that chorus. Anyway, its gonna be remastered and I'm going to get it. Its totally worth it. I always said, the only thing Mind Games ever needed was to be remixed and remastered and its happening. Yay! I'll be listening to it for a long time, that's for certain.
B000066NW0|3.0|Geez! I can't believe some of the really horrible reviews I've read. Granted, this little pop/punk starlet is no Streisand, C. Dion or Karen Carpenter when it comes to vocal talent and certainly is not near as talented as America's new idol Kelly Clarkson, but she is not as awful as some reviewers have said. She is certainly better than Pink, her music is much more refreshing than that of Alanis &quot;I hate everybody so I'm going to depress you with my so-called music&quot; Morisette and has more substance than Britney Spears and that loathsome woman who can't find her clothes, Jennifer Lopez. I am of the days when singer/songwriters were actually great - Carly Simon, Carole King, Joan Baez, etc. We have only one of those now - Sheryl Crow. So, why do I like this CD - it is good, mindless bubble-gum punk, pop with a hard edge. If you like her hit &quot;Complicated,&quot; you'll probably not be disappointed in the rest of this CD.
B00004ZEQX|2.0|House by the Cemetary. Lucio Fulci has been one of my favorite horror directors since I first watched the genre masterpiece. This film, in true Lcio fashion, offers up all the gore and all the horror as is expected from this great director. However, at times it moves rather slowly, and the gore is no where near sufficient for the die hard Lucio fan. Strong elements of the film however, include tense atmosphere and a sense of lurking danger. For the most part however, I would resommend the film Zombie for a true taste of Lucio's genius. I give this film two stars.
1573301051|5.0|I think that Celine Dion screams at the top of her lungs just so she can be heard over everyone in Natural Woman.  Otherwise this DVD and CD are good Mariah Carey is the bestest singer in the world and is the only one that acted, dressed like a &quot;diva&quot;.  Buy it for Mariah not Celine.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The first Rule of Fightclub...wathc this movie. From begiining to end this visually stunning and superbly directed film takes you for one wild ride. Beneath the bare fisted brawls and raging choas sprawls an intense web of deep philosophical meaning. Fight Club tackles the issue of a mans place in society where the onslaught of the politically correct and the idea of the &quot;sensitive man&quot; has left him wondering who we are and who we should be. A profoundly moving yet visceral film, Fight CLub delivers. I give this movie five big stars. Top tan movie. I also highly recommend the book, by Chuck Palahniuk for a thoroughly enjoyable read.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars combines thoughtful lyrics with a unique, emotional-yet-broodingly-dark rock sound to produce a distinctive album.  In an era where mindless rock groups are taking over mindless pop artists, 30 StM provides us with a reminder of what music used to be about and hope for its future.  The album plays with different sounds and effects that create a diverse sounding, interesting listen; you won't get bored listening to this album.  It's an album that is a refreshing blend of creativity and insight.
B00005R2IS|5.0|A post-apocolyptic wasteland. Peace officers in hopped-up hotrods. Renegade bikers. What else does a film need to offer to be a five star masterpiece?! One of GIbson's earliest films, Mad Max continues to be one of his greatest achievements, both as a film and as a character. I give this film five big stars! This is a must see film.
B00005O438|3.0|CUJO, a truely gripping and terrorfying movie experience. When i first saw it i was so scared i nearly cried with fear. Now however that it has seen the light of DVD, i wonder to myself what went wrong? The Sound and Picture are very good even though its presented in Mono, its not in Widescreen which is dissapointing and as for the Extras, what Extras. Theres just nothing on this Disc. All we have here is the scene index. It still is an essential if your a Dee Wallace fan like me but nether the less a Disc with no Exrtas can be a dissapointment.
0792140923|1.0|Forrest Gump is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is simply no way to make a good movie based on such a ridiculous concept. The movie expects us to believe that a person with an IQ of 75 can graduate from high school and college and join the military. I don't believe it for a minute. The plot of the movie is preposterous, and the script sounds like it was written by the same people who write greeting cards. This is not a compliment. The same gimmick is repeated over and over, and the movie drags on and on. Forrest is extremely lucky. Forrest is in the right place at the right time. Other people do things for Forrest. Forrest just says and does whatever pops into his head, and other people have the talent and intelligence to turn his words and actions into something entertaining. Tom Hanks is incredibly irritating in this movie. I never liked him anyway. Even a horrible movie can have something good about it. The only thing I liked about this movie is Gary Sinise. He plays a believable character and gives a good performance. Other than that, I would say don't waste your time with this nonsense.
B000002UA9|5.0|This album would be an all-time classic if it did not suffer from the inevitable comparisons to the subsequent albums released by the Beatles.  This is one of the best debut albums ever, and it still stands up as a work of pure rock 'n' roll brilliance, especially given the fact that it was all recorded in a single marathon session in the middle of a hellish work schedule.    Albums at that time were never thought of as a work of art on their own, but rather as a collection of songs.  This is important to keep in mind when evaluating early rock albums.    The only songs that aren't all that impressive are \\"Anna (Go To Him)\\", \\"Boys\\" (even though Ringo tries his best on the vocal), and \\"Baby It's You\\" (good cover of a bad song).    The two real standouts on the album are \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"Twist and Shout\\", with \\"There's a Place\\" as a signpost as to where John Lennon would go with his lyrics.    \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" was the first great song the Beatles made.  From his energetic count-in -- \\"One, two, three, FAWR!\\" -- Paul McCartney's vocal evokes a furnace burning out of control, and with the Lennon-inspired line, \\"you know what I mean,\\" there is an early example of the Beatles' trademark of identifying the music with its audience.    Recorded in one take, \\"Twist and Shout\\" goes against the grain as far as cover versions are concerned.  Rarely does a cover artist improve upon the original, but the Beatles make this song their own, even though the Isley Bros. original is a classic.  Lennon knew he would only get one or two tries at the vocal, and with the absence of overdub technology in 1963, all the instrumentation had to be right on the money as well, and it was.    There are quite a few other quality songs on the album.  Most of these, like \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"PS I Love You\\", and \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret?\\" have become staples of oldies radio.    Overall, this is a wonderful debut album and a precursor of things to come for thegreatest group of all time.
B00003CXE6|5.0|The best thing about Gladiator is the acting. I can't imagine anybody other than Russell Crowe playing Maximus. His performance is absolutely perfect. Russell earned his Oscar for this role, and it had nothing to do with his not winning for The Insider. If I had to describe Russell's performance in one word, it would be \\"subtle.\\" Russell always holds your attention and makes himself clear, but he is never flashy or exaggerated. He conveys Maximus' intelligence, sense of humor, warmth, courage, dignity, intensity, and all the other facets of his personality. He is also very [good looking]! Joaquin Phoenix should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Commodus. Connie Nielsen is superb as Lucilla and has excellent chemistry with Russell. The rest of the cast is also brilliant. The music, by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, is magnificent and should have won the Oscar. The writing and directing are good, but not great. Seeing Gladiator made me curious about the Roman Empire, and I have been doing some reading. The movie has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies. I think if people want to know the facts about the Roman Empire, they can read a history book. The movie is intended to be entertaining, not educational.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I love westerns. The tough, gritty action, the free living gunfighters, really makes a cinema memory. I will be honest. When I first rented this film, I was a little unsure. I had heard this was a comedy. I like my westerns to be pure western. I took a chance and veiwed this film. Wow. This was so good, I watched it four times all the way through. It is a beautiful film. The color has a very charming faded look to it. It dose have plenty of action. The shoot-out at the end is breathtaking. If you like classic westerns, you MUST own this film. The dvd does a great job of cleaning up the film. It also has some interesting extra features.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 seconds to mars can only be described as FRESH. The lyrics and music written by Jared Leto are amazing. Effects galore, lyrics about everything- except theres no whining or rapping which makes it all the better-and sick guitar playing. Simply put, if you want to hear something new and amazing, buy 30 seconds to mars' new cd.
B0000508U6|5.0|The Talent of cold play in the album&quot;Parachute&quot; was an incipient and likely to grow stronger in the coming years.<br />10 powerful songs profusing emotions , love , in a soft genteel ,and refined melodies.<br />&quot;Yellow&quot; the chart hit single expedited the success of the album whereas &quot; Trouble&quot; established the band for further future hits.<br />the group were circumspect to give birth for something coherent and aethetic in a way.<br />the Album remindes me of some Radio Head early songs.<br />Even though i am enjoying the album the best of all is &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;Spies&quot;.......<br />Parachute is definetly a Five Star Album!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I was really excited for this movie.  I love historical movies, and I think they do a lot to help us understand the world, and the events that made it what it is today.  Little did I know that this movie would have no more to do with Pearl Harbor than a stage for one of the cheesiest, poorly done love-triangles ever.<br />Unfortunately, I found myself outside the intended audience of this movie.  Since I'm not a 14 year-old teeny-bopper, I don't think Josh Hartnett 'is hot' and I don't think he's a good actor.  That pretty much sums up the entertainment value of this movie.  If you don't think Hartnett or Affleck are hot, don't watch this movie.<br />Not only was this movie lame, it was three hours long.  Take out the first 2 1/2 hours and leave the raid at the end and you'd have a fairly decent (though short) movie.  By this point of the film, though, I was so bored and irritated that I HOPED they'd both die.<br />I've seen everyone praise the scene with the attack on Pearl Harbor, but I wasn't that impressed.  Just because you make a lot of stuff blow up and a lot of people die doesn't mean it's entertaining.  I thought we learned that with Titanic.<br />The love story is old and worn-out.  The acting is not that great, and some of the lines are downright corny.  The historical aspect of this film is nearly non-existent, and even what little exists is grossly inaccurate.  So, if you just like to see Josh Hartnett get sweaty, watch this film.  Otherwise, stay away from it.
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.  Part of its appeal lies in its originality and simplicity.  Jeff (played by James Stewart) is an injured photographer who's confined to a wheelchair in his apartment.  The story revolves around the things he sees from his window as he's spying on his neighbors.  Binoculars in hand, Jeff looks at what everyone's doing and knows a lot about each of their lives.<br />He begins to suspect his neighbor of murdering his wife, and a number of things happen that seem to support that hypothesis.  He investigates, and gets both his girlfriend (played by Grace Kelly) and his nurse to help him.<br />Directing was an art for Hitchcock, and his ability is showcased marvelously in this thriller.  Using just the apartment building for a set, Hitchcock creates an aura of suspense and uncertainty that will keep you involved throughout the movie.<br />The acting in this movie is superb, and its story is interesting, all the way to the final climax involving the helpless Jeff.  This is a movie that definitely deserves to be on AFIs top 100 list.
0897500482|5.0|I think no student of hand-to-hand combat should be without this book, with one caveat: It's not a book that was written in a logical sequence or even chapters. It's a collection of Lee's notes put together after his death.<br />So, what you're getting is a buffet of disconnected observations and notes on what Lee learned as he studied the various classical styles of martial arts.<br />Even so, he was so insightful that one can gain a wealth of knowledge by reading it. A great reference guide for students of any level.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This movie is just hilarious.  I don't know how else to put it.  It's basically a series of short sketches that have to do with the legend of King Arthur.  He blunders his way about the land gathering 'knights' on his way and leading them on a search for the Holy Grail.  Along the way, he has some hilarious encounters.<br />One of the funniest aspects of this movie is the dialogue.  Some of the scenes are incredibly funny.  The burning of the witch (she turned me into a newt!) and Dennis the peasant (you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just cause some watery taut threw a sword at you!) are among the most memorable.  Equally funny is Arthur's battle with the black knight and Sir Robyn's encounter with the giant (when danger reared it's ugly head, he boldly turned his tail and fled).<br />The special features in this set are fabulous.  What could be more funny than Monty Python in legos!  Just the bonus disc is enough to entertain someone for hours.<br />Monty Python is undoubtedly one of the most talented comedy troupes ever to perform, and this is the creme of the python's crop.  If Monty Python isn't funny, I don't know what is.
B00005JK8K|1.0|The production of this film was expensive and the talent competent to say the least. The trouble was that while the purported subject of Native American code talkers is wildly fascinating, the actual subject of the movie was extensive, profane, ceaseless blood and gore.  As a Native American I am deeply disappointed, as an American Citizen I deplore the shallow perspective and as a human being I regret the time spent in watching this bloody depiction under misleading banner.
B000002U82|5.0|This is quite simply the best progressive rock album ever.  It is a must have for any music fan.  This is one of those albums that you'll never forget, that will be a standard by which you will judge all future music.<br />From the opening moments of &quot;Breathe&quot; to the final emotional finale of &quot;eclipse,&quot; the lyrics will leave you breathless as they glide over the soothing, beautiful melody.  This album is solid from start to finish--pure, blissful classic rock at its finest.<br />The release of the Dark Side of the Moon was one of the defining moments in rock history.  As any classic rock fan knows, this album is an essential.
157330087X|3.0|Well the list of guitarists is something to be expected considering they are paying homage to one of the greatest guitar players of all time. However it seems that his brother Jimmie in this DVD uses this as an opportunity to play with the greats. Instead of allowing the great guitarists play their hearts out they seem to be in the background of a sub par guitarist. The first thing I thought when I saw this was Stevie would have been furious seeing these great guitarists playing behind his brother. These people needed to be showcased instead of dropped in the background. Once you get used to this the interviews are really nice hearing these great blues players talk about Stevie. There playing was really cool, it is definitely something to watch and enjoy, and the last song SRV Shuffle on the DVD is really fun to watch. It would have been better if Jimmie had got out of the way though. Would have been a five star if he would have just let the better musicians play in the spotlight instead of trying to steal the spotlight.
6301543408|2.0|Besides the new \\"Insurrection,\\" this is the only \\"Star Trek\\" movie that feels tired, like we've seen it before. William Shatner directs and stars in this ho-hum film that leaves much to be desired. The plot concerns a renegade Vulcan named Sybok hijacking the Enterprise and taking it to the center of the universe to find God. It's not a pretty sight. Most of the characters we know and love have nothing to do here but act like zombies, especially Uhura, who gets naked and sings in front of Sybok's desciples. Why was this scene put in there? Don't get me wrong, Nichelle Nichols is a wonderful actress, but this is embarrassing to watch. As for Shatner's direction, it's actually not that bad. His writing needs plenty work, though.
B000065U1N|5.0|It is a shame that such a great movie comes from such a horrible real-life event. Everyone should be made to watch this film as well as read the book. I finished the book about a month ago and the film stays 99% accurate. Both are a must!!
0440178002|4.0|Whatever it was, whatever it wasn't - <BR>I read every word, every sentence skipped nothing and never grew bored at any point throughout the story.  I didn't like the ending because I felt saddened and left hopeless by it.  But I didn't want the book to end in the first place.  <BR>It was total escapist historical fiction; 1100+ ages read like 300.  Such interesting plot twists, but no real satisfaction for poor Mr. Blackthorn, Anjin-san.  Oh well, it's only a book.
B000068TPN|5.0|Everyone in the country should be made to sit down and watch this movie. My father was in Vietnam and by all accounts, this movie is very accurate (including the dropping of Agent Orange on our own soldiers). Will show you what our soldiers go through to defend and protect our country. Currently my father is suffering through medical issues because of Agent Orange and has told me of other guys that were over there that are now dying/dead (cancer, Diabetes) because of this chemical. All of these men are and have been fighting with the U.S. Government to take full responsibility for the problems Agent Orange has caused. The Government still wants to deny any wrong-doing and does not want to cover full medical expenses.
B000002B1M|5.0|I cannot believe it!! Nas makes a milestone in rap music (Illmatic) and then comes back two years later with an even better album than the original!! Maturity, mindblowing rhymes, and excellent, original storytelling (\\"The Set-Up\\", \\"Street Dreams, and \\"Shootouts\\" to name a few), are the recipe for sucess. <br />However, this can also be called one of the most underrated rap albums ever made as well. The reason for this is that on \\"Illmatic\\", he had no commercial singles like \\"If I Ruled The World\\", and was almost completely underground. He was a well kept secret, that is, until he made this album. He transformed from Nasty Nas to Nas Escobar (a more \\"gangsta\\" version of himself). Many of his fans found this to be bad. I would never say that he sold-out. I mean, c'mon! He worked much harder on this album than \\"Illmatic\\"! The other reason that this is so overlooked is because it wasn't the \\"Illmatic\\" sucesssor his fans eagarly awaited. Oh well. I think it's better. I can't believe what a brilliant album Nas has put out 6 years ago now. Forget about them...<br />The beats are excellent. Such famous producers as DJ Premier and Dr.Dre produced them. As someone else said, the beats never seem out-of-place at all. The intro to \\"Shootouts\\" has a kind of a \\"Gunsmoke\\" or 1950's western music clip, then goes right into a perfect beat with a harp or something liket that. It's perfect. Another one with a good beat would be \\"The Set-Up\\". With the opening, you feel like you're in a helicopter not too far above Queensbridge (where Nas hails from) watching the story that you visualize from Nas's perfect flow of lyrics. But enough about that...<br />Now onto the lyrics. Have you ever heard anything that flows better than these? Rarely. And this album deserves more credit for them. \\"Shootouts\\", \\"The Set-Up, \\"The Message\\", \\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"Watch Dem N****z\\", \\"Take It In Blood\\", \\"Live N***a Rap\\" (featuring Mobb Depp), *oh to hell with it* the whole album will blow your mind!!! Theyare less creative then \\"Illmatic\\", but it seems to go together better by only a tiny bit. <br />That's it. I've said just about enough now. Please go out there and get this album. If you are the one who idolizes bland, boring rappers like newer Ja Rule, Master P, Big Tymers, Nelly or any of that other garbage, I think you are best off staying away form this \\"real\\" gangsta rap album that is a complete masterpiece. If you are just getting into Nas, you might want to listen to Illmatic first. I see Nas's albums as conceptual. They tell a big, long story about his exploits. Enjoy! peace....<br />Standouts: \\"The Message\\", \\"I Gave You Power\\", \\"Watch Dem N****z\\", \\"Take It In Blood\\", \\"Affirmative Action\\" (with the entire Firm (AZ, now-rival Cormega (whose verse was taken out on the edited verion of this song on the \\"From Illmatic From Stillmatic\\" remix EP), and Foxy Brown), \\"The Set-Up\\", \\"Shootouts\\", \\"Live N***a Rap\\", and the hit single \\"If I Ruled The The World (Imagine That)\\".
0871137380|5.0|I couldn't wait to ride into work in the morning so I could continue to read this amazing story. I ride the subway every day and that is the only time I read. I enjoyed every moment of this story. Every high school student should be made to read this book because it is more than just a story, it is a moment in time that should never be forgotten.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|Can't wait to see this one, I have the VHS tape, but it has always had horrendous audio.  I see other people have had the same problem.  I hope the DVD has good audio.<br /><br />This is probably my favorite PF concert video, but I didn't care for the backup singers on \\"Great Gig In The Sky\\".  I think the ones that were on the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour did a much better job.  That's really my only downside to the Pulse video.
B000021XS0|5.0|I thought long and hard about creating a review for this album, with the goal of fully doing the genius of the record justice. I came to the conclusion that this was impossible, except if I analysed the 80 minute symphony literally note by note. What Dream Theater have achieved here is little short of breathtaking: a composition on a par with most classical composers, a truly grounbreaking, masterful concept album. Essentially, the album concerns the story of a contemporary man and how he is haunted by the unsolved murder of a young girl, back in 1928. The tale is long, complex and rewarding, especially so when listening to the album straight through, which is the course of action I would recommend. Snatches of ragtime piano, jazz, traditional rock, indian flavour, gospel choir and melodic vocal harmony are all subtely weaved into the album's fabric, creating a unique and inspired sound. Add to this the stunningly clever touches of the original 'Metropolis Part 1' (from an earlier album, it could almost be a kind of mythological or historical paradigm for this story) sprinkled throughout the work and one can only marvel at this level of intelligence and cunning from such a band.<br />Rarely do bands strive to create a masterpiece and succeed, but Dream Theatre do manage this feat. While 1994's 'Awake' was a stunning album in its own right, this album retains much of the heavy dynamics and intricate structure that precipitated that success, and twists it into what could amount to a single one hour plus song that surpasses anything before it.<br />To conclude, all I can find to say is that rock music, indeed any music, rarely gets better than this.<br />Three hundred and forty six thousand stars.
B000065V9Y|5.0|1992's \\"US\\" is truly a \\"from the heart\\" body of music from Peter Gabriel, his most personal album to date. He recorded \\"US\\" during a time when his 15-year marriage to his wife Jill had recently broken up, and a following relationship with actress Rosanna Arquette had also dissolved, so Peter certainly had a lot of personal, romantic demons to exorcise from his system, which he did with this album. Gabriel totally wears his heart on his sleeve with these songs, which may have irked some listeners, but not me. \\"US\\" is a Peter Gabriel album that's very close to my heart, because I can certainly relate to what he's singing about on it. Like Peter, I love to be loved, too.Gabriel explores many aspects of love & relationships on \\"US\\": lack of communication (\\"Come Talk To Me\\"), the desire for love in one's life (\\"Love To Be Loved\\"), relationships between men & women (\\"Blood Of Eden\\"), sexuality (\\"Steam\\"), loneliness (\\"Washing Of The Water\\"), emotional pain (\\"Digging In The Dirt\\"), and seeing someone's inner beauty beyond their physical appearance (\\"Kiss That Frog\\"). Gabriel explores these subjects honestly & beautifully, and not without moments of playfulness along the way, too (as the upbeat numbers \\"Steam\\" & \\"Kiss That Frog\\" clearly show). As always, Gabriel's singing, songwriting, and playing throughout are extraordinary. He also gets great help from the likes of Sinead O'Connor, Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones, William Orbit, and Gabriel's band regulars Tony Levin on bass, guitarist David Rhodes, violinist Shankar, and drummer Manu Katche, as well as a few holdover players from Gabriel's \\"Passion\\" album, like Doudou N'Diaye Rose & Hossam Ramzy. And \\"US\\" has definitely benefitted greatly from the new remastering job done on it, as the album has a much more spacious sound to it now than it did on the original version.When I listen to \\"US,\\" I don't hear anything excessive or \\"overwrought\\" on it. What I hear is a very gifted man opening his heart to his listeners in a verybold, personal way that he had never done before, and God bless him for it. Peter Gabriel's \\"US\\" is a very special album.

B00006G8K0|5.0|I have been a Christopher Lee fan for about 45 years, and this is the movie that did it.  I was 12 years old when I went to see it and, once he made his first appearance with blood, fangs, etc., I spent much of the rest of the film with my eyes covered.  Then, when it ended, I went back to the ticket window and purchased another ticket.  This time, forewarned, I watched the whole thing.  I had never seen a horror film like it and, as far as I'm concerned, it set the standard for all horror-genre films to come after it.  From the realism of the make-up to the lavishness of the sets, Hammer was in a category of its own.  I have owned the VHS for many years, and have waited and waited for the DVD.  Like the header to this review says, \\"IT'S ABOUT TIME!\\"
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is the best CD I've gotten in the last 10 years. It cracks open the gates of heaven and gets right to the heart of the universe. The more I listen to it the more I fall under it's spell. If you like Moody introspective music, Heavily layered affairs which relax your body while giving flight to your soul, this album is for you. Pink Floyd, NEU!, Prog- Rock it all leads up to this moment. Victory rose indead.
B0000640VO|3.0|My theory is that people who buy DVDs and VHSes have already seen what is on the medium and have made their own decisions about the story itself.<br />If you did not like the movie, you're not likely to buy it. If you have not seen it, you're more likely to rent it for three bucks than buy it. Yes?<br />So, here is a review of the *DVD*. It is not good. In the commentary by the director, he even admits that he pushed the color too far to green and said he was not sure it worked. It is annoyingly green. There are things that are green that should not be green. If you have ever been to Paris, you know that the walls of the Metro are beige and not green.<br />The movie is adorable. Tatou is adorable. The characters are cute and quirky. The added footage, interviews and commentary are very good. The director's chatter over the film is very French, &quot;Zees is my favorite scene....well, zees is my favorite scene...no, really zees is my absolute favorite scene, more zan zee others!&quot; The techical info is great. The peek into the ordered mind of the director is very edifying (if you want a director, hire this guy. He doesn't waste film. He plans it out ahead in great detail.)<br />But the movie itself is just too darned green. I hope this is fixed in any future releases.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD VERY VERY much. Monster Inc. is much mroe than just a cartoon, it is a cartoon with a soul. A soul that convey a message of forbearance, openness, and friendship (the last few seconds of the film is classic cinema). Unlike many corny animated films, this one strikes a chord for both kids and adults alike. When I think of Toy Story and I see Monsters Inc., I cannot believe how far animators have come in both storylines and visuals. Not being much of a fan of kid flicks, I nonetheless gave this movie a try because of all the positive vibes surrounding it - and I am glad I did.
B000005RXH|4.0|This album was definitely the beginning of the Supertramp sound that we've become so familiar with. Even though Rick Davies was there for the self-titled first LP, he was kind of pushed to the back. Here Davies has his coming-out party, and makes his presence known through his awesome keyboard work and his deep, heavy R&B vocals, both of which have become staples in the band's canon. Meanwhile Roger Hodgson's music still sounds indicative of the first album (Note the Yes-style flutes from much of the first album's music return for \\"Travelled\\"). It sort of sounds as if the early and the latter-day Supertramps are passing each other through a time portal. It would take another record for Hodgson and Davies' songs to mesh together more brilliantly than they do here, but in the meantime what you're getting is just a very interesting mixed bag of different styles. Other than Rick and Roger's songs is a very curious rocker titled \\"Potter\\" sung by one of the other guys (probably Dave Winthrop since he's listed as a vocalist). The other highlights for me are Hodgson's \\"Rosie Had Everything Planned\\", and Davies' \\"Remember\\" (which features a blisteringly distorted Fender Rhodes) and \\"Forever\\", all 3 of which round out the first half of the CD.
B000068CNX|5.0|Finally, they've released it. Now I'm good for another couple months. The first DVD season was great and I think I watched it in about a week and this set is just as good. Though it has taken me longer to watch I think that season 2 of Friends showed the media and all of us that this show was destined for great things. The first season was great and set the ground work for a wonderful and entertaining show, but it was season 2 that had to come back from that success and prove that it wasn't a fluke. Not an easy task, but done beautifully. If you love Friends you'll want to own this set and if you don't like the show... what's the matter with you?
B00005JKLZ|4.0|The Time Machine caught a lot of flack from critics, most of them finding it a silly, needless remake of a sci-fi classic.  And while I agree with some of their complaints, by the end, The TIme Machine successfully (though certainly not completely) won me over with its mix of awe-inspiring sci-fi and tense adventure.<br />Guy Pearce stars as Alexander Hartdegen, a mathematics professor in the late 19th century who's just about to propose to his beautiful fiancee (Sienna Gullory).  But on the night, he proposes to her, she's shot and killed by a mugger.  Distraught, Hartdegen spends the next four years building a time machine so he can return to the very night she died.  But when he does go back in time, the results are the same.  She survives the mugger, but is killed in an even more horrific manner.<br />Grief-stricken once again, Hartdegen comes to the conclusion she will always die no matter how he tries to save her.  Not knowing why, he believes the answer is in the future, which ultimately propels him 800,000 years to the future, where technology no longer exists and humanity's fate is more terrifying than Hartedgen could have imagined.<br />There's a lot to like in The Time Machine.  Despite a somewhat stilted beginning that belongs more in a romantic comedy, once the time traveling begins, the film only engages more and more momentum as it moves along.  The subplots that are added here and there (most particularly how the moon was destroyed) are fascinating, each one capable of making another film entirely out of such ideas.  <br />And it seems there lies the major problem.  The film is extremely rushed.  In what it should have been an intriguing, tense, and perhaps somewhat leisurely paced adventure turns out to be a short (albeit fast-paced) 96-minute ride.  Director Simon Wells should have spent a bit more time exploring each of the future worlds Hartdegen visited, rather than simply giving us brief teases. <br />The film has other problems, much of it pertaining to logic (and not logic applied to time travel, which would be pretty lame to complain about, since it would make the entire notion impossible).  I'd rather not give anything away, so I'll give a spoiler warning here.  There's a scene where Hartdegen meets the head Morlock (the people living underground), played by Jeremy Irons.  This morlock happens to be telepathic, but Hartdegen manages to trick him anyway.  Then there's the finale, which somehow features Hartdegen and his female companion climbing up a rather tall cliff in a matter of seconds, when it really would have taken at least half-an-hour to do so.<br />But there are enough winning elements to make this a successful film.  As far as science fiction goes, The Time Machine is occasionally awe-inspiring, particularly in two amazing time traveling sequences that showcase eye-popping special effects as the world quickly changes around Hartdegen as he views, like us, with a transfixed fascination.  <br />Though some people I know didn't quite like the film's 800,000 year jump in the future, it made for quite a few standout scenes (particularly Pearce's first sight of the Eloi village and later on, his conversation with Irons' character).  The film also boasts some energetic action sequences, which are actually quite tense and well-directed, especially the morlock hunt (a sequence that would probably frighten younger children).  There's a particularly exhilarating scene where Hartdegen tries to fight a huge morlock single-handedly, and is speedily chased by the creature through the forest and up a wooden tower. <br />As far as performances go, Guy Pearce is quite good as Hartdegen, delivering yet again another memorable turn.  Pearce makes this character convincing as both a nerdy scientist and as a physically-capable action hero, no small feat there.  Samantha Mumba makes little impression as Pearce's sort-of love interest, coming across a little flat.  Admittedly, her good figure kind of took my attention from her acting for a few moments.  Jeremy Irons is a standout as the uber-morlock, completely creepy and somehow both over-the-top and restrained at the same time.<br />It's unfortunate The Time Machine isn't all it could have been (these days, that seems to apply to most big-budget studio films), but it's nice to see an inspired and spirited sci-fi adventure that's entertaining.  I like good science fiction, and if you're willing to accept some of this film's flaws, you'll probably enjoy this film, too.<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****

B00006AFUR|5.0|As I was riding down the road in my Honda Civic, my sister's boyfriend, who rests at the comfortable age of 32, says to me &quot;You have to hear this band. Its got Jared Leto in it from My So-Called Life. I never knew he could sing like this.&quot; Immediately I was hooked. From the opening crescendo in &quot;Capricorn&quot; to the technically superb druming in &quot;Oblivion,&quot; 30 Seconds to Mars brings something previously unheard of before into the rock scene that always brings a smile and a healthy &quot;hell yeah&quot; from the crowd. Now ending its third-week straight as the only CD played in my vehicle, 30 Seconds to Mars continues to bring  the only euphoric time I feel in the early morning hours. If there is an album that all of humanity should purchase this year, it would be this one. Buy it, enjoy it, support good, quality rock.
B000059Z8J|2.0|I understand that many people who like this movie regard it as a classic, and they grew up on it. Heck, their kids probably grew up on it too. However for me it was quite different. I first saw this movie when I was about 8 I belive, and it didn't manage to keep my interest, and I fell asleep. I didn't remember any of it, until I decided to rent it a month or two ago on DVD. I had low expectations due to my boring memories of it and the fact that it was made in 1978. My low expectations were justified. This movie doesn't stand up to modern comic book flicks like Spider-Man and X-Men. Christopher Reeve plays Superman, who, unfortunately, is wearing tights, wich are, to put it delicately, tight. Perhaps too tight in some spots. Margot Kidder plays Lois Lane, howerver her performance comes across as \\"flakey\\". One might go as far as to use the word \\"dingbat\\". Gane Hackman play Supeman's arch nemesis, Lex Luthor. Unfortunately, I found his character to be the worst of all (second to Ned Beatty's \\"Otis\\"). It is impossible to take him seriousely. He does not come across as dangerouse, powerful, or even threataning. Hackman more or less plays him like a big joke. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the animated Superman cartoon from the 90's and the new show \\"Smallville\\" on The WB, but Hackman's Lex just doesn't work for me. Casting issues aside, the movie has a rather weak story. Basically it's written to accomidate as many special effects as possible. Rather than the special effects working for the story, the story works for the special effects. The story is very simple, obviousely geared towards kids, and when Superman uses his powers, it's almost always just to show off the special effect. The special effects were very good for '78, however that doesn't excuse how they used them for no other purpose than to \\"wow\\" the audience. Also, if this movie takes place in Metropolis, why do we constantly see new york landmarks? It's not accidental either. They intentionally flaunt images of the Statue of Liberty and the now fallen Twin Towers in our faces. Obviousely the director couldn't make up his mind where the movie takes place. In the end, you have a movie for young children, with production values up the wazoo (things like the Kryptonian counsil at the start and the earthquake climax were well done, but unfortuately wasted by the rest of the film), with a half baked story. If you can call it baked at all. This movie ranks in fourth place in the superhero flicks I've seen.<br />1. X-men, an excellent re-envisioning of the comic.<BR>2. Spider-Man, however I actually would have it tied with X-Men.<BR>3. Batman, wich I place in third, however I think it had bad casting (Micheal Keaton?) and low production values.<BR>4. Superman, wich places fourth, right below Batman. A kid's film with high production values and no story.<br />I seriousely hope that Superman's new film will turn out better than his '78 attempt. Superman was never my favorite superhero, but I think that since he launched the genre, he at least deserves a film that ranks up there with Brian Synger's X-Men and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.
0385493800|4.0|This was my first grisham book, the first part of the book moved at a quick pace but it seemed to slow down in the rest but it was a real good book. This was not my favorite of the grisham books but i would recommend any of them
0767830555|5.0|This movie is great! But, I watched the DVD and it lacked a short scene that I remember from the theatre version when I saw it there when it came out. It was when D'Nero was walking along the street looking for Jodie Foster, and the whores kept trying to get his business. He got upset with them, and said, \\"Don't you know a fag when you see one?\\", to get them off his back. <BR>It is a small scene, but is gone on the DVD even though it claims to be the original version.<BR> Oh well, nothing can be done, I guess.
B000066NW0|2.0|Well, her record is cool, except I would classify it as \\"play\\" rock- if there is such thing. I dig Losing Grip (Though it sounds distinctly familiar......), Tomorrow, Anything But Ordinary, And My Wold. There are 13 tracks in all, so I guess it would we worth buying. But as of the moment, m really SIK of Complicated already, but it sounded nice when I first heard it. Sk8er Boi (Skater Boy would have been better) [is bad]! As in, lotsa songs sound exactly like it. My Advice to you is this- Yeah sure, she's pretty and all, but you could spend your money on something better......
B00005MAM2|3.0|I grew up on the (VHS) original english translation and this new one, takes away from the overall effect and the storyline. It's Japanese in origin. Keep those flavors in. Don't Americanize it to death.<BR>The dialogue sounds so cheezy in this latest version. If you never seen this before, and want the DVD, that's fine. But if you have seen the original english translation in VHS and were looking to the same on DVD, you may be disappointed. <BR>Plus, I understand the plot maybe because I've watched it too many times. This is still the best anime of all time.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This album has the spirit and honest originality felt when the Beatles released Sgt Pepper's.  I know, I was there.  Old hippies, if rock and roll still matters to you, listen to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.
6305358567|2.0|Yes, it's historically inaccurate. Worse, it's both simplistic and hard to follow. The director manages to take a dramatic, dangerous, powerful era of history and reduce it to weird B-movie drama.<BR> <BR>I watched the movie for Cate Blanchett and Joseph Fiennes. While they are still my Elizabeth and Robert Dudley of choice, I would love to see what they would have done with a better director. There is little depth to the characterizations. Elizabeth at this era is a powerful, complex, driven young woman, but the movie never goes below the surface. The character of Robert Dudley fares even worse, often stiff and artificial. We learn little about him. With these two gifted actors, there was a real missed opportunity.<br />In place of using the real drama of history, the director uses B-movie tactics: exaggeratedly evil or grotesque characters, distasteful minglings of violence and sex. There are dwarves, cross-dressers, improbably incestuous queens (Mary Queen of Scots!) The first scene shows the villain committing a casual murder, apparently only to establish that he IS a villain. Yeah, right.<br />The Hollywood budget enabled him to pour money into sets and costumes. In other words, they are so elaborate that you never forget you are looking at: sets and costumes. Compare to Shakespeare in Love, where the sets and costumes make an effort to look real. They strike the right balance between authentic and attractive. By comparison, Elizabeth looks overblown and artificial.<br />This extends to the camera work. The MTV tactics just didn't work for me. The worst moment was when we see cuts of Elizabeth rehearsing a speech for the Lords. It looks as though he took Ms Blanchett's rehearsal takes and stuck them in the movie. And when they did get to the speech, I was confused. What's this all about? Why is it important?<br />At the end of this movie, I felt I had been on a long journey with little to show for it. The only interesting bit of insight was the idea that the image of the Virgin Mary was purposely replaced by the image of the Virgin Queen in English culture. An interesting idea.<br />If you want a historical drama that is also a good movie, try Lady Jane. In addition to a good (though teen) love story, it takes all that  theology over which Catholics and Protestants killed each other, and makes it dramatic and relevant. <br />Try also Mary Queen of Scots with Vanessa Redgrave; Elizabeth R. with Glynda Jackson; or, of course, Shakespeare in Love. If you are looking for strong women, dramatic stories, powerful villains, tense conflict, good love stories, or just fun, these movies will oblige.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Boo makes the whole movie tick.  The concept is soo cute its crazy.  Its like your parent's always told you when you were afraid of animals when you were little.  \\"Don't worry its more afraid of you than you are of it.\\"  Thats the case in this movie.  The Monsters are TERRIFIED of the children.  <br />The monsters go to work everyday at the scare factory, they call up closet doors by this crazy machine that allows them to use real doors that open from the factory to the child's bedroom.  The monsters go into the kids rooms, and attempt to scare them to collect their screams for energy.  <br />They teach the monstors to always leave the doors closed because nothing is more toxic than a child.  And then the inevitable happens, and that's the set up for the movie.  Once Boo arrives on the scene, the monster's whole world is turned upside down.  <br />Boo is wonderful, adorable and lovable.  She steals every scene and totally makes the movie.  As this is a Disney movie, there's something in it for the whole family, jokes all around.  <br />The voices are great (Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Steve Buschemi and Jennifer Tilly).  The animation is fabulous, each individual hair on Sully's body moves as the air around him moves.  The story line is classic and entertaining.  Its a must have for all, buy it today and you won't regret it.  <br />This movie teaches kids that there's nothing scary about monsters, they are just as silly as we are.  The moral of the story...Laughter is more powerful than fear any day!!  Enjoy.
B000002N25|4.0|I can't agree with the reviewer who gave this recording two stars (He should know better than to stop taking his medication). I have owned a copy of this CD since it came out and I still listen to it on a regular basis. I happen to think it's a very strong solo effort. I was a fan of the early Dire Straights material, however; I think much of their commercialized later work started to all sound the same and became boring.  So, if I hadn't heard Golden Heart at a friend's house, I may never have bought it. I'm glad I did! On this CD, Mark Knopfler showcases his versatility without straying from his distinctive style. If you're looking for a hard rocking party album, this ain't it. If you're a fan of Seattle-style head-banger R&amp;R, this ain't for you. If you want a great listening CD with R&amp;R influenced by a great mix of musical styles performed and recorded well, I highly recommend this CD. You can't go wrong.
0684803356|5.0|Despite the fact that Hemingway won the Nobel for the Old Man and the Sea, this is easily his best work.  It's combination of a gripping plot, intriguing and full characters, and simple, beautifully constructed prose is one that is rivaled by few works ever written.  The story is not a complex one that nonetheless captures the imagination of the reader.  It is one of love, heroism, convictions, responsibilities and an avalanche of vocabulary words more.  <br />His language comes off as repetitive only because it is true.  It is true to the words that we speak in our everyday usage and we can assume that that's true of the people of his times.  The short, crisp descriptions give the reader a lucidity that one wouldn't normally associate with the lack of syllables in the descriptions.  Like Shakespeare, one looks at a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph or a page and cannot discern how anyone could change a word for the better.  Everything he put down is as it should be.  Potentiality in literature has been reached and fulfilled in this particular form and variety.<br />This book ranks with the greatest of American culture, the English langauge as well as with the greatest the world has offered.  I do not hesitate to include it with the Brothers Karamozov, Don Quixote, Journey into the Night, Hamlet and the few elite literary accomplishments that humanity has produced. <br />So, yeah, it was a good book.  Read it.
B00003CXAE|4.0|Get the entire movie; this one included. The director filmed it in this aspect ratio - respect his art. <BR>
B00006AFUR|5.0|I saw 30 Seconds to Mars live on tour when they opened for puddle of mudd.  The bass was so intense that it knocked me off my feet.  I was unusually impressed with their sound and I became obsessed with their cd sampler that I had gotten.  The CD was released and I picked it up the first day it was out.  It was so a great flow to it I can listen to it all day and not get sick of it.  The songs are written beautifully and artistically and I hold a great respect for them as musicians.  Its a CD that should definately be in all &quot;rock&quot; lovers cd cases.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars are exactly what the world of rock, if not music in general needs: a swift kick... guitars that scream of droning, creamy distortion and drums that'll shake your filling loose every time this cd is turned up on the volume dial can only be surpassed by the power, majesty and naked truth revealed by the vocals in each and every song on this album. the melodies range from a quite hush to heart-stopping screams in songs like \\"buddha for mary\\" and \\"capricorn[a brand new name'\\" whereas they reveal nothing but beauty in \\"93 million miles\\" and the depressingly beautiful \\"oblivion\\". 30 seconds to mars' self-titled debut is hauntingly magical and should not be dismissed for anything less.
B000066AXC|4.0|I was interested in the story because John Nash is from West Virginia and wanted to learn more about him because I had never heard of him before the movie buzz about this film.<BR>I had no real expectations of the film before watching it.<BR>Masterfully directed.  The plot twist is unsuspected and you are not sure what is real and what is not.<BR>Very touching.  Cried a few times.  The true hero of the story is Alicia.  <BR>Not sure how accurate the film is.  If any of it is true it is still a remarkable story.  Hope to hear more about Mr. Nash and his family.
0385503954|5.0|I bought Atonement for my dad last Father's Day, because it had been relentlessly recommended to me on this very website, and it seemed to have an interesting enough story. I actually avoided reading it myself, wary of the huge amount of hype that surrounded it (it's difficult for me to appreciate good, solid novels once they've been touted in the press as &quot;masterpieces&quot;). <br />I picked it up last Sunday, after my step-mother told me that I reminded her of Briony. Having just finished it, I'm a little offended, and a little proud that my step-mother would see similarities between Briony and me. My overwhelming feeling, however, is complete and utter amazement. Atonement is the most graceful, carefully constructed and emotionally satisfying book that I've read since Lolita. McEwan writes so masterfully and elegantly about art's relationship to the world, managing to make his illustration somewhat subtle in what would seem like an obvious parallel to the book's plot. Atonement lives up to its hype, and deserved the Booker, much more so than Amsterdam (which is worth picking up, but certainly no Atonement).
B0000013G9|5.0|With respect to the Spice Girls, no girl group epitomized TRUE girl power better than TLC on this, their finest album.  \\"CrazySexyCool\\" is a stick of hip-hop/r&b dynamite that explodes with energy, attitude, and sass.  T-Boz croons through the Dallas Austin-produced \\"Creep,\\" a soundtrack to lovers who sneak on the DL; the ladies borrow lyrics from the O'Jays on the slammin' \\"Case of the Fake People,\\" and they cruise into steamy territory on Babyface's \\"Red Light Special.\\"  They also do a note-for-note cover of Prince's \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend.\\"  Their cover won't make anyone forget about the original version, but they still pull it off well.  But the album's crowning moment is their signature No. 1 hit \\"Waterfalls.\\"  Hearing this album gave me a tinge of sadness now that Lisa Lopes is no longer with us, but her energetic spirit is very much alive on this record.  \\"CrazySexyCool\\" is one of the best albums of the 1990s, and it gets an A- in my school of music.
B0000640VO|5.0|I've never been a fan of the so-called \\"feel-good\\" movie--always melodramatic, sappy, and with no artistic appeal.  That is what makes this film so special: it leaves you in a happy, skippy mood without being sappy or melodramatic, and it has more artistic appeal than any other popular film that was out this past year.  In fact, Amélie is one of the freshest, most charming films I have seen in quite a while ... <br />The film goes on at a zippy pace all the way through--with creative sound, camera and digital techniques at every turn, you're never bored.  I usually hate voice-over narration, but here it works so well because it is so bizarre and quirky and so in tune with the character of the film.  Audrey Tautou makes a perfect Amélie, with her large, impish eyes and outward-curling hair.  There are fun, quirky characters in this film, including a hypochondriac tobacco seller, a clerk at a porno store obsessed with collecting the torn and rejected pictures from underneath photo booths, and a frail man who every year makes a copy of the same Renoir painting.  The music is hard to get out of your head, and just as delightful as every other elemnt of the film.  Some events are equally bizarre, including child Amélie's suicidal goldfish and a travelling gnome.<br />If you're looking for art, quirkiness and delight, you've got the perfect film here.<br />My only complaints have to do with the subtitling of this film.  Like other reviewers have stated, the subtitles are sometimes highly condensed, inaccurate, or even wrong.  Also, why do I have the option of watching this film subtitled in English and Spanish, or even without subtitles, but--no French subtitles???  These are but small quibbles, however, and I doubt they will mean much to the average non-French speaker.
B000002H70|5.0|Following the hook-heavy pop of \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me,\\" you'd think Robert Smith and Co. would return with a radio-friendly album of Top 40 blandness.  Nah, think again.  On 1989's masterful \\"Disintegration,\\" the Cure dig deep into their roots and release an album that's almost as moody and dark as their \\"Pornography\\" CD.  This recording is a single disc, but it feels like a double album, with many of the tracks clocking in at least five minutes.  We have Mr. Smith getting over a breakup in the awesome \\"Pictures of You,\\" he shines in the superb \\"Lullabye,\\" and he brilliantly closes the album in the heartbreaking \\"Untitled.\\"  But my favorite track is the slow-moving and haunting 9-minute \\"The Same Deep Water as You,\\" which is among the Cure's finest.  Like much of the record, the song slowly grows and builds on you, revealing layer after layer of detail.  And, of course, there's the hit \\"Lovesong,\\" but it's the only upbeat track in an otherwise gloomy record.  Of all the albums by the Cure, \\"Disintegration\\" is my favorite, for it stands as a haunting masterpiece that holds up even after all these years.
B000000OSO|4.0|1993, the music world as we knew was changed forever by a musical revolution that invaded from Seattle. Grunge was all over the place and  the face of music was different than what AEROSMITH was used to.  GET A GRIP was released at this point in time and its resulting success proved that no matter what the musical climate maybe, AEROSMITH will still continue to rock. While not as raw as their earlier efforts, this album is still full of balls to the walls rockin' songs that should be played loud. EAT THE RICH, GET A GRIP, FEVER, LIVIN ON THE EDGE are just rockin songs that show the band still has the drive and energy to just rock. CRYIN, AMAZING, and CRAZY slow the tempo down abit but the album does not lose its momentum. This album has went on to sell like 12 million copies or something like that and I dont think many people out of that number are disappointed. This is a solid slab of rock and I think any music fan will enjoy this.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Most of the other reviewers have covered all the beauty of this, from the fact that EVERY song packs a wallop (something that can't even be said of \\"Exile..\\").  \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" just might be the most infectious song I have ever heard.  No matter what I am doing when I hear it, I have to bounce like a pogo stick!!  I can imagine if I played this song in my sleep, the bed would be bouncing!!  It was used to great effect in \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\" (John Cusack is obviously a Clash junkie).  Some of the lesser known songs are my favorite ones, such as \\"The Card Cheat\\" (Phil Spector would be proud) and \\"Death or Glory.\\"  The lyrics are also a treat to have with this remastered edition, since The Clash have always been a little tough for us Americans to understand.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Reign in Blood stands out as one of the best and most agressive trash-metal albums ever, no doubt about it. Slayers attack is unrelenting on Reign in Blood. Even if it is short, it is sufficient to get the adrenaline rolling.<BR>The album starts out with the notorious Angel of Death and continues through a nighmare, hellish landscape untill the final breath. There is nothing soft or melodic about the album, it is an attack of pure agressive, raw energy through the whole of the album.<BR>The album is generaly seen as the finest hour, not only of Slayer, but of trash metal as a whole. I have to agree, this is one of the most undisputed agressive album of the 1980's.<br />This was also the album that made Slayer into the gods of trash-metal, despite (or maybe because?) the controversy of songs like Angel of Death, and rumors of nazi and satanist sympathies, the album mannaged to sell very well. <BR>This album is a classic, a MUST in every metal collection. It is as simple as that.
0790733226|5.0|For those who actually like to be ENGAGED when we watch movies, summertime is usually the nadir of the year.  Lavish special effects complemented by treacly dialogue make me usually stay home when the latest &quot;blockbuster&quot; is released.  However, in the summer of 1997, this baby came along and was a breath of fresh air.  Actually having a movie get people to think about the meaning of life and their own existence is a fairly daunting task for a movie, but this one succeeds smashingly.  Having used it in my classes, I can attest that these questions can cut across ages and get down to the heart of us all.  It was also nice that this movie was fairly successful, making close to 100 million.  Like the best movies, repeated viewings just strengthen the message within.
B000009QPK|5.0|On Decade of Agression Slayer mannages to express the same agressive and dark onslaught as they have done on their studio albums. The attack starts with Hell Awaits and continues into The Anti-Christ.(As for those who accuse Slayer of satanism, listen Araya's plead to the audience to \\"help each other out\\", not exactly a satanist thing to do).<BR>The album is wellproduced, and does not have the flaw of overdubbed fancheers like so many other metal albums. Some of the songs got a different sound from what they sounded like on the albums, but this is not neccesarily a bad thing. If anything, I would say it is a bonus to hear.<BR>The musicianship is unflawed, Hanneman and King work their guitars with great skill, through the trademark chaotic Slayer guitar-solos. And Dave Lombardo...his skill with the drums is, in my opinion, unequalled. It is a wonder that it was not him that was chosen as the Worlds Best Drummer. In my opinion he is one of the best, if not THE best. His skill really shows on this livealbum, a great skill of improvisation, and nobody can do that double drum-kick like him.<BR>The double cd  contain some of Slayers all-time classics, including the notorious Angel of Death. The only track I really miss is Skeletons of Society (from Seasons in the Abyss), but that is the only thing I can think of. <BR>As live metal albums go, this is a definitive must in any metal-collection.
6302814359|4.0|First of all....I like this movie...Like I said..It should've been part one. What's stoopid about it is that they took characters who were killed off in part one and put them in this one.That's what I don't get...But if anything...I hope they make a dvd version...
B00004IC9G|4.0|Manowars debut Battle Hymns is a very promising start. Even if it is not as well done as some of their later albums it is pretty damn' good. <br />The power that Manowar is so famous for is there through the whole album. The album is somewhat uneven, but it does contain some very memorable and classic tunes like the title track, Dark Avenger and the stunning show-off bas solo Williams Tale by Joey DeMaio. Manowar has always been a band of incredible craftmanship, there is no doubt in my mind that DeMaio is one of the premier metal-bassplayers in the world, and Adams vocal is superb, almost equal to Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden.<BR>This album seemed to lay the plot for the rest of their albums. Most songs contain strong elements of war, battle and glory. For some people it is too much, and granted: Manowar IS over the top...but that is why we love them. Their no nonsense and attitude is undisputed.
B0000009SY|5.0|Some people like Frank Zappa for his amazing guitar work, some like him for his funny songs.  I'm in the second group of people.  When this album came out, it was his best work since \\"Apostrophe\\", and the last really great work of his career.  There were other high moments, but nothing as complete as this one.  <br />I'm talking mostly about Act 1.  The whole concept was great, with a government censoring everything, including music.  While we probably aren't going to see this in the good 'ol USA, may I remind the audience of something called the Taliban that instituted this not to long ago?  Or that much of the Middle East has very strong censoring going on, as well as a few Commie countries?  Ol' Frank knew what he was talking about.  <br />The songs on Act 1 are magnificent.  From the narration of the character The Central Scrutinizer, we get into the title song.  Yes, he's goofing on it, but allow me to detect pride in singing about his early rock and roll days.  Then we get \\"Catholic Girls\\", which makes a nice bookend to \\"Jewish Princess\\" from the \\"Shiek Yerbouti\\" album.  They're equally funny.  \\"Crew Slut\\" gives the band a good workout on some harmonica blues.  \\"Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?\\" is a flat out hilarious number on the complexities of acquiring clap.  <br />Acts II and III have their moments but they are not as strong as the first part.  There are a few gems here, and some very nice guitar work.  But overall, the hits are more than the misses, and yes, I really miss the guy.
0790729652|5.0|What can I say about 'Batman'? Tim Burton has done his usual wonderful job. The thing about this Batman is the creativity. Batman's outfit (rubber and latex) is one of a kind. Ever since its appearance in this movie, other Batman suits have followed in line. Even the upcoming 'Birds of Prey' t.v. show to air on WB has Batman in the rubber. Micheal Keaton as Batman is suprising if you are familiar with him before this movie. Keaton however does a wonderful job of displaying a duel identity. His Batman is so different from his Bruce Wayne. Jack Nicholson as the Joker is wonderful. I am very happy to inform that The Joker's signia hand buzzer and acid flower are in the movie. Very exciting to see him shoot acid at Kim Basinger. To put things over the top, Batman did win an Acadamy Award for Best Art Direction. Not that many people know that. All in all, get Batman.
B00003CXXR|3.0|I was disappointed the first time I saw this picture.  But that was at a drive in, where the picture quality was not great.  Plus the plot was paper thin:  Airplane crashes into dinosaur island, people try to get off dinosaur island.  <br />But after getting it on video, I changed my mind a bit.  Yes, the plot is still just a vehicle for showing off the special effects. And they brought in some of the actors from the original, who must have been it strictly for the paycheck, as a way to keep the audience interested.  And I'm sure Steven Spielberg's role as producer consisted of a few long-distance phone book.  <br />But I have to admit, it did hook me.  And I even like it better than the Part II.  The reason is that I didn't care for many of the characters in Part II.  Out of all the people to bring over from Part 1, Malcom was one of the least I was interested in.  so while they were in it for the paycheck, I at least had a bit of care left from Part 1.<br />But center stage has to be kept for the effects themselves.  You not only get a lot more minutes than the first film, but there has been an improvement in the quality.  When we see the pteradactyl coming out of the fog for the first time, it's truly creepy.  And it's also a film that keeps the kids interested.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The 30 Seconds to Mars cd, is like NO OTHER!! They are different and sound GREAT! I have never heard anyone like them, and i LOVE that!! The music, and the background noises and such are soo unique!! i would reccomend this to EVERYONE!
0441003257|5.0|Anyone with a love of mythology and a good sacreligious sense of humor (like Catholic-School Nuns)will really enjoy this book.  Two of the most creative fantasy writers from the last decade team-up to tell this tale that will keep you laughing until the Second Coming.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|First off. It is not a documentary film. The film gives proper credit to the real heros that did capture the enigma machine at the end of the film.<br />It is a good movie. It is a fantasy if you will. Just like Top Gun was not a documentary, don't look at U-571 as one either.<br />That said. This is one of my favorite films. The special effects were very good (couple of visual images - surface ship blowing up - not so good). Very good use of models, full size replicas in the ocean. Outstanding detail to the interior of the u-boats, outstanding costumes.<br />The pace of the film, the suspense is just right. I'm a fan of submarine/u-boat movies.  This ranks up there with Das Boat, Hunt for Red October, and Crimson Tide.<br />It is a no-nonsense action film. There is very, very little fluff. Unlike films like Top Gun (which I can watch in 25 minuts after FF by the chick flick stuff), it is all action.<br />Every time I watch it, I catch something new I didn't see or understand before.<br />The film does justice to the heros of WWII. All of them.
B00006AFUR|5.0|As a life long fan of rock/metal, I have heard so many copycat bands it is actually pathetic.  But just as you begin to accept the fact that there is nothing fresh out there and you are stuck with rap metal(gag) something happens.  A laser beam bursts through the black fog and out of it emerges a new creation.  This salvation comes in the form of .30 Seconds to Mars.  For lack of a better word, this album is brilliant.  I call this album  SPACE METAL.  Musically it is amazing, beautiful, orchestrated.  Vocally, I haven't heard a voice THAT breathtaking since Maynard Keenan of TOOL.  The album evokes visuals, a story in my head.  When I play this CD, I see a movie of a war torn planet on the verge of dying, under attack from some unknown assailant - be it natural or supernatural.  A few rebels break free and embark on a journey to a new world to start a new life...a new civilization. Few bands write to the degree that you are playing a movie in your head.  Do yourself a favor and buy this album.  JOIN IN THE FIGHT!!!  Amazing...simply amazing.
B000002UAO|5.0|One of my biggest regrets of being born six months after The Beatles broke up was that I couldn't experience the impact of listening to this album for the first time back in 65(even if it was the truncated US version).Rubber Soul,like Bringing It Back Home and later Pet Sounds redefined the album format as more than a hits and filler fodder.Every song,even if you may not like it,stands out and sticks in your head.Not only was the songwriting at its sharpest,but the recording studio was becoming an integral part as musical experimentation ascented the songs to heights unimaginable in pop music.The introduction of the sitar(on Norwiegian Wood),fuzz bass(Think For Youself), &amp; upperneck capoed acoustic guitars(Michelle,Girl) made the music a quantum leap beyond anything else at the time.John Lennon is the real star here with not only Norwiegian Wood,but also The Word,Nowhere Man,Girl,Run For Your Life(which he later discarded as a throwaway),and his most beautiful Beatle composition In My Life.Paul McCartney was no slouch bringing in Drive My Car,You Won't See Me and of course the sappy,yet beautiful Michelle.If I Needed Someone shows George Harrison's growth as a fine composer.Any act on the same level as The Beatles would've ran their winning formula into the ground.But instead of resting on their laurels,they took their music,along with the whole of pop music to a whole new level.And their best was still ahead of them.
B00006AFUR|4.0|30 Seconds to Mars is good, very good. In fact the only bad thing I could say about them, is that their lyrics sometimes could use some work. &quot;Had a thing for astronaughts&quot; just dosen't have that ring to it. But, the sound is awsome, and on a scale of one to ten for originality I would give them a ten. The album is definately worth buying and I look forward to their next album.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Though The Stones recording were well-revered at the time,Beggars Banquet is where this group shows they can reach the next level of musical progression.Coming after the ill concieved,yet quirkily brilliant psychedelic foray Their Satanic Majesties Request,they come out with BB which brings them back in touch with their blues roots as well as open new doors.Sympathy For The Devil and Street Fighting Man must of been a shock to the ears of ill prepared listeners who soaked up the non album preview single Jumping Jack Flash.But its also songs like No Expectations,Jigsaw Puzzle,Stray Cat Blues & Salt Of The Earth that fortifies this albums classic stature.Factory Girl,Prodigal Son and Parachute Woman makes you wish they'd return to this genre today instead of using their music to promote their concerts.At the time when most groups were spewing out SGT Pepper rip-offs or even falling apart(Cream and even The Beatles themselves)The Rolling Stones were ready to take the mantle,and Beggars Banquet was their first victory.
B00005YXZH|4.0|My first introduction to Wilco was a concert about a month ago, and I immediately ran out and grabbed &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; despite recommendations to look into earlier albums (YHF was on sale... and well... I'm not exactly loaded). <BR>This is really a brilliantly constructed album and shows clearly the effort and sweat and blood that went into the production of these recordings.  The songwriting is beautiful and interesting, the riffs are catchy, the beats are fantastic and the noise is incredible.  And even still, it's a completely accessable album.<BR>Wilco has really mastered the sound of feedback and noise.  Rather than sounding like a group of guys banging at various instruments the bits of noise, the tweeks and twirps that appear on this album sound completely intentional and controlled, without taking away the chance or accident aspect that is necessary for good feedback and noise.<BR>&quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; for me really sums up the mastery Wilco has over what they do.  It's an exhibit of great song writing, and beautiful lyrics, along with controlled yet unpredictable noises and drones throughout the song.  They hook you effortlessly with a four note riff that is repeated throughout the song, they swoon you with heartwrenching lyrics, then take you to the noise.  It pulls you waiting to hear that riff again, just waiting because you KNOW it's coming and they continue with drones and twangs and small bits of piano, and then bring you to a catharsis with the riff you're waiting for, which really maximizes the value of the simple set of four notes.<BR>This mastery they exhibit all through the album is best defined by restraint.  When I hear a beautiful song like &quot;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart&quot; another band might turn it up a serious notch at the end, or scream the last line, or repeat the quasi-chorus &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot; but Wilco really only presents what's absolutely necessary to a good song.  Andyou aren't left feeling like you want the chorus again, or the bar raised for the last line because they do such a good job at what's already there, you need nothing more.  This technique in their song structure really places them in a quasi-ambient stage at some points during the album.  But I'm reluctant to call them musical minimalists, rather they could be called musical economists.  <BR>This album really has me hooked and I fully intend to check out their earlier work as well.
B000002UAR|5.0|SGT Pepper may be the most influential album of all time to many,but Revolver is without a doubt the greatest Beatle album ever.This was their last album as a group before Paul McCartney assumed the role of driving force(he was the brains behind Pepper,MMT and the Get Back project).Where Rubber Soul was their folk-rock album,Revolver was their acid rock foray.John Lennon led the pack with such chemecally induced classics as And Your Bird Can Sing,She Said She Said,Dr Robert,I'm Only Sleeping, and of course Tomorrow Never Knows.They somehow meld comfortably with Paul McCartney's equally classic tunes including Eleanor Rigby,Here There Everywhere,Good Day Sunshine,For No One,Got To Get You Into My Life as well as Ringo's spot Yellow Submarine.George Harrison's growth as a songwriter cumulates on not only the sharp rocker Taxman but on his first foray into indian music(Love You To).1966 would also see the end of the group as a touring band as the experiments of their latter albums made it impossible to play their new music onstage.While record buyer were in awe of Revolver's complexity,concert audiences had to make do with 1963-1965 era songs on rinky-dink Vox amps.So while Revolver helped close a chapter of one era,it also opened a new one as well.
B00006AFUR|4.0|This new cd by 30 Seconds to Mars is one of the best cd's to come out this year.  It's pure rock, but isn't that what we all need?  Well, I believe it is, and I think that you should check out this cd.  Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Without a doubt one of the absolute best Disney movies ever released.  Plus, they have gotten on board about releasing juiced-up DVDs.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I miss the sound of &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; and &quot;Peace Sells&quot;, but megadeth is gotta move on. Countdown is one of the finest metal albums out there, by far better than Metallica's self-titled. Songs like &quot;Skin Of My Teeth,&quot; &quot;Psychotron,&quot; and specially the last track prove that Megadeth still rocks hard. The over production on the album though kills a little the aggresion. If you don't believe this tunes are as good as RIP or PS... Listen to them live and you'll be convinced. Highlight: The tittle track, it may not be that heavy but the melody in the song is one of the bests ever in this genre.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is the most authentic adaptation of Jane Austen's wonderful book. There is much more realism as far as daily life and class issues than in a movie that is more glammed up like Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. They are both great to watch, but this one is for the more sophisticated viewer rather than the one who doesn't know or care who Jane Austen is. People complain that Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds are not &quot;beautiful&quot; enough but that isn't the point (and they are very appealing in anycase-just not a Kate Winslet or Colin Firth). The point is, they depict the tension and longing so well that even if you are romantically inept you should feel this anticipation and desire. And actually C.Hinds is very handsome and strong and Root is rightly understated but pretty. There attraction is very subtle on one level but palpable if you pay attention. As I said, one of the best J.A. adaptations as long as you aren't a simpleton or snob.
0716736241|2.0|Having muddied the waters of physical chemistry, Atkins proceeds to write this low-grade inorganic text.  This book is laughable next to the Huheey, Keiter et al text.  This text is also far below the Miessler &amp; Tarr text. <br />This book is printed in large text, in black &amp; white, with some line art.  It has no more pages than M&amp;T but is twice as thick.  Its descriptions are shoddy and the explanations lacking.<br />Do yourself a favor and pick up the Miessler and Tarr text and leave this book alone.
0767020308|5.0|Please watch THIS adaptation.Do _not_ taint your minds with the insipid version with G.P. Although she is a very lovely actress in many other movies, she is leagues behind Kate Beckinsale's &quot;Emma&quot;.  Beckinsale is Emma to perfection. And Mark Strong as Mr. Knightley is right on as well. I had this one to begin with and rented the Hollywood version with Paltrow and almost couldn't get through it. If you have the slightest regard for staying closer to the text of Jane Austen, stick with this adaptation. It is fabulous! I haven't seen Beckinsale do as well in any of her other roles, but she is amazing in this one.
B00006AW2G|5.0|My husband was one of the original 'punk'/post-punk English rock 'stars'...and ever since I have known him he has argued with all and sundry about this being the best record the Stones ever made. His drumming style... was built around Charlie's 'Monkey Man' riff; his first tattoo (waaaay back) was the Stones' tongue; his first Stones gig was with the whole family in '72; to this day, he tears up at the opening bars to 'Gimme Shelter'; his cat was called Charlie Watts; they are the only band he will even consider dancing in public to at 46. SO - he should know!
0800141660|5.0|Although some people criticize this for being too polished, it is still a brilliant movie. All the actors do an excellent job. Thompson takes some liberties with her version (Margaret is way more developed than in the Austen original) but she does a good job with it. Winslet is very pretty in her role and Thompson is a great Elinor-governs her feelings but feels things very intensely. Rickman is -as always-very proper and fits the role perfectly for the MOVIE. Keep in mind that Thompson does a lot to flesh out the male characters (to make them more appealing) than Austen did originally. But in my opinion, she does it so well that all but the most unforgiving Austen enthusiasts will love it.
B00005TT77|5.0|This cd is amazing.  I consider myself a huge beatles fan and this cd does not dissapoint.  Some of the songs mirror the original recording such as Ben Folds exceptional cover Golden Slumber.  Even my mom who was a Beatles groupie loves the cover and it's her favorite beatles song. <br />Another exceptional cut is grandaddy's cover of revolution.  This one is a slight departure from the original incorporating a stronger beat and slightly distorted guitar.<br />The covers that really surprised me were Ben Harper's cover of Strawberry Fields, and The Vines cover of I'm Only sleeping.  Ben Harper made Strawberry Fields uniquely his own and The vines did a traditional cover of I'm Only Sleeping.  Now i really don't like The vines much, but they did a darn good job.<br />All in all the songs are really well chosen and flow very well.  Even if you don't like the bands on the album, if you are a Beatles fan you must own this cd.
B000069I1H|4.0|That's how I will describe this film.  <br />Eddie Murphy was his usual loud, talkative (sometimes irritating) self which reminded me of that donkey in Shrek & that dragon-cum-lizard in Mulan. However, he provided the comic relief while Robert de Niro was his usual serious & intense character.  As a matter of fact, it would seem surreal to see De Niro goofing around, so his 'no nonsense' character was just typically him, contrary to what other viewers say.  <br />It's light... it's funny...it's a spoof of all those reality shows we see on tv.  Simply sit back & enjoy.
B000059ZT4|5.0|...and a joy.  An absolute joy.  This is the album I've been buying old Wailers re-releases to find.  By far the highest production values of any pre-Blackwell Wailers recording.  <BR>Put in on, turn it up and fall under the spell.
0316666343|5.0|This book was incredible.  I couldn't put it down.  I started reading it at our local bookstore (where it's ok to read it and not buy it as long as you buy something AKA cappucino), and I couldn't put it down.  After 2 hours of sitting in the coffee shop, I felt sort of bad for delving so deeply into a book I didn't have the money to buy, but try as I might, I could not stop myself from starting the next chapter.  Only after a few odd looks from the cashier did I finally put the book back on the shelf and leave.  I was hooked, the next days was a repeat of the first, and by chapter 13 I had to buy it.  So I bought it, and for the next few day I read a little hear and there between class and work, regretful to put it down, and eager to get home.  I just finished it.  It was the best book I believe I have ever read (and I'm a massive book worm).  Maybe it was the way that I felt like I was Susie, or maybe it was the intimate closeness to the characters, who knows.  All I know is that everyone will like this book, perhaps not LOVE it like I do, but everyone will find something in it to relate to.  My mother died when I was 17 and I'd like to believe that in her heaven, she can watch me.  Alice, I hope you're right, and Kudos for such an awesome first novel!
0446604844|5.0|A great read, full of suspence. Was sorry when I finished it!
B00005JL9B|4.0|To explain my review title the people who gave this movie a poor rating, have.  This is much more than a comment on the actions of children under pressure, it's a side-swipe at the growing gap between generations (ironic seeing as the Fukasaku fairly old himself)in modern japan.  Even more than that, it's bloody entertaining too.<br />The characters are developed just enough to care about but the more important aspects of it is that children are both the problem with the society and the ones who are punished.  The survivor is not lauded as the winner but apparently held-up as a lesson to those who have reactionary thoughts.  I say apparently as none of the current 'players' have ever heard of the lesson as Kitano calls it.  Is this because the whole thing is in fact for the personal enjoyment of the adults who are at the forefront of the teenager's revolution?<br />In post-Columbine America (and I come from a town which lost a generation of children in similar fashion), those who could watch this film and grasp just some of what the film is trying to say then it has a very positive,and actually uplifting, message.
B00000255F|5.0|Although, his previous two albums served as a notice that a huge talent was on the horizon, they hardly compared to BTR, and neither would subsequent albums by my favorite artist ever, and hey I'm only 24.<br />After listening to the album all the way through, The Boss somehow put you into the stories that he told eloquently, with a hint of heroism, desparation, wanting to escape, and somehow a sense of overcoming and winning in the end. By the end you want to be in the car w/ Mary and him to escape and win. You feel the heartache at the loss of Terry who said &quot;forever friends&quot; but hated the other guy and &quot;hated you when you went away.&quot; That minute before the guitar solo in &quot;Backstreets&quot; in my opinion is the best minute in rock and roll history. It sums up what music should be and what Bruce has meant to his fans everywhere. Music is an escape, a joy, and Born To Run accomplishes that in totality. Some say there is filler in the album, but I say every song has a place, and in a time of poor music/lyrics, I don't see another album like this ever again.
B0000640VO|4.0|I first saw this film in Sweden with Swedish subtitles.  I don't speak Swedish (there was a girl involved, I'm not that stupid).  I loved it.<br />...The movement of the camera throughout is beautiful, augmented at times by CGI ...To quote one of my lecturers at university, \\"it's like the camera is a paintbrush creating a work of art,\\" ...<br />Criticism of the film for being too cutesy on the surface seems founded but there is a dark-spot in 'Amelie's warm heart.  In her pursuit for other people's happiness the she is not adverse to causing others a little well-intentioned pain.<br />Yes, it's quirky and kitsch and girly but it's infinitly better than the manipulative, sentimental drivel coming out of Hollywood and at least proves to your girlfriend that you can read.
0380778556|2.0|I'm afraid I simply can't quite understand why this book has the reputation it does; it struck me as being little more than a pale imitation of Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\"  Both have oppressed, rather nervous women as their main characters; in both novels this woman meets an older, wealthy man who owns a mansion, and has a dangerous former wife lurking in the shadows; in both novels the mansion is burnt down . . .  But whereas Jane Eyre is a true heroine, a woman of moral courage and conviction, the protagonist of Rebecca is spineless and frightened from beginning to end.  Both she and her husband are defined repeatedly throughout the book as being deeply conventional, and horrified at anything that would appear to make them otherwise.  Seen in this light, it is Rebecca who has the strongest claim as being the heroine of the story:  Rebecca has spirit; Rebecca is deeply, profoundly rebellious against all conventionality and, in her disdain of men and their love, against the patriarchal standards of her time as well.  She emerges, to my mind at least, as a tragic character, in the classic sense:  one who rebels against her human station, and pays the price.  I'm not saying that I don't understand the appeal of \\"Rebecca\\"; most of us have a certain love of conventionality and find comfort in it; it can even be argued that conventionality is necessary to some degree to create a stable society.  It's an interesting enough theme--just not, to my mind, well handled in this particular novel.  My only satisfaction is in the knowledge that Mr and Mrs de Winter are left at the story's end (as described early on in the novel) as leading such extremely dull and frightened lives that reading the sport's column of the newspaper constitutes the highlight of their days.  Bear this in mind when you consider du Maurier's novel:  is this really what you would call a happy ending?  Rebecca does indeed exact payment of her own.  If you want to read a truly first-rate accounting of these characters, why not turn to the masterful and far more thought-provoking original model, \\"Jane Eyre\\"?  And then, for good measure, give Jean Rhys \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" a try.  These two books both deal with similar themes as \\"Rebecca,\\" are quite as entertaining, and much more challenging to the discerning reader.
068485743X|5.0|Perhaps the best endorsement I could give this book is to say I finished it cover to cover for the second time in a two month period and I still have several unread writing books sitting on the shelf.  The tone is more familiar and casual than some of the other more \\"scholarly\\" sounding books I've read, which isn't to say it is not serious just more reader friendly.<br />I recently wrote a review for Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" which is also a great book on the craft and includes some personal history.  That book made me feel as if I was hearing from an old friend.  I noted in that review that \\"First Five...\\" made me feel as if I was hearing from a friend.<br />The difference I think was the personal touch in the former, lacking in \\"The First Five Pages\\" but not altogether absent.  I'd like to see a revision with more personal anecdotes or at least more stories similar to the ones Lukeman uses to open some of his chapters.  It is interesting to hear an insiders view of back room deals or books that were once rejected but later won acclaim.  It makes the learning part easier because it adds an element of enjoyment.<br />There is plenty of information here to help the aspiring writer the format is simple: the first thing that gets a work rejected is \\"A\\", the second thing is \\"B\\", etc.  To get published a writer must eliminate \\"A\\", then eliminate \\"B\\", etc.  While it is true that the actual order of items is subjective, I am sure it is close enough and besides if something is wrong it needs to be fixed regardless of it's relative importance.<br />There are lots of examples of bad text.  I quickly skimmed these in my second reading as they are so blatantly bad.  One improvement I'd suggest in a revision would be to use more real and true to life examples.  It is bordering condescension to be told that writing something like this has problems with it:<br />\\"Let me get your eggs\\" said Mary.<br />\\"Ok\\" said John.<br />\\"Do you like salt with them?\\" asked Mary.<br />\\"Not today\\" replied John, \\"Maybe tomorrow\\".<br />Eggs are so good.  You could eat them everyday.  I bet you eat eggs.<br />White.<br />Yellow.<br />Dipping toast.<br />Yummy.<br />That was the day Mary beat John to death with a dictionary.<br />I can see this myself easy enough.  What I'd really prefer is to see actual examples of that was either published or at least sent to an agent or publisher in an otherwise decent book.<br />One other slight (at least for me) problem was the end of chapter exercises.  While I realize these weren't on the order of: \\"Take a blind man, his dog and a long board and incorporate them into a story involving a blizzard.\\" I still found them to just get in the way of my reading.<br />Perhaps this quote from Swain has tainted my thinking: \\"The man who cottons to exercises generally isn't cut out to be a fiction writer.\\"  -Techniques of The Selling Writer.<br />On the whole I strongly recommend this book, it should be on the desk of every unpublished yet serious fiction writer.

B000066F6H|2.0|If this is the future in music we are [in trouble]. With all the hype about these guys I expected something better than a cheap imitation of early Kinks or Romantics. Punk is just a code word for I cant play this equipment,but I look cool. These guys cannot play,the guitar playing is somewhere above Sid Vicious & less than the dead Mark Bolan,and he knew all of 9 chords. If you see this in a budget rack for 3 bucks,it might be worth it if you are hard up. Save your money and spend it on Coors & the twins.
0316666343|2.0|I thought this book was really depressing.  It opens with Susie's murder.  She is murdered by her neighbor and the whole focus of the book is how Susie and her family deal with her death.  The book is narrated by Susie who watches over her family and friends from heaven.  I found the book so depressing because the version that Susie has of heaven is not one that I want to go.  Her heaven is everything she ever wanted except for the fact that she can't have her life on earth.  That is of course what Susie wants the most.  She watches the lives of the people she cared about as they deal with her death and she is impotent to help them through anything.  <br />The book would have been better if Susie's body would have been found and there was some sort of closure.  The book didn't have a happy ending... you just don't know what is going to happen.
B00000BKE1|4.0|This review will somewhat lack the conviction of a die-hard maiden fan due to the fact that this is my first Maiden album but thankfully it will not draw to endless comparisons to albums I have yet to hear.  The opener be 'quick or be dead' sets the tone and is both musically and lyrically solid, following well to this 'from here to eternity'.  Now we come to my favourite 'Afraid to shoot strangers', this is an absolute classic, a fantastically poetic masterpiece, one of the best guitar solo's I've heard. A solid opening 3 is followed by a less convincing trio, 'fear is the key' is distantly forgettable and 'childhoods end' though lyrically thought provoking lacks the necessary bite, the same goes for 'wasting love'.   Next is 'the fugitive' which picks up the pace and is a solid and catchy number however I was less convinced by 'chains of misery' which I thought was slightly cheesy and lacked the required rough edge.  The poor and forgettable 'Apparition' was only saved by it's meaningful lyrics but 'Judas be my guide' got the blood flowing again .  'Weekend Warrior's is lyrically interesting but fails to keep the attention.  The grand finale 'fear of the dark' is outstanding, it had an epic feel in it's dramatic riffs which kicks into an explosive chorus, it's not hard to see why it's been covered by many others.  In my opinion it's a great album and I will be continuing my new found love affair with Maiden despite buying the so-called 'weaker album', impressive stuff indeed.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is a cracking album.  A must for any lovers of Radiohead, U2 or Stereophonics.  The British boys did it again, and just as good as their first.  Check out their website.
B00005JKG7|4.0|A dark and eerie night. A group of children sitting around a campfire. A grizzled old man telling a ghost story at the stroke of midnight. So begins John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\", an old fashioned ghost story about the dead returning from a watery grave to seek revenge against the living.<BR> The basic plot of the film concerns a group of sailors who were lured to their death when their ship crashed against the rocky coastline and sank to the bottom of the sea 100 years earlier. The ghosts return, enshrouded in a glowing fog, seeking out revenge and wreak havoc on the tiny coastal town of Antonio Bay. As horror films go, this is just an okay film. Carpenter does provide plenty of atmosphere and a couple of good jolts, but the movie does tend to stretch credibility to it's limit, such as the scene in which Adrienne Barbeau (who plays a disc jockey, stationed in a lighthouse)tells her listeners the movement of the fog STREET BY STREET! Does she have a bionic eye??<BR> The real reason to watch this DVD is the extras. In addition to \\"voice over\\" commentary by Carpenter and screenwriter Debra Hill (who makes it very clear every time she, or one of her body parts, appears on the screen), the DVD has two \\"making of\\" documentaries. (one origionally made at the time of the film's release and another made specifically for the DVD). There are also outtakes, the original trailer and TV spots included in the extras. All DVDs should provide such bonuses. So whether you're a fan of horror, ghost stories, or Jamie Lee Curtis, this is definitely worth a look.
B000059MEK|4.0|I've always had somewhat of a love-hate relationship with Daft Punk. Even though I criticize them I still own both of their releases. I think they are an overrated group, that their influence in dance music isn't as big as some people claim. In Discovery, they explore dance and pop music of the 70's and 80's. It's a mixed bag, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. They should receive credit for great recreation of a specific style: it really sounds just like the music from the era. The album is fun, it grabs you and puts you in a good mood, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good record. They fall into excesses, such as the overuse of vocoder, especially the \\"cher\\" effect which has gotten old by now. They overuse stereo phasing too. I don't consider Daft Punk to be very group producers. The production is very simplistic and amateurish, just enough to carry the music decently. Their beats are very generic, there's an excess in the use of effects, the song samples are not put together smoothly, the mixing is terrible, a total disaster, especially in \\"one more time\\" where the bass kick muddies the whole mix. Romanthony's voice should have been somewhat polished. It's put straight in the mix, sounds like coming from a cheap microphone. They need some sound production classes badly. There are many things to criticize, but in the end this glitches end up being ignored, mainly because they are able to create a good vibe, nice ear candy, even if it's far from perfect. <br />There are some highlights in the album: \\"digital love\\" is excellent, production shines and it's an excellent recreation of late 70's. \\"Face to face\\" is also nicely put together and the samples sit nicely with the vocals. \\"Superheroes\\" is fun, with a smart use of synth arpeggios. \\"Voyager\\" reminds me of early house, the bass line is excellent.<br />The album is formulaic, it has many glitches, many things to improve, but it posseses it's own charm. It works.
B000067DNC|5.0|Since I purchased season one I have been hanging out to get my hands on season two 3,4,5 and 6?? It finally arrived this week and I have been religiously watching it after work each day. Ordinarily I prefer to play on the net, or read a book rather than watch TV. However Stargate has the uncanny ability to hold my attention.<BR>The true success of this show is it's ability to successfully mix several key elements into a coheasive mix. These being humour, action, plot, suspense, and consistency. ...
B00006AFUR|4.0|30 Seconds to Mars' debut CD is one of the best I have heard in a long time, they mix awesome guitar with great special effects, which makes for a good mix with Jared's voice, I urge you all to get the CD it will for sure become one of your favorites!!
B00006GFAB|5.0|This \\"Best Of\\" is perfect for the new, younger generation of the KISS Army.  Creating a greatest hits album for a band as monumental as KISS - that's been around more than a quarter of a century, with almost 20 studio albums out and various live and solo projects, the task is a daunting one.<BR>\\"Best Of\\" has all of the essential classics.  With Deuce, Shout it out Loud, Beth, Hard Luck Woman, Calling Dr. Love, and of course the original live version of Rock &amp; Roll All Nite, this is a great beginner's guide to the world of KISS.  Not only do you hardcore rock out while you're listening to the album, you're able to gain true respect for KISS by hearing just how influential they have been on today's music scene - song after song.  Rock on!
6304698798|5.0|My review is neither professional or amateur, but I know good movies when I see them. I have seen this movie on VHS before and loved it , but on DVD we see all the vivid colors as intended in the theater. I can watch this movie and every time it never fails to amaze me with it's rough vision of the civil war days. Sergio Leone is quite possibly the best foreign filmmaker of all time. The movie's simplicity and rough style is perfect for westerns period. The movie just has great character with an unforgettable soundtrack to boot. Watch this one when you feel like watching a real western.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I swear, if it does'nt sound bubble gum, or commercial enough, most people just can't appreciate GREAT HARD ROCK when they hear it!!! I have read most of the reviews for SILVER SIDE UP, and the majority of the nay-sayers think \\"how you remind me\\" is the only good song, and the rest [are not]? If you enjoy good rock music, you would think it is about the 5th or 6th best! First of all NICKELBACK is the first band to have this great modern rock sound!!! and it kicks ... If it did'nt, you would'nt have a hundred other bands trying to sound exactly like them, such as: Default, Theory of a deadman, and the list could go on and on! This record offers up great rock material! There are 4 stand-out tracks in my opinion. \\"Never again\\", \\"Woke up this morning\\", Too bad\\", and \\"Just For\\", which by the way, sounds nothing like \\"Smells like teen spirit\\" by NIRVANA!!!! as one reviewer writes? As for NICKELBACK, SILVER SIDE UP, is the best record they have put out so far, and we can only look forward to another great record to follow this up! So if you like hard rock music in general, you should buy SILVER SIDE UP by NICKELBACK!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|The music is so powerful like in the songs Lateralus, Schism, and Parabola.  the sound is so clean and original, instrumental too.  The Cd is great from start to finish!
B00000BIBQ|3.0|&quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; does rightly deserve credit for being the first rock opera.  However, the Who got it right one year after this release with &quot;Tommy&quot;.<br />The album was recorded on four tracks and it shows.  Plus why was it remastered in mono?!  It has some interesting experimentation with the sitar and mellotron plus some great guitar distortions typical of psychedelic music. Nevertheless...<br />Producer/Engineer Norman Smith did better work with &quot;Srgt Pepper&quot; and &quot;Pide Piper&quot;.  Though The Beatles and Pink Floyd also worked with limited resources, as the technology of the time was primitive, the music and sound quality on both albums were infinitely better.<br />&quot;S.F. Sorrow&quot; is worth a listen, though.  It serves as a memento of psychedelic rock of the 60's.

B00003CXI1|5.0|This film is as true to the book as it could possibly be. The cast is ideal, and, hopefully, will be able to complete the series intact. Having read (and loved) the books, but not as much of an aficianado as some other members in my family, I did not catch the parts which were, either, combined or omitted. Thus, I felt no need to pick it apart.<BR>It is, in fact, a rousing good story, with a plot that holds your attention consistently, throughout. <BR>Harry Potter is the nephew/ward of a truly dysfunctional family, who finds out at the age of ten that he is a wizard. His parents, who were successful wizards themselves, were mysteriously murdered by the evil Lord Voldamort. After attempting to do the same with baby Harry, Voldamort was somehow vanquished through means unknown. Because of this, a certain respect is paid to Harry by almost all except his muggle (nonmagic) relations and, Professor Snape from Hogwarts, the wizard school which Harry eventually attends.<BR>This is the Wizard of Oz/Alice in Wonderland/Morte de Arthur of our age, and I, for one, am enjoying the ride immensely. I highly recommend that everyone, especially if you have resisted thus far, do the same.
B000001TVD|5.0|this album what can you say is a classic beyond mere words, when george clinton put his  backup band front and center (even though the parilaments sung lot of those songs ) they to me are pure detroit rock -n-roll influenced by bands like the mc5 and the stooges ( the stooges and funkadelic shared the same management)  motown, stax, sly stone, jimi hendrix and the meters with a little frank zappa throw in for good measure.from the first crackle when clinton addreses you in spoken word to the most beautiful nasty, guitar solo from the late, great eddie hazel and the folk-gospel of &quot;when you get to that&quot; to the funk-rock of &quot;hit it and quit&quot; one of the first heavy metal slab of &quot;super stupid&quot; to the zappa-like back in our minds to the beautiful funk-noise masterpiece of &quot;wars of armeggdeon&quot; (now you know where prince got those musical ideas for &quot;annie christian&quot; and &quot;something in the water does not compute&quot;)this album has aged gracefully 31 years after its release it is as fresh today as it was in 1971 buy this album and free your mind.
0792839749|1.0|Why do some of these studios keep releasing movies on DVD that they have chopped up?  If some demented editor thinks a Standard version is necessary for TV viewing, then offer BOTH Widescreen AND Standard on the DVD (some do)...I want to see and hear the movie as it was shown in the theater - not chopped up for the few viewers who are going to watch their movie on a 13&quot; portable.  Do the movie producers hate non-theater consumers so much that they refuse to create DVDs with BOTH Widescreen AND decent sound?  Some of their products say, &quot;YES, we do&quot;.
0790729369|5.0|The other reviews have largely already pegged this - twenty years ago, in my \\"Dirty Harry\\" youth, I'd have been hard pressed to stay awake.  But this movie was wonderful from the beginning.  Eastwood plays the part of a quiet, introspective and fun-loving rover.  Streep plays the part of an Italian immigrant, farmer's wife and dedicated mother who is clearly homesick for something she's never had.  Neither is terribly young, but they show you can be 16 anytime you want - it just costs so much more when you're older.<br />Their passion for each other stutters at first, then explodes - only to be ripped apart at the peak of its adolescent ardor, before it can truly mature.  But it's a good story, and the theme, although pretty ordinary but nice as romances go, is made much more powerful because it changes both their lives and endures in a way that it never could, had they been free to continue.  An eye-dimming tale for those who have experienced distant affairs of the heart and mind - the rest won't get it.

0800177177|5.0|Coppola captured it all so elegantly.  If you like a bit of art and eroticism in the ultimate Gothic horror tale, one cannot do better than this.  This film is lovely and terrifying.  Excellent perfomances, romance, suspence, horror, all directed and produced with flamboyance.  I was very entertained and consider it to be one of the best horror films in my own personal collection.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I must admit, I'm not the most avid follower of any US high school sitcoms but this one truly rocked! The jokes are great and the adaption was spot on by NOT being exactly what ol' Will penned e.g. could you imagine what it would have been like a Patrick had submitted Kat to ritual humiliation in order to get her to date him? Wouldn't have been quite as effective. No lesser characters were overdevolped and the film was overdone in all right places. A moving, funny and truly great film that made me feel truly great. An all-time favorite.
B000002KDM|5.0|Next to Sweet Baby James, this is my favorite James Taylor album.  <br />The songs just go so well together.  Unlike the stripped down sound of Sweet Baby James, Mud Slide takes it a little further with great electric guitar on the title track, as well as some great harmony vocals by Joni Mitchell, to superb percussive work.  Another aspect is the song lengths. All the song lengths vary thoughout the album - from 53 seconds all the way to around 5 minutes. <br />(James will put the \\"short ditties\\" to good use on One Man Dog, but on Mud Slide, he only does 3 or 4 short tracks that are about a minute or so)<br />As for highlights, there are too many.  Although I will mention that I agree with a previous reviewer saying that more should have been released as singles other than the classic \\"You've Got A Friend\\".  Possibly the absolutely gorgeous \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\", \\"Riding On A Railroad\\", or the opening track \\"Love Has Brought Me Around\\".<br />Bottom Line: Listen to Sweet Baby James and then this album, and you will find out why James Taylor is one of the best artists of our time.
B000066NW0|4.0|When my 16 (I'm 24) yr old sister (who used to listen to Britney Spears and all that) came to vist and brought with her this CD I thought it was just another synthesized pop production. When I heard it I thought it was more my type of music than her's (I'm a big classic rock, country and Phish fan). It brought me back to the days when Hole first came out...after being madly in love with Kurt Cobain through most of my early teen years I was anxious to find out what Courtney's music was like. Although I know Avril is younger than Courtney was at the time, she has a sort of edge on her music that had been lacking from the pop music scene. I'm thrilled to see this album on top. Maybe this new music isn't as bad as I have thought in the last few years.
B00005BJ9W|2.0|Like many people are trying to say here, this cd doesn't have the versions which were remixed by David Kershenbaum.  The vinyl version released in North America when this came out had remixed versions of Rio, Lonely in your Nightmare, Save a Prayer, Hold Back the Rain, Hungry Like the Wolf, and My Own Way.  If you listen to the vinyl version and this cd, you can tell, some of the differences are pretty obvious, others are more subtle.  My understanding is the band themselves preferred the remixed versions to the originals that this CD has.  <br />Unfortunately, Capitol didn't give us the remixed versions, so those of us who grew up in the 80's loving the vinyl/cassette versions of Rio will have to settle for our vinyl copies until Capitol records gets off their butts and issues them remastered...something that they should have done in the first place!
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie was really good, brought me back to my high school days and how much I loved the prom.
6303965415|4.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is one of Jane Austen's loveliest tales! Indeed, one full of hope and second chances. I think everyone can relate in one way or another, because we all have made decisions (which later we discovered were actually MISTAKES!) that were partly based on outside influences and opinions, and have lived to regret them. :`(<br />This is precisely the case with sweet-tempered Anne Elliot (Amanda Root), a not-so-young woman in her late twenties, who chose (in her younger years, when she was about nineteen) not to marry the man she truly loved, Frederick Wentworth, because he was thought to be \\"unsuitable\\" (by some anyway), for no other reason than his lack of fortune and connections! He was just a sailor, with nothing to offer- if LOVE and COMMITMENT are nothing (gee! the English were really shallow!). Her young, inexperienced heart was led, or \\"persuaded\\" if you will, to believe that his seeming lack of position in society would interfere with her happiness, and that opinion, which was not her own, no doubt contributed to her decision to turn down his proposal. As the years fly by, Anne is left to bear the burden of her choice. In her household she is made to feel less than appreciated, considered by this time to be an \\"old maid\\", she is not thought to be as pretty as her sister Elizabeth, and is generally neglected by her father (her mother died). Add to that, the fact that her family is teeter-tottering on the edge of financial ruin, and Anne has quite a load to bear! All her hope of finding happiness, love and contentment, is seemingly dead until... the once \\"unsuitable\\" sailor returns (this is eight years later mind you) as a Captain, of rather large fortune I might add! Captain Frederick Wentworth, charmingly played by Ciaran Hinds (gotta LOVE Ciaran!). He is yet unmarried, and is quite dashing, quite the talk of the town, quite the gentleman. As you can imagine, plenty of YOUNG ladies (younger, fresher than Anne) are more than willing to become Mrs. Wentworth. Could Anne be a consideration still? At her age? With their history? Just as Wentworth reappears in her life, and she is forced to look her past straight in the face, another man, young, handsome, seemingly wealthy Mr. Elliot (her cousin) also appears, and takes an interest in Anne! (When it rains it pours, huh!?) Could it be Mr. Elliot is right for her?<br />Ah, and here's where second chances come into play. What to do? What to do? Is it possible Wentworth could still love her after so many years? She has certainly never forgotten him. Could it be that her heart which was once \\"persuaded\\" to let him go, could now be \\"persuaded\\" to reach out to him again? Would HE be receptive after being rejected so many years ago, by the one he truly loved? Could he be \\"persuaded\\" to forgive her? Wouldn't YOU like to know? You have to see the movie! I won't give it away. But, let me just say it is quite rewarding, because too often in life (and even in movies/books too I suppose) those worthy of second chances do not get them, or, they are too blinded to recognize them when they come back around. Even worse, they may be too hesitant to go for it when they do recognize! Love though, \\"persuades\\" us to do what we never thought possible! It emboldens us, encourages us, and pushes us to go after our dreams! <br />To be honest, parts of the film are a tad... well, dull, but the overall theme, the storyline, allows you to endure them in order to see the outcome. Ciaran Hinds, and Amanda Root have a good chemistry. So often in the movie Anne has this wide-eyed, \\"I think I'm about to faint\\" expression on her face whenever she sees/talks to Wentworth... it is quite funny to see. And Wentworth's stares are enough to make any woman feel that way! This is a beautifully done adaptation, and you can't help but adore Ciaran Hinds! \\"Persuasion\\" is the perfect name for this story, because though our thoughts and opinions, and as a result our actions, can be influenced by others, it is reallythe heart that is the most persuasive influence! Really, each person must decide for THEMSELVES what is best and right for them. Love is never of little importance, but of the GREATEST, and a heart that has known true love will be persuaded to seek it again! All-in-all this movie is great! Why rent it when you can own it? I hope I have persuaded you (pun intended) to do so. Enjoy!! :-)
B00005LO5P|5.0|This movie is definately a collectors item. A MUST SEE!!<BR>The story line and effects are brilliant for it's time.
B000066NW0|5.0|... She gets the credit she deserves for the songs she writes herself. She has great rythms for her songs. She taught herself to play, and she is one of my favorite singers. If you think Britney is attractive, then how come her record sales were down for her third CD? Avril sold a greater number... Now, her songs are the best. <br />1. Losing Grip-I love the Crying Out Loud part. This is about her not caring what the guy thinks of her. A slow song, yet very \\"Avril.\\" Has sharp guitar.<br />2. Complicated-I love the \\"take off all your preppy clothes\\" part. I love the accent on that part. The song's about her just wanting her guy to be himself everywhere, not just in front of her. A fast and catchy tune song. Very <BR>\\"there.\\" Even my mom likes it, and she's into classical!<BR> <BR>3. Sk8er Boi-I love the \\"superstar\\" part. This song is based on a true story. Not about Avril. It's upbeat and has Avril \\"slammin' on her guitar.\\" Fast and very well written. Very hard-core and raw guitar.<br />4. I'm With You-Just another slow song. But I love this one better than Losing Grip. Light guitar.<br />5. Mobile-Just a song about her moving away and everything changing. A very true song. Not about love. <br />6. Unwanted-Where she feels unwanted. I love this song! Very in your-face and angry. Hard lyrics and a great tune and meaning. <br />7. Tomorrow-Not the Annie song. Talking about how tomorrow will be different. A slow song with light guitar. <br />8. Anything But Ordinary-Another non-love song. Describes her exactly. Medium sharp guitar and very hard-core lyrics. A great song. <br />9. Things I'll Never Say-About how she's feeling in general. Up-beat guitar and happy somewhat. Another song I love. <br />10. My World-Up-beat, whimsical, and happy. About her life. It shows she is human. Laid back and conserving her energy power. A non-love song. I love this song. <br />11. Nobody's Fool-Saying she'll take nobody's [guff]. Light but in your face guitar. I love this song. <br />12. Too Much To Ask-A true story. Not about Avril. light abd sharp guitar. Soft lyrics. I love this song. <br />13. Naked-Not about being \\"naked.\\" She's feeling like herslf around her guy. It's a melting to your touch song. A slow song with light and airy guitar. I like this song. <br />It is very unusual for me to like and listen to the whole CD 1st to last song. This is a great CD! She's raw and fresh. Only two months out, and already on the cover on YM. Show you how much she is loved. Slutney took awhile. She has people write her own songs. Avril is a good role model. <br />So buy the CD. It is WORTH IT! then you'll love it as much as I do.
B00000K31Q|5.0|It's absolutely wonderful to see this movie, Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles are gorgeous and pretty good actors. The story is great and I agree with that girl who said is the best since Clueless. It's worths the money.<br />Kat-Patrick got lot of chemistry between them and hope to see them together in many more movies soon. All the caracters are funny. All the songs are so appropiate and cool that I bought the soundtrack immediately. GREAT TEENS MOVIE!
B000002V07|5.0|I have owned literally thousands and thousands of cd's.  I worked in a record store through college, so bands have passed through my collection like the wind over the years.  But this is the CD by which I judge all other albums...that's how good it is.  I am a musician and everything that I have ever played or will ever play has its roots in these songs.  Hope's voice is the most beautiful I have ever heard in my life.  If I had to have one album to listen to for the rest of my life it would be this one.  I've had it since 94 and it still gets listened to continuously...and still to this day I hear new things in the guitar work that I haven't heard before.  That's because her voice is so mesmerizing that you sometimes forget there's anything else going on.  For me, there's So Tonight That I Might See...then there's everything else.  There is none higher.
6305265666|5.0|I've had this movie on VHS for years, and recently upgraded to the DVD version. There has not been a week that's gone by since I first got the tape that I haven't watched it. It's an absolutely charming modern adaptation of Cinderella that adults will love (no pandering script here!) and older children, especially girls, should see. Danielle, our modern heroine (played by Drew Barrymore with depth I didn't know she had), rescues HERSELF from a fate as a servant to an evil man, before winning the hand of Prince Henry (a foxy Dougray Scott)--no need for a man to watch after her! This movie is extremely well-cast, and has a beautiful score, luscious costuming, and great photography direction. Watch Melanie Lynskey, who plays the youngest stepsister Jacqueline, steal every scene she's in (note to Hollywood: more of her, please). And Anjelica Huston, as Rodmilla the \\"wicked stepmother,\\" was born for this part--and gets hers in the end. This gem never fails to make me feel wonderful.
B00004XONN|5.0|I am a very new radiohead fan (only several months of listening, so far), so this may benefit you if you are just discovering them, as well.  <br />Radiohead may be the only modern band to release three consecutive albums that are deserving of the classic rating.  The Bends and OK Computer, each so different from the other, are truly incredible works and either is an appropriate starting point for the band.  The Bends, by the way, has become the hallmark for all the newer british bands.  I know people like Coldplay, but I just can't shake the thought that they keep trying and coming up short of recreating the bends.<br />So the next logical step for Radiohead was KID A; the conceptual sweep echoes of OK Computer, but the experimentation and departure from previous sound is even greater than with the first.  The first two songs set a desparate and lonely tone for the rest of the album, while National Anthem opens and maintains a ferocious bass line and rhythm before descending into a futuristic nightmare of angry horns.  The next track (How to Disappear Completely) opens with acoustic strumming and continues to build (similar to bulletproof from the bends), finally climaxing in Yorke's pained and gorgeous crooning -- a masterful song.  Optimistic may be the best song on the album (don't miss the brief, but FUNKY reprise at the end, wow it would be neat to hear them try more stuff like that).  <br />The best tracks rounding out the album are Idioteque -- the most pointed song -- and Morning bell, a painful, beautiful song of cutting the kids in half and dividing up the furniture.  <br />This is essential Radiohead.  If you're a new fan, start with the Bends or OK Computer; if you love those, then you will probably love this quantum leap of experimentation as well, as none of the musical emotion is sacrificed or left behind.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I saw this movie a couple weeks ago and totally fell in love with it and it's characters. Yes, I am a teenager, but I also understand that many adults (including my parents and sisters) have enjoyed it. Any teenager that watches this movie can relate to something, which is one reason I found it so interesting. I think many viewers find themselves totally interested in one character and paying attention to that one throughout the movie, hoping he/she gets what they want. Also, the acting in this movie, was awesome. The casting director needs some kind of award for this, because the teenagers portray their characters very well. If you haven's seen this movie, you must see it. Maybe some people find it to be a bad movie, but I think most of you will be very interested in it and want to watch it again and again.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Awesome movie, seeing this makes you forget that the horrendous picture, JAy and Silent Bob Strike Back, ever existed, its Smiths second best, second only to Dogma.<BR>This movie is of the life of an underpaid clerk who &quot;shouldnt be there today&quot;, and comes across many problems like seeing his ex girlfriend is going to marry someone else,   an old friend dies, and questions life.  He is criticized by his friend Randal for being much too apoligetic and tells him to rip into the occassional customer, which Randal does all too often great movie, the DVD is a bit grainy, but you forget within 5 minutes.<br />My list in order of the best NJ Films<BR>Dogma<BR>Clerks<BR>Chasing Amy<BR>Mallrats<BR>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
B000004166|5.0|This is the complete corpus, minus the Concertone in C, of Mozart's major works for violin and orchestra. Not only will this CD quickly fill that gap in your classical collection, but you will not compromise anything in terms of quality and performance with this all-encompassing CD. Arthur Grumiaux's performance is near-perfect interpretation, combining sensitivity with rousing liveliness, and wit where needed. These are some rather well-noted performances from the 1960s, completely digitally remastered for today's high-tech listener. Personal favorites of mine are the final Rondeaus of Concertos Nos. 2 and 5, and that perennial showpiece, the Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364 (320d) (performed with violist Arrigo Pellicia). Carefully considered performances, executed without a hint of pretension, make this recording the best match for quality, comprehensiveness, and value.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album is the first masterpiece of many. Every song is  exceptional in a humble way. It surprises me how much power the music and lyrics contain considering the somber mood of most of the songs. <br />Don't Know Why- This is her first hit and also one the songs that she wrote herself. It's a lovely song about telling someone how un-sure you are about things, such as meeting them where they are mentally, physically, of emotionally. While also letting the person know that you do care and it is troubling you.10/10<br />Seven Years- This is a wonderful and very sad song about a little girl that is constantly being neglected and yet continues to be herself. Which means she remains happy and hopeful. Very important message I think. 10/10<br />Cold Cold Heart- This song is about the neccesity of being able to forget the past pains given to us by people and not making people in the future that we meet pay for it. Although the song does take it from the direct perspective of a woman trying to convince a man who has been hurt many times that she loves him and won't do the same. 10/10<br />Feelin'The Same Way- A very upbeat song musically with some very melancholy lyrics about being stuck in the same rut day after day and then realizing that you have to change eventually. 10/10<br />Come Away With Me- This is a very beautiful song that should be her second hit. It is also another one of the songs that she wrote herself. The title is very self explanatory...she is so tender and loving and sexy with her lyrics and vocals in just about every song but especially in this one and the Nearness Of You. 10/10<br />Shoot The Moon- Another up beat number that is a great song about reflecting on why people are lonely. Is it because they choose to be or is it that it's just not their time yet to find someone. 10/10<br />Turn Me On- Very sexy and playful and creative. The title is very self explanatory. I think though the surprise is that while most female and male singers are sexy withvery vulgar and simple lyrics, this song is very sexy in a very original and non offensive way. Not that I could be offended easily of course, I mean I am a guy. 10/10<br />Lonestar- A song about the longing for some answers, it is sort of like Nightingale [however I like Nightingale a lot more.] 10/10<br />I've Got To See You Again- Sort of a dark and edgy song that is definitely one of the best songs on the album [of course as you can see by the ratings they are all great.] For the most part the title describes the song perfectly. The only twist is when she throws in some lyrics about wanting to see the person but not wanting to go to see them if they are going to be with certain people, I guess because she feels like she wants the person to herself for awhile. This is also another song that she wrote herself. 10/10<br />Painter Song- Very creative song. You know I don't know what the instrument is but they actually have an instument that sounds like a paint brush that plays through out most of the song. The song itself is about the desire to go back to the way you use to be with a lover and if you can't then you will paint a happy memory of when you were together and then show it to them to remind them in hopes to fall in love all over again. 10/10<br />One Flight Down- This song is about realizing when you are wrong and all of the things that you may have to go through or think about to realize that you are wrong. 10/10<br />Nightingale- Beautiful song about looking for answers from someone who you want to understand better and also the longing to hear a beautiful song that will touch you. 10/10<br />The Long Day Is Over- This might be my favorite song on the album. It's hard to say because I love them all. The title is very self explanatory...trust me I know I've written that for three previous songs and I'm not being lazy..its just that sometimes song titles really do describe the song perfectly. 10/10<br />The Nearness Of You- A beautiful song about lettingsomeone that you love know that you only need them and nothing else. 10/10<br />Please note that she did write more than three of the songs on the album and that although she does not write all of her songs. Many of the best songs on the album were written by her. Plus she does play the piano and beautifully I might add. She is going to be around for a long time making masterpiece after masterpiece...hope you come along for the ride.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I loved this movie soooo much. it is extremely romantic and has a great story line (thanks Will Shakespeare). it is really funny and has just enough sound track so that you can here the speaking but also get the full effect of the music. patrick and kat were great!
B0000640VO|5.0|...And just about everyone else, too. Whatever baggage you may or may not have concerning foreign films- drop it now. Amelie is perhaps the most exuberant, joyful movie to pop along in ages. Lovingly made: the acting, the shot composition, the editing and the (very, very) subtle use of CGI... Wide screen is a must for this one, as much of the film's beauty is chopped out in the VHS release (such as one scene, where Amelie is sitting in front of the TV in a room that's nigh entirely red- save for a small blue lamp to her left. It's a tiny detail, but it fleshes out everything wonderfully- closed captioned: the lamp is gone). Little things, definitely. But then, this is a movie that is all about the tiny details in life... <br />Yes, it's a love story, and as sweet as they come. No need to further belabor that aspect or give away any moments. But you will be surprised many times over. You will laugh at loud. And you will want to watch it again and again, especially with someone you can touch close by. And if you don't have someone- this movie may provide the much-needed impetus to go to France and start turning (not to mention skipping) stones (the shots of the city are marvellous). <br />Then there's Audrey Tautou, whose expressive face is the axis of the movie. Amelie holds your gaze like a naissance de millennium Audrey Hepburn. She has an elfin grace that is utterly sublime and unique. When Amelie smiles, you smile with her. <br />If you have seen it, then you know why you should own this one- movies like this simply aren't made that often. Especially with such skill and flair (this was, I believe, the cinematographer's first feature, though I may be mistaken...) If you haven't seen it- trust a stranger. This film will add something light and hopeful and precious to your life.
B00001NFCY|2.0|But I've also heard a LOT worse. Frankly, I'm glad these guys came along when they did. I would rather hear \\"Higher\\" or \\"My Sacrifice\\"(newer album), or some other semi-hard, three cord Creed song for the 9,000th time that some whiny black guys singing about how much they love me, Britney Spears AGAIN, or Sixpence None The Richer (see my review of their stuff)<BR>That being said, Creed really IS just a Pearl Jam knockoff. I never realised this until I started reading the reviews here on Amazon.com. I listened to a couple Pearl Jam albums a friend of mine owns, I decided that yes, Creed has just ripped of Pearl Jam, a far more talented band that doesn't NEED a (supposedly) attractive lead singer to get people to go to concerts or buy albums. <BR>I really dislike the lead singer's insistance on making most of their material religious. Apperently he does not realise that their are other people than WASPs (White, Anglo-Saxon Protenstants) out there listening to the radio, and they don't appriciate preachy Christian bands.<BR>Long story short, Creed is not the worst band I've ever heard (I reserve that for Sixpence None The Richer), but there are other things I would rather listen to.
B00004T8RK|5.0|one of the most beautifully made albums ever.if true credit is to be given to the album then it should be at billboard no.1 spot should sell over 15 million copies and should be in each and every one's house all over the world.every song is good from the blistering breakerfall to my favourite light years and rival.for me light years seems like the other&quot;alive&quot;.all other tracks superb.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I love this movie. As soon as I saw it I feel in love with it. I am also from Seattle area and just moved so it reminds me of home. My whole family loves it (except my dad who hasn't seen it). I really recommend it.
B000068OCS|5.0|If you've never seen this one, you're in for a truly unique experience. No dialogue, no characters, no conventional plot. Music. Images. Hear me out, here!! The film starts off with nature shots against a slow tapestry of horns and winds. Eventually, we interfuse the nature shots with those of technology; dumptrucks working the land, airplanes in the sky. Eventually, the photography and music get faster and more electric, till we wind up with images of New York City streets sped up 200% give or take. Behind this is the grandest, most energetic and spectacular music Philip Glass has ever composed, bringing us to a pinnacle of sublime excitement.  Atlthough there's no 'plot' to give away, I will not give you the ending lest you lose the fun of EXPERIENCING IT FOR YOURSELVES!!<BR>   <BR>   Of course, if anyone but Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass had done this film, it would've been disappointing. After all, we've all seen Baraca. Nature images, music; still, this is the original. So many films, just like Baraca, have imitated this one and even after one viewing, it will not be hard to see why! Although, on the 'DVD speical feature' interview, Reggio did offer one peice of advice for viewing. He mentioned that if, while watching, the viewer is asking herself why she's watching this, she will not enjoy it. So, yes, I suppose it takes 30 or so minutes to warm up to- as these are the slowest moments of the film, both visually and musically- but once you're there, it may just capture you!!<br />   One complaint about the DVD. The music, even though touched up from the original soundtrack has WAY too much reverb. On the 'vessels' cue, the keyboard reverb COMPLETELY drowns out the vocal. I listened back to my CD soundtrack and even that doesn't have but half the reverb of the film. Although it doesn't come close to ruining the film, it's definitely a pain. Here's a minor gripe. The Philip Glass Ensemble redid the soundtrack in 1998 and I know they toured with it that year, playing it synced up to the original film. I was REALLY hoping they would actually use the new soundtrack, as it would line up perfectly. They did not. Instead, we have to learn to live with the old one laced with careless reverb. Oh, well!! For all that, still five stars!!
B000001Y9I|5.0|653 CD´s in my collection.... hundreds of tapes... hundreds of MP3 songs in my computer... And I must say: Purpendicular is simply one of my top ten. And I´m saying this a long time after the release of the album, without the excitement that happens with a new release of a band you love.<br />IN Purpendicular, PUrple sounds astonishingly fresh, relaxed and inspired. Morse proved once and for all how majestic he is, because it´s not common a virtuoso guitar player with a solid solo career merge so smoothly in a band effort. But he did that.<BR>He added his genius in a controlled way. Gillan also sings with glory, all the band is strong, focused, goping for it. The songs are a mixed bunch of diverse styles, withou forgetting the Purple signature. I JUST LOVE THIS ALBUM FROM FIRST TO LAST TRACK!<br />Of course, such a glorious work could hardly be reproduced, and the posterior ABANDON is not so great, altough very good.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I thought Julia Stiles was a superb actress in this movie. It's a movie where you know what happens at the end, but you keep watching because it's sending the wrong message when your role models have such a trash-talking character. This movie is definetly one you can watch every day and never get tired of it. It's the all time sleep-over movie.
B00004Z459|5.0|Likin Park-Hybrid Theroy is the best CD ive ever heard. All the songs are exelent, and well mixed. It is a great combination of hard rock and rap. These are what I thought about the tracks. <br />1.Papercut-this is a great song and opening to a CD, it has some solid rock and rap in it. <BR>2.One Step Closer-This is my favorite track in the entire CD, it is a great hard song,I also like Chester Bennigton in this song screaming. <BR>3.With you-Has a exelent begging, starting as a good rock song, its one of my favorites. <BR>4.Points Of Athority-Has a really good sound, My 2nd favorite on disc. <BR>5.Crawling-This is a great song with incredible emotino, I love it! <BR>6.Runaway-This song starts ok then gets better and bettter, it is great. <BR>7.By Myself-This song is ok, I didnt care for it much, but good begginig. <BR>8.In the End-This is the hit song on the whole CD, u find this on the rdaio everywhere, its really good, and has some pretty good rap/rock parts. <BR>9.A Place For My Head-Mellow begging, turns into a awesome rock song woth great rap parts in between. <BR>10.Forgotten-This is a exelent heavy song, graet lyrics too. <BR>11.Cure For The Itch-This to me is the only dissapointedment on the CD, its just drum beats, no singing. <BR>12.Pushing me away-A exelent start and way to closeout the Cd,great song.   <br />You should really buy this CD, it will amase you how good they are..
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. I'm 15 years old, and I've watched it with my friends, parents, and my little brothers. Every person I watched it with found it hilarious. It was very well written! It was so funny. Even if you're not much for romance, I'd have to say that you'd STILL like this movie with it's comedy and even the story. I hope you found this helpful!
B0000039LE|4.0|This is absolutely the best in the series. It's about the night HE came home and he does it with a style. I really admire how wisely Michael Myers kills all the witnesses around his sister Laurie Strode... and then we see this little domestic quarrell  wich makes this movie woth of 4 stars. Just take my simple advice: Buy it.
B00000K31Q|5.0|&quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; was a freat movie! It was wounderfully done, and the plot was terrific. The actors and actresses really got into it. There was not one bad actor in that film. And once you got into it, it was almost like one of those super heroes movies, you kept routing for the good guy to win.
078322804X|3.0|The Blues Brothers is one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, they ruined it in this version by including scenes that were cut with good reason. <br />I keep hoping they'll release a DVD of the original movie without the dubious 17 extra minutes, but so far no luck.  :o(
B00000K31Q|5.0|Prepearing a paper for my Shakespeare class on productions of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, I decided to rent &quot;10 Things&quot;. Now, granted, I tend to be an incurable romantic. That said, I absolutely adored this film. I loved picking out the reletion between the film and the play. It was great, because it helped me somewhat with my paper. I thought it was cute, sweet, adorably, funny, incredibly, romantic...all around a wonderful movie.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars is a new young group, not only featuring familiar faces, but also providing a new base of hard alternative. The music is both the kind you head bang to and the kind to relax the troubled soul. This CD is a small showcase of the band's talent. This CD is recommended for anyone who enjoys or has a liking for music.
B00000K31Q|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, it would be a fun movie, but mediocare. I was pleasantly surprised about it--the caracters were really well rounded with fun quirks that remind us of the cruelity of the social dynamics of high school and the movie was well written with hilarious and witty lines that fit into the context of the story that fit the caracters and went a step beyond the conventional lines. It was a well done modernazation of Taiming Of The Shrew.
B000000W9Z|5.0|Too trite?  Too hard to take?  Too much?  Too bad--this one is pure Bowie.  It's all of those things and it's not enough of them, either.  The title track is a great opener.  &quot;Heart's Filthy Lesson&quot; is a great single.  &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot; is fabulous.  (The live TV concert for David's 50th birthday features a powerful version with the Foo Fighters.)  A great album from one of music's most gifted.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie was really good. It was hillarious yet unpredicdable. The script was very funny and very well written and the cast interpereted it well and showed that on the screen. Heath Ledger's australian accent was awesomeand Michael was Hillarious especially in the bar scene. One of my favourite quotes in the movie was &quot;Am I transperent? I want you I need you! Oh Baby Oh Baby&quot; (said sarcastically).
B000000WCX|5.0|Another great album from David Bowie.  Is &quot;Little Wonder&quot; too easy for you?  Then try &quot;I'm Afraid Of Americans.&quot;  And if you can, go find a copy of David's 50th birthday party TV concert from Madison Square Garden.  The live version there is enormous.  A great CD.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Hey everyone out there who wants a funny and cool movie about school, sisters fighting, and relstionships. This movie. It has plenty of comedy and surprises. I love this movie and I recomend 10 Things I Hate About You to any 12-99 old person. Bye bye
B00001QGPR|5.0|I struggle to pick my favorite track on this great album.  It's got to be &quot;The Pretty Things Are All Going To Hell.&quot;  Having said that, &quot;What's Happening?&quot; is right up there.  Or should I say &quot;Survive&quot;?  David Bowie did it again with this one-another step, another re-invention, another great CD.  Buy it.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This is a very entertaining and funny movie - fairly well crafted and had good chemistry between cast. Why do theymake Heath use such a fake australian accent?
0486411818|5.0|An excellent reference book from one of the gurus of FEM. It's more mathematically oriented than most, but it gives you a good insight into the math , which is the foundation of all FEM. <BR>Great bargain for the price.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I really enjoyed the animation aspect of the movie.  Character developement was great and the voices chosen to do them as well.  I think Lion King was a big step for the production company as far as the quality of the animation was concerned.  The plot of the movie is generaly the same every time.  Not that it's a bad thing though since it is a childrens movie.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Although I didn't like &quot;Hey Baby&quot; all that much when it came out, my boyfriend bought me the CD for my birthday in Feb &amp; I LOVE it!! All the songs are good... I listen to the CD over &amp; over again.. a must have for No Doubt fans.  Very funky sounds to it!
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Along with I Am Sam, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The singing is horrid and the actors never seem to finish a song, but instead mix it with the title lyrics of other songs, mostly cheesy Elton John songs.  Ewan McGregor can't sing.  Neither can Nicole.  The pudgy owner of the Moulin Rouge can't sing either.  It's mostly a shout fest.  The costumes are stupid.  The dance numbers are rehash of Gene Kelly.  There is a dance scene in which Kidman is in a negligee bouncing up and down like muppet -- so incredibly stupid in presentation, it made me feel sad that actors have to make a living this way.  The sets are gaudy and inductive of vomit.  And the worst thing: THIS MOVIE IS LOOOOONG.  The plot is so predictable you know exactly what is going to happen next, and you hope the director doesn't drag it out, but he does.  This movie is like the guy in the office who is so amused with his jokes he keeps going on and on while everyone leaves because they can't stand the hackneyed schtick eructating from his flatulent cheeks.  If you're a masochist, be sure to rent this movie.  If you're fool, make sure to purchase the DVD keepsake edition.
B00003CXAY|4.0|....as another reviewer has said, KOYAANISQATSI is CROPPED.  I own the limited edition DVD that was sold as a fundraiser around a year ago by the Institute for Regional Education (IRE) and it is in 4:3.  The new MGM so-called \\"widescreen\\" release simply adds black bars to the top and bottom of the screen, with NO extra width shown- the other reviewer is 100% correct!  I compared the IRE DVD with the new MGM commercial release on two DVD players at the same time, and the size of each picture is exactly the same, but the MGM release has black bars blocking Ron Fricke's cinematography.  The bars take away 2 inches from the top and bottom of the screen of my 32\\" TV, or 4 inches of picture height total.  I love widescreen movies, but purposely blocking out what was originally filmed is RIDICULOUS.  KOY was originally filmed in 4:3, not widescreen.<br />These films are the two greatest combinations of music and film ever made- it's just a shame to see KOY treated so poorly.  Nice interviews with Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass and cheap price still makes it a must-buy.  All we can hope for is maybe a \\"special edition\\" in the future that's done right as this release is apparently selling pretty well.<br />Right now, the best KOY sound is found on the laserdisc, and the best picture is found on the limited edition IRE DVD which is no longer available.  I'm so happy I didn't sell it!  It's a priceless collector's item now!<br />I haven't yet checked the new MGM DVD of POWAQQATSI compared to my VHS POW videotape as far as the black bars taking away picture from the original- but the new POW DVD indeed has an incredible picture quality and the soundtrack fared very well in the conversion to Dolby Digital- it sounds excellent.  KOY sounds muffled and too rolled off in the highs.<br />Steve Glassfan
B0000542D2|5.0|Richard Lester's \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" bursts from the screen in glorious black and white, showing the world what it was like to be young, handsome and talented in the early 1960s.  It's a fabulous picture, and every \\"rock\\" movie and video since then are mere copycats, trying too hard to recreate the frenetic fun-in-the-park sequence, John's one-liners and quirky gestures (notice the Coke-bottle-in-the-nose gag on the train), and Ringo's solitary man sweetness.  There's nothing better, really.  The despair on some of the young girl's faces at the ending concert will even bring tears to your eyes, and you'll wish you had that kind of passion in your life.
B00006950W|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that this is a very brainless movie. It plays out like an extended video game cinema, with lots of gunplay, yelling, zombies, and zombie bites. The characters are essentially movable, bendable action figures, complete with clip-on weapons and pre-recorded lines. The only difference is that when they get \\"broken,\\" they can come back and eat your flesh. I hate it when that happens. The actors include Milla Jovovich (who likes to look intense) and Michelle Rodriguez (who likes to glare at people from behind her eyelashes). They do their best, and manage to create fairly believable characters. On the whole, though, this is mindless action fare that most people will hate.<br />Wait, I'm not finished. I didn't hate it. I was entertained. I'm not a fan of the games and have never even played one, but I still enjoyed this. If you're looking for pure entertainment and pulse-pounding action, look no further.<br />The movie begins in the Hive, an underground research facility, where the employees' day is somewhat ruined when the doors seal themselves and poisonous gas gushes from the walls. So much for them. Cut to: Alice (Jovovich) waking up in a deserted mansion with no memory of who she is or how she got here. Before she has time to get over last night's hangover, all heck breaks loose and she ends up down in the Hive with an eco-warrior (Mabius), a fellow amnesiac (Purefoy) and a bunch of military commandos (Rodriguez, Crewes, Salmon, and some highly expendable extras for added flavor). Their mission is to kill the sentient computer running the hive, but first they have to contend with the dead employees, who are back as hungry zombies, thanks to a nasty genetic virus. Throw in some undead dogs, rounds and rounds of gunfire, a killer computer, security lasers, a heavy metal soundtrack, and \\"The Licker\\" (don't even ask), and you've got yourself a gripping action flick.<br />There is nothing I can say in this movie's favor. I could say, \\"Why is it that Rodriguez yells 'we're running out of ammo!' near the beginning of the movie, but no one ever actually runs out of ammo?\\" I could say, \\"Zombie dogs? They just look like a bunch of dobermans who rolled in Black Forest cake!\\" I could say, \\"I don't care if you loved him! He's a bloody ZOMBIE! Wipe that shocked, tragic look off your face and RUN!\\" I could say, \\"What were these people paid to be in this film and will they ever live it down?\\"<br />But I won't. Despite all its flaws, I enjoyed this movie. In terms of gripping action and terror, it delivers. If there's a sequel -- and you KNOW there's gonna be a sequel -- I plan to see it. So shoot me. Because you know I'll come back to get you.it that Rodriguez yells 'we're running out of ammo!' near the beginning of the movie, but no one ever actually runs out of ammo?\\" I could say, \\"Zombie dogs?

B00005Y1MT|5.0|This album is a musical work of art, undoutably the most emotional music Marillion (or any other artist for that matter) has ever produced. <br />80 amazing minutes of  vivid and diversly haunting yet aslo rocking music which takes the listerner on a journey in and around the mind of an emotionally fragile woman who begins a mental downward spiral from her birth to her death. The whole time, you never really know if she is suffering the physical and emotional abuses that have scarred her or whether she is just metally imbalanced, causing her to have horrible flashbacks that may never have taken place, her life story is a tear jerker. <br />Marillion have stretched the music boundries here on 'Brave' but the real magic comes from the vocal delivery of singer / songwriter Steve Hogarth. His lyrics and voice reach into the human spirit, into the sensitive core of your heart, creating an involuntary compassion for the poor woman who's life this story follows. <br />Without being pretentious in anyway, Marillion manage to keep the listerners attention for the entirety of this 80 minute album.<br />There are no albums that I would give 5 stars to but 'Brave' took me to places no other album has. <br />For the old school Marillion fan of the 80's (Fish period) there is virtually no connection on 'Brave' to their prog-rock past. Being a fan of both periods, I have to admit that Marillion still mess with time signitures but now write songs that would be recieved very well by the general masses if they were just given airplay. Maybe that is their salvation! More like Radiohead or Massive Attack, Marillion's sound is very current yet totally original in style and influence.<br />'Brave' is a masterpiece of music which I strongly recommended!
630289915X|5.0|This film - more than any other in my life - has become a perennial 'touchstone' for re-aligning my values and ambitions in my career, and rejuvenating my sense of clarity and belief in the world, as well as my place and contribution within it. Does this sound corny to you? Too bad - its the truth! This film is a magical, healing, life-affirming journey for the viewer. It's a rare collaboration of good film craft, direction and talent and something more - the 'whole' is greater than the sum of parts - the film has captured a sympatico between actors that has yielded 'something elusive and extraordinary'. <br />Remake it to bring in younger audiences? Would you remake the Beatles work - or Marvin Gaye or Ella Fitzgerald or Edith Piaf? Would you remake Casablanca - perhaps replace Humphrey Bogart or Ingrid Bergman? Of Course Not! Nor can you replace Jimmy Stewart, who more than acts in the leading role - he brings in the essence of himself - who he was, what he valued. No one else could top his performance. The way to bring in younger audiences is to teach them the value of these classic contributions - not to remake them with contemporary actors. <br />This film is a truly authentic outcome of talent and craftmanship. It can't be remade, superceded, duplicated or excelled. 'It's A Wonderful Life' is a masterpiece! Enjoy it often!
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the best CD ever!. You can listen to it all the way through and not have to skip any songs. If you don't have this CD you HAVE to get it! KURT COBAIN RIP
0440180295|5.0|This is one of my favorite Vonnegut books.  In the book, the author describes aspects of World War II in a surrealistic way. Billy Pilgrim, the main character, maintains a fluid relationship with time. Read the book to get your mind all scrambled and learn about non-traditional views of time.
B000066NW0|4.0|Okay, I'll admit it, Avril is not a complete punk, but would her album really be good if everything on it was the same? About 2/3 of this cd is &quot;punky&quot;. The rest may not be very hard-hitting, but it does go a lot deeper than the likes of Britney and Mandy. Avril's music is definetly &quot;Complicated&quot;, as it usually has a more interesting subject than her last kiss or sad breakup. Avril is a nice refresh from the run of the mill, 80 point IQ, music girl. You ethier like her or you don't. I personally like this album because it has music on it that expresses the fact that life is not pefect. After all, the girl can can sing and, in my opinion, her # 1 hit &quot;Complicated&quot; is just the beginning of her carrer.
B000002C2E|2.0|I've been listening to Bob Dylan since 1964. I've been through a lot as a fan, from the brilliant Sixties to the mostly dead Eighties to the stunning release of &quot;Love and Theft&quot; last year. Of all the things I've witnessed in his career, the acclaim &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; has gotten is the most puzzling.<br />I don't like this album. I've listened to it many times trying to let it grow on me, but it won't. It's so dreary, monotonous and suffocated that it is a chore to listen to. None of the songs run in my head and compel me to play them again and again as do the masterpieces on &quot;Love and Theft.&quot; Yet it is praised to the skies.<br />Sorry, I just don't get it. Even Dylan himself has said that he couldn't get what he wanted while making this record. It's pretty obvious he's surprised that people like it; he doesn't.<br />Skip right over this one to &quot;L&amp;T&quot; if you're looking for Dylan's real comeback album. Or get the one before it, &quot;World Gone Wrong,&quot; another Dylan album with some real heart.
B000002J29|5.0|this is a brilliant album and the track selection is the best they have done(they could of done more from Wind &amp; Wuthering though, they chose AFTERGLOW! it is the WORST track from W&amp;W and it is better on the album anyway). Seconds Out is a wonderfull album to listen to, especially Firth of 5th which is better with phil than with peter and it has an extended tony banks solo and this time it is a synthesizer, and not a boring old piano.<BR>Other highlights are: Robbery, assault and battery, I know what i like and squonk.
B00000IO4I|5.0|The first time you watch this movie,you will be blown away.A hermit girl is discovered as a breathtakingly talented impersonator of female singers.This movie is filled with entertainment,sorrow,laughter and soul.
0967851408|5.0|I am surprised that this book was not written by a philospher or a new-thought practitioner but by an ordinary businessman.  He was truly a genius and this, to me, is the best self-help book we can find today.  It will survive for ages and should be read by every thoughtful person. It ought to be translated into other languages
0800125789|5.0|A young boy is thrown into the latest action film that stars his favourite fictional hero,Jack Slater,played by Arnold Schwarzennegger,both in the real film and in the film inside the real film...It's full of laughs and I'd have thought anyone with sense of humour would like it for what it is.
B00005MP58|5.0|Well, this really isn't my kind of movie, but I bought it for my wife who has read the book about 10 times.  She loves the movie as much as the book, and I agree that it is a good, wholesome film.  The acting is superb and the scenery awesome, but the dvd could use some re-mastering because the colors are a little washed out in some scenes.
B0000399WI|5.0|Not only is this one of the best films ever made it exemplifies the poetic writing of one of our most under-appreciated writers: Stephen King.  The writing in this movie is outstanding and Morgan Freeman's narration is beautiful.  I could watch this film again and again and still feel its powerful message.  Poetry and poetic justice.  A MUST SEE!!
B00005R2M3|5.0|I have been wanting this CD for such a long time after hearing several of Shakira's more popular songs on the radio.  I just got it and I was not at all disappointed.  All the songs are just wonderful - great latin flare to them as well.  Her voice is strong and distinctive and a joy to listen to.  Her songs are catchy and fun to hum or sing along with.  Plus the dancing possibilities are endless - makes me want to tango!  Just a real delight!
B00000JGHM|5.0|Few movies from the 1990s have the energy, action sequences, or provocative depictions of men who are bigger than life than does this gorgeously photographed and brilliantly choreographed cops and robbers tale starring Robert DeNiro as a supremely competent heist-meister and Al Pacino as his indefatigable pursuer. The film, which opens with a robbery sequence involving an armored truck and a precision team that takes it down so professionally it makes one's head spin, has so much action and so much going on it sometimes skips into overdrive. Yet it is all done with such an entertaining verve that one stays with all that is happening as it floats from one situation to another.<br />There are a number of subplots, each involving one of the principles in elements of his personal life. But whether it be DeNiro trying to come to terms with a woman who offers him a chance at a more meaningful and satisfying life, or Val Kilmer trying to figure out how to deal with his high-maintenance life style and a wife with a roving eye (played wonderfully by Ashley Judd), or Pacino trying to essay his way through the wilderness of his own conflictions and how they affect his relationship with his wife, we see these as entertaining sidebars and not the main show, which is the inevitable showdown between DeNiro and Pacino.<br />This is several movies in one; a wonderfully entertaining shoot-em-up action film, with more than enough pyrotechnics to satisfying the most demanding of fans; an absorbing character study of both DeNiro's and Pacino's contrasting characters and the ways in which they are very similar and at the same time very much different; and a morality play, in which we watch as DeNiro's figure has to make the choice between a life affirming and a life-extinguishing decision, one that then profoundly affects his own fate. This is a great movie, and one that confirms the fact that neither DeNiro nor Pacino have lost the magic touch; both are terrific here. Enjoy!
B00005QDW1|3.0|No Doubt will always be fabulous but this CD still does not really shine like Tragic Kingdom did, although I think it's better than Return of Saturn.  Tragic Kingdom will always be a constant on my play list, but Rocksteady will fall away sooner rather than later.  I bought the CD just before going to their concert and was very disappointed in it.  However, after seeing them perform many of the Rocksteady's song live, I like them much better.  &quot;Hey Baby&quot; is an awfully fun song and I do enjoy hearing it, though I think perhaps it is one of the weaker songs on this album.  At any rate, I feel rather neutral about this CD - hence the 3.  Will always love them but was not blown away with this latest endeavor.
0345448898|5.0|\\"His Dark Materials\\" is a nothing short of a meditation on the nature of humanity and divinity masquerading as a series of fantasy novels.  Eliminate the name of the trilogy in that last sentence, and it could describe several really great works -- The Lord of the Rings, Dune, the Chronicles of Narnia.  And this is a work equal to those.  There are significant differences: perhaps because Pullman is a contemporary author, the characters speak normally, and not like Oxford dons, the action is not broken up for lengthy expositions on the history of the imaginary lands, peoples or languages, and of course, this is a profoundly irreligious series of books.  This may be viewed by some as a strength and others as weakness, but all in all it does make for a great readable work with a terrific fresh sense of where good and evil come from.  It is labelled a young adult book, but I'm really not sure why -- maybe it's part of a subversive effort to keep the theology under the radar of those who would never deign to read something that involves teenagers.  Whatever.  Lord knows how many doctoral dissertations and book clubs this has launched -- the possibilities for provacative discussion are endless.  Read it and participate.
B00006FXB6|5.0|Well I had never heard of QOTSA, befor Dave from Nirvana joined them for this great album.  And now i'm hooked.  Get this album.  It's rare when albums come out that are good from start too finish.  And this is one  of them. The bonos DVD is cool as well.  With a few live performaces, and behind the scenes footage.  Nuff said.
B000002J03|5.0|I'm not even sure why I'm attempting this.  Is there any way to heap enough praise on this album?  Can any review really do it justice?  Of course the answer is \\"no\\", but I'll try anyway.<br />As Ian Astbury once said, \\"This is where it all begins.\\"  Two friends, a garage, a dartboard, darts, a cheap old tape recorder, and several gallons of apple cider plus left over from a recent Christmas party.  The year?  1985.  <br />Oh, and the picture is not quite complete yet.  In that garage, there was also a homemade tape of Led Zeppelin II copied from the album version.  You can't leave that out.  It is critical to our story.<br />During the last half of 9th grade, practically every afternoon when we returned home from school Chris and I would head for his mom's garage to throw darts, imbibe apple cider plus, and listen to that remarkably poorly recorded version of Led Zeppelin II.  And yet even as that tape scratched and hissed its way to completion, there was no question that we were listening to one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  <br />Think about it all you want, there is really no way to fathom how the members of Led Zeppelin created this masterpiece.  Led Zeppelin II is so far superior to virtually any other album ever made that it seems almost mythical.  Can it really possibly exist and why is no one out there today capable of creating a comparable masterpiece?  How in the world did John Paul Jones come up with that monstrous, seductive bass line that dominates \\"The Lemon Song\\"?  From what source did Jimmy Page conjure up those timeless riffs in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman)\\"?  Where did Robert Plant get the pipes and inspiration to sing the lovely \\"Thank You\\" and \\"Ramble On\\"?  And how in the world did John \\"Bonzo\\" Bonham conjure up a drum sound 10 times louder than anyone else has ever produced throughout this whole darn album?  <br />Don't even bother pondering these questions.  They'll make your head hurt.  My advice is to sit down with your Led Zeppelin II CD and don't even think about it.  Just relax and let the music take over.  Over the course of this CD you'll experience almost the full range of human emotions - how many CDs can you say that about?  I recommend it to almost anyone.  Okay, perhaps it's a little too rawly sensual for your 10-year old niece, but assuming you are at least 13, this CD is perfect for you.  Just be warned - you'll probably want to have some dart supplies and cider around for when you press play.
B00006AW2M|1.0|Their Satanic Majesties Request was released on Dec 8, 1967, for the first time simultaneously in both the UK and US and with the same tracks.  This is a remastered super audio CD (SACD) issue from the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material).<br />There are a number of interesting things about the album:<br />.....the title is a parody of the \\"Her Britannic Majesty requests\\" on British passports<br />.....it was the 1st album to use a 3D photograph (by Michael Cooper, shot in Mt. Vernon, NY)<br />.....Lennon & McCartney sang backup on \\"Sing This Altogether\\"<br />.....Jagger wrote \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" in his cell at Brixton Prison<br />.....We Love You and Dandelion were on the acetate but were removed just before pressing began<br />.....the album received the worst reviews of any Stones album and is still considered by many to be their poorest work<br />.<br />This is the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material.  ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog after Allen Klein became their manager in 1965.  The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.  With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio.  I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the World.<br />The tracks were recorded between May and Sep 1967 at Olympic Studios, London as follows:<br />May 18, 1967<br />.....She's A Rainbow<br />Jun 8, 1967<br />.....Citadel<br />Jul 7-22, 1967<br />.....In Another Land<br />.....Sing This Altogether<br />.....Sing This Altogether (See What Happens)<br />.....The Lantern<br />.....On With The Show<br />Aug 10-30, Sep 1-7, 1967<br />.....Gomper<br />.....2000 Light Years From Home<br />.....2000 ManLantern<BR>.....On With The Show<BR>Aug 10-30, Sep 1-7, 1967<BR>.....Gomper<BR>.....2000 Light Years From Home<BR>.....2000 Man<br />
B000002KZ6|5.0|First, I must start by saying to that seemingly uncultured fan from New Orleans, I now understand why Brittany Spears comes from there.<br />How can you not \\"get\\"  SPEAKING IN TONGUES?  This, to me, was Talking Heads defining moment, with the subsequent film, Stop Making Sense. I lived near these guys in Long Island City & listened to them create these & many other great pieces of music back in the day.  I was entranced by their sensibility & style.  This album meshes African, funk, rock, electronica, gospel, pop & dance into a collage of jubilation of life.  One must be glad to be alive to witness such an inspiring group of songs.  Quirky beats that sound like hearbeats, nervous tics, hiccups, spasms - things in life.  Things that are off kilter - real!!!!  With guest artists like Nona Hendryx, Wally Badarou, Bernie Worrell & Dolette Macdonald (later in Sting's crew) one cannot go wrong.  \\"Burnin...\\" is a musical classic already, Slippery People 's style has been copied by everyone from R.E.M. to Billy Joel with its's choir reply chorus.  Pull up the Roots could force the dead to dance. With \\"Swamp\\", Byrne offers the singer an education on working a character into song without sounding like an idiot.  Ok, maybe MOON ROCKS isn't so interesting.  But, it doesn't take anything away from this incredible band's masterpiece.  I didn't think it could get better that Remain In Light, but I knew I was wrong from the second I heard this one.  They did break up at the right time.  I commend them for that.  But I'd love to see them get together for one big reunion tour  before they are all too old!!!  They deserved to be loved live by their old following!!!
B000003BES|4.0|With the release of the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material), there is now some confusion as they have released some of the early albums in both US and UK versions.<br />This is the version of Big Hits (High Tide & Green Grass) that was released on Apr 1, 1966 in the US. The American record company execs had tampered with the original UK design of most of the Stones albums up to this time, often releasing inferior American versions. On this one they reversed the trend and the UK design, which was released Nov 4, 1966, did not include Paint It, Black. The UK version substituted Mother's Little Helper and added 3 additional tracks (Take It Or Leave It, Out Of Time, and What To do).<br />This US version covered their American hits from 1964-1966. Here are the songs on this album, in the order they were released as singles in the U.S.:<BR>3-6-64 Not Fade Away<BR>6-12-64 Tell Me (version 2)<BR>7-24-64 It's All Over Now<BR>7-24-64 Good Times, Bad Times (B side of It's All Over Now)<BR>9-25-64 Time Is On My Side (version 2)<BR>12-18-64 Heart Of Stone<BR>3-12-65 The Last Time<BR>3-12-65 Play With Fire (B side of The Last Time)<BR>6-4-65 (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction<BR>9-24-65 Get Off Of My Cloud<BR>12-17-65 As Tears Go By<BR>2-11-66 19th Nervous Breakdown<br />There is an interesting story about the cover art and 8 page photo book that was part of the original album. The photos were originally done for an album to be called Could You Walk On The Water?, but the concept was so controversial at that time that the photo of the Band walking on the water of a California reservoir was dropped and the photo of them standing on the bank was used. The album was renamed After-Math (although the American version dropped the hyphen) and the artwork was used for this greatest hits album.<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection, with some of the notes from Davis' \\"Old Gods Almost Dead.\\"  Both books are available from amazon.com.
B000069CWE|3.0|Why did Linkin Park allow such a butchery of their songs? Nearly every song from their original album has been stripped, [altered], and left for dead. Some of them, like Points of Authority, survive the experience; some, like Crawling, are even stronger than they were before. But for the most part, the songs are horribly mutated remnants of their former glory. This is the result of people who don't understand what Hybrid theory is really about, deforming Linkin Park's songs to fit their own personal styles of music and agendas of self-glorification. Hearing \\"In The End\\" being so brutally slaughtered left me with a burning desire to kill Motion Man and the other bloke who was responsible.<br />Overall, the songs that aren't too badly damaged manage to give this album a 3 out of 5 stars. I hope that Linkin Park will not allow people to screw around with their music in the future.
B00005JKDR|5.0|.<BR>Summary:<br />Great movie for kids and adults with lovable characters and side splitting laughter. Great Pixar quality animation, great and imaginative script, great acting voices (Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully) that really fit their parts, high quality comedy (some slapstick) great directing, great music.<br />DVD Features:<br />The DVD extra material are plentiful and excellent!  Definitely well worth the purchase!<br />Great Director's Commentary; great tour of Pixar; great presentation of the animation process, etc.  <br />\\"Mikey's New Car\\" is a great little short feature; etc. and the \\"Birds\\" short feature is cute, too!<br />Review:<BR>  <BR>This hilarious movie delivers side-splitting laughter!  Everything fits together and is just great! Should be animated DVD of the year!<br />This is a great DVD to have at home, even if you saw this in the movie theatre.  My daughter saw it in the theatre, but still laughed uncontrollably watching the DVD movie, as well as Mikey's car!  I mean really laughing until she couldn't breath!<br />Story:<br />Monsters work for a Corporation (Monsters, Inc.) That supplies energy for their city, Monsteropolis, by capturing the screams (scream energy) of children and monsters compete for the best screams with blue-furred cuddly Sully (Goodman) leading the competition.  Somehow, a charming infant sneaks into Monsteropolis and hooks onto Sully; and whoever gets caught with her will get \\"cleaned\\" by the \\"authorities\\" - not a good thing! This throws Sully and one-eyed Mikey (Crystal) into a panic as they stumble against all odds to send the child back without getting caught.  <br />Scare Factor:<BR> <BR>While the Monsters may be afraid of the children, there is no need for your kids to be afraid of them.  The movie seems pretty harmless and young children seem to have no problem with the movie concept and scenes.<br />And, did I mention it was FUNNY?!
B00004Z459|4.0|Let's be honest: Rap-rock and metal [disappoint]. The lead singers usually can't sing, the lyrics are unintelligible at best and criminally offensive at worst, and \\"music\\" is too often a misnomer. It is no match for the brilliance of Pop-rock.<br />Linkin Park is the exception to all this. While many of their songs are no better than the garbage we see from Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit and Korn, many other songs are truly outstanding: In The End, Crawling, Runaway, Points of Authority, and One Step Closer are the five best rap-rock songs I've ever heard, and all of them are done by the same group: Linkin Park. The lyrics for \\"In The End\\" almost made me cry the first time I heard them; the melodies really grow on a person with time, and the lead vocalists do a pretty decent job.<br />This album is something of a mixed bag, but so is every album. This one just has higher highs and lower lows than most, and as my experience proves, it can even find fans among people who don't like rap-rock.
B000008H24|4.0|\\"War Child\\" contains all the magical musical and lyrical mayhem and adventure one could expect from a Jethro Tull album: even from a more basic work such as this. Although the suites from albums such as \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"A Passion Play\\" aren't present here, they're really not necessary in this case, since Ian Anderson and crew must've been worn to a frazzle since creating and producing three previous masterworks (\\"Aqualung\\", \\"Thick As A Brick\\" and \\"A Passion Play\\"). Hence, the band needed a break, so they just broke the concept down to a more simplified approach - writing mostly short and simple songs dealing with war and tyranny (\\"War Child\\"), victory (\\"Queen And Country\\"), freedom [from strife] (\\"Skating Away On The Thin Ice Of A New Day\\"), and just plain celebratory mayhem (\\"The Third Hoorah\\"), among other subjects. Ah, but since Jethro Tull was exhausted from completing (really) four \\"Stand Up\\" concept albums (\\"Living In The Past\\" included), the band felt they could afford to flirt with some nonsensical ideas, as presented in the silly lyrics and the semi-progressive flute and guitar drives featured in the whimsical \\"Sealion\\" - perhaps the standout track on \\"War Child\\". Even a poppish tune works well here in the sweet cadences of \\"Bungle In The Jungle\\", a number which reached the Top 30 in the U.S.. A further note of interest: At one point during the 1974-'75 concert tour in support of this album, Ian Anderson would introduce the title of the above latter selection as...\\"Rumble In The Bathroom\\"! (I wonder if he had a unique set of lyrics to go with the title change?) Funny stuff! One would call it \\"potty humor\\", if you get the joke. Anyway, as was sort-of stated earlier, virtually all the songs fit together to create a story of \\"biblical\\" proportions (mini-suites, as is the case here), as Jethro Tull had been known for in prior works. Even though a majority of the tracks on \\"War Child\\" contain a slight slant towards commercial pop, it still retains a grand degree of progressive charm, a Tull trademark. \\"War Child\\" will grow on you after the first listen, so pick this up only after you've listened to one of Tull's previous excursions (\\"Aqualung\\", \\"Thick As A Brick\\" or \\"A Passion Play\\") if you're one of the Tull uninitiated. Well worth the purchase (trust me)!of progressive charm, a Tull trademark. \\"War Child\\" will grow on you after the first listen, so pick this up only after you've listened to one of Tull's previous excursions (\\"Aqualung\\", \\"Thick As A Brick\\" or \\"A Passion Play\\") if you're one of the Tull uninitiated.

B000002J1S|5.0|This record is even better than I remember from 1974. I hadn't heard it for about 20 years, and I recently picked it up on CD. I was a Genesis fan from about 1972. I was immediately smitten by their unusual sound and Peter Gabriel's voice. At the time, they took a big risk with this record. It had a harder edge, with all kinds of strange vocal distortions and dissonance, along with the same unforgettable melody lines the band was famous for. The record may have caught some fans off guard. Gabriel abandoned his usual &quot;tea and crumpets&quot; lyrics for something totally different, and I recall reading that he and the other guys split after this because they were headed in different artistic directions. Like others, I regret not knowing where the group would have taken us if Gabriel had stayed.<br />What really strikes me after hearing the record again is how it does not sound dated (unlike most music from the '70s). No, this is not party music, but it plays like a dream in the &quot;skull cinema&quot;, as Stephen King says. Even if the sketchy story isn't very clear, the dark, creepy, and beautiful tone will really get to you. In my opinion, Peter Gabriel had, and still has, the most expressive, haunting voice of any rock singer, ever. And even though Phil Collins went on to become a bland pop star, he still ranks as one of rock's best precussionists. In fact, his backing vocals contribute greatly to the sound of this record. Hearing it again after all of these years in remastered sound with no pops and scratches makes it sound fresh. Whether you are 50, like me, or 20, check it out.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|This was the record that changed my knowledge of popular music. I had mostly listened only  Finnish artists and then my scout leaders played once this record.<br />The sounds are so clean, drumming is great and Sting´s backing vocals on &quot;Money for nothing&quot; gives me still the creeps.
630588255X|5.0|This film is so beautiful.  Evokes the confusion, fear and joy of being young.  Portrays the transcendant power of love.  This film would be incomplete without the score by Cat Stevens, who carries the emotions along just right.  Laconic, terse, cryptic and ironic comic genius.  Open your heart and mind, and this film may change your life.  I know it did mine.
B000069HKH|4.0|When I for the first time heard the single track &quot;The Rising&quot; on the radio, I didnt instatly know, what to think. But after several times that the single was played and when I purchased the record, I was glad to notice the return of the E-Streer Band. I had seen the N.Y concert and noticed, that the guys(and the girl) were still in a good shape. Especially Max Weinbergs drumming sounds good in rock after all the jazz influences in Conan.
0380977788|4.0|It was a fun read but it could have been better. I expect more from Gaimen. And it was a little too simple, even for a YA novel. But it kept me reading.
B00005A0RI|4.0|There are no flashy solos, no daring arrangements, hardly any variation in tempo and mood, and yet the listening experience is entirely pleasant, soothing, and, yes, rewarding. A remarkable feat. Haden, Rubalcaba, and the rest of the musicians and production team obviously shared a great chemistry. The only gripe I have is with the percussion, which is relegated to a basic timekeeping role and gets a bit repetitive. Other than that, \\"Nocturne\\" comes close to easy-listening perfection. Also a very well-engineered CD, by the way. The bass is warm and full, the highs, crisp and detailed. A good reference CD for stereo shopping (if you can find a quiet  room.)<br />At first I gave this album 5 stars. But upon further reflection I felt I had allowed strong public sentiment to cloud my judgment. \\"Nocturne\\" is very nice. I think you should buy it. But is it really as much of a masterpiece as, say, \\"Kind Of Blue?\\"  Is there the same degree of artistic originality? Will it endure the test of time in the same way? Are we reviewers, in our eagerness to heap deserved praise, allowing grade-inflation to rear its pernicious head? There's nothing wrong with a solid 4 stars, folks.

B000066F6H|4.0|Listening to The Hives make me feel like a kid again. Forget the comparisons. People lump The Hives with The Strokes and The Vines simply because the mainstream has not embraced rock in the past few years. Their similiarities end with \\"The.\\" The Hives emit a ton of energy, which complements their songs' simplicity and catchiness. This energy is something so many bands lack... What these guys have is somewhat reminiscent of The Who. My favorite on this album is Die, Alright. However, I think this album is marketed toward people who are expecting something heavier than it is. To me, The Hives sound more pop to me than punk. In fact--and this may be a stretch here--The Hives remind me A LOT of 80s glam band Hanoi Rocks.

0446677450|2.0|Sigh.  Yet another &quot;how to become a millionaire&quot; book that extols anti-intellectualism (The author's &quot;poor dad&quot; is a mere *teacher*, and the author's constant equating of self-worth with financial wealth as opposed to education or intelligence is palpable through the book), and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste regarding the author's methods (he constantly brags about taking advantage of desperate people by buying their properties for pennies on the dollar).  The author quotes Gordon &quot;Greed Is Good&quot; Gekko with a straight face, castigates his parents for trying to make him feel *guilty* about his greed, and pats himself on the back because he gives to his church (while no doubt fighting to keep unions away from his employees the way his &quot;rich dad&quot; did, then blaming his employees for not investing their shorted salaries).  If Kiyosaki's preference was medical equipment instead of real estate, he'd probably advise us to hang around morgues and funeral parlors to cash in on all those unharvested donor organs lying around...
B000067CQK|5.0|OK OK I admit it. I bought the album for the cute little book. I wanted a David Bowie album, and this adorable packaging made my decision on which one to buy a lot easier. But of course that is not all there is to this record. It is such a great album, so much better than I expected. He mixes guitars and piano like only Radiohead can. When I listened to this album for the first time I immediately thought of a dozen bands this incredible man has influenced through the years. Plus, the book inside brings an interesting prespective on David Bowie, and helps to understand where this album came from. The second CD is also a lovely addition with tracks that are not on the album, and the demo versions of some of the songs. I really appreciate that because it helps to see the evolution of the songs and the album. If you already own this album in regular format, go ahead and buy it for the special book and second cd. If you don't already own this record, why not buy the best edition of it?
B000002HPV|4.0|This CD ends up in fairly heavy rotation whenever I'm doing research, writing a paper or cleaning the kitchen. Even the slow songs move forward with a methodical pace that would shame Baum's Clockwork Man.<br />Favourite tracks are Joga, Alarm Call and Pluto. All three have their special charms, but most particularly I dig the beats on Joga, the lyrics on Alarm Call and the electronic effects on Pluto.<br />This album doesn't rate a five simply because there's no song that combines all these elements perfectly. Still, a really good album, I recommend it highly.
B00000I49J|4.0|This is one of the best bands to come from the eighties. We have them to thank for influencing a lot of the music we have today, and starting a musical revolution (though a small one) called jangle pop. This album is by far the best example of their music. &quot;Happy When It Rains&quot; is a classic song despite its eighties qualtiy. Other than that this album is way ahead of its time. I have a friend who hates eighties music, and I played it for him. Even he was blown away by it. Young or old, black or white, this album has something in it for everyone. However don't make the mistake I did and buy Munki first. If you have made this mistake already I urge you to take another listen to this fine band by buying this album. It worth your time and money. Do not hang a great band for their latter day sins.
B00005JKDR|4.0|This movie really has no weak points. The argument could be made that it has no really strong points, but I don't see that. To be honest, I enjoyed every scene in this movie, from beginning to end. The toddler's a cutie-pit and the Goodman/Crystal combination really throws off sparks.<br />A great kids movie. Not necessarily a masterpiece of a movie, but if you want to entertain children for a while, pick this one up.
B000066F6H|4.0|I recently discovered the reformations that have been occuring in music today when I picked up a little album called \\"White Blood Cells\\" by the White Stripes, and I begged for more of this raw, back-to-the-basics sound. If you too have experienced this or something similar go ahead and pick up this album, Veni Vedi Vicious. The Hives definitely have a hard Ramones/Sex Pistols guitar sound to them, and it makes wonder how the music industry got so over produced. This album is clean, and fun, and a fresh sound for your ears. You only have one set of ears, so be good to them BUY THIS ALBUM.
B000002N2Z|5.0|This cd is one of the first real rock cds that I ever bought along with Weezer (Blue).  I would have to say that this cd is one of my favorites.  I bought this cd around 6 years ago and it still kicks ...  If you havent bought this cd, go out and get it now.  Being considered Korn ripoffs most people havent bought it because most Korn ripoffs ...  Well Deftones blow Korn away.  Also Deftones were around before Korn since they formed in the late 80s.  Buy this cd along with Around the Fur and White Pony.  You wont be diappointed.  Plus your cd collection will have improved about a 1000 times.

There is a lot of information, but it is presented in an easy-to-follow manner and the quotations are set off so that they are easy to read (almost like you are there at the interview). At one point, I almost stopped reading it, but it pulled me back in right away. Although I wish there had been more information on the early handhelds (late 1970s), I was definitely pleased with the coverage it did present. Play on!

B000002GJH|5.0|This is an excellent record, and I wish they would make a follow up.  All the musicians are stellar, with two of the best vocalists not just in recent rock, but in rock history.  Cornell sets a precedent for a type of sound he delves deeper into on his wonderful solo album \\"Euphoria Morning.\\"  He is joined with his fellow bandmate, drummer Matt Cameron, who is currently with Pearl Jam.  Matt is a wonderful drummer, one of the best in the business today, and that he plays very well on this record should come as no surprise.  Of course the other members of Temple come from Pearl Jam, who played in Mother Love Bone.  This was a bright idea to have members of two of the great Seattle bands (Nirvana and the great Alice In Chains being the other two) play a loving tribute to a departed friend who left well before he should have.  Recently, with the death of the extremely talented Layne Stayley, I think it would be utterly appropriate to do a similar project in Stayley's honor.  Way to rock guys, I would expect nothing less from such an all star lineup.

The mood is set, but why set up all the knocking without entering a place, and then he breaks that whole convention in the end with their getting into the lighthouse (build up of power? who knows).<br />BUT..and the biggest but..is when they just POOF appear in the church to behead Holbruck.  If they could do this, the rest of the meager set up makes no or little sense.<br />This movie could have stayed on VHS and gone out of print for all I cared. Why write this and share? Want someone to save money and get a better film.
B000002LMK|5.0|I love Neil Young, and when you have a musician who seems to improve with every album, or who is practically a musical shape-shifter like Neil Young who seems just as comfortable rocking out as he does strumming his acoustic folk.  This album is very heavy on rocking out, and that is a real treat to Neil's fans.  Obviously Neil has many followers, in fact Pearl Jam plays some of his songs pretty frequently in their concerts, including the song \\"F@#king Up\\" which is a standout track on this album.  This album sounds like a group of friends (which all happen to be gifted musicians) joined together in a garage, turned up the amps, and tried to ... off the neighbors.  It has Neil's loose feel to it, after all, only Neil could have recorded this album. I  Even though it isn't his most well known, you will love it especially if you like his rock side, or even if you are a fan of Pearl Jam or Nirvana, cause there are elements of his music in both those bands.  If you are looking to get into Neil Young, this is the perfect place to start, and if you like Neil Young, there is no reason not to have this album.  It's really remarkable that a musician like Neil can stay relevant for so long.  His albums from the sixties are just as important as his albums now, and just as good. ...this album is just as good as his stuff in the 80's 70's and 60's.  He really hasn't lost a step, and he truly is a living legend.  Great Album.

B00006BCAZ|4.0|I've read some of the displeased comments of fans regarding Metanoia in parts because it isn't as song based as &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; or &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; and this is correct, there's not much structure as in the previously mentioned albums. <br />That is to be expected if put into perspective. On Metanoia we hear Porcupine Tree improvising and fleshing out material. To a great extent we get an inside look to the creative process that went into &quot;Signify&quot; as much of this music is from the recording sessions. <br />Fans of earlier Porcupine Tree albums, in particular &quot;The Sky Moves Sideway&quot; will be more interested in this album. Many of the moments from that album, it's ambience particularly on the last couple of tracks would fit well on this CD.<br />As a listener I have taken two approaches to Metanoia. I've listened to it as background music and unlike ambient or insipid &quot;easy listening&quot; these tracks melt into the background. Sometimes you stop what you are doing and the music catches you. It's easy to continue with what you did but you know there is something behind the ambience you hear. The second approach is sitting down, concentrating and listening. To some degree this is nearly impossible. Personally, I drift off when listening to Metanoia. The music is somewhat repetitive at times but there are details within the grooves and ambiences that are there for the discovering. This is an album that rewards listeners with small moments within larger amorphous structures.<br />For people who enjoy song based music it's probably a good idea to pass on Metanoia. For people that like improvisation this is appealing although mostly subdued. In part this is why I haven't reviewed individual songs. The music simply flows and undulates. There are dynamics in these songs but they are more about atmosphere and sonic textural explorations.<br />Metanoia achives the bridge between ambient and groove Eno has been trying for the last few years and does a better job of integrating the two. Great sound quality, interesting interactions between the rhythm section and the keyboard and guitar textures. My parting thought; think Pink Floyd meets ambient electronica, or what they call dark ambient this week :) Or consider this NEU! meets Pink Floyd at top form.
B000000H5K|5.0|This albumn is so great, every metal music fan should have it! Who would have thought the mix of aggressive metal with tribal drums and other native instruments mixed in would sound so awesome.?! Well it does! Play it loud!! Sepultura kicks [butt]!

B00005AAFS|5.0|I am not a person to be completely captivated by celebrities for any reason, ever.  However with Rammstein it is  different story. Don't know what it is exactly, but something captured my soul at first, then showed in true freedom in the raw feeling of this music.<br />Rammstein is, for lack of any better word, amazing.  Positively stunning in every way shape and form.<BR>They are raw untempered fury and unbridled emotion.  By untempered I do not mean that their sound has not been refined to it's highest potential only that it has not been made, as so many bands have been, to fit inside the perimeters of popular music.  Certainly is not untempered for lack of fire. =)<br />While Rammstein certainly deserves all the popularity they get and much, much more, it is their radically different sound and conveyed emotion that makes them what they are.  Herzeleid was a stunning album, I actually bought it after Sehnsucht and thought it was the second one because when I went to buy Rammstein all they had was Sehnsucht.  <br />At any rate, their sound has changed, well, not changed, evolved.. It has kept all of the old feeling and sound and carried on to a higher plateau of musical excellence.  And yet their older albums are still stand alone in their own incomparable excellence, somehow undwarfed by even this new accomplishment in excellence.<br />From the well incorporated \\"techno\\" effects, seemingly to always be precisely directed, to the grinding rifs that drive the sound deep into your mind, even deeper into your soul, the unstoppable and almost singularly melodic rhythm drummed out in a blackened fury, the howling guitar to the deep, guttural angry lyrics and tone of Lindemann, Rammstein's excellence is unrivaled.<br />Rammstein is the epitome of hard-core, there is little, if anything that rivals it in sheer amplitude.   What's more, unlike a good deal of loud music it does not compromise the integrity of the sound for is volume and intensity.  Rammstien needs compensate for nothing.   They have it all.  The driving speed, the deep and fully emotional sound.<br />The more I learn about and hear Rammsteing the more I like them.   Of the 32 CD's I own, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Herzeleid, Sehnsucht,, Mutter and Live Aus Berlin are doubtlessly my favorites.   It is more though, than them being my favorite band.  I have many bands that I like, but for every band except Rammstein, there are song I do not like.  Rammstein has yet to produce something I did not feel privileged to listen to and I am beginning to believe they are incapable of producing inferior music.   <BR>I am unable to pick a mere favorite of their songs, or even a favorite album.   It is all gold.<br />The \\"language barrier\\" for those of you who do not speak German is really non-existent.   There are enough web-sites that have translated the words.  But, more importantly, you do not need to understand the words to enjoy the heavy metal symphony that is Rammstein and to understand the sheer intensity of the emotion.<BR>Rammstein is a veritable unstoppable symphony of sound and emotion .<br />My only strict opinion on Rammstein is that it is only done justice when played loudly.    To mute is a crime.  It's akin to looking at the Mona Lisa with a stick pocking in your eye.<br />So, if you want to ... receive the very best that heavy metal has to offer buy it.   If you want to remain confined to a musical paradigm, don't.<br />Personally, I would have given Rammstein six or even seven starts were it possible to do so.    Five stars seem unjustly limiting on such a musical accomplishment as Rammstein, but thus is rating system.<BR>(note that this my opinion of Rammstein without ever having been able to see them live.)

B000005DQR|5.0|This CD is truly one of the better CD's I have heard.  To be blunt, DJ Shadow (or Josh Davis) OWNS this type of music.  A few others (like DJ Spooky) have come close, but this guy has it all figured out.<br />The CD itself is pure, untainted musical magic.  There are phat beats, quiet interludes, and a he   of a lot of emotions in this CD.  I just wish it was longer and had more tracks.<br />The only thing I don't like about this CD is it can be a little obnoxious at times, but after listening to it all the way through, you won't care!<br />Awesome CD from a awesome DJ.  A true masterpiece.
B000002LOE|4.0|After listening to this CD for the first time in a few years,  I was curious as to what other listeners had thought of it...frankly, I was so dismayed by some of the reviews on this site that I wanted to add another vote in its defence. Granted that Out of Time was an enormous commercial success, but it is also a surprisingly adventurous LP with a crazy-quilt of musical styles (from spoken word to Byrdsy harmonies) and tones (from giddy to anguished). Not to mention that Michael Stipe's performance on \\"Country Feedback\\" is one of the unacknowledged great moments in pop music--his (half?)crazed howl, \\"I NEED THIS\\", may not be Grammy fare, but it could have netted him an Oscar if the rules were more lax.<br />I would strongly recommend this CD to anyone interested in hearing four creative, talented musicians explore \\"pop\\" music as a legitimate genre (instead of just using it as a commercial vehicle). Yes, the big singles have been overplayed, but blame the radio for that. REM has long since   outgrown the abstract jangle-pop that made the group a college favorite, and as far as I'm concerned, the people who have been crying \\"sellout!\\" ever since Green's release have missed out on some of the most intelligent and beautiful music of the 90s.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Dark humor.<br />That by itself is enough to justify this movie.  It is beyond well-made; whoever did the technical work on this movie deserved major recognition.  The music/sound effects are simply stunning (and funny.)  It is funny (as in, a horrible pain will be taking over your sides and you will loose your breath) and interesting.  There is not one dull moment in this entire movie, there is always something going on.<br />The only thing (and another reason to buy it) is that you will need to watch it a few times to get the full effect of the movie.  But, after you see it, you will need to repeat the process a few times.  If you have friends (you better know them well), this is a great way to kill time, as it is better to watch it in a group.<br />Buy it and enjoy!
B00005OC06|3.0|This version of Madama Butterfly is not well-adapted to a film format, I do not recommend it. <br />The director doesn't seem well-acquainted with the medium. His direction is awkward, with clumsy cuts, poor camera work, a plodding pace and flat lighting. The added scenes, such as the opening sequence with a distraught Domingo, as well as the dream sequence during the humming chorus, are unimaginative and don't add anything to the story. <br />The costumes and makeup, too, are unattractive. Freni looks like a ghost in her stark white makeup, and Domingo's attire in the love scene is wholly inappropriate -- a cheap-looking, blue-colored T-shirt that doesn't flatter his pudgy, middle-aged physique. He looks like he ought to be sitting on a sofa guzzling beer and watching football. <br />The only pluses are the acting and singing of the principals, which are quite good throughout.
B000002NFM|5.0|It's great!  What can I say?  I expected Prodigy to start running out of steam (pulling a Crystal Method) and become pop trash.  They have not.  This CD is strong and thoroughly enjoyable.<br />You just need to hear this CD for yourself.  It is full of phat bass and grooves, and they all work together with the (weird!) lyrics to make a truly unforgettable CD.
0316666343|4.0|In a brilliant masterstroke, Alice Sebold kills her 14 year old protagonist on page one, then sets the remainder of this heart-pounding book in a stunningly imagined heaven.  And it's not just one heaven--it's a glorious afterlife of infinite possibility, a bit new-agey, but far more attractive than any described by Western religions.<br />Susie Salmon spends ten years in her heaven, watching and participating in the events of those she loves and of the man who obscenely took her life.  The events involving her family and friends are beautifully, touching rendered, with barely a touch of saccarine.  Several times Sebolds descriptions of metaphysical events are confusing, but you get the point--they're transcendent.<br />The finale is a powerful construction, one that doesn't disappoint after the brilliant body of the work.  We leave loving Susie, having learned from her, and wishing well those she loves, the lovely bones that were given the opportunity to grow on earth as Susie's could not.

B00006690G|5.0|Eminem does it again! With little help from his mentor Dr. Dre, Marshall Mathers has dropped another bomb on the hip-hop community. Eminem pulls no punches on his third, and biggest solo album. <br />In typical Slim Shady fashion he expresses his \\"love\\" for the ladies on tracks like \\"Drips\\" and \\"Superman\\", and he also goes after new victims in the music industry like Moby, Canibus, Mariah Carey, and Jermaine Dupri. But this album isn't about taking shots at pop-stars, he has songs that address our nation (\\"White America\\", \\"Square Dance\\") and hard-hitting rap songs for real hip-hop heads (\\"When The Music Stops\\", \\"Till I Collapse). The stand out tracks on the album are \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\", and \\"Hailie's Song\\". \\"Cleanin Out My Closest\\" not only expresses Marshall's ill feelings towards his mother, but gives a closer look at why. \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" displays Eminem's twisted sense of humor with his daughter Hailie providing vocals and \\"Hailie's Song\\", the highlight of the album, finds Slim singing about the love he has for his child. <br />It may be a long time before the hip-hop community gives Eminem the respect that he deserves, but he has definitely dropped another 5 star classic.
B00000JZC4|4.0|I personally dont think anything of Short bus, amalgamut was a good record, but title of record will beat them all. Tracks like welcome to the fold have good rock eliments and It's gonna kill me is one of the best songs I've ever heard, i like its pop-like verses, and hard chorus.Lively capain bligh is okay, yet shows need of improvement.Techno rock the best things isnt one of the best things on the album, but its a great song.There are a lot of good songs on this album, so check it out
B000069AUI|5.0|Found this CD by accident when I stepped into the Virgin Music store in Time Square.  The CD was playing and it was one of those &quot;who IS that band?&quot; moments.  I'm an old classic rock guy so I'm not up to speed on this alternative rock stuff but this is some great music.  To me, it sounds like a cross between U2 and Dave Matthews with a touch of Beatles sprinkled in.  Check out &quot;Clocks,&quot; the 5th cut on the CD. Makes me want to get in the car and find an open road...
B00006AFUR|5.0|Breaking the mold with their debut, 30 Seconds to Mars has finally hit the music scene. The long-awaited album from the California- based band will not disappoint. The 11 track cd has much to offer to the music enthusiast, and to the newbie. Capricorn, the first track, and also the first single, has taken the radio by storm and left people to wonder, &quot;Who are these guys?&quot; You might have trouble finding out, for the band have been known to be tight lipped, but what is known is their incredible talent for making music. If I were stuck on a desert island, I know what I'd take with me.
B00005QIPH|5.0|First, let me start off by saying that this is one of those albums that grows on you.  I'm sure a lot of the people who gave this album a bad rating listened to it a few times, hated it, and threw into their closet, never to be heard again.  I nearly made the same mistake.  <br />Originality is what makes this album work.  Unfortunately it might be a little too off the wall for peole.  The distortion of Julian Casablanca's voice takes a little getting used to, but after a while it becomes surprisingly catchy. Like the White Stripes, their trying to do something new with rock.  It's for the people who don't want to always hear depressing whining in the music that they listen to.  Rather, this is meant for sitting on your porch and drinking a beer with friends to.  The Strokes aren't trying to be The Saviors of Rock and Roll, as they've been prematurely labelled as.  They're trying to do a new style of rock, and having fun doing it.
0440236304|4.0|The author was a member of A Company of the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne.  While dealing to a certain extent with his training and the preparation phase for the invasion, the book deals primarily with his experiences during D-Day and the days that followed.  <br />Early on the morning of June 6, the 101st along with the 82nd Airborne and other paratroop units were dropped behind the German costal defenses to capture key pieces of infrastructure in order to facilitate a rapid inland thrust from the invasion beaches.  The drops, however, were poorly done and much chaos ensued as the men tried to form up and carry out their missions.  As the book Currahee! graphically describes, the bitter fighting that ensued was fluid and brutal.  Often in small bands (sometimes consisting of men from both the 101st and 82nd) the paratroopers took on whatever Germans they encountered, causing much disruption behind the lines and no doubt lessening the influence of the reserve units that the Germans sent to drive the Allies off of the beaches.<br />This book is a gripping eye-witness account to the D-Day invasion and the role that the 101st Airborne played in it.  A must read for every WWII buff.
B00004SAAY|5.0|I can't say enough about Pinnock performances. His interpretations of Bach's Harpsichord concertos are sprightly and energetic. These recordings are absolutely beautiful with the perfect balance of detail and ambience. Even thou Pinnock uses multiple instruments per part, these recordings come across as well balanced. I'd still like just a touch more volume to the harpsichord, but the sound is in perfect proportion to the number of instruments used. I especially like Pinnock phrasing of the melodic lines. The bouncy and well articulated violin playing compliments the solo harpsichord beautifully which is reminiscent of Leonhardt's historic and still superb recordings from the 1960's (still avialable on Teldec now Elektra/Asylum - #97452 ISDN B000000SPD. I've played these Pinnock recordings over and over again and they are still immensely enjoyable with every repeated listen!<br />Extremely recommended!

B00006AFUR|5.0|AS you can see, I'm a huge fan of 30STM...why i'm a huge fan of them? because they inspired me and the masses, they're music is so fascinating that involves me into their world, a world where there's no pain and hate, just horizonts and people who want to live their lives. 30 SECONDS TO MARS guide us to that world, beginning with \\"CAPRICORN (A BRAND NEW NAME)\\" that means how can someone disappear and start again changing their names...from that moment, the music turn you on and guide you to another place with the song \\"EDGE OF THE EARTH\\" that says to us how can people die eveyday because they lose his faith and start believing on suicide. Now, the ride has become dark and emocional, with the song \\"FALLEN\\" that talks about low self-stimation and commence the violence inside them. \\"OBLIVION\\" says to us how can some silly people just take a look around and don't risk themselves on the ride that is life. \\"BUDDHA FOR MARY\\" is about a girl that is so much different and how she evolves herself just to show to world the other side. \\"ECHELON\\" is a dream. A dream about a world where the sky's are red like the blood, the world has been cut in two pieces, and that to the people is not a good example. \\"WELCOME TO THE UNIVERSE\\" is a song that says to us that the time of death is now here, and that we can't change that, just the time and the masses can do it. The only thing that we can do is wait, watching the pallid sky, walking to the pantheon. The trip is now become faster, as the album plays himself with now a song that you have to listen with an open mind, this song is called \\"THE MISSION\\", that talks about looking in the others persons mind, hiding ourselves from the weaks, travelling through the wild hill.  The next song is about out-world life form, constant waiting for signs and new religions, taking tests and using our instincts to guide ourselves to watch the worlds collide, that song is \\"END OF THE BEGINNING\\". \\"93 MILLION MILES\\" is about cemetary's secrets and the division of teams. The last song of the album, called \\"YEAR ZERO\\" says to us that we can be hero's, killing our egocentratic souls and starting new one's, but standing by the masters, doing what they want us to do, just save them.sion of teams.

B000069CWE|1.0|This is just wrong, I really really do not like this dont get me wrong I like Linkin Park.  I really have respect for bands that combine rap into there great rock music but like most remake cd's this one just fails, I really hope LP gets in the studio to make a new cd they have milked this one completley dry
B000002N2P|5.0|I think that I searched this album so much, that when I found it, i just couldn't stop playing it. The fast and furious \\"jaded\\" just made me want to play guitar,\\"brat\\" was so hilarious to me the first time i heard it, \\"no pride\\" made me value myself for the idiot i am (that's not the idea, i know, but its funny anyway), \\"Walking contradiction\\" is a fast, easy learning song that you keep in your head for so much time. The cover is awesome, it's a great artistic job and a freaky way to scare parents. Anyway, You gotta buy this CD if you want to get a little introduction to the punk world, because its got a lot of punk subjects many liked of this one. Just buy it, you will understand me when you start hearing it.
0881032646|5.0|On recommendation from my husband I read \\"Childhood's End.\\" My husband mainly reads science fiction and I like reading cookbooks, so I did not expect to finish the first chapter of this book.  I finished the book in one day, curled up on the bed under a cover, while dust bunnies multiplied under the furniture. The book also made me think about the way we treat children who are different. As a special education teacher I have seen how some adults dislike children who are labeled as \\"gifted and talented.\\" And sometimes we need someone strong and honest looking over these children, so that their intelligence will not be \\"killed.\\" ANy book that makes me stop and think about my inside and outside world is a book worth reading.That was my take on it.

B000069HKH|5.0|The Rising has to be considered some of the best music from the poet /musician of the Baby Boomer Generation.  As a Springsteen fan since his first vinyl albums who has been disappointed by his past several offerings, The Rising is a return to what originally drew me to Springsteen's music -- haunting, evocative lyrics and infectious pop tunes.  Perhaps it's because Bruce got the band back together.  The E-Street boys (and wife Patti Scialfa) still know how to bring Bruce's music alive.<br />Whether Bruce wrote this music as a way to sort through his own feelings about Spetember 11th or for some other reason, this collection of musical essays works as well as, if not better than, any other thematic album.  Nothing Man and You're Missing tug at your heart as you wipe the tear from the corner of your eye.  Yet, Bruce is able to sound upbeat and optimistic in The Rising and My City of Ruins.  Even the frothy, dancable Let's Be Friends (Skin to Skin)is a well-placed intermission before the second act.<br />This CD is a definite must for any Springsteen fan and well worth a listen, if not a buy, for anyone who is not a Springsteen fan, or who thinks they are not.
B000002KEV|5.0|&quot;Made in Japan&quot; is a work of genius, the musicianship and the empathy  between the band members umatched. This is heavy rock as it should be loud, raw and pretentious with long and sometimes brilliant guitar solos backed up by phenemonal thunderous drumming, excellent keyboarding, very competent bass playing and truly incrediable viocals. From the very beginning you know you are in for something special, the sound of instruments being turned on, volume switches turned up and then you hear the simple snare rhythm that heralds the start of &quot;Highway star&quot;, Gillian introduces the song and then we are away. There is not one song on this Album that lets it down, the live versions all have something  extra that makes them special, that improtu verve that Deep purple did in all their live shows. Hi-lights include a guitar vocal duel between Blackmore and Gillian, the obligatory drum solo fron Ian Paice and a truly classic version of &quot;Smoke on the water&quot; Even if you aren't a Deep Purple fan you should listen to this purely for the sublime musicianship on display by this classic rock band

B00006AW2G|5.0|This is definitely one of the Rolling Stones' best known albums, and its recognition is well-deserved.  If nothing else, this album produced three great hits (Gimme Shelter, Live with Me, You Can't Always Get What you Want).  But the rest of the album is great as well.<br />The sound quality on this album is good--it's not great, but then what do you expect from Britain in the lates sixties?  The remastering was done well, and the sound improved considerably with this.  <br />For many casual Stones fans, there are many greatest hits and live albums that will suffice.  But for the rest of us, those of us who love the band's style of music and want everything we can get, Let It Bleed remains one of the Rolling Stones' best studio albums.
0671510991|3.0|I have always been impressed with Kissinger's lucid discussions of world events, but \\"Diplomacy\\" succeeded in making me feel a bit like a mental pygmy.  I do not refer to Mr. Kissinger's ability to convey his ideas or even their supporting facts.  I actually learned a great deal from this book.  However, Mr. Kissinger's style presumes great familiarity with the subject matter (which he obviously is).  However, as I read the book I felt as if I were listening to a lecture about people whom I hadn't met yet, but were just waiting down the hall.  In other words, \\"Diplomacy\\" presumes that the reader knows a lot about the major players with the familiarity of an intense graduate student.  I must confess that I do not, and the book's tone affected my enjoyment of the book.    Would I recommend this to a student of 18th-20th century western diplomacy?  Of course -- this book gets 5 stars for information.  However, before I would recommend this book as an enjoyable read, I'd ask the reader several questions first.      Perhaps I'm spoiled -- I just read \\"Miracle at Philadelphia\\" and \\"The First Salute.\\"  Bowen and Tuchman are masters at informing and entertaining -- I may have set the bar too high for Mr. Kissinger and other mere mortals.
0316666343|2.0|So many people had talked about how wonderful this book was, so whimsical and wonderful and moving, I just had to get it. I was very let down. It's an interesting concept, but unfortunately, I didn't get into it at all. It was, sorry to say, boring. The writing was very stilted at times and the people were wooden. The heaven portrayed was depressing. I didn't really care what happened to any of the people- I just wanted SOMETHING to happen. The first half of the first chapter is the best part. The title is great, too bad the novel fails to deliver on the promise.
B00006HBUA|2.0|So I went to see this movie expecting absolutely nothing.  I honestly expected to hate it.  I always loved Scooby Doo as a kid, and I CRINGED to think how Hollywood would once again ruin my childhood.  But I found myself actually LIKING this movie.  Lillard was FANTASTIC!  And other than Velma being WAAAAY too hot, the flick was kinda funny and was coming close the the spirit of the TV show.  And then, about an hour into the movie, IT happened.  Scrapy Doo showed up.  Very briefly but enough to totally throw me into a funk.  It was such a cheap trick.  I literally felt like I was just kneed in the privates.  I couldn't breathe, and needless to say I lost interest in the flick.  But then the TOTALLY unexpected happened.  I started gaining interest again.  Slowly.  They were winning me back.  But as Dubbya would say, \\"Fool me once shame on me and then ... um ... er ... you can fool me.\\"  They went and did it again to us.  All I have to say is that when I left the theater I felt violated.  ...
B00005YU1O|5.0|If you are an artist, as I am, this film is so envelope pushing on blending the real world with the animated world that you can shut off the sound and just watch it.  It is worth the money right there because you have never seen a film that looks like this.  And you even get to see a special feature with the inventor of the process working with his drawing tablet and computer monitor so you can learn how it is done.  My husband, who hates animation, loved this because he noticed right away how much more real world everyone looked. Next, if you like the kind of film that explores quirky characters and ideas with lots of conversation, this film contains that in spades.  It reminded me a bit of \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" in that respect.<br /><br />So even when you turn on the sound, there is still a movie that many people will enjoy. There is no other plot per se as this is a film about ideas and daily life albeit in a university setting.  Linklater, the director, is notorious for having made \\"Slackers\\" as his first film.  Some viewers will compare this film to \\"Slackers\\" saying it is a more adult version of that film.  In its quirkiness, it does resemble \\"Slackers.\\" However, \\"Slackers\\" was only a mild nudge of the envelope whereas \\"Waking Life\\" is a full blast push off the cliff.  I bought this film after seeing it.  There was no way I was going to be caught without my own copy if it went out of release.

0606221409|5.0|Fantastic Beasts is a cute little book. I appreciated the effort that went into maintaining the illusion that this was an actual textbook from Harry Potter's \\"World\\", especially the notes scribbled at odd intervals by Harry and Ron Weasley. There's an informative introduction by Albus Dumbledore, and a foreward by Author Newt Scamander. There are also illustrations scattered throughout of some of the 75 Beasts described in the text. A short read, but lots of fun, and a few really good laughs.<br /> Now, onto the real reason to get the book: Proceeds will benefit Harry's Books, a division of Comic Relief U.K., to help impoverished children around the world. Big kudos to the talented J.K. Rowling for donating her time, efforts, and talent to this cause. By buying this book you will be helping needy children, and getting a fun read at the same time. Harry Potter fans won't be disappointed!

0790729652|1.0|It's a shame they released this DVD in the condition it's in. This was a huge, blockbuster movie that made a ton of money and it's not that old so there's no excuse. Also, there are hardly any extras.<br />The movie starts out with some obvious defects and spots on the film in the opening. It's like they didn't even try to find a good print from which to master the DVD. The 5.1 dolby digital soundtrack is among the worst I have heard. This is supposed to be a loud, movie with lots of action. Things like explosions barely even register on the subwoofer. The movie makes almost no use of the surround speakers. It might as well be mono. It's that bad. Then again, the DVD is better than any VHS and at least it's in widescreen which is how it should be unless you enjoy seeing only half the movie. My advice, wait until they remaster this and issue it as a special addition. I wish I had waited to buy it because the shortcomings of the DVD stood out for me so much that it detracted from my enjoyment of the movie.
B00000JCOV|2.0|The only songs that I enjoyed were sic, eyeless, and wait and bleed. The lead singer has a nice voice, however, I just didn't like the cd very much. This is just something some angry, hopeless, teenager who feels like the whole world is against him would like. If you are an angry, hopeless teenager, then this may be a great cd for you. but for me...It's just not something im interesting in. I want something more creative and inspiring...i guess... Anyways...I would like to say eyeless is an awesome song and it just made me go like &quot;wow!&quot; so I gave 2 stars for the first 3 songs after that the cd is just like &quot; ughghgh&quot;  If you wanna hear slipknot, get iowa, that is a decent cd.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I really enjoyed this fantasy movie.  Although it would be impossible to fit every element of the book into the movie, this one comes close.  Every member of the cast seems to fit perfectly into their parts and the special effects were awesome.  A must for Harry Potter fans and everyone else.
B000002HPT|5.0|If you're new to Dream Theater, then you've probably noticed the &quot;stench&quot; surrounding this CD.  Nobody seems to really like it.  People complain that it's too mainstream, or it's not heavy or intense enough.  I have been listening to Dream Theater for years and I can't count how many times I've seen them live on both hands.  That being said, I'll tell you that Dream Theater has not released a &quot;bad&quot; song or album yet.  &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; may not have the technical prowess (&quot;Metropolis pt. 1&quot; from Images &amp; Words) or the lyrical beauty (&quot;Voices&quot; from Awake) of their previous works, but that doesn't make it a bad album.  Songs like &quot;Burning My Soul&quot;, &quot;Peruvian Skies&quot; and &quot;Trial Of Tears&quot; are so much better than everything else out there that it seems like sacriledge to call them fair or bad compared to their older--or newer--stuff.  I have gotten several of my friends to listen to and love this band, and &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; is their favorite still.  If you can contemplate the concept that a song doesn't always have to be godly technical to be good, then you'll love this CD just as well as their others.
055321263X|5.0|Count Fosco--Isidor Ottavio Baldassare Fosco, Count of the Holy Roman Empire, etc.--is as charming and likable a villain as one is likely to meet in literature. This is a brilliant and talented man of the world, a gentle animal lover who raises birds and treats his pet white mice as if they were his children. Count Fosco is also a scheming, cunning and avaricious man, who together with his friend, Sir Percival Glyde, conspire to ruin the lovely Laura Fairlie, who eventually becomes Lady Glyde.<br />_The Woman In White_ is a wonderfully written gothic mystery novel, a romance that is deeply atmospheric with richly developed characters. Each section of the novel is narrated by the participants in this complex yet incredibly involving book, the principals being Walter Hartright, a drawing instructor whose heart is always in the right place, and Marian Holcombe, Lady Glyde's loyal and loving half-sister. And, of course, there is the elusive, ill-fated Anne Catherick, \\"the woman in white,\\"  shrouded in mystery, and the link between Laura Failie (and her identity) and the malevolent machinations of Count Fosco and of Percival Glyde, who is desperate to protect his \\"Secret\\" at all costs.<br />Despite some unresolved loose ends, I was never less than completely immersed in this extraordinary story of treachery, betrayal, but more importantly sisterly fealty and devotion.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Well this album is great as the other ones. Shakira sings to u in spanish and english. She writes her own songs, the lyrics come from her heart. This album is the bomb. Its kind of u to dance belly dancing and tango. This cds made her win her awards and thats what she deserves and more too.
630463949X|5.0|Fleetwood Mac is a legendary band, the creator of the single best selling album of the 1970s and three of that decade's most influential recordings.  But the band was always as famous for its interpersonal explosions as for the music it produced, and throughout the 1980s repeated conflicts effectively destroyed the band's creative balance.  By 1997 the golden line up of Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, Christine McVie, John McVie and Stevie Nicks had not toured or recorded together in a decade, so there were naysayers aplenty when a reunion was announced.  But shortly before the reunion concert, a reporter asked Stevie Nicks why she--a great star and headliner in her own right--would bother with it, once more reduce herself to the level of just one in a group.  Nicks's response was surprising: when I perform solo, it's just me.  When I perform with Fleetwood Mac, THAT is big time rock and roll.  And when Fleetwood Mac reunited and strode out onto the stage for this concert film, Nick's words were phrophetic.  It was, and it is, big time rock and roll.<br />All the members of the band are older now, and it shows--but that is not necessarily a bad thing, for although they have lost some of the brilliant spark that fueled their early recordings and concerts they have gained a tremendous amount of control.  And it shows in the music.  From the concert's opening with &quot;The Chain&quot; all the way to the traditional close with Christine McVie's solo on &quot;Songbird,&quot; everything is slick and flawless.  And the highlights are many.<br />Perhaps the most memorable moments of the concert come from Nicks with her performances of &quot;Landslide&quot; and &quot;Sliver Springs&quot;--the latter's inclusion a personal victory, for she had long battled with Buckingham in an effort to place it on a Fleetwood Mac album and release it as a single.  But although Nicks' star quality tends to dominate the proceedings, both Buckingham and Christine McVie equal her every inch of the way.  Buckingham offers incredible guitar solos, particularly on &quot;So Afraid,&quot; &quot;Go Insane,&quot; and &quot;Big Love;&quot; watching his hands pluck the guitar is simply poetry in motion.  And Christine McVie, famous for the cool detachment of her full-throated vocals, offers stunning performances of her best Fleetwood Mac numbers, including &quot;Over My Head,&quot; &quot;Say That You Love Me,&quot; and &quot;You Make Loving Fun.&quot;  John McVie, as usual, fades quitely into the background to perform his miracles on bass guitar, but Mick Fleetwood is flashy and showy and devilishly fun on the drums--and together they create the backbone that gives the soloists support.<br />Buckingham, Chistine McVie, and Nicks all introduce new material with the concert, some of it more successful than others.  Regretably, Nicks' &quot;Sweet Girl,&quot; although extremely well done, is not greatly memorable--but Christine McVie scores with &quot;Temporary One&quot; and Buckingham's &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; really should have been released as single.<br />Some viewers may complain that the band's current control puts a damper on their energy level.  The ever cool and calm Christine McVie performs so effortless and with such self-confidence that she never seems to break a sweat, and although her opening numbers are extremely well performed Nicks doesn't completely unleash her talents until the second half of the program.  Time has also taken a toll on Nick's voice: her upper notes are gone, a few of her songs have been re-worked in order to accomodate her increasingly limited range, and discreetly placed back up singers (Sharon Celani and Mindy Stein) are worked in to spare her extremely delicate instrument as much of the back-up work as possible; a handful of other expert musicians also support Buckingham, Fleetwood, and John McVie.  And on a technical note, the audio mix could have been better than it is.  No, this is not Fleetwood Mac at its creativeapex--but it is hard to argue to with such a class act, particularly when this is the closest most of the world will ever get to seeing the band in the flesh.  Very welcome, and highly recommended.apex--but it is hard to argue to with such a class act, particularly when this is the closest most of the world will ever get to seeing the band in the flesh.

B00000JBCP|5.0|Once again Mana the best of all. This CD as u can see is Unplugged but that doesnt change the great music from Mana. They are the Maximum. This songs have been sang infront of people. U hear the base and the electric guitar.
0679601686|5.0|I LOVE this book.  I first read Pride and Prejudice when I was 6-7 (I know, a little young, but I love to read), and I loved it. I've read the book 12-13 times, seen both big TV miniseries and the Laurence Olivier movie adaption, and a stage adaption. It remains on my list of top ten favorites. I love everything about it. I love the charming Edwardian language, the character's, and the plot. This book is not a girly fluffy book, even though the plot is a bit of an old one (who knows, maybe the plot came from J.A.?). I fell in love with Darcy and Elizabeth from the very start, and I still love them. I've read this book at least once every year since I first read it, and it just get's better every time. I laugh in it, which is unusual for me, I rarely laugh in books, even funny ones. What more can I say? If you haven't read it, then you ought to, don't just watch the movies. The only thing is that I've never found a guy who has willingly read it, and I've never found one that liked it. What's wrong with our guys?
B00006AFUR|5.0|Imagine, interesting new trends from Hollywood. This CD is strangely familiar as well as hauntingly disconcerting in its strangeness. There's a lot going on here. Deep secrets about the band, the band members, the relationships between a whole new breed of Hollywood kids who think they have a better plan... I sure hope they do, because the planet needs a better plan. If their music is any indication of the elation, ambition and yes, pretention of this band and its interconnections to other celebrity progeny, then we're in for a rough ride. This CD hasn't left my player since I got it...How I heard about it? One of their Ninja Echelon tactical pr team snuck into a turned off local high school radio station and played the CD for a solid 24 hours non-stop before \\"the adults\\" ever noticed... By then, the entire County had heard the sounds coming through loud and clear. This band could spark a revolution. Powers that be... beware... the fat lady is singing... RC
630463949X|5.0|I have heard of the band during my high school days, but it wasn't until I saw the concert on PBS that made me go out and buy the DVD- and my god!!! WHAT A SHOW!!! The music is fantastic and I never knew just how good Lindsay Buckingham played the guitar, he was fabulous. Of course Stevie Nicks' voice is out of this world. I only wish they would get back together and tour again so that i can have a chance to see them in concert. i also bought the making of 'rumors- which made me see the band thru a different perspective, I am a life long and always will be a lifelong fan of theirs.

0738206679|4.0|This book is ideal for those who are interested in learning how network theories relate to a wide variety of topics.  The author relates his research of network topology to many systems including the internet, terrorist organizations, and the cell's metabolic web.  The text is clearly written and easy to read - no background in the area is needed.  Thus the ideas in the book can be absorbed in a few hours.  This will be time well spent to anyone who may have heard about 'scale-free networks' and 'power laws,' but doesn't have a good grasp of these concepts. The book does not offer much new information beyond the authors published scientific papers (a very impressive string published in the most prestigious scientific journals), but does present these ideas as a cohesive whole with interesting background information.
B00006F2TV|5.0|I was surprised to find I enjoyed this movie even more than Attack of the Clones--and I'm a big Star Wars fan. Partly it was the novelty of the movie, since I didn't know as much about Spiderman man as I did about Superman and Batman, for example, when I was a kid and was reading comics. And partly it was the fact that this was a more intimate movie than Attack of the Clones, since it concentrates on many fewer personalities and goes much more into the development of the Peter Parker character and his immediate family and friends (as well as his enemies).<br />The movie does a great job of realizing Spiderman's abilities, which are put to good effect in the movie. The fight scenes with the Green Goblin are really well done, and the movie seems to succeed without nearly the amount of special effects that the Star Wars movies are using.<br />One minor detail. In the original comic strip, Peter acquires his amazing abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. In this movie, he's bitten by a genetically engineered super-spider, whose DNA interacts with his own to give him his new-found abilities.<br />All in all a great movie for the summer. Big Steve says go see it and don't Bogart the popcorn.
B000069HK2|5.0|unreal CD, and unreal band.  one of my favorite bands.  everyone that likes rock or punk, should give this a try.<BR>what kind of music is it?  most people call it emocore, but i'll simply call it great music.
B000002N2P|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best Green Day CD ever. This goes out to all who wanted to hear endless reruns of Dookie on all Green Day CD's. This is so much more.<br />This is an energetic, loud, fast, angry punk CD, all captured without losing a shade of Green Day's catchy tunes and upbeat melodies. If you want to hear some awesome music get this and listen to Armatage Shanks, Panic Song, Geek Stink Breath, Jaded, Walking Contradiction, and Stuart and the Ave. All are probably my favorite Green Day songs.<br />This is so much more than Dookie. It's like Dookie on Steroids AND Valium.
B000002WU9|3.0|I have read many reviews on this site and on a few others, of how Raekwon's &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx&quot; is one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. So, judging on the large number of people who have accoladed the album, I went out and purchased a copy. Naturally, due to all the glowing reviews, I thought it would be a superb album. After the first listen, I found I liked none of the songs. But I persisted on listening to the album, trying extremely hard to like it. And after at least 15 listens to the disc, I can say it is rather disappointing.<BR>        Sure, it contains excellent songs like &quot;Ice Cream&quot;, &quot;Wu-Gambinos&quot;, &quot;Verbal Intercourse&quot; (featuring an outstanding verse from Nas) and &quot;Incarcerated Scarfaces&quot;. Not to mention a few decent cuts in the remix of &quot;Can it be all so Simple&quot;, &quot;Criminology&quot;, &quot;North Star&quot;, and depending on your mood, the eerie &quot;Rainy Dayz&quot; and the dark, sad, emotional &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;. In fact, there are no really bad tracks on the album. It's just that a number of them suffer from being rather bland. Raekwon's and Ghostface Killah's rapping is too solid its own good, and lacks expression, meaning the songs lyrics are not paid the attention they deserve due to Raewon's voice being buried in the RZA's adequate yet bland backing tracks. <BR>          &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx&quot; is an adequate album, but is far from being one of the best of all time, let alone 1995. While it has its share of good tracks, the number of bland tracks on this album brings down its greatness considerably.
B000069AT7|5.0|Remember back in the early 80's, when movies actually contained a great deal of heart and emotion to captivate their audiences? This time period was probably the golden age for movies, combining good visual effects with effective storytelling, unlike today's cardboard, computerized theatrical wasteland. Coming right in the middle of the classic Star Wars trilogy, this movie actually rivaled it in terms of magic and heart. I can't remember how I felt the first time I saw it, it was so long ago, but I'm sure the scenes of E.T. dying had to have everyone in the movie theater bawling, as well as the final scenes where he is about to leave and Elliot gives him a hug. The musical score is excellent, just as good as Star Wars. For some reason, even John Williams can't compose music like this anymore,(just check out the new Star Wars movies), maybe the movies themselves actually have to be magical for him to compose a magical soundtrack. This has to be both the saddest and, at the same time, most uplifting movie ever made, and unlike movies like Titanic, the emotions actually stay with you after repeated viewings. I haven't seen the \\"updated\\" version, and I don't plan to because I absolutely hated the Star Wars Special Editions, and I'm afraid this movie may be ruined as well. It shows the current state of moviemaking that they keep having to re-release movies from this \\"golden age\\" because they just can't recapture the magic of these films today, which would be fine with me if they would just leave the films as they are. At least we can watch the original versions on VHS, and we had better enjoy them because, from the looks of things, they will never make another classic movie again, especially as far as sci-fi is concerned. Do you really think kids watching these new Star Wars films will feel the same way about them when they are adults as we do about the originals? Not likely.
B000066NW0|5.0|You either like it, or you hate it. I love it. I bought the CD 2 months ago, and it is worn out. The songs never get boring, and there is a very wide variety of songs. The album starts out with Losing Grip, the most punkish on the album (Avril's personal favorite), then to Complicated, which is more pop. Further down the line is Tomorrow and Things I'll Never Say, which are slower. This CD is amazing, and my mom, who doesn't like this kind of music, even puts it in when I'm not in the car.<br />... Avril is very talented, and has a fantastic voice...
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Zack de la Rocha made rap-rock one of the rising genres in the '90's, along with guitarist Tom Morello and the rest of Rage Against the Machine.  This album, as well as the rest of Rage's music, is a mix of hip hop, heavy metal, and anti-political material.  Yes, this is very political, but that doesn't mean that it is bad.  One other unique thing is about how Tom Morello plays the guitar, managing to coax squeaks, squaks, and bleeps from his guitar.  Through this unique style, Morello ultiimately paved the way for today's rock DJ.  Rap-metal is usually the second worst genre (rap is the worst), but this is one of the few exceptions. Rage's work is brilliant, and they are one of the two good rap-metal bands of the '90's. (the other is Korn) ANYWAY, metalheads will love this, so buy it.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This explosive album completely caught me off guard.  I bought it on a hunch, and was blown away by what I got...  The style of 30STM's music is the perfect blend of Metal, Techno, with just a hint of Prog.  They take everything I like about those three styles and orchestrate them in such a way that they define a new style.  The first track, 'Capricorn', is powerful, graceful, tasteful, and damned awesome.  But the only song I heard before I bought the CD ('Edge of the Earth') I downloaded online, to see if this band was worth owning.  I was hooked after the first 10 seconds.  I recommend this album to anyone that enjoys any aspect of at least one of the styles above.  It will blow you away!
B00002EPMF|5.0|This record came as a complete surprise. Being a fan of Chuck and Death for quite some time (since '91) I knew he was awesome, but Control Denied still swept me off the floor. Some reviewers seem to accept that it is a great effort, but sort of dismiss it as mere technical exercise. Not so! Each and every song on this album is a technical, melodic and SONGWRITING masterpiece of Pure Metal. The playing is brilliant, the structures are brilliant, the riffs and melodies 100% genius, even if some have a tinge of classic metal/thrash to them. Nowadays, no artist in any genre can be said to sound 100% original, without the slightes trace of another artist's influence on the music. I mean, a band like Primus, which to me is as original and unique as it gets, often has elements traceable to bands like Rush, Yes and bassist Stanley Clarke. I say this is one of the top 5 Metal albums EVER. Period.
6303257844|5.0|This is a fun movie, and one of the most entertaining movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The plot is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity: a bunch of innocent people, plus a cop, are on a bus. A terrorist has put a bomb on the bus, so if the bus slows down everyone blows up and dies. And the bus happens to be on an ordinary, crowded big city highway. So once you realize ( very early on in the movie ) that the bus is definitely *not* going to blow up, you can enjoy the ride. So once we're handed the simple, bare-bones scenario, we get to see every single complication that can occur with one speeding bus, scared people, and public roads. Every single possibility of loss of life and horrible danger is explored in loving detail. That is where this movie gets really fun: just sit back and enjoy the ride. That's all you have to do with this movie.
0812550706|5.0|I think this book it the best book in the world, and I'm not just saying that.  I personly enjoy science fiction books and fantasy books.  Although it is an anormous book, it is well worth the late hours on my bed reading and reading and reading. <BR>I love it because it is action pacted, has a great story line, and best of all, I can relate to the main character.  This book takes place hundreds of years from know.  It's about a younge boy that goes in a revolving battle station in the Earth's gravitational pull.  In this battle station, instructers teach other younge boys and girls how to be fighter pilots for the wars in the future.  Everything seams to go acourding to plans when a new batch of kids come.  In that batch, there's a kid who breaks all the rules and rises up against the intructers.  They were going to send him back when they found out he was a genis.  After much tormoil and cunfusion for the younge boy, he made it to the big leages.  All he has to do is pass a test, a test thats he has been training for.  A test that he didn't know he was training for.  This test is a videogame, or is it more . . .
B00004Z459|1.0|This is just baaad! Lets see, I will put rap and turntables with a few riffs and I have Linkin Park. And the worst part is people actually believe they are listening to metal!!! Thats what is sooo dumb about it all! If you REALLY know what metal is you would know this is NOT metal at all! Real metal-Godsmack, Pantera, Slayer, old Metallica. Nu-Metal that is good-KoRn, Distrubed, System of a Down, Slipknot, and Mudvayne to name a few. BUT Linkin Park should not even be classified as nu-metal! It is an insult to people that actually know what metal is! How you know this isnt metal is because teen girls enjoy it. They like it because Chester Bennington is \\"hot\\" and he sound like Nsync. If you put rap, pop, and a few pitiful riffs into a blender you would get this. Do everybody a favor and dont classify this as metal, more like \\"rapcore\\".
0345448898|5.0|I love this trilogy and have gotten all of my friends who read to read it to. It must say something that there are already 150 reviews on this book!! I think his opinion of religion is right on. Just look at what has happened historically. I disagree with some though I think the main protagonist is great, she is brave, thoughful, caring and tough. I wonder if she was a man if people would not like her more. I am hooked on reading all of his works right now. Interesing review this month in Vanity Fair on him, and he was covered in BBC all month. Very though provoking. With the violence on television that is prevalent I see no harm in a mature child reading this trilogy. Enjoy!!
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem has made an excellent album filled with infectious beats and rythmes. This Cd has a few singles on it:Cleanin Out My Closet, Without Me, and soon to be more. He is still #1 in the rap industry and this album proves it. It stayed at #1 for weeks. Anyway its a definite must own of 2002. I got this Cd and Korns Untouchables and had a music filled summer. This is a must own if you like rap and Eminem.
B00005JKDR|4.0|This was a very entertaining movie for people of all ages! It had a lot of laughs! And, of course, the animation was superb!! But it didn't quite compare to Toy Story! It seems to drag in some parts! The DVD extras definitely make up for that though!! A &quot;must-have&quot; DVD for everyone's collection!!
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down are one of the best nu-metal bands EVER!! I personally think that System are alot better than Rage Against the Machine EVER was. I love the middle eastern influence heard in their metal, it gives them a unique perspective. Anyway this album is HIGHLY reccomended to anybody that likes nu-metal bands like Slipknot or Rage Against the Machine.
0060278234|5.0|I was absolutely astounded when I saw that people in Amazon had rated this book lower than Nix's last in the series - Sabriel !at 5 *s.  Actually, I gave them both 5 stars, but this one is still better.).  <br />This book is written to endear us - and it's better than Sabriel because it has a dog in it!! Lirael is someone we can empathise with, and Sabriel and Touchstone make a comeback which completely explains the life they have made for themselves.  <br />The only problem with this book is the way it left us dangling at the end!! I can't wait for The Abhorsen, Garth Nix!
B000069HKH|5.0|It seems that all New Jersyans are born to be Bruce fans.  I am not however, one New Jersyan that has succumbed to that theory over the last twenty years (or more)as rock fan.  And frankly, in the past, I had been put off by Bruce's over the top rock-as-sport-event live performances and seemily forced sincerity.<br />The first chink in my anti-Bruce armor came with \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\"' which I thought was a remarkably understated album filled with delicious musical and lyrical momemts.<br />\\"The Rising,\\" with a few exceptions, is a remarkable album from every perspective; musically, lyrically, subjectively.  Obviously, this album is heavy with Sept. 11th themes but it handles them in a remarkably light (maybe not the right word) touch.  It takes the themes of loss and pain and puts them into a more universal perspective which, for me, hits just the right notes of respect and reverence without pandering.<br />This is a mature rock album.  It gives hope that rock is not just the provance of the under-30 crowd and can still be relevant to at any age.  We of the rock generation suffer from the youth culture syndrome that just because an artist ages he/she is a \\"dinosaur.\\"  Albums from Neil Young, Dylan and now Bruce over the last few years has proven this isn't the case.<br />The Rising is a great album.  Perhaps the significance of its subject matter gives it added psychic weight, but it is an undeniably important rock album that deserves your consideration.  And while its art will surely not outlive the memory of it's inspiration, let's hope that years from from now we can think back on this album with the same positve feelings that members of the WWII generation remember \\"White Christamas.\\"

B000001DU5|5.0|You know the problem with most \\"greatest hits\\" albums; some suits at the record company sans clues choose just the \\"hits\\" and leave many fan favorites, or some songs that should be automatically included are mysteriously absent.  That said, this greatest hits is one of the best I have encountered.  Tears for Fears was always so much more than just their singles, and non-hits like \\"I Believe\\" and \\"Advice for the Young at Heart\\" (a #1 song in a perfect world) make this collection indispensable.  The real icing on the cake, however, is the new song included here, \\"Laid So Low.\\"  Whenever a band puts a \\"new\\" song on a greatest hits CD, it's usually something they scraped off of the bottom of their trash can at home and threw it on tape.  I can probably count the worthy \\"new\\" songs on greatest hits packages on one hand, and this inclusion is easily the best I've heard.  \\"Laid So Low,\\" with its dynamite lyrics and propulsive beat is one of the top three songs EVER from TFF, and makes this collection a must-have for anyone who likes literate pop.
B0000024JA|3.0|THIS ALBUM WAS FAR FROM A CLASSIC IN MY OPINION LETS TALK ABOUT THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE ALBUM.WHEN I HEARD BISCUTS THE BEAT WAS DOPE BUT HIS MIC WAS CUT DOWN ROBBING ME OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING. THE SONGS THAT SAVE THIS ALBUM WAS PROTECT YA NECK,MR.SANDMAN,RELEASE YO DELF. OH YEAH I FORGOT THE METHOD MAN REMIX. THIS ALBUM IS NOT METHOD MANS BEST WORK.
B000024GHY|5.0|This CD made quite an impression on me as a kid in 1976, and I understand that it impressed the entire planet too. No one has changed the scene of electronic music like Jean-Michel Jarre, and no one can challence him and win. Unfortunately his last CD's have been disappointing, but fortunately for him his older works still makes him the king of electronic music. I own a giant collection of electronic music but it does just not compare to his early works. This records is composed much like classical music by famous composers like Mozart, Bach etc. etc. but of course just not the same kind of music. But he pays just as much attention to every details as the them. A genious!
0767830555|5.0|Do you remember the name John Hinckley? Hinckley was the guy who attempted to assassinate Pres. Ronald Reagan. What does this have to do with \\"Taxi Driver?\\"<br />The premise of this beloved film is, Travis Bickle, played by none other than \\"Bobby D,\\" attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate in an attempt to gain the attention of \\"Betsy\\" (Cybil Sheppard), who works for this candidate, who Travis also has the hots for. There's a line that Travis narrarates, \\"I've got to do something big.\\"<br />While Jodie Foster, \\"Iris,\\" (the 13 year old prostitute), was in college (at Yale or Harvard, I forgot), John Hinckley was \\"stalking\\" her and writing her all sorts of disturbing letters. Eventually, as we all know, or forgot, or are now learning, he attempts to assassinate Pres. Ronald Reagan. Hinckley apparenty does this in an attempt to gain Foster's attention, imitating the film. At the time of the attempt, he apparently was even dressed like \\"Travis,\\" in that he was also wearing the army field jacket. And in the pocket? A copy of \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"<br />The movie \\"Taxi Driver\\" went far beyond the cinema. Indirectly, this film has affected the federal firearm laws that are on the books today. For whatever disturbing reason, Hinckley in imitating this movie, thought that assassinating a president would gain him the attention of Jodie Foster. In his assassination attempt, he ended up shooting James Brady, who in turn had a hand in changing federal firearm laws, by implementing the \\"Brady Bill.\\"<br />The \\"Hinckley\\" case is one that really tested the \\"insanity defense.\\"<br />So, a little piece of useless movie trivia, where life imitates art.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I'm referring specifically to the writing. The plot was so contorted, so unbelievably farfetched that it forfeited the right to be called science fiction and instead became fantasy.  Why even have the pretext of science? (like the green house flooding, \\"advanced\\" robotics and cryogenics.)  It was actually going along pretty well (I thought) until the Flesh Fair.  When that crowd turned from a blood thirsty mob, into a bleeding heart moral majority I realized the whole point of the movie was to make some sappy point - at the expense of all other aspects of the film.  The final death blow is the underwater scene in which David is trapped in a submersible at Coney Island under the ocean.  Let's see....what to do now...I know! Freeze him for 2000 years.  Will have a narrator explain what's going on!  Folks, that's called painting yourself into a corner. Like when a child writes a story and the hero suddenly finds a treasure map on the sidewalk.  It's a gimmick, a quick fix.  To my utter amazement, this went on for another half hour.  They bring back the mother (but only for 1 day cause the space time continuum only permits one day of resurrection) and then they fall asleep forever.  Oh wait, there are aliens too.  I'm surprised God didn't show up. If you manage to identify with the hero you'll get some emotional juice out of this movie. Other than that, it's a narrative disaster.
B00005JKDR|5.0|MONSTERS INC. is a thoroughly enjoyable and highly delightful movie about the world of monsters. You will laugh and you will &quot;awww&quot; when you watch this movie. It's a great cinematic picture from Disney/Pixar, and the animation is breathtaking. <br />The premise is cute: in the world of Monstropolis, the inhabitants are all monsters whose job everyday is to scare all the world's children to power their city, which is quite charming. We focus in on two particular monsters: Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and his pal Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal). Sully is trying to maintain his status as the #1 scarer of all in Monstropolis. But when a young sweet little girl crawls her way through her door into the world of Monstropolis, it's up to Mikey and Sully to get her back before everyone sees her and causes widespread panic, as humans are thought of as &quot;toxic&quot; in the world of Monstropolis.<br />You will love this charming tale, which will make a wonderful holiday movie, or if you're just in the mood for laughs and maybe even funny scares, you will surely love MONSTERS, INC. A highly delightful and very entertaining animated film indeed!
B000002OX7|5.0|I remember listening to this album for the first time at the age of 13 and being mesmerized by the soaring vocals of Daltry, the power chords, mastery and writing of Townshend, the maniacal drumming of Moon and the melodic genius of Entwhistle on bass.  Probably the purest assembly of great rock on a single CD.  With the addition of new tracks in the 1995 remix, including Pure and Easy and Baby Don't Do it, this album will always be in my top 5.  Today, I still workout, dream and pray with Who's Next in the background and in my mind.  Enjoy, my sons and daughters!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think you either love this film or hate it. I watched it again last night and absolutely loved it all over again. Every scene is a wonderful feast for the senses and even the tragic, sad ending is perfect. All of the performances are excellent and its great to hear their own voices singing the songs. I think its a film for anyone who is open to a different type of film experience. Sit back and enjoy the ride...
B000000OUW|4.0|At least according to Manowar they did. If the gods made heavy metal then surely Manowar must be their emmisaries, playing  metal like it should be, loud and fast.<BR>On Louder Than Hell Manowar pretty much sticks to their old &quot;powermetal&quot; formula, there isn't any surprises on this album, but why change the formula when it works so well? <BR>Manowar gives us their usual mixture of hard and fast heavy metal, and the occasional power-balad, like the moving Courage.<BR>Of the fast and hard tracks I could mention The Gods Made Heavy Metal, which is a hilarious song, with a fantastic beat.<br />As I said, nothing is new on Louder Than Hell, and we can only be thankful for that. You don't really want progressivenes when you buy a Manowar album, you want MANOWAR, and that is what you get on Louder Than Hell.
B00003CXI0|2.0|The book is 100000 times better. The movie cut or modified over 75% of the plotline(Snapes Questions, Peeves, having a wands, midnight duel, second Quiddich Match, conversation between hagrid...)THE BOOKS IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!(I am a harry potter fan)I hope Chris Culumbus would do  better next time.<br />  Lord of the Ring fans,DO NOT dismiss the book because of this junk, HARRY POTTER BOOK IS MUCH BETTER(a thousand times better)THAN THE MOVIE!!<br />from a Harry Potter Fan
B00004XQP4|1.0|i never thought i would see the day.my favorite punk band has become pop.i loved kerplunk,slappy hours, and nimrod. i had mixed feelings about insomniac,but dookie was my favorite.when i heard minority on the radio i knew i had to get this cd.so i bought it,took it home, and put it in my cd player.i expected more cool punk tunes but all i heard was this god-awful pop music. since when is green day supposed to be soft?i know theyre maturing, but this sounds like a whole new band!hopefully soon they realize how good they once were.but right now, i have one word for you green day:SELLOUTS!
B00005J6UP|5.0|I was 4 years old when I saw this,I'm 21 now and could never tire of it.It was and still is one of the best movies of my childhood.And I still want that Purple Rain shirt(lol).We follow the adventures of Mikey,Brand,Mouth,Data,Stef,Andy and who could forget Chunk.NO ONE!!! It's one of Richard Donner's best films I think his first best will be and forever will be Superman.When I heard that this awesome classic was going to DVD,I ran out of the house to buy it,even though I did have it on video,DVD is way better.I wished they had more outtakes on it but I loved the DVD.But they have other cool stuff on the DVD,The making of the Goonies,Commmentary,The Goonies R Good Enough music video and theatrical trailer.Didn't we all want to move down to Astoria,Oregon after seeing this?I know I did,just so I could find that [great] waterslide.I hope like E.T.,that they bring back The Goonies to theaters for it's 20 anniversary,if they do,I'll be one happy kid to see my favourite kids movie in the theater for the first time.Have fun and remember for now and forever.THE GOONIES R GOOD ENOUGH!!!
B00003CXDV|5.0|I did not expect to like this movie at all and instead found it on my short list of favorites.  It's clever, hysterically funny, well acted, and all around good fun.  The whole family can enjoy it but it's not condescending.  Particularly funny are Sam Rockwell and Tony Shaloub - they steal every scene they are in (whether together or alone)!  I highly recommend this for all ages - corny, campy, and fun to watch again and again.
B00005JL3A|5.0|First of all people say this is a rip off of other movies ie: Night of the Living Dead. Well in a way yes but this movie is also it's own movie.<br />Resident Evil is based on the fact that a Virius infects the hive which is an underground research facility. This causes them to turn into Zombies which is the basic plot of the Movie and the games so it cannot really rip off night of the living dead when it is based on the game which has zombies in it.<br />To really understand this movie you have to understand the game so unless you are a zombie fan, video game fan or someone who enjoys watching movies like this then you may not like this. This movie isn't for everyone, But from my point of view this movie was a really really good movie, great plot and sepcial effects as well as sound and cast.
B000066AXE|5.0|I was so eager to watch this movie and it was truly worth it..! Usually Oscar winning drama movies have a different taste that you might have difficulties to swallow... but A Beautiful Mind keeps you thrilled and attached to the movie all the way until it ends... it's the kind of story that you never get enough from and keeps you curious until the end!<br />The movie is full of surprises all the way until the end... it's a story of love &amp; struggle and believing in yourself and your love! It's very touchy especially when you know it is a TRUE STORY!
B0000028VT|5.0|Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand all have one thing in common; they have a tendency for singing ballads with oomph! Yes, they get loud, they come on strong, and sometimes they sound almost like they are screaming, but we love all of them just the same. MUSIC BOX is essentially an album of ballads, many of which are sung, you guessed it, with oomph! There are exceptions such as the title cut &quot;Music Box&quot;, &quot;Without You&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Just To Hold You Once Again&quot;. But make no mistake, this is not an album without gusto, as &quot;Now That I Know&quot; proves. This very danceable cut is a jewel. &quot;I've Been Thinking About You&quot; is another lively number. The album ends with the lovely &quot;All I've Ever Wanted&quot;. Mariah proves herself with this album, having written all but one song (&quot;Without You&quot;). She also had great success with &quot;Dreamlover&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; (another personal favorite). So dust off your preconceptions about ballad-oriented albums and give this MUSIC BOX a listen. You'll love what you hear.
B00005QIPH|3.0|The Strokes are one of those bands I love to hate.  Overall the album is not bad. Its got catchy tunes, and their image is fully intact throughout.  But thats just it.  They don't create their image on this album, its almost as if their album was produced simply to protect their image. <BR>    They don't take any chances, they stick to the formula, it all seems a little calculated.  It was less than what I felt they made themselves out to be.  I don't hate the strokes by any means, but it all seems a little dry and juvenile.
B000001DV2|2.0|I remember full well when this CD came in 92 the year of grunge of course it went in at #1 in the charts everywhere.  With a handful of tunes written/co-written by the great late Steve &quot;steamin&quot; Clark I thought this'll be all right well I was wrong for the most part sugary sweet sappy ballads (well this is the same DL we've had ever since this album). These guys no longer rock I really tried to like the 99 release Euphoria but alas Viv is really no replacement for Steve.  You'd think given Vivien Cambell's past Def Leppard would ROCK AND ROLL.  I know that Phil Collen was playing all the guitar parts by himself on this album the band should have gotten a tempory replacement in the studio at least (to play Steve's parts). Well at least their are 4 master pieces of work from these guys prior to Adrenalize.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is an album worth spending some time with.  Its songs are original, varied, genuine, emotional, fun, elegent, prolific and they prove that you can be all these things without loosing your pop sensibility.  For me it was the lyric writing itself that was the real gem of this album.  His literary voice is so fresh, these guys are real artists, yet they don't come off that way. And that's the beauty of this album for me.  Its thoughtful and breaks ground, but won't alienate the audience like  Radiohead's latter records. This is a very tasteful pop album.
B00006AFUR|5.0|From start to finish this CD takes the listener on a fantastic journey, into through, and out of the complex and often haunting world that is the music of 30 Seconds To Mars. The music is an interesting blend of sweeping and dramatic instrumentals, other worldly vocals, and heavy guitar riffs...leaving the listener somewhere out in space even after the CD has stopped playing. This band proves to be a definite entity of its own in the often bland and un-original world of rock music today.
B000002H97|2.0|After great masterpieces such as Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice For All, Metallica decided to go mainstream, isn't that a synonim for selling out? From fast thrashing songs full of masterfull solos, Metallica turned into another mid-tempo 5 minutes radio songs. Regardless, all that shouldn't matter, the songs are plain &quot;not-as-good.&quot; Definitely it's a must have, it's also way better than the albums to come from Metallica, but this is the end, of Metallica as a metal band. Don't expect headbanging stuff here. Expect hard-rock. Highlight: &quot;The Struggle Within&quot; great intro, great riff, great solo, definitely one of Metallica's most interesting songs. Low: &quot;The God That Failed&quot;, just not a good song, slow and boring.
0380799006|5.0|Are you tired of your children fighting over everything big or small? Are your nerves frayed at their ends? Are you spending too much time setteling your childrens' agruments? This excellent book teaches parents all these different techniques to help children help themselves solve their sibling problems without violence and parental intervention.<BR>When investigating the problem of sibling rivalry, the culprit and the root of the problem comes from parents' attitudes toward their children. Are you a parent that has labeled your children? Sometimes parents attach a label to their children without realising it and the consequences are creating excesive pressure on the children to play a certain roll that they have no desire to but continue to act it out in order not to hurt the parent.<BR>Children want to be heard and adults must first learn to listen and acknowledge the childrens' feelings. When children are mad or angry, it is important that we help the describe what they are feeling and let them know that it is alright to be mad, sad, angry or disappointed, however it is not acceptable to hurt the person with whom they are having conflict. The whole idea of this solution sounds like it was concieved in some fairy tale but it works about 90 percent of the time to reduce the tension between the fighting children in our family. After the tensions have subsided between the siblings, the parents suggest the children find a solution to their problem and they actually come up with some creative things.<BR>The authors have integrated numerous real live scenarios they have encountered from parents who have participated in their seminars over several years.<BR>Two years ago I purchased a book from the same authors, \\"How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and How to Listen so Kids Will Talk\\" which brought a lot of peace and sanity between parents and children. As our family expanded, the conflicts and bickingering between siblings started to increase and with the help of this bookthey are now on the decline. <BR>An excellent book that all parents should read.
B000068R88|4.0|Just because you see a little girl on the mic, don't mistake it for pop music!  This girl is no pop princess.  Shes gorgeous but not even close to Britney...better.  She writes her own music and doesn't need all the dance moves to show her self, she got talent.  Her music is punk...so get ready!
B000068QY7|4.0|Oasis are a band you either love-or-hate, there is no \\"I kinda like them\\" with these guys. <br />This CD was a nice bounce-back from the boring, Pro-Tooled and sequenced/remixed to death \\"Standing...\\". Gem Archer and Andy Bell have really rejuvinated this group - these two are far better musicans than Bonehead and Guigsy and thier presence has greatly improved the musicanship of the group. Gem's \\"Hung In a Bad Place\\" is a great rockin' tune with an excllent vocal from Liam. \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" really touches the heart - its Noel's best big ballad since \\"Wonderwall\\" and a excellent melody. Also another good thing is that most of the songs dont run too long with a overblown production - a big fault of \\"Be Here Now\\".<br />The biggest surprize is Liam's songwriting - yeah his lyrics are still babyish trite but the band knocked these basic and sketchy songs into really memorable tunes. Hope he keeps writing, there might be a classic song banging around somewhere in that crazy brain of his.<br />If the marketing Bozos at Epic USA (who promote Oasis like they did the Hollies and other UK bands in the 1960's - with little or no respect) can get \\"Heathen Chemestry\\" on USA radio and MTV they will gain the success the band has had in the UK and abroad. This is a fine CD that can convert the unconverted!
0345409671|4.0|This book explores more controversial views than any of her other ones. I certainly did not mind it, it actually made the book more interesting. It made me think about the religious world more clearly. It did drag a bit though. I recommend this book if you like philosophy.
B000060OFT|5.0|This movie is done so well, and is great to watch over and over again.
B000002HRE|1.0|This was one of the first albums I bought that I was dissapointed with. Load was better, and as back in Metallica albums you go, it gets better. \\"Fuel\\" is a fun song to listen and to play on guitar, but the rest is better left to rest. 'The Memory remains\\" has some nice bluesy riffs, but it's more of a Creed song than a Metallica song. As the album goes by, you will the deception too. Soft rock fans will find this an interesting offer from Metallica with songs as \\"The Unforgiven II\\", not bad at all, in fact, very interesting to listen to. Highlights: \\"Fuel\\" not metal, but regardless a great tune. Lows: monothony of the rest of the album.
0694013889|5.0|This has been one of my 19 month old daughter's favorite books for a month now. She brings it to me saying \\"poo-poo\\" and never tires of hearing the story of Prudence and her potty. We even made the middle part interactive where they question what the potty is; I ask \\"Is it a...\\", and she says, \\"Nooo...\\" It's just the right length as well.
B00005ATQI|5.0|Who would watch a movie like this and why? That's, good people, what I'll tell you. Do you like horror movies, visual art, a good romp through psychological waters with a comedic twist? No? Well, you'll still like this. The plot will make you think, don't worry. For a first time viewing during the beginning you may find yourself going, \\"What the...?\\" but trust me. You will love getting scared to this. Now for some fun facts to aid in the visual digestion process. The movie was taken from Steven King's novel with the same name. King didn't like it because the plot was changed but Kubrick, genious that he was, decided to show what people would do in certain situations and leave the viewers to decide why. Stanly Kubrick, the director, used some camera angles that are so original no one knows how he did it, so be prepared for some roller-coaster visual effects with no computer technology aiding the way. Who better to play the part of a man turning insane than Jack Nicholson? His spiky eyebrows will get you every time. The characters show tons of emotion and you have to wonder how it looks so real. Well, it's partly because Kubrick took take after take to get the actors riled enough. Old Jacky looks and sounds like he's just about to throw a chair out the window? Close. I hear people quote the movie all the time. It's just right for a horror flick, that's all, and the scenes stick in your mind. So in conclusion why should you watch it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's better than Psycho. There's slashing and gore but it isn't all mindless---it really shows a lot of truth in situations. What would you have done....seriously...and also what's all the plot about? Watch with a friend and you WILL start to talk about it. Alone it's all about the atmosphere.
0345350472|5.0|I won't make huge editorial comments but I can try to resolve the reasons why other people have rated the book below 5. I think this book should be celebrated because it is so great. Even to this day, it speaks of ideas that no one in the media business has ever explored more in depth than Phillip K. Dick. It shouldn't be celebrated because it was written long ago. First and foremost, this book is a book of its time. Once the ideas in it become widespread, the book will probably fade from public interest. Let me explain. If you haven't had a lesson in the history of \\"visionary writing\\", in the 1950's they claimed that modern American cities in the year 1990 would look like the cartoon family \\"the Jetson's\\" city. People also thought that by now we'd have space colonies, however we are 50 years away from that. Visionaries are always great for their time, but they always get some facts wrong. Same with Phil K. Dick and any other writer. What's timeless is the ideas they bring, and ideas can truly change the way people think.<br />I think people expected this book to have the most enjoyable traits of all fiction books--action, page-turning, and memorable characters. But instead it has flat, 2-dimensional characters whom you can't seem to either like or stigmatize. I think this is because the book wasn't meant to be a 100%, pure story. It was meant to express an idea through the use of a story. However, because it is partly about storytelling, it would probably drive you just as raving mad if you were forced to read it in school and analyze it like teachers always have you do. In that way, it still is enjoyable and isn't completely academic.<br />I think it could also help if you watched the movie first.<br />I think I liked this book so much because I love science fiction. This book is so visionary and so gripping (again this is at present) that I was equally impressed with the ideas as well as the writing. That's another reason to get this book. He is a great writer, and so many passages of his books could be quoted--they're that good.
B000001E21|5.0|If I hadn't read it here I wouldn't have believed that this was an album of B-sides. If so, this has to be the best album of B-sides that I've ever heard. You must listen to this one if you like Def Leppard. My favorite is Fractured Love. About half the songs, maybe a bit more, are ballads and other laid back fare. I think it has a pretty sophisticated sound. Many of the tracks have acoutics guitars or instruments other than electric guitars, which I think is a nice touch.<br />The album cover is great. One of the few that I actually look at. No skull, it is a clever optical illusion of a woman sitting in front of a mirror.
B000002H33|5.0|If you ever looked for the biggest masterpiece in thrash metal. This is your MUST HAVE. This is METALLICA. Raging vocals, heavy guitar, extraordinary bass lines, pounding drum beats, all combined in nice melodic harmonies. But don't have a doubt that this is HEAVY. The speed of \\"Battery\\" and \\"Disposable Heroes\\" is a proof of dexterity in the band. Other songs such as \\"Welcome Home (sanitarium)\\" and \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" change the tempo a little, which is what makes this album so good to listen from beginning to end. This is an album you won't regret buying. This is an album which you can listen from begining to end, no fillers, all songs kick [butt]. Definitely a classic, and definitely of the best of all time, definitely the best from Metallica. Higlights: \\"Master Of Puppets\\"'s slow solo. Low: It's only like 50 minutes long...
B00005QIPH|3.0|Having heard so much about the \\"New Velvet Underground\\" and their revival of New York punk, I wanted very much to like this album. And considering it was also a gift from a very good friend whose taste in music I respect immensely, I was determined to get into it.<BR>Well, several listens later, I have to confess that I have yet to see what all the hype is about. I just don't think it's a very good album. The songs are generally mediocre at best with an occasional standout or two, but even those don't \\"stand out\\" very much. Mind you, the album is not a total write-off, and I will say that it does have a certain appeal after listening to it again and again. But that's as far as it goes.<BR>I had a tough time deciding whether to give this a 2 or a 3 rating, and opted for the latter only reluctantly. If you're looking for the saviors of rock and roll, look elsewhere. You won't find them here.
B00006BTCA|5.0|...Interpol.  Interpol clearly has late 70's and 80's influences,<br />not in the synthy, drum machine-y way, but in the moody dark guitar oriented way.  While their lead sounds a bit like<br />Ian Curtis, he equally sounds a bit like Jim Morrisson or the guy from Dead Can Dance, in short a resonant hyponotic voice perfect for the darker stylings of this great band.  Their sound is rhythmic, almost a little minimalist in terms of melody yet tastefully decorated with shimmering guitar (some say Smiths, closer to Echo, even closer to Chameleons UK as mentioned by another reviewer).  Add to occassional HORRIBLE rhyming lyric and atmospheric flourish and the Chameleons UK comparison is much stronger.  With key tracks &quot;Untitled&quot;, &quot;Obstacle #2&quot;, the hypnotic &quot;NYC&quot;, the for sure to grow on you &quot;Stella was a diver&quot; and the elegiac &quot;Leif Erikson&quot; the album is a stunner and the band has room to grow into themselves.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is one of the best movies since Dumb &amp; Dumber and that is ALOT to say. I really like this movie its one of those you can watch over and over again. I wouldn't buy it from here because the price is bad and you have to pay for shipping. A couple of the deleted scenes are funny. I know it sounds weird being about male models and stuff but after I saw it is was really funny. See it. See it!
630382790X|5.0|This 1995 film, directed by Ron Howard, is the true story of the 1970 moon mission that went wrong.  The three astronauts were nearly lost.  But due to the dedicated men in the Mission Control Center in Houston, the astronauts made it back to earth alive.<br />Naturally, I knew the outcome of this story.  I remember watching it on television way back in 1970.  But that didn't stop me from completely enjoying this film.  From the very first moment, the tension mounts and I was completely swept up in the film, so involved that I didn't move away from my VCR for a moment. I understand that it was all recreated and the details completely authentic. And the film techniques available today allowed the experience itself to come alive.<br />I was filled with emotion throughout.  I smiled wistfully at the fact that someone described the computer used then as one that only took up the size of a room.  I felt the pride of the families along with the fear.  I re-experienced the way life was in 1970 and the impact that the space program had on our imaginations.  I cheered at the resourcefulness of the men on the ground whose job it was to bring the astronauts down alive.  And, looking back now, I realized how primitive their equipment was compared to what we take for granted today.<br />I didn't really expect to enjoy this film.  After all, I knew the outcome.  I was unprepared for the real tears that stung my eyes as I shared the horror in the space capsule and held my breath as hope sparked and then waned over and over again.  It was a miracle that they survived and lived to tell about it.  It's a great story, well told, and worthy of all the awards it won.  Highly recommended.
B00000AFWW|5.0|I actaully didn't even buy the CD. I downloaded every song off of it from a website I'm very greatful to. They are, without a doubt, one of the best bands I have ever heard. I didn't think I would like them. THen I found out they sang \\"Heaven Tonight\\", which was featured in Never Been Kissed. That is my favorite song from them. All of them are very good. Some of them are not what I'm used to, more grungy. But I thought it was very well done. But the only problem is, I don't know what parts Courtney sings!!!!!
0553573403|5.0|I originally picked up this book not really knowing what it was about.  The blurb on the back is, in essence, a bit fluffy and doesn't speak about this book like it should.<br />But as soon as I started reading, I could not put this down!  George R. R. Martin has simply blown me away with this book (and every other book in the series).  Be prepared, because once you dive in, you won't be able to work your way back out!<br />Game of Thrones centers around one family, the Starks of Winterfell.  Each chapter is written from the perspective of a different family member -- Bran, Catelyn, Sansa, Arya, Ned, and Jon Snow.  Instead of having one main character, Martin has a whole slew of them.  Don't let this put you off though--the book is carried through marvellously and you manage to love and hate each one seperately!  Each character is wonderfully fleshed out, and they all act and react together beautifully.<br />The world that Game of Thrones is set in is remarkably detailed as well -- from the Wall to Winterfell to King's Landing.  You will truly believe in the world that he has created.<br />I can't give this book enough high marks -- wish that I could give it 10 stars! It deserves it!

B000022TSH|5.0|This 1974 film takes the classic film noir detective movie to new heights.  Yes, there is murder, scandal and lots of lies.  But yet Jack Nicholson, cast as a private eye, is a sympathetic character.  There's one scene in which the director, Roman Polanski, playing a bit part as a thug, rips open Nicholson's nose with a knife.  This is the kind of wound that makes the audience grimace every time someone refers to it in the film.  Faye Dunaway is cast as the femme fatale.  She's beautiful, of course, and it's hard to take our eyes off of her.  She's a woman of mystery, but little by little we glimpse her humanity.  And by the time her secret is revealed, she's won everyone's heart.<br />Based on a real life scandal in Los Angeles in 1908, another underlying theme is about water and power in this desert city.  The action takes place in the 1930s, and the details of that period of time are well portrayed, right down to Faye Dunaway's shaved and penciled eyebrows. The screenplay won an Academy Award and I can understand why.  It was tightly written and revealed details that moved the plot forward at just the right pace.  I sat there fascinated, not wanting to take my eyes off the screen, trying to figure out what would happen next and constantly surprised by the next twist and turn.  John Huston is cast in the role of a wealthy landowner with a huge secret of his own.  He's a fine actor and his presence on the screen added depth to the whole production.<br />The DVD has a special interview with the writer, Robert Towne, as well as Roman Polanski.  This added to my enjoyment of the film and provided further insight about its production.  Definitely recommended.
B00000DCHE|5.0|I orginally had this recording on a cassette tape and wore it out.  This is one of my favorite Billy Joel albums--each track  has it's own energy and allows Joel to shine.  I'm a Billy Joel fan, but sadly not all his albums are as good as 'Songs In The Attic.'  You won't be let-down with this album.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I didn't know much about Sarah McLachlan before I bouth this CD, but now after listening to it for several months, she is one of my favorites. I wonder if it's because I heard this live album first, but when I listen to the studio albums, I don't think the songs are nearly as good as they are here. The studio versions I found somewhat wooden and cold by comparison, but live a great amount of emotion comes though. Sarah's voice is incredibly expressive and she gives flawless performances. It's really impressive for someone to sound so good live, and I like that she doesn't hide her voice behind tons of effects and other instruments. Gee she plays guitar and piano very nicely too, what more do you want? I also get the idea from how she interacts with the crowd that she's a genuinely nice person too. Maybe you don't care but it makes me appreciate her even more.<br />The production is very good, so you will not feel like you are compromising quality. I feel it's one of the best-sounding live albums I've heard, right up there with Supertramp's \\"Paris\\", Dire Straits' \\"Alchemy\\", and Joe Jackson's \\"Big World\\". Originally I only liked a few songs on this album. I'm glad I gave a few of the \\"disposable\\" ones a chance because now I love pretty much all of them -- there are no tracks that need skipping over here. There's a good range of emotional textures presented, from the semi-rocking (for a folk artist) \\"Building a Mystery\\", \\"Possession\\", and \\"Sweet Surrender\\", to fun to nostalgic power ballads like \\"Adia\\" and \\"Good Enough\\", to haunting and sad piano introspections \\"Do What You Have to Do\\" and \\"Angel\\".<br />I really hope some guys get over their anti-female-artist bias and try this album. Trust me this is NOT Britney Spears (no choreographed background monkeys here!). It's touching and intelligent and honest songwriting, sung by one of the most beautiful voices you will ever hear and it is well worth your fourteen bucks.
B00006690F|5.0|This is a GREAT cd~!! I love all the songs except 2 i rarely listen to, but still good songs... Eminem brings a very unique and original style to the game. No doubt Eminem is hip hop, but a unique hip hop... i like how a lot of his songs are hip hop and a little bit of rock mixed.. All the haters can't deny Eminem is a very talented rapper... Anyone who says otherwise are wrong cuz it's a fact whether you like him or not.. This is a must have Cd!! Here's a brief summary of each song and my ratings...<br />The first song on the album is White America. It's like hip hop and rock mixed which is cool, but i'd say this is one of the worse songs of this album, but it's still aite.. honestly i skip this track most of the time.. so i give it a 2.5/5 <br />Buisness is the next. I like this song. It has a good beat. Dr.Dre is in the beginning with Em it's like a little skit(funny). Em talks about his style, how hip hop is in trouble and how he is needed in the game. And symbolizes batman and robin as himself and Dre savin the hip hop world. i rate it a 4/5. don't get me wrong this is a great song,but the 5's will go to the deeper songs or very unique and original songs. <br />Cleaning out my Closet. Great beat. It's a personal song about his life and his mom. He talks about the stuff he went through in life and mostly what he went through with his mom, but it's all over with and he's not goin to dwell on it any longer. 5/5 <br />Square Dance. I don't kno how the other guy said this was a techno-ish song cuz it's sooo not. This song was very unique and i loved how he did it.  He was sayin the words like they were scratchin on a turn table(in the beginnin and a little every now and then). Good job at it too. Just love the rhyme scheme. 5/5 <br />Soldier is next. Personal.  Good beat. Great hook! Love this song too, but comparin with the others i give it a 4/5 <br />Say Goodbye to Hollywood is the next song. Great beat. I love this song.  He talks about the pressures of fame, how he just wanted to give Hailie all the stuff he never had, but all the good that comes with fame comes with just as much bad and maybe more so he just feels like leavin hollywood. Flows always hot~!! I give this a 5/5 <br />Drips. This is a whatever song to me.  Good beat. The only thing that makes this song aite content wise is Em's verse cuz he puts personal meaningful stuff in it. Unlike Obie where he just talks about a hoe, doin her, and gettin frustrated cuz he might have a disease. I didn't like Obie's verse cuz who cares??? if you get a disease from doin any hoe, that's your own fault.  Where as Em's verse was more about a girl he loved, didn't kno she was a hoe and then he got frustrated. I like the way it sounds and flows though. So i give it a 3/5 <br />Without Me is the hit single of the CD. I always skip this song. It's entertainin. But not much content to it. I like the songs with deeper meanin.  Em's lyrics are always hot whether it's deep, funny, or jus entertainin. Nevertheless I didn't like this song. i give it s 2/5 <br />In Sing for the Moment the hook is Tyler from Aerosmith singin a part from Dream On. Great beat. It's like Hip Hop and Rock mixed. As are some of his other songs. In this song he talks about how his music just expresses his feelings not to take them literally and how he seizes the moment. Love this song. 5/5 <br />Superman has a great beat also. In this song he talks about hoes and their shady ways, how he hates them, how he learned his lesson, and he doesn't want a relationship right now until he does he can't be their superman. Good song  5/5. <br />Halie's Song. Again i disagree with that guy that said this song was kind of pop-ish. It's more hip hop and rock mixed. Like Lifehouse, Creed, Aerosmith, or somewhere in that category. Em sings in this song.  He isn't great at singin, but he's decent.  Another unique song comin from a rapper.  The title explains what the song is about. Very cute and meaningful. Love this song. 5/5 <br />When the Music Stops features D12. Good beat. Basically about how people confuse hip hop with real life when the music stops... Good song with a message... so 4/5. <br />Say What U Say features Dre. Good beat like all the other songs... Flow and the song in general sounds good. He bashes JD in this song... 4/5. <br />Till I Collaspe has Nate Dogg on it. Aite beat good content, but i don't really like the way it sounds. Basically he talks about how he'll never give up on rap. i give this a 3/5. <br />The last song is My Dad's Gone Crazy with Em's daughter, Hailie Jade sayin the hook. It's very cute, adorable... good beat.. great song... i give it a 4.5/5 jus cuz i listen to it a little less than the others..
B0000009S3|5.0|The \\"music fan from Kansas\\", among others, got it right. This remix, that was overseen by Zappa, is a little disconcerting for the existing fans, as it reveals totally new colors that were not in the original, while nearly erasing original lines or \\"voices\\", that I happen to miss here (some clarinet and left hand piano parts in \\"It Must Be a Camel\\", for instance). But all in all, it is nevertheless a must-have, against which I cannot help finding my old Canadian Reprise reissue vinyl sounding so duff... Plus the amount of new bars of music this CD contains stretches it to nearly an hour running time! And mind you, these extra bars do not AT ALL sound like they had been edited out of the original master because of bad playing or waning of inspiration on the part of the performers!... Quite on the contrary, Ian Underwood's unedited tenor sax solo in \\"The Gumbo Variations\\" reminds us of what the word \\"funky\\" used to mean in the 60s and will have you try to hum it note for note before you know it! Though I have not read all of these reviews, I am surprised not to see more praises for this multi-instrumentalist's brilliant contributions to the making of this album. True, HR was created with the help of several other excellent studio and not-so-studio guns (John Guerin, Max Bennet, Jean-Luc Ponty, Captain Beefheart, Sugarcane Harris, etc.). But just think a minute: what would our beloved HR be without Ian's grand piano, pipe organ, sundry electric keyboards and array of woodwind and reed instruments, all overdubbed with an awe-inspiring watertightness? I think his contributions make up for what this album sounds like in our collective memory just as much as Don Vliet's screeches on \\"Willie the Pimp\\", or the composer's epic guitar explorations... if not actually more than these AFAIAC! Who else could have thusly devoted himself in learning and playing Zappa's incredibly complex pieces and charts (esp. tracks 1, 4 and 6) in what must have been late studio hour nightmares oftakes upon takes... and still be ready to \\"blow his nose\\" with frenetic sax improvisations to boot in an RnB jam?<br />Though a bit on the aggressive side, this remix IS a must! But I also wish dearly for a future good remastering of the original mix of 1969.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The Movie: Latest film from Pixar is about the world of Monsters and how they scare kids so they can use their screams as energy but when a bumbling pair named &quot; Mike&quot; and &quot;Sully&quot; accidently bring a human child into their world they cause disaster, only the both of them can bring the child back to her place. A very entertaining, funny, and engaging animated feature with realistic looking CGI and a great companion film with &quot;Shrek&quot;.<br />The DVD: Perfection! has great sound and picture including tons of extras that will keep you busy for hours, so if your a DVD owner then buy this DVD cause this DVD is a experience for your player.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man is one of the best films of the year. Its completely thrilling, with excellent acting and script this is how super hero movies should be made.<BR>And people, please whatever you do get the widescreen version, though this was shot in Open-Matte which composes the image for both the theater and TV, they do because its a very easy process to follow and it causes less distortion than with anamorphic lenses so they use spherical and they also do the process to get rid easier of boom mikes and stuff like that. <BR>But since this film was intended for the theater and since the widescreen version is what was shown in theaters, get the widescreen. Yeah sure you might get more at the top and bottom of the screen in the Full Screen,  that is if you want boom mikes and set lights.<BR>So support Mr. Raimi's vision, GET THE WIDESCREEN!
B00005JKDR|5.0|this is an amazing movie. my two year old watches it,in its<BR>entirety, while sitting quietly, eyes glued to the set.  then when it's over she wants to watch it again.  not only can it hold her attention, it is actually a movie i don't mind her watching.  it's clean, fun, and not scary for kids.  and my husband and i like it almost as much as she does, which is important, since we'll probably see it about 80 times.
0441009425|4.0|I knew what I was in for when I started reading Revelation Space.  Obviously science would form an important part of this book, but I felt it played too big a part.  If we want science fiction to be seriously considered literature, it has to BE literature.  Science fiction needs to be about people, not cold machines and fantastic technology.  Reynolds spends too much time describing the minutiae of his far flung technological creations, and is far less evocative when dealing with his characters.  I felt there was a solid base for each of the characters, and they did seem interesting, especially Volvoya and Sylveste, but they needed more of the author's attention.  One element that I did enjoy was the dialogue, and that helped ameliorate Reynolds' misplaced focus.  The story, however, was truly incredible, like nothing I've read before.  &quot;Epic&quot; describes Revelation Space more than any other book I've read (though The Worthing Saga is a close second).  The scale and pure quantity of content was amazing, though it forced Reynolds to glaze over some of the nuances of the story, i.e. the Conjoiners, pattern Jugglers, and how exactly humanity made it off Earth.  But these are just minor greivances.  Revelation Space was a great book, with a few superficial flaws, though perhaps too &quot;hard&quot; for my tastes.
0064407667|5.0|I had received this book on Christmas of 2001 from my sister (who works at a book store), and hadn't really thought anything of it. After 5 months, maybe more, I started to read it out of boredom. I found it extremely exciting! Sure it isn't action packed, but it is so well written that you can't wait to see what Snicket will write next. This really isn't a book for most people. It's dreary and sad, but for those who enjoy a witty author, a good plot, and can see past the drearyness to then understand a bit of the humor that comes into this book, than it should be a most enjoyable read.
B0000696I0|1.0|Alright, first of all, i really love this movie.  I used to watch it all the time when i was little.  So you'd think that with a DVD of it coming it, it should be incredible.  However, there's something unbelievably wrong about this DVD.  If you take notice, it gives you an option of either watching it in fullscreen or widescreen.  Naturally, eveyone jumps to the widescreen because they've never seen it, but it's not better than fullscreen.  From comparing the two, widescreen is just fullscreen with black bars cutting off a bit of the top and the bottom of the fullscreen to look like widescreen.  An easy comparison is when the title pops up and the screen freezes.  Nothing in widescreen is gained, just a bit is lost.  This dvd is no better than the VHS that you have stored away in your closet.  It is an incredible movie, however the DVD quality doesn't help its appearance.  As my advise to anyone who is looking for improvement, don't get this because nothing is gained unless you dont own the movie on VHS already.  I am very very sorry to say this myself, but try to stay clear of the DVD if you own it on VHS already.  Sorry guys.
B000001ESP|5.0|I first saw rush in 1976....at 13 yrs old.....I saw what would be &quot;All the world's a stage tour&quot; or &quot;2112&quot; Can you imagine that...your first concert ever being &quot;2112&quot;. I have been an avid fan to say the least ever since! Moving pictures came at a time when rush was in their prime and EVERY album was just KILLER! You actually couldnt wait for the next album to come out! &quot;2112&quot; &quot; A Farewell To Kings&quot; &quot; Hemispheres&quot; &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; Moving Pictures&quot; I tell you what, Listen to these discs in that order and YOU TELL ME which one is the best! I couldnt name which one is best! However Moving pictures is really the icing on the cake! Afeter this one they went more techno and keyboards....Which I like also however you will notice that ALOT of folks will tell you that, RUSH'S music has changed....These folks have a heavy dosage of hours of listening to this era of RUSH (74-81) I really love all of their stuff....It took awhile to grasp &quot; Vapor Trails&quot; But I love it after a few weeks of listening....Their show live is THE BEST Rock &amp; Roll show to ever grace God's green earth! And I don't say that lightly! I've seen just about every group out there! Not a better LIVE show anywhere...SEE THE BOYS WHILE YOU CAN YOUNGINS! LONG LIVE ALEX GEDDY &amp; NEIL ! WE LOVE YOU GUYS! You've motivated us in our teenage years and hopefully throughout our best years to come! See you in the CONCERT HALLS!
0671027344|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, couldn't put it down.  Charlie's is the most intricate, evolved and sincere character that has come around.  The process of writing letters to a person we don't know is amazingly clever.  Get this book, read it, you will remember your high school days, your teenage life, the ups, the downs, the highs and lows.  We are all Charlie in some way, the wallflower, the outcast, the person trying to figure everything else out, yet staying on the sidelines.
0393317552|4.0|Guns, Germs and Steel is a well reasoned volume that presents its ideas clearly. It may get you to think for the first time about questions to which you thought the answers were obvious, but upon reflection, you find are not. In reading this book, you'll learn why it was so easy for a tiny Spanish force to conquer a comparatively huge Aztec empire, why Europeans ended up with all the resistance to common infections, and why having the right plants and large mammals on your continent makes all the difference. It turns out that dominating the world comes down to a geographical luck of the draw. The reason for knocking a star off of the rating of this book is its length. Towards the last quarter of the book, you begin to feel that the author has already made all of the points that he has to make and that continued reading is just subjecting you to repetiton of the same themes.
B000060MWU|3.0|The movie itself is fantastic.  Lost Highway is a beautifully designed film executed with skill in every area.  See it.  However,  the Canadian DVD release is probably the worst DVD I have ever seen.  For starters it is in 4:3 ration instead of widescreen 16:9.  Secondly, the film transfer is terrible.  It almost looks worse than VHS.  Truly a terrible picture.  Sound is just fine although nothing special.  Judge for yourself, but I think you would be better off waiting for an American release (hopefully with widescreen and significantly better picture quality).
B000002JPA|5.0|This album is too good.  Dream Theater have managed to make an album as progressive and technical as you could ever want, but that's not nearly all.  They also have feeling, they have emotion.  Read the lyrics yourself, you will see, they are not just a bunch of musicians playing &quot;too many notes&quot;.  They have done this all without being pompous or self indulgent(in my opinion).  Anyways, if you like progressive rock, this is a must.  If you like metal, also give this a try.  They sound Metallica-esque sometimes(old Metallica, that is).  Metallica was my favorite band before I heard Dream Theater. Now Metallica is my 2nd favorite.  But don't worry if you don't like metal that much, They're not like a full-on metal assault, they just have some metal influence.  They remind me alot of Yes as well.<br />If you've never heard Dream Theater, this is the album to start with.  Classics like &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;, &quot;Take The Time&quot;, and &quot;Metropolis Pt. 1&quot; really show what Dream Theater does best.  They do have a softer side as well, with songs like &quot;Another Day&quot; and &quot;Surrounded&quot;.  I like those songs, though some people don't.  I wonder why? They are great songs, even if they are a bit softer.  Anyways, the musicianship on this could not be better, and if you're not ready for some long instrumental sections, this album might not be for you.  Personally, I love it.  Great guitar playing, incredible drumming from the master, Mike Portnoy(best drummer ever), spectacular use of keyboards, and a bassist who is great, but I would like to hear him a bit more.  Then there' James LaBrie. Man, that guy can really sing!  Pretty hard to describe in words, you have just got to hear him.  So, if you like the aforementioned bands, and would like to hear some great music, don't wait to pick this up.  If you like this, check out their 1999 masterpiece &quot;Scenes From A Memory&quot;.  Great Stuff.
B00005JKED|4.0|&quot;Training Day&quot; is a dark film that isn't afraid to take risks.  It's a movie unlike any I have seen of its genera.  Even from watching some of the previews of the movie, I knew I was in for a wild and unpredictable ride.  And I was right.<br />Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke star in this powerhouse cop thriller.  Hawke plays rookie cop, Jake Hoyt.  Hoyt has dreams of becoming a detective, and hopes that he will be able to put away every single scum-of-the-earth criminal for good.  But before he can do that, he must survive a day with Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington).  And on this day, Hoyt will see the dark side of the streets, the job, and most importantly, the dark side of human beings.  The next 24 hours will be the longest hours of Rookie Jake Hoyt's life.<br />The acting is really amazing.  Of course, Washington is great, as he is in almost every role he takes.  But, he shows us he can break away from his traditional &quot;likable good guy&quot; roles, and take on the role of a sadistic and psychopathic cop who will do what it takes to get the job done at any cost.  Hawke is also terrific, and should've recieved more recognition for his part in the movie.  I also liked seeing Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as well; they proved to be very talented actors.<br />The writing is really effective; with very realistic and believable dialogue.  And Antoine Fuqua does a fabulous job as director.  Being that he knows exactly how it is on the streets, it made him that more of an effective director, and adds to the movie's credibility.<br />The DVD is not bad as well, being that it is a Warner Bros. DVD.  Usually, they don't add too many special features, but they did on this one.  Theres a bunch of deleted scenes, a making of feature, 2 music videos, the trailer of the movie, and many more.  The picture is crystal clear; presented in 16:9 widescreen.  And the sound is also great; quiet when it should be, and loud when it's supposed to be.<br />&quot;Training Day&quot; is a great movie filled with action, drama, and a lot of unpredictable twists and turns.  If you're looking for a good cop action/thriller that is unlike any other, then this just might be the movie for you.  A very unique and awesome movie that never gets old.uot; is a great movie filled with action, drama, and a lot of unpredictable twists and turns.

B00006HBUA|5.0|Scooby Doo has been a No.1 cartoon hit on Cartoon Network over the 90's and now its going into a new era at the big screen and has just come out with a game on the stunning PlayStation.2 gaming console. The movie is going into the 00's and was No.1 at the box office for 3 weeks in a row! Making $54 mn in its opening week it has made $240 mn dollars world-wide. It was No.1 in Spain, USA, South Africa, Germany and other countries. Sarah Michelle Gellar shows an excellent performance in this film, and so does the rest of the Scooby Gang. The movie is for adults and children. It has a great feel to it and is very entertaining with some great special effects. Despite the rude negative reviews from newspapers in its release the movie has become very successful and the sequal Scooby Doo 2 is coming in 2004. Let's just say those newspaper reviewers don't know a good movie when they see one and don't know how much work goes into it by the Director and actors/actresses. It has become a world-wide franchise and nothing can stop it.
B0000041Z5|5.0|This set gives the lie to claims that Sir Georg Solti always played up technical brilliance and superficial excitement above all else. The sound of the Chicago Symphony is so ripe and Germanic, you'd think you were listening to the Vienna Philharmonic or Statskapelle Dresden (actually, the Chicago players are a little more precise than their Central European counterparts). Solti's tempos are unexceptionable, even a little on the broad side (so much for his speed-demon reputation) and his understanding of Brahm's sound-world and meaning is acute. The only quibble I'd raise is that the set comes on four not-very-well-filled CDs, where it could've been accommodated on three (granted, that would probably have meant splitting a symphony between two discs). Along with Kurt Sanderling's dirt-cheap set from the early '70s, this is certainly THE bargain among Brahms symphony cycles--and one of the best at any price point.
B0000025ZF|4.0|I know that there are many fans out there who will disagree with me here, but I consider this album to be the best Roger Waters solo album so far. In fact, you could slide this right next to Pink Floyd's \\"The Final Cut\\". Every time I listen to this disc I fall in love with it even more. The three tracks that represent the album the best would have to be \\"Sexual Revolution\\", \\"Go Fishing\\" and \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\". If you are going to buy any Roger solo lp's you should buy this one first, then \\"Amused to Death\\". If you have any money left then maybe you could buy \\"Radio K.A.O.S.\\".
B000000WA4|5.0|Perhaps this album is most criticized for a) its 'pretentiousness' and b) Billy Corgan's famous nasal voice. Both these criticisms are valid, but does it keep Mellon Collie from being a fantastic album? No way. Call me strange, but in a way I like the overblown nature of Mellon Collie. That may be because the Pumpkins' music appeals to me personally, but I don't think anyone can deny that they were risk-takers. While they might not have achieved incredible heights of originality, they certainly stuck out like a sore thumb. They were never interested in what anyone else was doing. I can't help but respect that. And while Billy's voice is annoying, it's easy to overlook that in favor of his songwriting abilities.<br />In any case, this album has its definite dry points and failed experimentations, but they are suprisingly rare for a 2-hour CD. And when Mellon Collie shines, boy does it shine. &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; in particular is one of the most breathtaking songs I have ever heard -- the orchestra arrangement is just fabulous. The songs vary greatly in tone, structure, sound, and theme, which is another definite plus. I love the fact that Corgan screams &quot;Love is suicide!&quot; on the violent &quot;Bodies&quot; and immediately follows it up with &quot;love can last forever&quot; on the beautiful, poignant &quot;Thirty-Three.&quot; <br />Overall, an album definitely worthy of all the praise it has received.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This album is not only the greatest rap cd ever made but the greatest cd period. Snoop Doggy Dogg is the greatest rapper that has ever graced the mic. nuff said.

The vapid attempt at shock value by constantly mentioning the word pee is ridiculous. <br />On the back of the book jacket, Wiiliam Finnegan is quoted as saying, &quot;Nobody has ever written a book about growing up in rural Africa the way Alexandra Fuller has.&quot; That's an understatement.

B000068TPN|5.0|I have to confess that I wasn't quite prepared for this film. I was expecting something at least decent, but instead saw what I believe to be one of the best war films that I have ever seen.<br />This is the latest in a string of films that attempts to make the combat sequences as accurate and as life like as possible. I have read a number of books about wars, warfare, and battle, and in them one constantly reads about the amount of smoke that there is on a battlefield. Most films take cinematic liberties, however, making the battlefield as clear as possible in order that the viewer can follow the action. In WE WERE SOLDIERS, however, much of the battle takes place is an artificial fog.<br />One of the best things about this film, as opposed to other battle films, is that you get to see how the battle looked from both sides. The Vietnamese are not presented as faceless, almost inhuman forces as in most films, but we get to see them as human beings, and their own strategy and tactics are displayed. One shot in particular stood out for me. A Vietnamese soldier pauses in the hollowed out part of a tree, breathing hard, changing the clip on his rifle, and then putting on the bayonet. Then, he stands for a second, battling his fear, before forcing himself to move from cover and attack. You can probably count the number of war films on one hand that would have portrayed the enemy in such a human light.<br />The film as a whole, despite containing some very intense battle sequences, is as concerned to focus on the human dimension as much as the military. This may be the most purely emotional war film that I have ever seen. It is also filled with many individuals acts of moral courage, such as when Col. Moore's wife demands that the cab company deliver all the telegram's from the war department to her instead of the individual wives, telegram's that informed them of their husbands' deaths.<br />The cast was, for the most part, excellent. Mel Gibson was as solid as usual. Barry Pepper was marvelous as reporter (and real life book co-author) Joey Galloway. I wonder why we don't see more of him. He has been thoroughly enjoyable in everything I have seen him in. Sam Eliott has always been on of my favorites, and he stood out in this one as Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley.<br />A very good movie, and while I would caution that it is very, very violent, and graphically so, I would also urge anyone who has been putting this one off, to give it a try. I think they will be moved and astonished.Barry Pepper was marvelous as reporter (and real life book co-author) Joey Galloway. I wonder why we don't see more of him.

6305013578|2.0|METROPOLIS is a masterful piece of cinema. I've heard people talk about this movie for most of my life and how it inspired filmmakers and brought about a new type of moviemaking. Some of the scenes become fixed into one's mind and have become engrained into our culture.<br />Unfortunately, I had never seen METROPOLIS until I bought this Madacy version of the movie. I bought the DVD for a whopping (Money). I knew that the quality was probably going to bad (I only paid (Money)), but I never expected it to be this bad. I wish I could have read some of the reviews here at Amazon first. Much of the printed narrative at the very beginning of the film is completely cut off the screen. The film is rather grainy and at points it is difficult to see anything on the screen. Also, there are several times throughout the movie that the film skips like a scratched record. My only positive comment about the film is that I did enjoy the musical score, it reminded me of sitting in a theatre and listening to an orchrestra perform while a silent picture was being projected onto a screen.<br />The movie METROPOLIS deserves five stars. This DVD, would have gotten only one star, but because I still came away enjoying the film and because I liked the score, I give it two stars. Now I just have to wait until the Vino DVD version comes out and I can sell this puppy for fifty cents.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Had this not been a foreign film, the Oscar for best picture would have been in the bag.  Packed from start to finish with laughter and tears, Life is Beautiful remains one of my favorite movie experiences.<BR>Originally in Italian, the DVD has a perfect English audio track.
B00006G8G4|5.0|Yes, I agree with all of the reviews saying Spider-Man Really Rocked! And the Special DVD with the comic and other extras will be on my list of must have DVDs to get. I grew up watching the old Spidey cartoon and reading the comics when I was a kid. But I also grew up reading and watching Star Wars, so I have to give both movies thumbs-up. Because they were both very good in their own ways. P.S. The DVD edition of Spidey to buy is the one with all the extras like the reprint of \\"Amazing Fantasy #15 in the box!
B000069AUI|5.0|Yes, this is better than Parachutes, which is really good, too. \\"A Rush Of Blood..\\" has more of an edge to it, with Politik setting the tone the way Don't Panic does for Parachutes. It's kind of strange thinking how you'll crank up the stereo to a \\"piano-song\\", but Coldplay pulls it off. There isn't really one standout song on this album, just hit play and listen. I will say that the title song is probably the best, especially the lyrics (pretty much a response to last september). If you want more Coldplay, get the Blue Room EP, it has some really good b-sides and a good early version of Don't Panic. Needless to say, Coldplay will be a band that everyone will know.
B00006JN9U|5.0|First of all I have to say that I LOVE Shakira, she is such a hottie!! If you are a fan of Shakira you need this set for your collection. The first CD is the same as the US release with the hits Whenever Wherever, Underneath Your Clothes, and Objection (Tango). The second CD/AVCD has 4 remixes by Shakira: Underneath Your Clothes Mendez Club Radio Edit (3:24), Underneath Your Clothes Acoustic Version (3:58), Whenever, Wherever Tracy Young's Spin Cycle Mix (7:02), and Ready For The Good Times THUNDERPUSS Club Mix (10:47). It also has the videos for Objection (Tango), Whenever, Wherever, and Underneath Your Clothes. Overall I would recommend buying this set, the Ready For The Good Times THUNDERPUSS Club Mix is worth it alone, it is an AMAZING remix, probably one of the best to date.
B00006690G|5.0|If I could then I would give this album 6 stars.  Slim has done it again.  Molding his beats w/ his lyrics that seem to get everybodys attention.  He definately knows what appeals to peoples ears and always keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You shouldn't be reading these reviews cause there wasn't a doubt that this album would be poppin.  Recognize!

B00005R87Q|4.0|I rented this movie right after seeing xXx to see if my original impression of Vin Diesel would hold. Part of it holds, but I also realize that this movie is more flash and glitz than high caliber acting. It's one of the movies where your park your brain and just enjoy the fast cars, good looking people, and special effects and worry about the plot later.<br />The casting for the movie was pretty good, overall most of the actors were attractive. Vin Diesel, Jordanna Brewster, and Rick Yune fit their roles well, either through the right look, or the right presence. The only person that really didn't fit was Michelle Rodriguez. I can buy the tough girl street facer image, but I can't buy her as Diesel's character's love interest.  There are too many scenes where she's making an ugly face or some rude remark that fits with the tough girl appearance, but not girlfriend role she's also supposed to have. <br />The cars are as big as the actors in the movie. In the \\"making of\\" included in the DVD they mention the cars used are actual street racing vehicles, and the extras are fans and racers themselves. I think this really helps out the movie, it takes it from being a just story and actually gives it some credibility. You're not seeing a bunch of young people racing expensive cars, you see everyday people racing everyday cars. Sure, your everyday car doesn't have a bright paint job, sticks, a huge spoiler, and doesn't shoot flames from the exhaust pipe when it takes off, but you can accept that young people would own these kinds of cars.  The Charger used in the last major scene of the movie deserves attention as well, it's a beautiful car. It looks out of place being a muscle car in a world of imports, but it's still a classy car.<br />There are two detractors from the movie: the lack of a good plot and little character development. There isn't much to the plot, a group using tricked out Hondas keeps high jacking semis full of electronic equipment, and the truckers are (angry). The police send in an undercover guy to find out who's stealing the stuff. He falls for the sister of the top street racer in the area, and befriends him. That's really it. The plot isn't that believable, $6 million in stolen electronics is a lot of stuff, and how are you going to offload that much stuff without attracting someone's attention? The character development is sorely lacking as well. We find out very little about anyone in the movie, it's mentioned that most of the characters don't have parents; they're either dead, left, or in jail. You don't find out much more than that, which makes the characters two dimensional.<br />Overall, I'd give the movie 3.75 stars. 1star is for the cast, 1 star for the cars, 1 for the racing and special affects, and 3/4 star because the movie doesn't drag. There's no point where you really feel like the movie is just killing time, which I like. Since I can't use partial stars I'll round up. Overall, it's worth renting if you want to take a break and concentrate on eye candy for a while.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This is like the only album I've listened to over and over, month after month and I still love it! Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman have the most incredible voices!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Even if you aren't able to watch the DVD edition of Monsters, Inc, the VHS version is still laced with a few extras to enjoy at the beginning and the end of the film. <BR>&quot;For The Birds&quot;, the Academy Award Pixar short winner plays first, a wonderfully modest computer animation of little birds getting their just deserts when crossing power with a bigger bird while perched on a telephone wire. It is continuously the most hilarious 5-minute story you'll ever watch. We are also indulged to a small clip of Pixar's new movie &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (coming to theaters in 2003), detailing the life of a young fish stolen from his coral reef home and the search his timid father must undergo to find him.<br />Next is the movie Monsters, Inc. the magnificent comedy that can be enjoyed by ANY age group. I am endlessly amazed just how clever the people at Pixar are, no detail is overlooked and the film flows with such energy and intellect the story is essentially believable.     <br />While the credits roll, we are treated to the bloopers that were later added to the theatrical release. A few include James stumbling up while entering the scare floor, Roz popping up in random places and your average character accidents like messing up lines. After the outtakes, Pixar ingeniously created the cast to perform, \\"Put That Thing Back Where It Came From Or So Help Me!\\" the play Mike and Sulley claimed they were rehearsing during the movie to cover up an argument (returning Boo to the human world), which duplicates the entire film's plotline into a musical rendition.<br />After the film, the animated short &quot;Mike's New Car&quot; is included, which has Mike showing Sulley his new 6-wheel drive vehicle that completely explodes with various mechanical problems. Not as funny as the movie itself or \\"For the Birds\\" in my opinion, yet still a delight.<br />Overall, everything about the tape is just superb, I highly recommend adding it to your Disney/Pixar collection.
B00006HBUB|5.0|As a father of five children, many children's movies are very boring to me.  This movie has humor for young and old alike.  It was funny, entertaining, and held the attention of me and my children alike.  Though not a perfect movie (and what movie is), it is simply a good movie especially for Scooby-Doo fans.
B000002572|4.0|this is the best Boston album and it has my favorite track on it, Smokin'. i am 13 and my dads favorite Boston song is 'Foreplay/Long time' which starts with an istrumental (foreplay) and ends with a 5 mins song (long time). Me and my dad both agree on the WORST track on the album, it would have to be 'Let me take you home tonight' which is a horrid mellow track which does NOT suit an otherwise excellent album. Best songs are: Smokin', Rock & roll band, Foreplay/long time and peace of mind.
0140177396|4.0|Similar to Steinbeck's magnum opus, The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men takes place in the Salinas River Valley. The two pitiful symbiotic characters, George and Lenny, provide for a fun, easy-to-read, yet meaningful storyline. The two migratory ranch hands exchange entertaining back and forth dialogue that only Steinbeck could produce, himself having toiled many long days and hours on California farms and ranches. Through all of their adversity, Lenny and George tragically cling to that which we all do at some point, the American Dream - theirs being \\"to live off the fatta the lan' an' have rabbits.\\" Although not on the same Pulitzer Prize level(but what is?) of The Grapes of Wrath, Of Mice and Men manifests itself as the classic paradoxical tale of hope and despair not to be overlooked.
B00006DEFA|5.0|First, it's a great movie, and should be seen by everyone who appreciates great acting and excellent music. The new edition appears to be quite an improvement over the previous, featureless &quot;flipper&quot;-disc.<br />In response to the previous reviewer, the MPAA does not decide its ratings based on the acting ability of a film's actors or the quality of a film, but rather, they judge its content. The new scene definately merits an R rating and is unsuitable for high schools to show. Fault the filmmakers who turned an excellent PG movie into an R rated one, not the MPAA. The same thing happened with an equally great music movie: Topsy-Turvy. Were it not for a brothel scene and a few f-bombs, it would be a PG film.
0316666343|4.0|As I read through the other reviews I coundn't help but notice how many people discarded this book just because there's a 'hype' surronding it. Like a hype is a sign of missing deapth/quality. Living in Germany I heard about &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; purely by coincidence. Without knowing about any sort of 'hype' I sat down to read and couldn't put it down. <BR>In my opinion, Alice Seebold manages to tell a believable story about dealing with loss (of loved ones as well as of hopes and dreams) and finding different forms of consolation while making the reader laugh and cry in equal messures. This book is definently one of the best reads I've had in a long time. <BR>My rating of only 4 stars is due to the one weak scene towards the end of the book in which Suzie, the books heroine, is able to make a dream of hers come true. As much as I was silently cheering her on, this part of the book didn't seam to match the rest. <BR>Even though, I would recommend &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; to absolutly everyone who loves an intriguing story and is able to enjoy a good book without automaticly being biased if it gets good critics and does well in the stores.
0316666343|5.0|This is a book that will affect each reader in a different way.  Much of this depends on where the reader is in his/her life and how many family members/loved ones they have lost (and in what manner.)  <br />If you're reading this book for a good murder mystery/serial killer novel, you're going to be disappointed.  However, if you have loved ones who have passed on and feel a need to be connected, this is a wonderful novel.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Ok I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.  It has a good story, lots of action, and hardly gets slow.  It's cool to see Arnold so brutal in this movie.  If you're an Arnold fan (like me), then this is the movie to see if you want to see him brutal and mean.
B00006AW2J|5.0|With the release of the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material), there is now some confusion as they have released some of the early albums in both US and UK versions.  There was only one version of Beggar's Banquet.  This is it.  It was released simultaneously in the UK and US on Dec 6, 1968 and in my humble opinion is the finest album they ever produced.  The Beggar's Banquet sessions also produced 3 of their finest works that are not on the album (Jumpin' Jack Flash, Love In Vain, and Sister Morphine).<br />There have been two covers for this album (but only one version of the tracks).  The original art (known as the toilet cover) was rejected by both Decca in the UK and London in the US.  After much delay, the album was finally released in 68 with a plain white cover inscribed as an invitation to the banquet.  The 4 month argument over this cover was the last straw for the Stones in their relationship with Decca.  They resolved to find a new label as soon as their contract was up (this resulted in the famous last single they submitted, titled #$@!% Blues, but never released by Decca.)  The original toilet cover was released by ABKCO in 1986 when they first remastered the album.  Interestingly, the toilet cover was shot by the husband of Mary of Peter, Paul & Mary and included graffiti insults written by Mick & Keith about Lyndon Johnson, Allen Klein (their manager), the U.S. Marines, Bob Dylan, and Herb Alpert.<br />This is the remastered super audio CDs (SACD) of the Stones ABCKO catalog (which includes all the early Decca/London material.  ABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog after Allen Klein became their manager in 1965.  The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever).  But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material.  With these remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio.  I guess if we had these 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the World.<br />The tracks were recorded between March 17 and June 28, 1968  at Olympic Sound, London.  Some of the concepts were recorded at Keith's house, Redlands, beginning in February, and some final mixing was done on June 30th at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles.  In addition to the 10 tracks that made the album, the Beggar's Banquet sessions also produced:<BR>.....Jumpin' Jack Flash (released as a single and on Through The Past, Darkly)<BR>.....Love In Vain (released on Let It Bleed)<BR>.....Sister Morphine (released on Sticky Fingers)<BR>.....Child Of The Moon (released as the B side of Jumpin' Jack Flash)<BR>.....Family (released by Allen Klein on Metamorphosis without approval of the Band)<BR>.....Downtown Suzie  (released by Allen Klein on Metamorphosis without approval of the Band)<br />This information comes from \\"It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones\\" by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection.
B00004TRD8|5.0|A sequel that is atleast definately as good as the first.  It has great action, good effects, and is funny at times.  3 movies on 1 disc is great, it allows you to have more control over the time of the movie, and what scenes you like or not.  It's great, but the only thing that I don't like about this one, is that it's not all just about running from the terminator like the first one was, and in this one Arnold isn't a killer..... :'(
B000003CMB|5.0|There's not much doubt that this is the best live album ever recorded by anybody....ever.  Duane died shortly after these recordings, so this is an album without comparison in all of rock.....this is THE live rock album.......nobody ever came close again.......one of the best Bands that ever existed, captured blazing hot just before their lights would dim forever.  What else can you say?.....Duane and Dickey are brilliant, Gregg spectacular, but the set is historic because Jai Johanny and Butch Trucks never stop while Berry Oakley keeps the bottom running full tilt regardless of where Dickey and the Allmans are flying at any given moment.<br />If you are entranced by this music (and how could anyone not be?), you should consider getting one of the full Fillmore East sets (the famous hall really DID have a great sound, much better than the Kinetic Playground in Chicago, Fillmore West, or any of the others....I remember them very well).  The reviews of the surround sound remixes are varied.....many people don't like having Duane and Dickey behind them......so my advice is to read the reviews before you buy.<br />No matter what you decide, I would strongly urge you to consider this album because it is THE historic mix, THE memorable sequencing, THIS ONE is what made that night in 71 famous, and for that reason alone this album should be in everyone's collection.  Just buy the damn thing and love it like the rest of us.
B000002AGE|4.0|Weather Report is a band that adds many creative touches to their music. Jaco Pastorius adds some captivating bass runs and Joe Zawinul contributes plenty of pretty piano passages as well. Wayne Shorter makes some good contributions on several tracks.<br />Songwise, the lead off track, Birdland, has an extremely memorable melody coupled with awesome instrumental passages and soothing background vocals. It is clearly head and shoulders above the rest.<br />A Remark You Made is quite pretty and soothing and The Juggler has a delightful instrumental blend. The remaining tracks certainly suffices as good background music with special arrangements.  Whereas the melodies aren't super strong, after a while the fine playing makes up for such short commings.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I absolutely hate it when people say that this music is nothing new or it sounds like other bands before it! Music has been around a LONG time. I would hate to crush peoples hopes but your not going to find anything 100% original anymore. Futhermore, to grade down a CD because its not 100% original (which is impossible) is plain stupid and defeats the purpose of grading CDs. The Strokes are everything that music should be. Songs like 'Last Nite', 'Hard to Explain', and 'Someday' are great songs and get all the publicity but there is not a bad track on this CD. I personally recommend 'Take it or Leave' and 'Barely Legal', two awesome tracks. New York Cops can be hard to find (gotta get the import) but it is in awesome track as well. Theres a reason this is known as one of the best CDs of the year!
B000067CPX|5.0|This cd is absolutely great. A pure masterpiece in every sense of the word. Possibly the best cd I own. Some klunkers sprinkled throughout it like Don't Forget Me and Midnight, but overall this is one of the most enjoyable albums I've heard recently. By The Way and The Zephyr Song only scratch the surface on how good this album truly is. From one song to the next this album just keeps on getting better and better. From the music to the vocals, everything is in top form on this one. A rare gem among albums that truly deserves a place in your collection.
B000068IEU|1.0|Ugh, I had to force myself to the end of this clunker.  It's amazing how people can consider grainy, low-budget filmmaking, awful music and bad editing as artistic.  Even more amazing was the fact director Wes Craven somehow used this hunk of junk to secure financing (and redeem himself) with the Nightmare on Elm Street series.<br />So what's the plot?  Well, after a mother-daughter rant on the pros and cons of going braless, two teenage girls are raped and murdered.  Wow. MIRACULOUSLY, they happened to be murdered right next to the house of one of the girls' parents.  MIRACULOUSLY, the parents search out and discover their dead daughter in the woods in the middle of the night.  MIRACULOUSLY, they execute some Macgyver-type plan of revenge on the culprits instead of simply killing them outright as they were planning on doing anyway.  Heh.<br />One of the so-called revenge acts involved the mother performing oral sex on one of the killers.  Is this for real?  And, lest I forget, you the viewer have to be told that the daughter is dead because she's still breathing and moving her head!  How can anyone take this movie seriously?  Even Wes Craven admitted he was stoned throughout the production and it shows.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This film is without a doubt one the top 3 of the last decade and one of top 20 ever. Every bit as good as Hitchcock at his best. Simple, human, powerful, beautiful, enlightening, moving. Kar-wai Wong is one of the worlds great film makers, and this is his best work yet. Tony Lueng is great as always and Maggie Cheung again proves herself to be at the top of her profession. She is radiant. One of the world's great beauties. If there were ever an American version (which would never work and I hope no one would dare try), I'd love to see Ms. Streep try to out act this performance. Wong, Lueng, and Cheung create a masterpiece. Atmosphere you can taste. The colors of chilis and hot mustard drench the screen. The costuming and styling are brilliant, esp. Ms. Cheung's hair, \\"Suzie Wong\\" dresses and high heels used almost as if it were a bondage film - hinting at the bonds that the characters cannot escape. There is so much longing for love and sexual tension in this film you almost hold your breath. And the final scene at Angor Wat, COMPLETELY UNFORGETABLE. Perhaps the best scene ever filmed.
B00002Z88D|4.0|There have many things been said about this great band; sellouts or have they grown wiith their music? Have your own opinion, but as far as this album goes, it is the best rock/classical fusion project ever. My only problem is that some of their better songs have been left off; where's King Nothing, Fuel, Hero Of The Day and Creeping Death? Other than that, this is great stuff from a great band.
0316666343|5.0|There is a great deal of hype surrounding this book. Having written a memoir that received rave reviews, Alice Sebold's debut novel was released with a bang. Regardless of the commercial hoopla, The Lovely Bones is a compelling and heartwarming story about death, love and grief.<br />The victim of a brutal rape and murder, Susie Salmon watches as her family disintegrates with grief, her close friends attempt to find answers, and her murderer moves on to other victims. She narrates these events from heaven. Witnessing the pain her loved ones go through, Susie finds it difficult to let go of the living. Will her friends and family ever get over her death? Will Susie be able to rest in peace? Will her attacker receive the proper punishment for his crime? There are some interesting and moving twists in this novel.<br />I have to say that I'm disappointed with the victimizer's outcome. I also don't like the fact that the writing is a bit sugarcoated at times. But those are two of the few blemishes in the novel.<br />The Lovely Bones is a wonderful and compelling read. However, the novel's enormous success has provoked some negative feedback from various readers. I have to admit that I gave up on its commercialism, but I can see what all the fuss is about. Sebold has written a beautiful novel with clear and lucid language. I love it, so I have got to give credit where credit is due.
0345357116|5.0|This particular book I believe is the most valueable source of Middle-Earth Knowledge outside of The Hobbit, The Lord Of The Rings, and The Silmarillion. Especially &quot;The Quest Of Erebor&quot; which explains why Gandalf was willing to go to the lonely mountain and help fight Smaug, and why he wanted Bilbo to help.(which when I read the Hobbit was my biggest question, without this answer the book felt incomplete).<BR>   <BR>    Also &quot;The History Of Galadriel And Celeborn&quot; tells of their history from Beleriand all the way to LothLorien.(I always wondered what happened on their journey because they were strangely absent from the 2nd age's stories)<BR>   <BR>&quot;The Hunt For The Ring&quot; tells of the Nazgul's journey to find the ring using the information tortured out of Gollum. It tells of the events prior to entering the Shire and it gives us a DEFINANT name of one of the Nazgul, the 2nd in command Khamul The Black Easterling. Also under this section it tells why Sarumen resents Gandalf. Also it tells of the moment Gandalf suspected Sarumen wanted the ring LONG before the Lord Of The Rings. And how Sarumen knew it was in the Shire.<BR>   <BR>And in Part 4 of the book a few eye-opening explainations were made. This is by far the most surprising section.<BR>1.)The Druedian or the Woses, {best know as the primitive forest people living near Rohan and Gondor that show the army of Rohan a secret path through the mountains to avoid the enemy and get to Minas Tirith quicker.} This portion gives their history and explains some of their cultural aspects. I was surprised to find out that they were around in the FIRST AGE and were reported to have &quot;Mystical&quot; powers. This also contains a very touching story called The &quot;The Faithful Stone&quot; about a very special statue that protected a family.<BR>2.)The Istari or wizards, It tells of Gandalf, Sarumen, Radagast, and the Two Blue wizards that came from the West sent by the Valar to help defeat Sauron. This part was probably the most surprising to me! I did not know that they were Maiar or lesser &quot;gods&quot; like Sauron. And I found out Gandalf was really Olorin the wisest of the Maiar created along with the Valar before the world began who is briefly metioned in the Silmarillion.<BR>3.)The Palantiri tells of the Palatir stones that were held by Sauron, DenethorII, and Sarumen, and how they came to be where they are. It is told by way of the delaings of Gandalf and how his understanding of their workings, importance in the struggle with Sauron, and the sway they held over Sarumen and DenethorII.<br />  Plus we must now forget the description of Numenore or the 2nd age tales of this book which is more informative than it is entertaining. Also the stories or the 1st age are very good, but they only deal with Hurin and his children Turin, and Lalaith. <br /> I feel that if any Post-Sailmarillion book deserves a 5 star review this one was it. All of my major Hobbit, LOtR, and a few Silmarillion questions answered in full.
0380977788|4.0|I kept hearing about this book, so I had to read it to find out what all the fuss was about.  Indeed, it is a deliciously creepy tale for children, and I managed to race through it within an afternoon.  I did like it; however, I was expecting a little more.<br />Coraline is a refreshingly intelligent girl, but perhaps almost too intelligent.  She never seems quite concerned enough about her dilemma, even though her very soul is at stake.  This, in turn, made the story a little flat for me.  I suppose I didn't believe the danger, since she was so casual about it.<br />While reading this book, the ominous overtones kept reminding me of another children's book, the similarly creepy \\"Marianne Dreams\\" by Catherine Storr (unfortunately, it's only available in the UK at the moment).  If you read \\"Coraline\\" and like it, you might like this book as well.<br />The writing was flowing and easy to read, and the story drew me in.  It's nice to see that there are some intelligent, wonderfully creative stories for kids out there.
0345357116|5.0|This particular book I believe is the most valueable source of Middle-Earth Knowledge outside of The Hobbit, The Lord Of The Rings, and The Silmarillion. Especially &quot;The Quest Of Erebor&quot; which explains why Gandalf was willing to go to the lonely mountain and help fight Smaug, and why he wanted Bilbo to help.(which when I read the Hobbit was my biggest question, without this answer the book felt incomplete).<BR>   <BR>    Also &quot;The History Of Galadriel And Celeborn&quot; tells of their history from Beleriand all the way to LothLorien.(I always wondered what happened on their journey because they were strangely absent from the 2nd age's stories)<BR>   <BR>&quot;The Hunt For The Ring&quot; tells of the Nazgul's journey to find the ring using the information tortured out of Gollum. It tells of the events prior to entering the Shire and it gives us a DEFINANT name of one of the Nazgul, the 2nd in command Khamul The Black Easterling. Also under this section it tells why Sarumen resents Gandalf. Also it tells of the moment Gandalf suspected Sarumen wanted the ring LONG before the Lord Of The Rings. And how Sarumen knew it was in the Shire.<BR>   <BR>And in Part 4 of the book a few eye-opening explainations were made. This is by far the most surprising section.<BR>1.)The Druedian or the Woses, {best know as the primitive forest people living near Rohan and Gondor that show the army of Rohan a secret path through the mountains to avoid the enemy and get to Minas Tirith quicker.} This portion gives their history and explains some of their cultural aspects. I was surprised to find out that they were around in the FIRST AGE and were reported to have &quot;Mystical&quot; powers. This also contains a very touching story called The &quot;The Faithful Stone&quot; about a very special statue that protected a family.<BR>2.)The Istari or wizards, It tells of Gandalf, Sarumen, Radagast, and the Two Blue wizards that came from the West sent by the Valar to help defeat Sauron. This part was probably the most surprising to me! I did not know that they were Maiar or lesser &quot;gods&quot; like Sauron. And I found out Gandalf was really Olorin the wisest of the Maiar created along with the Valar before the world began who is briefly metioned in the Silmarillion.<BR>3.)The Palantiri tells of the Palatir stones that were held by Sauron, DenethorII, and Sarumen, and how they came to be where they are. It is told by way of the delaings of Gandalf and how his understanding of their workings, importance in the struggle with Sauron, and the sway they held over Sarumen and DenethorII.<br />  Plus we must now forget the description of Numenore or the 2nd age tales of this book which is more informative than it is entertaining. Also the stories or the 1st age are very good, but they only deal with Hurin and his children Turin, and Lalaith. <br /> I feel that if any Post-Sailmarillion book deserves a 5 star review this one was it. All of my major Hobbit, LOtR, and a few Silmarillion questions answered in full.
B000068OSK|5.0|Yeah I know this is the first CD. But I actually got them backwards first White Blood Cells, then De Stijl, and just a couple days ago I got this one. And I'll be honest I tried to get it for one and a half months and it was out of stock or something messed up happened I'm not really sure. Anyway I got it the other day. And oh my gosh this is the best CD yet. It's awesome like I LOVE LOVE the other two albums don't get me wrong but if you asked me which one to buy I would say this one. OK now for all you little candy cane children I'll describe each song for ya. 1. Jimmy The Explorer: awesome totally cool and kinda rockin'. 2. Stop Breaking Down: it starts out like hhmmm... but then it gets way better and I really like it. 3. The Big Three Killed My Baby: just pure awesome totally cool tubular spectacularness (today at the pep assembly (I hate the word pep it's so peppy hey I had to go to it I didn't have a choice) the football coach was like after this game we have three more we call \\"The Big Three\\" and I kinda yelled 'KILLED MY BABY WHOO-HOO!' and people looked at me weird so that was a little funny) 4. Suzy Lee: ok the first couple times I listened to the CD I kinda skipped it but then I listened to the whole thing and it's really cool give it a change you'll like it. 5. Sugar Never Tasted So Good: again one of those ones I kinda skipped then listened to and REALLY REALLY liked so again an awesome song. 6. Wasting My Time: I kinda like this one I mean I like all the songs just maybe not this one as much but I like the guitar in it. 7. Cannon: I played this one over and over and over again it's pretty cool I like that part in the middle that's all \\"biblical\\" it's really bluesy and awesome. 8. Astro: again not my favorite off the album but I really like the guitar part a whole lot. 9. BROKEN BRICKS!!!: ok as you can tell I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Broken Bricks- the guitar, the lyrics, the way it's sung, and the percussion are all PERFECT!!! 10. When I Hear My Name: um hmm I have listened to it and I know I say this a lot but I do really like the guitar a bunch in this song. 11. Do: I usually skiped this one but I started listening to it today and I actually do like it it's just that I'm used to kinda I dunno \\"Rockin' Out\\" when I listen to this CD so it slows it down a little but I still like it. 12. Screwdriver: yes the first white stripes song ever I love it bunches and yet again I love the guitar and the way Jackie sings it. He's awesome. I wrote about him for my English \\"Who is your hero?\\" paper and it was like four pages long and it was awesome I think I got an A but we haven't gotten them back yet. Anyway. 13. One More Cup Of Coffee: hmmmmm yeah ummmmmm it's ok enough said I know all the Bob Dylan fans are going *Gasp* OMG did she just say that. But I'm just not TOTALLY into the song that much. 14. Little People: again ok it's a little weird kinda like Aluminum is weird but we all listen to it anyway. 15. SLICKER DRIPES: like broken bricks I'm in love with this song it's awesome totally mind-blowingly cool. 16. ST. JAMES INFIRMARY BLUES!!!: Jack has to be the smartest guy that has ever exsisted because this song is so awesome and Jackie sings it so well and the piano is cool and I just love St. James Infirmary Blues, The White Stripes, Blues, and Jack. (oh and I haven't forgotten Meg I just love Jack I only like Meg, get it? They do both make my extremely happy though.) 17. I Fought Piranhas: it's really cool listen to it it's one that slows down the album but I like it. Well there you have it folks another freakishly long review from 13-year-old Indie/Punk/Garage rocker Kelsey. Thank you folks look for other weird reviews from me on all The Clash albums. BYE.
B000066NW0|5.0|Believe it or not, I bought this album ... and LIKED it! It boggles my mind how so many people with zero talent can bash this girl. Are people jealous? Insecure? There are five solid singles on this album--one of the best debut pop-rock albums of all time. The girl's voice is still developing, but she already diplays an impressive vocal range, especially on &quot;I'm With You.&quot;<BR>The lyrics may not be deep, but what do you expect from someone who is 17 (and probably was only 16 when she wrote some of the songs)? Perhaps people should judge themselves before judging others so freely and cruelly.
B000066I6N|2.0|Hmmmm...let's see, 2 good songs and 1 marginal song for [amount]! Not a good deal by any stretch of the imagination. I'm a hard-core RP fan but this latest effort is just plain lifeless & a real chore to listen to. The \\"No Quarter\\" album of a few years ago was IMHO his best effort since the LZ days. If you want an INCREDIBLE album buy that one instead.<br />Regards,<br />KTR
B0000028UK|5.0|Ok, we all knew that it would be pretty much vertuly impossible to churn out a TEN pt 2. But, yet pearl jam in some people's views a more soild effort than TEN, just as good. I however Belive not only does this album run pretty much 50/50 with ten, but it's just as or the most solid album pearl jam has done. There is absoluetly no filler on this. Not to say all the other pearl jam albums are below par persa they all have there moments, but ill get to that in the future. Needless to say this was indeed pearl jams most commercialy sucssesfull album to date. So lets get to CD. You get into such mammoth rock tunes such as GO with it's really funy groovy hard rock edge to it. Then you get into tunes like animal witch as first listen sound just like even flow 2, but soon get's really rockin, with probably mikes fastest solo next to go. Then the album progreses into tunes like the daugter, with it's really pleasnt rythim. Glorifyed G and dissident are rather catchy tunes I must say. So later in the album you have songs like W.M.A. with it's really cool u2ish vibe to it and amazing depth in edd's voice. The only song on here that does not particularly inrest me is blood, yes it rocks like hell, but after a while it can get on my nerves. The rest of the album just get somewhat mellower from there and still manages to keep the solid rythem of the songs going till the end. In conclution if your new to pearl jam, I would defitetly feel obligated to buy this, along with ten. Never the less, both are just superb.
0316666343|2.0|Kudos to Ms. Sebold for getting her first novel published and becoming a best-seller.  That said, I think most people are ...in by the original premise of the novel.  Some of the writing is good and Ms. Sebold clearly has talent.  However, I found the book to be a difficult read (shifts in tone, unbelievable characters, plodding story-line). I guess it's a story about loss and how it affects various people. I didn't much care about any of the characters so I didn't feel their pain.<br />The first chapter is promising and there are other bits of excellent writing, but as a whole, the novel doesn't work. Maybe she needed a better editor? There are flaws in logic (no one from her neighborhood dies and enters heaven over the eight-year span of the story? the dog dies and shows up in heaven, but not the grandmother?) And I swear some of the sentences just didn't make any sense. The mother/detective relationship was not believable. The detective was incompetent, but romancing the mother? I don't think so. I also had serious problems when the father (thanks to Susie's help) identifies the murderer. In any event, I became bored with the book and struggled to get through it. When it turned sci-fi (Susie inhibits Ruth's body) near the end, I completely lost interest. The ending ties everything up into a nice bow, but the death of Mr. Harvey (in terms of how he dies) was stupid. Again, a great premise, but not a great read.
038533348X|4.0|Initially I was somewhat put-off by the first few pages of the book.  I didn't feel like familiarizing myself with this invented religion (Bokononism) and it's respective jargon, so I put down the book and didn't pick it up for several months.  But I decided to give the book a chance again and I came up w/ the following:<br />     This work goes at a good pace, in the few places where the novel may start to dull, Vonnegut picks things up again. You can say that it's a roller-coaster of a book, you have no idea where the book can go.  \\"Cat's Cradle\\" involves Jonah, who decides to write a biography about Dr. Felix Hoenikker, who invented the atomic bomb.  Yet, his search really starts to takes off when he acquires information and contacts w/ the former scientist's children.  From there, the storyline is like letting to of an inflated balloon --> from the lab to Newt on the plane to San Lorenzo to lust to presidency to ice-nine @ work, and more!  I'd find myself returning from a 10-hour workshift and I could still read this book for hours.  \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a good one, it'll make your head spin, you'll find yourself begging for more.
0316666343|5.0|This book warmed my heart, made me cry, laugh and exclaim outloud sometimes all within the same page.  I found that she really didn't give the family closure at the end but showed that after more years of mourning and destroying themselves than is imaginable they are finally able to move on with their lives without their daughter.  I was pleased that many things were not resolved like the finding of her body because in real life many times this is also the case.  It gave me hope that should something like this ever happen to my family I could think of the person I lost going on in heaven like Susie does in the book.  This book takes the reader through something incredibly tragic but it is not uncomfortable to read and enjoy.  I will be looking for more books from this author thanks to her fantasic style and viewpoint.
0452282152|4.0|I had heard great reviews about this book, so I decided to pick it up one day.  For me it was a rough beginning, but once she got into Vermeer's house, and started living there, I really wanted to read this book.  I could tell what was coming as the book progressed, but loved it anyway.  I really liked the description of his art studio, and when he finally got down to painting the girl, I kept turning to the front of the book to try to see the different things the book was describing.  Overall a great book, and it makes me want to pick up that other book about his work, &quot;Girl in Hyacinth Blue&quot;.
6302969352|5.0|I finally got around to watching \\"Seven Samurai\\".  This classic 3 hour+ film by the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa has got to rate high among the great action/adventure epics.<br />Kurosawa's film takes place in 16th century feudal Japan.  A gang of roving bandits has been terrorizing a Japanese farming villages.  The bandits are in the habbit of looting villages, stealing crops, killing people, and raping women.  Knowing it's only a matter of time before they are attacked, one village sends people to town to hire some samurai to protect them from the bandits.  Eventually, seven samurai are recruited and head off for the village, knowing the odds for their success are against them.<br />Unlike modern action films, Kurosawa doesn't rush you into the action.  Instead he takes his time to introduce you to each of the characters and set up the story.  Each samurai has their own distinct pesonality from the wise older leader of the group to the hero worshipping younger member.  I liked watching the samurai engage in male bonding.  My favorite character was the unstable samurai wanna-be Kikuchiyo, played by Toshiro Mifune.  Kikuchiyo is really the son of a slaughtered farmer who is out for revenge.  Mifune and Kurosawa would work together many times with great success.  Kurosawa also allows for a touching romance between the younger samurai and a village girl.<br />Much of the film is a build-up to the climactic battle, but when it arrives it doesn't disappoint.  Kurosawa masterfully builds suspense and details the strategy of the samurai, while choreographing some exciting action sequences.<br />Undoubtedly, this film influenced many other action/adventure epics made since.  While not for everybody, anyone who is willing to give a black & white subtitled film a try will be richly rewarded.  I can see now that I'll have to track down some other Akira Kurosawa films.
B000066NW0|4.0|Great CD to be sure. Tracks 1-13 shine to the finish and deliver an awesome-sounding debut for 16 year-old punk Avril Lavigne. <BR>01. Losing Grip - Good song but not my favorite. Very, uh, pointful(?).<BR>02. Complicated - 'Why'd you have to go and make things so COMPLICATED?' asks Lavigne in her album's first single; her rise to fame was inevitable after this release.<BR>03. Sk8er Boi - My personal favorite, Lavigne's 'Sk8er Boi' still shines among the best of the best in today's pop/punk rock scene. In this, Lavigne jeers at a girl for dumping a good-hearted skater boy because of his clothes. <BR>04. I'm With You - I never got this song. Sure she's trying to figure out her life, but aren't we all?<BR>05. Mobile - Interesting. The total my-world's-changing thing is very appealing.<BR>06. Unwanted - A sad song but perfect for the 'Lilo &amp; Stitch' soundtrack. If only it was a remake of Elvis.<BR>07. Tomorrow - Scared of tomorrow - should catch on.<BR>08. Anything but Ordinary - 'I'd rather be anything but ordinary' sings Lavigne in a plea for recognization as a unique individual, instead of an ordinary person.<BR>09. Things I'll Never Say - I didn't get this one either. WHAT will she never say?<BR>10. My World - A look at her hometown in Napanee, Ontario, another great song, although I wouldn't guarantee it as a single.<BR>11. Nobody's Fool - The take-me-as-I-am style credo makes definite single material out of Track 11. If I had a pen I'd highlight it right now. <BR>12. Too Much To Ask - Too slow for my taste, but YOU might like it.<BR>13. Naked - Nice. Another personal struggle for freedom of reputation. Or a ballad celebrating freedom of the public shell of overprotection. Maybe both, but all over a good song.<br />So there, you've heard my recommendations, what I like and what I don't, so listen up - you make think I'm highly picky, right? Well buddy I'm just one of the other millions of critics that you'll find in this world and you've gotta get used to that. So think of this as a learning experience instead of a disclaimer of your favorite star (if you even consider it a disclaimer) and enjoy the rest of the show. <br />SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Listening to 'Let Go' will indefinitely cause exuberance, happiness, and alter personal outlook on today's punk rock. Take at your own risk.
0486411818|5.0|The author hase chosen the best, in my oppinion, way to present the background maths using functionals, this not being the fact with other, indeed classic and valuabe, though much more expensive, texts on the subject. Actually most use the original forms of variatonal formulations, which are tricky and result in very lengthy equations. Regarding the method itself, this text includes almost everything you should know to solve linear problems, both static and dynamic (i especially appreciated the dynamic part). Price over value ratio tends to zero, so it is a real bargain!
B00003CXAY|5.0|My father introduced me to Koyaanisqatsi.  He gave me a copy on VHS and told me it was a \\"coffee table\\" film - the cinematic equivalent of a beautiful picture book that you pick up every so often and enjoy flipping through. He was both right and wrong.  Yes, it presents striking images and music void of narrative, character, dialog, or traditional 3-act structure - but by no means is it for casual browsing.  Koyaanisqatsi is, in fact, the essence of \\"pure cinema\\" - a work of art that simply could not exist in any other medium. It is as arresting, lyrical, awe-inspiring, emotionally satisfying, and intellectually challenging as any film could be.<br />To try describing it further would be folly, about like saying that the Mona Lisa is a piece of stretched canvas with dried, oil-suspended pigments stuck to it. As director Godfrey Reggio says in a wonderful interview included on the DVD, an audience gets from it what they bring to it.  More than the sum of its parts, Koyaanisqatsi is an evocative and haunting meditation on nature, technology, social politics, mass media, consumerism, pop culture - and perhaps whatever else you care to read into it.<br />Long unavailable, it is gratifying to see both Koyaanisqatsi and its sequel, Powaqqatsi finally offered together on two magnificently produced DVDs.  What can be said of one film can be said of the other:  they are the same, yet different, like two movements in the same piece of music.  One film complements and expands upon the other.  Where Koyaanisqatsi seems preoccupied with the technological revolution in the so-called \\"first world\\" and its devastating effect on the Western psyche, Powaqqatsi is its inversion - a celebration of rich cultures and vivid lives led by people paradoxically struggling under the burden of crushing poverty in the Third World.<br />Taken together, the films seem to suggest a philosophical conundrum: comfort, wealth, and ubiquitous technology spell the death of the human soul - while societies in transition from agrarian to technological, despite horrendous conditions and back-breaking labor, are fertile ground for authentic compassion, artistic expression, and spirituality.<br />But again, words are inadequate.  Minimalist composer Philip Glass' score, fused with cinematographer Ron Fricke's brilliant images, waxes far more eloquent on these matters than I could ever hope to in this review.  For the price, these two DVDs are a rare bargain for those who appreciate fine art.  For students of cinema or would-be film makers, they are essential.eties in transition from agrarian to technological, despite horrendous conditions and back-breaking labor, are fertile ground for authentic compassion, artistic expression, and spirituality.<br />But again, words are inadequate.

If you like this album, or if you have never heard it, you must buy this NOW! The clarity is beyond any other pressing of this album's past. GFR RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002H70|5.0|This album is TIMELESS.  From the opening track (ironically called plainsong, is anything but plain) the chimes set the atmosphere, we are about to enter a new world and then boom, the music engulfs you into a sea of auditory bliss.  Prepare to be lost and swept away for the next hour.  This album stands out on its own, you will love it either for its painfully honest lyrics, or the seering soundscapes.  The hardest thing for a new listener is getting past the fact that this is &quot;the Cure&quot;  who is famous for its 80s pop on the radio.  There is a deeper, genius side of Robert Smith that is most evident on this album.  When I remember the Cure, it is DISINTEGRATION that I see.  My only regret is that I only discovered this album in 1995.  At 25 yrs old, it would be fair to say I missed most of the Cure's career as it happened. But I am glad that I woke up to find them when I did.  This is their hallmark, their gift to the world.  If you need a track to get into, Try (#2) Pictures of You followed by the infectious bassline of Disintegration (#10).  To feel haunted with longing and wonder, try the secretive Homesick (#11)  and Untitled (#12) is by far the best ending track to an album with so much to offer, the last song slowly brings you back to the real world, but reminds you that this wonderful world with robert smith is accessible whenever you want it.
0385720920|5.0|You know a book is going to be interesting when the first sentence reads like this:<br />\\"If you're going to read this, don't bother.\\"<br />And so begins Choke, a book that actually centers more on sex addicition than it does the \\"choking\\" plot.  Victor Mancini is a med dropout who has devised an interesting scam to pull in cash by choking at restaurants.  His saviors are made to be heroes, and they reward him with cash in return.  In between choking gigs, he works in a colonial tourist attraction, visits his mother in an Adult Care home, and has more sexual exploits than I could count.  Palahniuk's humor is at it's best yet in this novel, and I enjoyed it even more than Fight Club, if that's possible!

B000002J23|2.0|In between the 2 superb Buggles albums, Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes made the mistake of joining &quot;Yes.&quot;  Stood up beside &quot;Age of Plastic&quot; and &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording,&quot; &quot;Drama&quot; pales dramatically.  Where Horn and Downes knew how to craft a beautiful melody and layer it with splendid vocals and instrumentation in an exciting arrangement that left you wanting more, their &quot;Yes&quot; material suffers from the same excesses as the Jon Anderson-led group:  they just don't know when to stop!   Taken in small doses, some &quot;Yes&quot; songs can be quite good.  But dragged out over 10 minutes they become boring.  The only decent track on &quot;Drama&quot; (the one that keeps it from being a 1 star album) is &quot;Into the Lens.&quot;  As an edited single in 1980 it sounded great on the radio.  Dragged out over 6 minutes it overstays its welcome.  To appreciate better what Horn and Downes could do by themselves, check out their own version of &quot;Into the Lens&quot; retitled &quot;I Am A Camera&quot; on their &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot; album.  Reduced of its excess, it is one of the better songs-that-should-have-been-a-hit in the '80's.  In fact, pass up this disaster (&quot;Drama&quot;) and do yourself a favor:  buy &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot; instead.
B000002IZ4|5.0|I'm torn as to which is the better STP CD, &quot;Core&quot; or &quot;Purple.&quot;  My solution:  Buy them both!  This album is a great follow up to their debut CD, and features some of the band's best known songs, such as &quot;Vasoline&quot;, &quot;Big Empty&quot;, and my personal favorite, &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot;.  Some consider STP to be a Pearl Jam knock-off (like more Pearl Jam is a bad thing??), but I'll be the first person to tell you that STP rock out in their own right. Buy this album!
B000002IJL|5.0|The Stand By Me soundtrack is a trip back to the mid to late 50s.  Having been a teenage for all of those wonderful years, I can tell you that memories will begin to flood back as you remember a simplier time. The first selection is &quot;Everyday&quot; recorded by Buddy Holly. The film takes place in the year 1959 , the year Buddy Holly died in a plane crash in Clearlake,Iowa. The title song, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; fits the film perfectly with lyrics that are meaningful as well as beautiful.<BR>One of my favorite movie soundtracks.
B00005QIPH|2.0|The rest of the album besides &quot;Last Night&quot; is totally forgetable.  And &quot;Last Night&quot; isn't particularly inspiring - it's just fun to listen to - which is fine.  Sometimes that's all music needs to be.  Maybe they'll have another hit next year, but I doubt the rest of whatever they put out next time around will justify buying another ablum of theirs.
0440234743|4.0|Billionare Troy Phelan's untimely death left a confidential will in the hands of his trusted lawyer Mr. Josh Stafford. Mr. Phelan's late family's grief was short lived after they assumed that they would get a portion of his fortune and estate. As irony would have it, old Troy left his entire fortune to an unknown Rachel Lane-his illegitimate daughter. In desperate attempts to contact Rachel and have her sign the contracts bestowing her the fortune, Josh sends his colleague Nate O'Riley-a formally successful lawyer before the alcoholism-to find her. Nate's legal trip takes him into the untamed Pantanal wetlands of Brazil where Rachel was serving as a missionary to native Indian tribes. Nate arrives in Corumba-a small city outside of the Pantanal- and is greeted by Valdir Ruiz, a Brazilian lawyer who finds him a guide to take him to the Indian tribes in hopes of finding Rachel. Nate's river boat guides are Jevy and Welly, two young men who have navigated the river most of their lives. Together, the three of them endure the treacherous rainstorms, alligators, and disease-carrying mosquitos that plague the Pantanal. Meanwhile, back in the states, Josh holds off the Phelan family lawyers, all of whom want a piece of the will for their greedy clients...<br />As the plot the book progresses, the characters find themselves in life-and-death situations, entangled in the legal process, and fighting against others and their own wills. Will Nate ever find Rachel? And if so, what is she like? Will she accept Troy's fortune? Will the greedy Phelan family get to it first? <br />The Testament has a detailed and gripping plot, threading the legal world to that of our own actions and resolve. John Grisham has written another best seller, one that everyone is sure to appreciate.
B000002P5W|5.0|there is not one song on any of the 3 jimi hendrix experience cds that i do not absolutely love.  i would be hard pressed to pick a favorite out of the 3, but if i absolutely had to, i would probably pick axis: bold as love.  every single song (with the exception of exp which can easily be skipped) is such an incredibly brilliant example of jimi's virtuosity with the guitar, the fantastic musicianship of the experience, jimi's writing ability, or, more often, all three at once.  words cannot begin to describe how amazing this album is whether you devote all of your attention to listening to, appreciating, and loving every single second or you are just listening to it while cruising on the highway with other things on your mind.  the point is that each song alone is worth the price and that all of them together constitute what can only be described as a flawless, incredible masterpiece.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I can't believe how Lucas has ruined what started out as a great series of movies.  What a waste of time this one was.  Instead of this I'd recommend Lord of the Rings (books or dvds), Frank Herbert's Dune (book or dvd) or Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress (dvd) since all of these were the major inspiration for Star Wars and much better than Episode I.  Hold out for the original trilogy on dvd, at the very least.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I didn't really know much about Phil Collins until I heard a song on the radio called 'In the Air Tonight.'  This song is just plain awesome.  Luckily 'In the Air Tonight' was on Phil Collins' 'Hits' CD.  I made a poor decision to buy the CD for that one song.  BUT.........some of the other songs on this CD are very good also.  I guess you could say they grew on me.  This is a good CD, worth 5 Stars, I mean it's all of Phil's hits on one CD, I guess you could also call it 'Phil Collins Greatest Hits.'  This CD truly is worth buying.  Great CD overall.
B000063DHK|5.0|What are you waiting for ?. This is real metal, full of energy from the first song to the last one. Don't hesitate, this is the best Iron Maiden live album.
B000067CPX|5.0|If you want to love a band that never changes, go join the AC/DC fan club.  If you want to hear a great CD, buy this one.  Yes, they've come a long long way from \\"Suck My Kiss\\" and BY THE WAY proves it (not that Suck My Kiss was bad...).  I listened to this CD with somebody who said the music was \\"beautiful\\", which is the best descrpition I've heard of it.  It is soulful, deep, moving, etc.  I loved CALIFORNICATION and was hoping they'd keep going in that direction.  They did.  Two of my favorites are Cabron (funny)and Dosed, but I like all of the songs here.  Some people may like their older stuff better, but if you liked their last album, you won't be dissappointed.
B00006690G|4.0|One phrase you will probably never hear said concerning Eminem is, \\"Eh, he's okay.\\"  ...  With \\"The Eminem Show,\\" however, Eminem seems to have become aware of his pop stardom ... and come out with a somewhat toned-down and much more accessible work.<br />Oh, you'll still hear the profanity fly and the bitterness towards his now-ex-wife spout, but Eminem now turns his attention to his own stardom.  \\"White America\\" is a scathing anthem aimed at the disapproving parents of his suburban teenage audience, reminding them that \\"Erica loves my .../I go to 'TRL', look how many hugs I get\\" and he's aware that \\"if I were black/I woulda sold half.\\"  The first single, the unbelievably hooky \\"Without Me,\\" plays along this theme, with Eminem acknowledging that he's the pop music scapegoat of the moment but that we should just deal with it because music would be boring without his scandalous presence.  A mildly amusing moment comes during this song when Eminem blasts Moby as a \\"36-year-old baldy ...\\"--as if he is 18 instead of 29.  The three women in his life are dealt with in typical Eminem fashion--his mother is blasted in the almost wistful \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet;\\" his ex-wife Kim has a couple of tirades directed at her, namely \\"Superman,\\" which is a slightly cleaned-up version of the scary \\"Kim\\" off \\"The Marshall Mathers LP;\\" his daughter Hailie gets her very own song (\\"Hailie's Song,\\" natch) on which Eminem actually sings.  Well, he's reasonably in tune sixty percent of the time, anyway.  Hailie also pops up on the busy \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy,\\" chirping the lead-in to the chorus.  One hopes that the intro to the song, in which Hailie walks in on Eminem snorting [narcotics], is fiction rather than fact, though, as Eminem is so fond of claiming most of his raps are.<br />If you've ever wondered why the heck Eminem is so popular, one listen to \\"The Eminem Show\\" will answer that for you very nicely.  Insanely catchy riffs and suprisingly evocative lyrics abound, and even if the only rap you ever listened to is Blondie's \\"Rapture,\\" you won't go wrong picking this up.  Of course, you'll get strange looks when your late-thirties white female self pulls up in your SUV at the supermarket with Eminem blaring from the system, but it's never too late to have a happy adolescence!lbum.  9/10.<br />Say What You Say - One of Eminem's bad songs.  Gets really boring and annoying.  6/10.<br />Till I Collapse - A song that stands out on the album.  Amazing song with something a little extra.  10/10.<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy - Really funny song with Halie (I'm not sure if it's the real Halie) saying how her Dad (Eminem) went crazy.  Very funny.  10/10.<br />Curtains Close - The outro.  Really funny, this guy's trying to sing Without Me but he's really bad at it.  10/10<br />Overall - Very good album, 5 stars for Eminem's possibly best album yet.  Remember when this album gets boring and everyone criticizes him... he'll be back.
0767002652|5.0|This is the first series of Upstairs, Downstairs.  Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse, Updown, as it is affectionately known, covers about twentyfive years.  The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908.  It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle, barring a few later additions to the caste.  Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah, who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode.  We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy, daughter of the house, as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents.  Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white, due to a cameramen's strike.  I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs.  Some of the episodes are a bit off target, especially The Swedish Tiger, which is just plain weird, but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed.  The first series is a great way to start your acquaintance with the residents of 165 Eaton Place.

6305263248|5.0|*<BR>This DVD is an extremely high-quality product.  My personal ratings would be Picture = 4.5 and Sound = 5.0.  There is a bit of grain and some tiny &quot;flecks&quot; but overall the picture is very, very clean.<br />Photography is fantastic especially during the car chase scenes.  Despite all the action, most of the shots are smooth and I cannot figure out how the filmmakers did that.  <br />Music and sound is the real gem here and surround-sound is used effectively.  The soundtrack is impressive as the music seems to be based on drumming and interesting drum patterns.  There are plenty of low frequencies used and some action punctuations that will test your woofer for sure.  Classical music standards are also used at times (for background) and sound wonderful.  <br />I enjoy this movie more each time I observe and listen to it.  Highly recommended.<BR>*
B000002WYT|5.0|Usually live DMB is more of my staple, but Crash brings us back to the studio where the band first put laid down these tracks.  Rarely will you find an album with so many nuances and well blended instruments.  One of the highlites is #41--&gt;Say Goodbye.  These two songs were meant to be together and they flow oh so nicely.  Check out Two Step, Let You Down, Cry Freedom, Tripping Billes, hell, check them all out, this is a great cd! it's essential for a reason.  The Dave Matthews Band is in it's best form.  If you like this recording, check out the darker, Before These Crowded Streets.
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie is a great flick.  If you are thinking of buying this movie, then you already know what it is about... Religion and the problems it can create for people and society. <br />I know that Kevin Smith is almost something of an aquirred taste to most people.  ... Dogma is his tackeling of a large subject, Religion, in his own way.  Because of that, it sits as a different type of movie from Kevin Smiths other films.  It does involve the same general mind set, and some of the same charaters, but the subjects weight makes it take on a different tone.<br />But the Smith experience does play well in fandom, ... <br />Many of the same actors from the previous movies are back, along with both Jay and Silent Bob again.  Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jason Lee are all good in this.  And new comers like Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, Alan Rickman and Salma Hayek all turn in great performances. <br />To a large extent I mystified by people who hate this movie. ... Let Dogma be Dogma ... <br />This movie, more or less, is The Last Tempetation for Christ mated to Blazing Saddles, with Jay and Silent Bob coming along for the ride.  <BR>The extras on the discs are nice too. There are two sets of commentary from Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier. Then there is commentary from the cast, Including Jason Lee and Ben Affleck and Jay Mewes.   Then there are all the outtakes, extra length sense, etc.. that add up to about 100 minutes of extra material.  <br />Just remember, it is a comedy.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|If you want an amusing time at the movies, you could certainly do worse than to see this lightweight comedy. All the reviews seem to be saying that Hugh Grant plays an irresponsible and immature character, self-absorbed and without any committment to values, who learns to be more responsible through a quirk of fate that thrusts him with a 12-year old boy who helps redeem him. But actually this movie doesn't really base itself on such a moral high ground as to be so preachy as reviewers seem to want to paint it. Grant's character is really a Londoner who doesn't at first bond closely with others, but proves to have a kind streak as the story goes on. None of the other characters in the movie really at any point tower above him as paragons of virtue; any lack of well-directed values in the movie seem to reflect generally the culture of London (at least as portrayed in this film) as much as they reflect his character. Perhaps this presumed typecasting of Hugh Grant reflects less about the characters he plays than about the way he just can't manage to live down the fallout from the time he was caught cheating on Elizabeth Hurley (who scarcely ever put forth a more likelable on-screen persona than his, for that matter). I'm not going to say that all movies should reflect Christian values, but Christians might have a point in noting that Christmas is made an important symbol herein, and while Christams is at its root a Christian holiday, no specifically Christian values whatsoever are reflected here. But Christian or otherwise, I found no clear moral direction in any character at any time to justify calling Grant's character particularly valuless by comparison. Anyhow, his bonding with the twelve-year old comes through Grant's character's invention of a fake son of his own to try to make a better impression on women who are single parents like he pretends to be. Greater involvent with the twelve-year-old begins when Grant's character and he discover that the latter's mother has attempted suicide. The relationship grows from there and is a mutual learning experience. But neither of these two guys is a saint single-handedly redeeming the other; the kid can in fact be demanding and a bit bratty at times. As for the part about masquerading as a parent to try to have better luck courting \\"other\\" single parents, well his deception is not exactly a moral high ground. But doesn't it say as much about a society that so arbitrarily values parenthood as to give one a motive for such deception? Indeed there is one scene in the movie that seems to give such value to being a parent that non-parents might as well bow out of the mating game in disgrace. With such attudes, no wonder some would cheat and deceive! Again, this is a somewhat amusing comedy that can be fun to watch. Just avoid buying into the overhyped premise that it rises to the level of a morality play!

B000050XEI|4.0|another well-made CD from one of the most familar names in New Age.  The first three tracks in this CD offers a good glimpse of the creative talent in Enya.  well composed, well rendered, and well written. The fourth track is more hanuting than the others and is a nice change of tempo.  The other tracks are vintage-Enya.  nothing extra, nothing new..but the usual slow tempo any Enya fan will expect. Overall, a nice collection of tracks..Not much new ground is broken in this CD..but the first four tracks in itself makes it worthwhile to purchase the CD.
0553579908|5.0|George R.R. Martin's A CLASH OF KINGS continues where A GAME OF THRONES left off. With this second installation of the series, there is no question that A Song of Ice and Fire establishes itself as one of the premiere fantasy epics ever written.<br />For those who enjoyed A GAME OF THRONES, A CLASH OF KINGS is an absolute must-buy. The only downside might be that you will do nothing but read it (which doesn't bode too well for your social life or you personal hygiene). The second book contains some of the same elements as the first: <br />(1) a very realistic world comprised of believable characters, none of which are purely good or evil;<BR>(2) bad things do happen to the main characters;<BR>(3) a captivating and flowing style written from multiple points-of-view, each of which has a unique voice;<BR>(4) more details about the continent of Westeros and the Seven Cities beyond the sea;<BR>(5) the same gripping plot, which once again explodes with unpredictable events (which are still believable!);<br />In short, BUY THIS BOOK NOW if you have read and enjoyed A GAME OF THRONES. You will not be disappointed.
B000006MS3|5.0|Yes, this is Kate's best, and a jaw-dropping masterwork. The supreme excellence of the disc has been acknowledged by many others here, so I won't reiterate that point. Rather, I'll just say a bit as to what this album is about-- since that seems to be unrecognized?     The Dreaming clearly comes out of a period of considerable unhappiness (if not crisis), which genius Kate is able to turn into a masterpiece. It focuses on one simple, profound, sorrowful theme: separation, division, being cut off, deliberate protective isolation, etc. The theme appears in various guises. With \\"Pull out the Pin\\" and \\"The Dreaming\\" it is the wretched fissure between the Americans and the Vietnamese, and between Australian miners and the Aboriginals. \\"You find them in the road\\"-- yet they live in a different world: the world of the Dreaming. In \\"All the Love\\" it is our separation from our friends, epitomized by her protective answering machine and the endless \\"goodbye's....\\" In \\"Sat in you Lap\\" and \\"Suspended in Gaffa\\" it is the interior  separation between ourselves and our goals, our own happiness, found in our inability to arrive at sense of accomplishment. (Who else sings about that??) With \\"Get out of my house,\\" the disc concludes in the most personal and most impassioned instance of this separation: the rupture between the lovers. Note especially her brilliant use of different voices to express her disrupted frame of mind. Who else could come up with a song which is this overwhelming in its subject matter, this vocally virtuosic, and this accomplished musically, as a composed song? Nobody else. She was a wizard.          And now I've already mentioned my four favorite songs: Sat in you Lap, Pull out the Pin, the Dreaming, Get out of my house. But it's all good.       PS If you enjoy this, be sure to seek out Jane Siberry's great  \\"The Walking\\". Then Joni Mitchell's \\"The Hissing... [of summer lawns]\\".   Then Henry Green's Loving, Party Going, Nothing, and Wyoming!
B000GBEWHA|3.0|My review refers to the Australian 2-Disc DVD which is essentially the same as the US edition: <br /> <br />The first disc contain the movie with apparently a new digital remastered transfer of the film. I cannot notice much difference to the previous DVD version except it seems more compressed this time round. The DVD still only features a the 5.1 soundtrack which is problematic. The dance hall scene is where this is noticeably an issue. For example, \\"Hound Dog\\" and \\"Born to Hand Jive\\" both sound echoey and tinny, with very little use of bass. Also, the surround speakers are rarely utilised. I wonder why they just didn't put the original stereo mix in. I dislike 5.1 mixes applied to original stereo mixes. The first disc also contains an audio commentary by the director, and also the option to do a sing-a-long with the movie, or just with the music scenes.  <br /> <br />Disc 2 contains the remainder of the special features. At first glance, these look impressive but once you start watching them you realise they could have been so much more. The main reason I purchased this new DVD was to get the 'deleted and alternate' scenes. Unfortunately, these were all black and white. According to the 'Director's introduction' to these, they are not available in colour (which doesn't make sense as they were filmed that way, perhaps film stock has deteriorated). More importantly, these scenes add little value to the die hard fan as they really are quite short or just expanded on what we have already seen. I was very disappointed overall with these deleted scenes. I would have liked to see the additional beach scenes of which some can be seen in the movie trailer.  <br /> <br />Other special features include:  <br /> <br />- Remembering Grease (20 minute or so retrospective which interesting, and was compiled for this new DVD. It contains some rare footage, which was also included in previous DVD);  <br />- 2002 DVD Launch Party (this was quite good for the footage of John and Olivia performing on stage. Poor John could hardly remember the words to Summer Nights which was funny);  <br />- John and Olivia remembering Grease (this is really just extra footage from the 2002 DVD Launch party and only runs for about 2 minutes);  <br />- 1978 interview with Alan Carr and John Travolta (good but cut short. Would have been good to include the interview in its entirety);  <br />- 1978 interview with Robert Stigwood and Olivia (good but cut short. Would have been good to include the interview in its entirety);  <br />- Moves behind the dance sequences (a segment with original choreographer which shows some rare behind the scenes footage. Quite good);  <br />- Hairstyles from the film (a segment with hairdresser who shows how the hair styles were put together. Very little interest to me but other people may like it);  <br />- Original trailer (seen before on previous DVD).  <br /> <br />So, is the new special edition worth purchasing? Well, depends on whether you are a die-hard fan or not. The lack of inclusion of the original stereo soundtrack is a big omission. The deleted scenes add little value to the package. The other extras are like other DVD's ... you'll watch once, maybe twice. It would have been useful to include the original 1978 TV special which was put together by Alan Carr to promote Grease ... a lost opportunity.  <br /> <br />Rent first before buying.
0316666343|5.0|This book is written in a style that makes it impossible to put down the book.  The psychological profiles of the characters in the book are portrayed in a very likable and interesting fashion.<BR>I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to see character with very well devloped personalities.
B00004X01U|5.0|If you are looking for a Madonna album where you can listen to the entire album and not feel disappointed then Music is the album you need to purchase.  Every song has it's own unique sound.  Starting with the title track, that takes you back to 80s with a fresh electronic sound, to the closing track, a different guitar strung ballad, you will be surprised when the album ends considering this album only contains 10 tracks and most are not that long except for the exceptional track Paradise (Not For Me).  The bulk of this album is co-produced with Mirwais, while three of the tracks got treatment from William Orbit-(the main co-producer from her 1998 album Ray of Light).<br />The standout track for me on this record is definitely Impressive Instant, an intense club track that can put you in a trance.  This album will be hard to follow up but I'm sure she'll follow it up brilliantly.
1891252089|5.0|Ashtanga Yoga by David Swenson is exactly what the title indicates. This book is user-friendly in every way,from the spiral binding to the clear, concise details given for each asana. When first discovering this yoga tradition I lived on a bridgeless barrier island with no access to a yoga instructor. David's video was my daily teacher. This book would have been a wonderful addition to my self-taught practice.<br />I have now had the pleasure of studying many times with David and continue to appreciate his lack of ego in both his book, his approach to teaching and his personal practice. One cannot learn spitituality from a tape or book and I appreciate David's focus on a technically safe practice with modifications given for each asana.<br />As one develops his or her own practice, focusing on the breath, the spiritual journey begins. That is what makes David unique as a teacher and author. He lays the groundwork for a very individual journey. This book serves as a wonderful guide along the way.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is my all time favorite album!! Avril has amazing vocals (especially on Losing Grip and Unwanted,with her angry-chick sound)and this is definitely one of those cds you can listen to over and over and still not get tired of it.There's not one song I can say I don't like on this cd,it's just mind blowing.<br />Losing Grip-One of the more rock-sounding songs on the album;Avrils vocals sound great and whenever you just feel angry at the whole male population,this is a good song to listen to ;)<br />Complicated-The song that got me hooked on Avril;Anyone can easily relate to this song,and even though it's been overplayed,I still love it.<br />Sk8er Boi-One of my fave songs!!

B00005YW4H|5.0|I really enjoyed Don't Know Why from the radio and bought the album, hoping the rest of the music would be similar.  It is mostly of a jazz/blues genre and I find it to be excellent music for winding down in the evening.
B000005AYM|5.0|Erykah Badu's debut album is loaded with old school jazz and modern r&amp;b that's as tighly woven as her famous mile-high headdress.  &quot;Badizum&quot; is a classy, towering release; for me, it conjures up images of a Saturday evening at your local jazz club or a cool, sun-drenched Sunday morning.  It gives off a calming, peaceful vibe, and it's a near-masterpiece that can't be likened to anything else.  Badu's voice, often compared to the grittiness of Billie Holliday, is elegantly restrained; yet, it is its modesty that makes it all the more powerful.  There's the jazzed-up swing of the hit &quot;On and On,&quot; the soulful swagger of &quot;Four Leaf Clover,&quot; and the bangin' &quot;Rimshot.&quot;  Badu's voice is effortlessly smooth as she croons her way through these slightly hip-hop-flavored slices of r&amp;b.  I was first introduced to the music of Badu at a beach party a few years back.  The single was &quot;On and On,&quot; whose hook made me take a mental note to run and grab her disc.  I'm glad I did.  And so will you.
6304806418|5.0|Before Andrew Lloyd Webber and Time Rice came along and gave this story the breath of life through the rock opera medium, the life of Argentine icon Eva Peron might have never occurred to anyone as a great subject for an opera, much less a rock one. But Webber and Rice pulled it off brilliantly and Alan Parker has created the definitive film adaptation of the piece. The film version of the \\"Evita\\" musical was an idea for years, Oliver Stone was attached to direct at one point (he shares screenwriting credit) but had a falling out with Madonna and filmed \\"The Doors\\" instead. Parker picked up the project and has created a timeless, exhilarating experience of drama and music. Pop star Madonna has never been ranked with Webber stars like Sarah Brightman, but she holds her own ground here and delivers what must be her best vocal work considering the range and skill a tune like \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" requires is much more than the demands of \\"Vogue.\\" She also fits nicely into the role, completely becoming the character. Antonio Banderas is a wonderful Che, his voice also delivers and he has raised the bar for future actors who take on the role. Parker has director has not made a better movie since this one. \\"Evita\\" crystalizes the best of Parker's talents, it's always a visual feast and the texture of the film is almost enough to recommend it. Those who thought \\"The Wall\\" was a disorganized acid trip will appreciate the focus and epic scope of \\"Evita.\\" And of course there's the music. The songs are catchy, beautiful and classic, always going for broke. \\"Evita\\" is a grand opus, one of the great modern musicals that can probably now be seen as a precursor for flicks like \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" \\"Chicago\\" and the next upcoming Webber-inspired film, \\"The Phantom Of The Opera.\\" This is a movie for people who love music marching to the beat of awesome cinema.
B000002H4Q|5.0|This is the Cure's first studio album since winning over American audiences with their &quot;Staring at the Sea&quot; compilation.  Originally released as a double album before omitting &quot;Hey You&quot; to fit the material on a single disc, &quot;Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me&quot; is a slice of pop at its most thrilling.  There's the gloomy and spiteful sting of &quot;The Kiss,&quot; the bubbly punch of the hit &quot;Just Like Heaven,&quot; and the innocent love song &quot;Why Can't I Be You.&quot;  Robert Smith glides through a range of emotions throughout this album: infatuated, detached, angry, smitten, and gloomy; but the whole disc works consistently and never tires.  The Cure have struggled to retain their audience within recent years, but you can always turn to this disc to see this band at one of the peaks of their enduring career.
6300214753|5.0|Wow...if you grew up in the 80's and didn't see this movie at least ten times, you must have lived under a rock.  I have seen it so many times, and it never loses it's appeal.  It's not a movie that won a lot of awards, and it doesn't ponder anything deep and spiritual.  It is just a plain old fashioned silly laugh your pants off kind of movie!!  The first time I saw this movie, I knew it was going to be a keeper.  Now, years later I still can't stop myself from thinking of that hilarious line with the nurse every time someone says the word \\"fever\\"....you know the one I'm talking about:<br />\\" I heard that you are feeling ill<BR> headache, fever and a chill.<BR>  I came to help restore your pluck,<BR> cause I'm the nurse who likes to.....\\"<br />If you've seen it, see it again.  If you haven't....what are you waiting for!
B00006G8G1|3.0|...This concert sounds okay but the camera shots are too jumpy. I found myself comparing it to the After Death concert too much. I could not enjoy their new style. Every band changes over the years and I guess I cannot accept the new Maiden.<br />I keep hoping they will release After Death on DVD but until then I will settle for this one...<br />If you are a hardcore Maiden fan, buy it but do not expect the same concert you saw 17 years ago.
0345349571|5.0|When I came to this book, I was mainly interested in the chapter on the Black Death, which I was researching at the time. I was interested in researching the history of microbial disease and epidemics, and Tuchman's chapter turned out to be an excellent place to start on this subject. Since it's the only chapter in the book I've read, I'll confine my comments to that.<br />There are several book-length treatments of the subject now, but I read the chapter in Tuchman's book to get a good introduction and overview of these events before reading the other, more specialized books. This doesn't mean the chapter was light reading. On the contrary, Tuchman packs a great deal of good and detailed information about the Black Death into this one chapter, dramatically chronicling and evoking the terror and horror of this plague as it swept across Europe.<br />The story of the Black Death's ravages in Europe makes for perhaps the most dramatically morbid and gruesome historical tale of all time, with 60-70 million dead from the disease, and I enjoyed reading Tuchman's excellent account on the subject. After this, I was ready to go on to more serious researches.

B00005RIZP|4.0|If you've seen this movie, you should know what the title is a reference to. For those of you who haven't, it is exactly how the heroine of this movie answers the phone. <BR>And phone-answering plays a pretty important part in this movie. Black Christmas was the very first slasher film, made all the way back in 1974. While it may not be the precise blueprint for all subsequent slasher movies to follow ( Halloween comes closer to this. It had a chain of sequels, too, which is an important part of any slasher movie franchise ). Black Christmas, while it may not be terrifying, is a neat, tight little gem. Its game is mainly suspense, with only a few smears of blood to scare us with otherwise... and those obscene telephone calls the girls keep getting. If you like horror movies, check Black Christmas out. I think it's telling when almost everyone who remembers this movie remembers it fondly... and with goosebumps rippling up and down their arms. As a matter of fact, the cashier at the video store where I checked this movie out at said, upon looking at my selection, \\"Oh! Black Christmas! This was the first horror movie I ever saw and it is *so scary*!\\"<BR>I couldn't have put it better myself.

B000002LQD|3.0|On this album Reed investigates mortality, loss, guilt, rage and resignation. Each song has a subtitle and a mystical symbol, tracking the issue in full circle and attempting to cover all aspects and relevant emotions of the chosen theme. The best tracks, because their melodies make them stand out, include Sword of Damocles (Externally) with its flash of humor (\\"That mix of morphine and dexedrine/We use it on the street\\"), Cremation (Ashes to Ashes), the strange, funny and sad Harry's Circumcision (Reverie Gone Astray) and the powerful rocker What's Good. As on his New York album, the instrumentation is sparse with only guitars, bass, percussion and drums. It is a moving and literate piece of work, but ironically lacks some of the magic found on most of his best albums. Perhaps because he chose a rigid framework, the overall impression is one of sameness and lack of variation. Still, it is by no means a uniformly bleak album, and at least lyrically, there is plenty of material that ranks among his best work. The sound is reminiscent of the New York album, but unlike that album which is his least personal work, this one focuses on the loss of specific friends and his reaction to death, making it highly personal and intimate in its exploration of universal themes. A good album, but not a Reed album that I listen to very often. My real rating is three and a half stars.

B000001U3K|5.0|Over these eleven perfectly crafted tracks, Lou showed us various little panoramas of Andy Warhol and The Factory, transvestitism, New York's [homosexual] scene, urban decadence, [narcotics] use and more in a wonderful blend of humour and irony and in a brilliantly diverse musical setting. The guitar-driven hard rock of Hangin' Round and Vicious is balanced by the subdued power of the poetic Perfect Day and the imaginative arrangements of Walk On The Wild side and Goodnight Ladies. Transformer is a literate, intelligent and enduring statement of an era and is one of the few albums of the glam-rock movement that has survived with its artistic integrity intact and that still has something to say today. David Bowie and Mick Ronson produced it with all the expertise they lent to the Ziggy Stardust album. But its varied styles, broader subject matter and feel of personal experience make it a better album than Ziggy Stardust. Unlike on most of Reed's other albums, there is great melodic variety too, and classic pop like the poignant Satellite of Love which by the way, is beautifully covered by Eurythmics on their Sweet Dreams video. It ought to have been as great a hit as Walk On The Wide Side! This most accessible album of Reed's was a deserved commercial success and spawned a million dreams.

B000002LGA|4.0|This collection of 14 sketches represents one of the most powerful song cycles of Reed's career. On New York he discusses the wider world rather than personal concerns for a change, and in the decaying but enchanting core of New York City, he found enough to sing about, like crime on \\"Romeo Had Juliette,\\" the terrible impact of AIDS in \\"Halloween Parade,\\" the tragedy and psychology of child abuse in the poignant \\"Endless Cycle,\\" the plight of the homeless on \\"Xmas in February\\" and wrong priorities on the powerful rocker \\"Strawman, \\" where he actually sings with open throttle unlike most of the other tracks where he employs his talking-style delivery. Older themes are revisited too: \\"Dime Store Mystery\\" is a moving elegy to his former patron Andy Warhol. Not all the tracks are memorable though - \\"American Whale\\" and \\"Mr Waldheim\\" for example, are not up to the greatness of the rest of the album. In addition, due to the lack of any other but the basic rock instruments, the sound is not as varied as on some of his other classic albums. Neither is this Reed's most melodic work. However, the lyrics make up for that - in beautiful lines like \\"Caught between the twisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that brought Columbus to New York\\", the poetry is full of sharp and lean images, driven by Rathke's guitar, Wasserman's bass and Maher's drums. This album is a beacon of literate, intelligent rock and amongst the top 5 of Reed's career.

B00005JKDR|4.0|\\"Monsters Inc\\" is first-rate family entertainment. This Pixar Studios production is visually stunning and shows off digital computer technology at its finest. Its monsters wouldn't scare the average four-year old, which is what the moviemakers intended. This is sheer fantasy, and delightful fantasy at that. Adults should know that the movie lacks the sophistication of \\"Shrek\\", \\"Antz\\" or other Pixar works like \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"Toy Story 2\\".<br />In this highly imaginative tale, those monsters who come out of kids' closets at night are actually residents of Monstropolis, where energy is provided by the screams the creatures elicit from unsuspecting children. Times are tough, though, because kids today aren't so easily frightened. The monsters must never actually touch any child because they believe that human beings are deadly poisonous. So, the beasts are actually more frightened of kids than kids are of them. [Who knew?] Much comedy and pandemonium results when a little child called Boo follows one of the monsters, Sully, into Monstropolis.<br />For kids, this is one of the best animated features ever made. For adults, it is painless to sit through and, for the most part, quite entertaining.
078401213X|1.0|This movie is the stupidest movie that I have ever see. A hour+ of a guy that goes searching for pi. How stupid can you get. I actually felt myself become stupider for sitting there watching it. This movie is easily the most worthless movie ever made. I would rather have my eyes plucked out of my head by a chicken than watch this movie again. I only wish that I could take away stars from this movie instead of giving it one.
6305013578|1.0|If you're reading this, you doubtlessly know already that Metropolis is a magnificent classic of the silent era.  No definitive version is available yet, they're all incomplete, but this DVD is especially atrocious.  The picture quality is an insult to DVD technology.  I just saw the theatrical release of Kino International's new restoration, and it's a beautiful, pristine print.  The film has been restored to be as close to the original theatrical release as possible, with title cards inserted to describe the missing scenes.  This version will be out on DVD in early 2003, and it should be worth the wait.
B000002H33|5.0|... <br />This is Metallica's third studio album (and their last with  bassist Cliff Burton).  Their first album, Kill 'em All, is very raw sounding and almost all of the songs sound the same (all the songs are great though).  This revolutionary album is basically a good excuse to solo.  Their second album is very good as well, more variation in their songs.  You can hear how the group has found their own style: aggressive lyrics, complex melodies, and long flawless solos.  <br />Master of Puppets is an even further evolution of their sound.  This is not the same crap that Metallica is putting out today.  I cannot stress that enough.  This album was recorded in 1986, when Metallica was still an underground band, so naturally they made this for true music-loving fans.  Now their music is so mainstream: simple melodies, crappy lyrics, and NO solos!  If you want to listen to great sounding music, this is it.  <br />Personally, I feel that all of the songs on this album are great except for track 3 (The thing that should not be).  My favorite tracks are Battery, Master of Puppets, and Sanitarium. <br />This album, along with The Wall (Pink Floyd), are my favorite albums of all time.  <br />This was the album that turned me on to 80's metal (I don't mean glam metal like poison or skid row).  Do yourself a favor and buy this multi-multi-multi platinum album.  You'll love it.
0553106635|5.0|An amazing read!  <br />I had some misgivings, based on other reviews (and word of mouth) that the book would be nothing but protagonist carnage.  However, it was far more than that.<br />It was a gripping, epic read  (nearly 1000pp).  It was, again, over the top with sex -- it sometimes seems that GRRM uses it as filler--, violence and intrigue.  It only occassionally dipped in to the \\"not again\\" syndrome (ie, how many times can someone almost, but not quite meet somebody else that they were searching for).  <br />And-- going back to the protagonist killing machine that is reputed to be GRRM-- there are some \\"shocking\\" deaths that, upon reflection, really aren't that shocking.  If anything, GRRM seems reticient to kill off \\"antagonists\\" and ever willing to dole out the \\"splash\\" of magic to put the word \\"fantasy\\" in this \\"war of the roses\\" inspired, expanded & delivered upon delight.<br />It's book 3 in a reported-to-be 6 book series.  It's grim.  It's dark.  It's interim and self-standing.<br />As such, is it better than Jordan, or Tolkien, as some have claimed?  That's really the wrong question.  The right question is: why can't more authors fill the fantasy field with the same high quality that the above, and GRRM, do ?  Followed closely by: when is book 4 due ?<br />Bottom line:  An excellent-- nay, legendary-- addition to a classic series.  Buy it. Read it.  Enjoy it.
B00005JKJA|1.0|David Lynch, if your reading this, Mulholland Dr. was the same material you were producing ten years ago on &quot;Twin Peaks.&quot;  The goal of an artist is to move ahead, not to stagnate for ten boring years!  This &quot;movie&quot; was the worse piece of garbage I have seen &quot;The Brady Bunch Christmas Special&quot;.  This abysmal piece of junk might fool some who are easily fooled by the &quot;arts and croissant&quot; crowd into believing this is art.  The dialogue was forced and phoney, the acting more phoney than the script, and the story flat out boring.  Even the lesbian scenes were boring; how is that even possible!  I have seen commericals for cellular phones that are more artistic than this.  Any finacial executive that gives David Lynch a penny for any future film might was well throw his money out the window and let it fall into the street gutter.

B0000636UN|5.0|One thing I will say for Sheryl Crow - at least there is ONE artist out there who plays great 70s-inspired classic rock.  Who else can we turn to for this nowadays?  No...this album isn't grounbreaking but it's a good, hooky, enjoyable album with solid songwriting.  The only thing I am disappointed with is the cheesecake photos of Cheryl all over the CD sleeve.  She is GORGEOUS, but I just feel she should be above the typical exploitive stuff like this.

1573921394|3.0|The strengths of this book are in its treatment of time, information, uncertainty, and coordination problems. Keynes investigates many scenarios where miscommunication between groups of individuals leads to coordination failures that lead to a specific type of problem- deficient aggregate demand. We should think of trade cycles as coordination failures, and Keynes raises many such possibilities.<br />The historical significance of this book is a matter of contention. According to the prevailing mythology, Keynes singlehandedly transformed professional opinion concerning the causes of the Great Depression. Prior to Keynes all economists believed that markets self-correct. In reality, several economists developed demand side theories of unemployment before Keynes: Dennis Robertson, JM Clark, M Kalecki , Lautenbach, JA Hobson, JR Commons... Keynes was involved in the development of these ideas, but he is not singularly responsible for either the development or popularization of these ideas. The real founder of modern macroeconomics is the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell, not JM Keynes.<br /><br />There are empirical problems with this book. Keynes argued that decreases in private components of aggregate demand cause cycles. Yet, shifts in the money supply correlate well with depressions. Also, at the close of World War 2, Keynesians predicted another great depression in 1946 due to massive decreases in government spending for armaments. They were clearly wrong, and this is very damaging to Keynes' case. If his 'effective demand' hypothesis is correct, there should have been a depression in 1946. Modern Keynesians, like Paul Krugman, claim that we don't know what happened in 1946, but we really do know. Capitalism worked.<br /><br />Keynes paid almost no attention to data in this book. Instead, he focused, as the title implies, on theory.  His central hypothesis is his 'Principle of Effective Demand. He lays out the main variables involved here on page 29. This principle supposedly refutes Say's law of Market. Keynes claims that total spending can fail to generate full employment. This happens when total savings exceeds total investment. A key supporting argument is that investors will hold cash when interest rates fall. This cash holding supposedly causes demand to fall. The truth is that investors do not hold cash, but instead hold their money in some form of asset in financial markets, even when they are speculating over future bond prices. In the absence of legal restrictions money stays in the financial system and circulates. Depositors did withdraw money from banks- during the banking panics that began in November of 1930. Were these panics an effect of a slowdown that had already existed for more than a year, or the cause of the slowdown itself? Keynes might have the direction of causation backwards.<br />Keynes refers to the 'marginal efficiency of capital' and downplays the critical issue of time preference. Oddly, Keynes does admit that money serves as a link between present and future (p293), and even considers dividing economics between the theory of stationary equilibrium and shifting equilibrium (same page). But Keynes never dealt with time preference all that clearly. In his world, capital markets are driven by 'animal spirits', not expected profits. 'Marginal propensities' drive saving, not inter-temporal consumer choice. The validity of these propositions is questionable.<br /><br />Keynes' irrationalist view of markets stands in contrast to his view of government. Will public officials stabilize the economy via some socialization of investment? He seemed to believe that government officials seek simply to promote the general welfare, rather than to seek political gain by catering to special interests. Does the historical record substantiate this view of government?<br /><br />It should be noted that Keynes does not endorse deficit spending in this book. Deficit spending was proposed by Abba Lerner- and endorsed by Keynes (after initial hesitation). In this book Keynes recommended something even worse than deficit spending- `somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment' (p378). The economics profession drifted away from Keynes during the late 20th century. In fact, modern Keynesian economics bears almost no resemblance to this book. The recent financial crisis has renewed interest in The General Theory, but it is this resurgence warranted? We should consider the possibility that the housing boom was driven primarily by central bank policies, not by animal spirits. This book has its place in history, but it is possibly the most overrated economics book ever written.).

B00005JKG7|4.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? If you're a fan of well-made (but not overly slick) horror films, or if you're a Carpenter fan who hasn't seen this particular film, then I highly recommend The Fog.<br />Set in a fictional coastal village called Antonio Bay, with most of the story revolving round a widowed female DJ/Radio station owner (Adrienne Barbeau: Carpenter's wife, at the time), whose station transmits from a lighthouse, The Fog was made shortly after Halloween and certainly resembles Halloween on many aspects (which is not a bad thing). This time, however, the evil is a legend from the past which returns for vengeance on the citizens of Antonio Bay through and with a mysterious fog.<br />The Fog on DVD has extras that include photos, trailers, deleted scenes, flubs, and a making of The Fog, all of which I found very informative and entertaining, being a big fan of Carpenter's early films.<br />Basically, if you like Halloween, you'll like The Fog. The Fog is by no means a masterpiece, nor can it be ranked with Halloween; however, the familiar John Carpenter imagination, feel, original music, intensity, and scares are there, along with some familiar faces, and a much different setting.
B000002BYD|5.0|This is Pearl Jam's best album. All of them are outstanding, but this one just stands above them all. I didn't love it at first, but before too long, I saw the true genius herein. A song-by-song analysis:<br />Brain of J: A catchy, up-tempo, balls-out rocker. Good way to kick things off. 8/10<br />Faithful: One of the best on the album. Starts out slow and melodic, then rocks hard, then ends quietly. Interesting lyrics, hard to figure out. 10/10<br />No Way: One of the band's most unique songs. It has a cool, funky vibe to it. Everything in the song just clicks so well. 10/10<br />Given to Fly: Decent quiet verse, with a powerful, rocking chorus. 9/10<br />Wishlist: One of the band's better ballads. Very interesting and creative lyrics. Not much more to say. 9/10<br />Pilate: Somewhat boring verse, catchy chorus. It's not a bad song, but one of the weaker songs on the album. 7/10<br />Do the Evolution: This is my favorite Pearl Jam song. Another balls-out rocker, with a couple of catchy riffs, and a haunting, dramatic chorus (if you could call it a chorus). Brilliant lyrics about mankind's relationship with nature and the world around him. 10/10<br />Red dot: One of those Vitalogy-style experimental songs, which I merely classify as filler. The only skippable track on the album.<br />MFC: This one rocks, too. Nothing overly innovative, but it's still a good listen. 8/10<br />Low Light: Another soothing ballad. Very peaceful. 8/10<br />In Hiding: Sort of a midtempo song, not entirely rocking, not entirely mellow. Not much else to say....I'm very tired. 8/10<br />Push Me, Pull Me: A very unusual song. Spoken-word verse with a strange chorus. I don't know what it's about, or what the point is. It's still kind of catchy though. 7/10<br />All Those Yesterdays: Starts off as a mellow, quirky ballad. Then, halfway through, it starts to pick up the pace, and that's when it gets really good. Nice rocking outro. Along with Faithful, No Way, and Evolution, it's one of the bestsongs on here. 10/10<br />In closing, you can not call yourself a Pearl Jam fan if you don't own this album. It really is their best, though not the most accessable. If you don't own any PJ albums, go for Vs and Ten first, as they're easier to get into. After that, get Yield. You shan't regret it.
B00005JKWJ|1.0|What a stinker.  I mean, the first \\"Blade\\" movie wasn't exactly high art, but at least it had some enjoyable moments.  This sequel, by contrast, is dreary and belaboured, everything too calculated and cold... I'm sure they meant for it to be stylish and sexy, but it's all just dreadfully dull.  The film sets up the most hackneyed cliches (Blade the loner gets set up with a super team, a punkish/modern primitive vampire platoon, which he must lead to defeat their common foe...) but instead of following through on the premise, the filmmakers just let it drop to the floor, as flat as everything else in the movie.  No one bothers to embue the members of the group with any personality -- why bother?  they're going to die anyway.  In fact, they hardly get any dialogue at all, not even a wisecrack or cynical aside.  It's all just chop chop chop hack hack slice dice chop chop chop.  Hack.  Slice slice slice.  Bang bang bang.  Boom. Chop. Slice. Pow. Chop.  Bang bang bang.  Techno fetishism and grotty special effects are supposed to save this film, but once again, we learn the lesson that razzle dazzle and gimmickry in and of themselves cannot make a dead film fly.  An 11+ on the yawn-o-meter.
B000000WA4|5.0|Although a shade less brilliant than Siamese Dream in my book, Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness is a magnificent 28-song opus spanning 2-CDs and a multitude of musical styles. At times, the disparate influences and diversity between tracks cause some sprawling, unfocused tracks, but all in all, it's akeeper. One of the great acheivements of the 1990's, that probably won't(and shouldn't) be ever replicated or attempted.<br />The first disc, Dawn To Dusk, has more of the radio hits. The sweeping, orchestral &quot;Tonight, Tonight,&quot; the heavy grunge of &quot;Zero,&quot; and the famous 'rat in a cage' line of &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings.&quot; Other highlights are the rockers &quot;Jellybelly,&quot; and &quot;Ode To No One,&quot; and the soft, epic soothing songs &quot;Galapogos,&quot; and &quot;Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans.&quot;<br />The second disc, Twilight To Starlight, is harder to digest in that many songs are softer than on Disc 1. &quot;1979&quot; is found here, a 90's new-wave song. Other highlights are: the other Disc 2 hit, &quot;33,&quot; the epic rockers &quot;Bodies,&quot; &quot;Tales Of A Scorched Earth,&quot; &quot;X.Y.U.&quot;, and a plethora of other tracks consisting of lifting, grand, and sweeping design--all done in the Smashing Pumpkins' signature style. Billy Corgan's high-pitched whine of a singing voice, James Iha's textured guitar, D'Arcy's supporting bass lines, and Jimmy Chamberlain's intricate, progressive, technical drumming.<br />Just by reading the song titles and their cryptic lyrics, looking at the front and back of the mammoth CD case, and the pictures inside the two booklets, I get a feeling of magic and wonder. A feeling of surrealism, as if this is more than just a piece of music. It's art. More so to me than any Tool or Pink Floyd album. Each person is entitled to their own interpretation. You can find the music boring, or Corgan's voice annoying, or the whole thing too long. It might be laughable to compare it toPink Floyd or Tool. Fine. But you'll never know until you try it...

B00005JKDQ|5.0|An energy crisis in Monstropolis means that the scarers at Monsters Inc. whose daily job it is to scare children from their closets have to work harder to provide the city with energy. As an ad for Monsters Inc. says, \\"We scare because we care.\\"<br />The concept is imaginative and brilliant--each assistant works the machinery to put the door in place. The door is aligned with the closet door of a sleeping kid. The monster enters, scares the kid, filling a yellow energy cannister. John \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, a giant blue and purple furred ursine monster, and his assistant/pal Mike Wazowski, a fast-talking, wisecracking small green ball with a large eye, horns, and toothy smile, are the top scarer team. Right behind him is Randall, a nasty purple lizard with chameleonic talents who hates Sully and wants nothing more than to topple the friendly and loyally dependable giant from the top.<br />CEO James Watternoose, a gray multiocular creature with crustacean body, is concerned of the crisis and difficulties. Kids are depersonalized with violence and horror, Georgie, a scarer, accidentally has a kid's sock on him and has to be shaved and decontaminated, temporarily putting the Scare Floor out of action, and new scarer recruits aren't cutting it.<br />Sully goes back to the scare floor to retrieve some paperwork so Mike can go on a date. He sees a door still in place and lo and behold, encounters a little girl. To say he panics is an understatement. Monstropolis soon goes into crisis mode, complete with yellow-suited members of the Child Detection Agency. Seems that the running myth here is that children are toxic. \\"A single touch can kill you.\\" Yet Sully realizes that maybe Boo, (the little girl) might be safe to touch, and he becomes attached to her, to the chagrin of Mike. The simple solution would be to find her door and return her, which it is, but that would end the movie too quickly.<br />The key thing though is that throughout it all, all the monsters are anthropomorphs--they have basic human characteristics. If I close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue, I'd imagine a slapstick comedy. Even Roz, the raspy-voiced slug-like matron of accounting with pence-nez and a quiff of white hair, who's forever reminding Mike to turn in his paperwork, is human-like.<br />Mike Wazowski was tailor-made for Billy Crystal what with his fast-talker/charmer personality. Most of the triumphant dialogue is his to chew through. Ditto for Steve Buscemi, whose vocal talents exudes wonders as the slimy Randall. John Goodman's Sully is the most tender-hearted and most human character. The scenes when he faints four times in a row is funny. But other monsters who have a few lines are merely stunning even in their brief appearance. Check out the slug janitor who gives a satisfied nod at cleaning a spot on the floor. He departs leaving a trail of slime behind him.<br />Influences include the 1970's energy crisis, Mike's accent and schtick, which recalls the 1940's, jazz music from the 1940's, the Abominable Snowman, the Right Stuff style entrance of the scarers, The Invisible Man, the CIA, SWAT Teams, Medusa (Celia's hair), Star Wars (the filtered voice of the CDA members modelled after Imperial stormtroopers), and the opening scene of Star Trek II.<br />Oh yes. The opening For The Birds short feature involving a bunch of parochial sparrows and a large goony-bird on a telephone wire is just as enjoyable. And the Mike's New Car feature shown right after the credits has Mike having trouble with his six-wheel drive. And the bloopers segment shows that a certain monster does have a sense of humor after all.<br />Monsters Inc. is not only the most creative animated films I've seen since Twice Upon A Time, but the funniest. It's one movie I actually went to see twice at the theatres, and I don't do that often. Rating: Five eyes, suited for people with however many arms or legs.s--they have basic human characteristics.

B00005R87Q|5.0|ONE THING I LOVE ABT THIS MOVIE IS THE \\"NOS\\". ULTRA COOL. An the cop kid is a charlie chaplin who tries to become Arnie.No wonder he didnt climb the ladder after this movie.BUT VIN DIESEL IS REALLY A NATURAL. HES A REAL PRO. THE ONLY REASON I SAW THIS MOVIE IS BECOZ I LIKED VIN IN PITCH BLACK. The 3d engine mechanics sequences in the movie r quite good but not the best. The story line is very LOOOSE and does not actually leave u grippin onto ur seat. but Vins actin makes u sit here at least. No one wud sit there to see that wimp of a cop walkin around with a t-shirt to cover his skinny body.A real good movie fer those who like action with racing.
B0000028M7|5.0|Released back in 1992 , this album was the one that set Alice in Chains really high and not without reason. ... . About the album now, it seems to be the natural progression from \\"Facelift\\" and the songs move in the standard rock sound of that era. The songs though are very well written and performed and each song keeps you interested until the end. There are some really nice ballads as \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Down in a Hole\\" and Staley's voice sounds very emotional and strong on these tracks . Also the lyrics on \\"Down in a Hole\\" are a nice poetic attempt unlike most of their songs. Some are actually about [narcotics] like \\"Junkhead\\" where Mr. Staley encourages us to \\"open our minds and do as he does\\". I guess not. Some of the best tracks on this one have become Alice in Chains' hits like \\"Angry Chair\\" and \\"Would ?\\". It's a shame they couldn't keep up to this album and never released anything as worthy as this one. Luckily this album stands as one of the best hard rock albums of the period and is a definite must have. ...
0783225733|2.0|ROCKY V may have tanked at the box-office, but that didn't stop Sylvester Stallone from reviving the Apollo Creed character from the original film and spinning him off into his own franchise.  By the time this THIRTEENTH installment was released, the series had run out of gas.  The film is probably best remembered for it's tagline, &quot;Yo, Houston! It's me, Rocky...&quot;
B00005QG9J|5.0|I've been an Incubus fan for some time now. I've gone to a few of their amazing concerts, including twice to see the Morning View Tour. It's very hard for me to decide which Incubus album I like the most, but i either lean toward S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or this one. Morning View is one of the most diverse albums I have ever listened to. You have everything on this album. From hard heavy riffs, to melodic acoustic songs like &quot;Mexico&quot; and even a string orchestra and a ko-kyu given to the band by Steve Vai in &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; One listen and you will be hooked to Incubus forever. I really can't complain about any song on here. From the opening song &quot;Nice to know you&quot; to the very different &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; you will be in heaven.The best songs on this CD are:&quot;Circles,&quot; &quot;Blood on the ground,&quot; &quot;Wish you were here,&quot; &quot;Mexico,&quot; and &quot;Warning.&quot; Don't judge the CD by its soothing cover. There ARE hard songs on this CD. I like that there is less of a hip-hop influence on the CD. But even &quot;Are you in,&quot; which has a funky hip hop beat in it, is great. If you are an Incubus fan, and are weary of buying this just because you think  they have gone soft, don't think and buy this NOW! And if you are just starting to listen to them, i would highly suggest this CD because it really shows the talent of Brandon Boyd's singing and song writing ability. Just buy this CD and see them live!
0446310786|5.0|There are many reviews here that tell all about this book - so I won't bother with that. However, I am grateful to Harper Lee for giving the world this timeless treasure. Thank you for giving us Scout, Jem, Atticus, Dill, Calpurnia, Boo Radley, and Tom Robinson. They are characters that will always be treasured in the hearts of people.

B00003CXV4|3.0|I don't usually write reviews, cause my bad English, but here I go.<BR>The story is good, interesting and nice to follow. Charlize's character is beautiful and well acted. I liked the plot a lot, and although some said the ending was bad, I really think it was a good ending, not the usual cliche (I won't write any spoiler, but you'll see)<BR>I give the movie only 3 stars, cause I don't know what was wrong with the director, choosing Keanu Reeves for this story. This guy is good on action flicks only. He can't show ANY emotion, and what about his arm mannerisms? Is that acting? I can truly say that I saw so many of his &quot;Bill &amp; Ted Excellent Adventures&quot; character that I was shocked.<BR>Charlize did great though.<BR>Good movie. But not better than &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; Rent that one instead, really touching.
B00006AW2M|5.0|As any serious music historian knows, this album was the Stones' &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot; It sounds like no other release in their impressive catalog. And it IS a departure. But, that's the point! Why have so few people NOT  gotten it. Are they simply NOT LISTENING? &quot;Satanic Magesties&quot; is an awesome piece of work. And psychedelia never sounded so good as it does on the brilliant &quot;2000 Light Years From Home.&quot; And it sounds great  on &quot;Sing This All Together,&quot; &quot;Citadel,&quot; and &quot;In Another Land&quot; (Bill Wyman's 'underwater' vocals are both freaky and effective for the style of the song...NOT thin or weak like a reviewer stated!). And &quot;2000 Man&quot; and &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot; are two of the bands best efforts to date. Overall, a very much underappreciated and underated Stones album. Just give it a chance and listen to it with an open mind (and ears) and I think you'll discovery a true masterpiece. It's different all right...But, in keeping with the &quot;Spirit Of '67&quot; and the band itself...it's a GAS! GAS! GAS!
B0000691U1|5.0|The Duke, and his prime rate followers on this record, has his claim to fame: to play the most beautiful jazz on the planet.<br />They achieve the aim - elegantly.<br />It's clear that everybody else pales against the master. He's in charge and everybody knows. But the music is just enchanting.<br />This is a record that you won't forget once you've listened to it with care.<br />If you like improvising, masterful playing and keen vision, please own this record. If not, ask yourself: Am I really alive?
0316666343|5.0|I like the way Alice Sebold came up with putting the whole story within the framework of fantasy, beginning in heaven. That's what makes this book different and fascinating. If you liked &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;, I recommend that you next read another book I have read that is similarly presented, a book called &quot;West Point...&quot;, by Norman Thomas Remick
B000001ESF|5.0|Rush broke through with this album, and while listening to it, I can now understand how they did it. <BR>The title track, &quot;2112&quot;, is a 20 minute mammoth of a song, but listen to it the entire way through. The &quot;2112 Overture&quot; will grasp you in and lead you through the entire track.<BR>This entire disc will enthrall you and make you want more. After listening to the entire album once, I pushed the &quot;replay&quot; button on my stereo, and let it roll again. I absolutely loved it. I know you will too.
B000002H72|5.0|The first thing about DOOLITTLE that shocks anyone following the Pixies' albums chronologically is how much of a transition had occurred from the band's 1988 debut SUFER ROSA. The Boston quartet had moved from a razor-sharp raw sound to something a bit more warm and coherant. David Lovering's drumming is a lot smoother and polished here. Nonetheless, what fans liked about SUFER ROSA is still here, there's just a lot more of it, including Black Francis' odd lyrics.<br />The vocals here are incredible solid. The mixing balances Kim Deal's backup singing perfectly, neither making her inaudible or having her overwhelm the main vocals. Black Francis is doing more than just wailing here like on SUFER ROSA, he's able to expertly jump from melody to screaming to monotone to menacing whispers.<br />What is interesting about DOOLITTLE is how it takes from the past in creating a genre never heard before. \\"Wave of Mutilation\\" has as its basis surf music, but is transformed into something more. In \\"Here Comes Your Man\\", a remake of a song on their 1987 demo tape, 60's pop and a dash of country are obvious influences. \\"Tame\\" and \\"Dead\\" are inspired by punk rock, a movement that had taken place only ten years before, but was so over with as to be considered oldies already. \\"La La Love You\\" and \\"There Goes My Gun\\" are reminiscent of nascent rock 'n' roll from the late 50's.<br />The design of the album, by acclaimed British design firm v23, is one of 4AD's best. Simon Larbalestier's photography complements the music well, just compared the cover to the contents of the song \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven\\". The lyrics are printed in the insert in a way that goes along with the overall design.<br />DOOLITTLE is a natural progression from SURFER ROSA, and it shows a band getting better and better. If you liked SUFER ROSA, move on to this one. And if you've never heard the Pixies, check out DOOLITTLE.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen was something I picked up indirectly. I had read Dark Knight Returns and was reading reviews of it, and I constantly saw it being compared to Alan Moore's Watchmen. Having placed Dark Knight as my favorite graphic novel, I had to get Watchmen to see if it deserved that position.<br />I love Watchmen. Moore introduces characters that are deep and have actual reasons for donning a mask and fighting crime. They are real people, not aliens gifted with super strength. Rorshach will always remain one of my favorite characters, after Batman. His story alone is worth it. I wish there was more written about all the characters in Watchmen, but that's what makes it truly a masterpiece.<br />Moore's talent is truly seen in how he can let readers know almost everything about a character without any prior knowledge. Watchmen is a self-contained world with no ties to any other comics. Where DKR is a magnificent tale about one man's struggles and his last battle, Watchmen tells the LIFE stories of several characters and the world's final battle.<br />I can't decide if DKR or Watchmen is better. I love them both for different reasons. The scope of Watchmen will blow your mind, and it all started with a smile. :)<br />Have a nice day
B00003CXAY|4.0|...<br />Certain movies (especially during the 80s) were shot full frame on the film negative with the intention of \\"matting\\" the frame to create a widescreen picture with a 1.85:1 aspect radio. There were a few reasons for doing this, including making it easier to display on television (back when nobody except laserdisc fans could appreciate letterboxing) as well as other technical reasons. <br />You can see examples of this with unmatted television releases of movies like \\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure.\\" Remember when he's pulling the chain from his bike and you can see it coming in from the bottom of the screen? This wasn't intended as a joke, but rather the bottom chain was supposed to be blacked out by a matte. <br />Rest assured, even when some of the picture is covered, it wasn't the director's intention for you to see that part of the screen. If you've seen the unmatted version (either on television or in a theater) you're not seeing the director's true vision. Yes, the unmatted version may have more picture content, but it's not content you're necessarily supposed to see. Sometimes the director would shoot with the understanding that both versions (aspect ratios) would be seen, even when they preferred the widescreen version. Other times, the unmatted versions would display undesired visuals, including dolly tracks, boom microphones, and filming equipment. Not to mention the framing of the shots will often be compromised. <br />So, more isn't always better. When it comes down to it, the vision of the movie you're supposed to see is that of the director's. When a DVD release presents a matted version, they're not doing this to appease people with widescreen televisions... they're doing it to give you the correct, director's version of the film.

No book has ever tugged at my heart like this one with so many varied emotional responses.<BR>I LOVED IT!<BR>
B00005R23S|4.0|Any Springsteen fan knows the catcall, and hopefully, everyone will have the chance to do it at least once in their life. I had the pleasure of doing so at the Toronto show in May of 2000. This DVD captures the mood, the excitment, and the pure showmanship of Springsteen and his fantastic E Street band.<br />The footage was taken from the last two shows of the 2000 tour at Madison Square Garden, and it contains a total of 25 songs spanning 2 DVDs. The usual hits are there: Badlands, Out in the Street, Two Hearts, Murder Incorporated, the list goes on and on. The musical highlights are, without question, an acoustic version of \\"Born in the USA\\", and the brand new song \\"American Skin (41 Shots)\\", which is a beautiful and soulful ballad. But the greatest sequences are between songs. Springsteen's famous \\"Preacher mode\\" during \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" is inspired, while his interaction with the rest of the band is priceless. Springsteen, despite pushing 50, it an energetic and spirited performer, and I don't believe I have seen anyone sweat as much as he does in this concert.<br />The DVD set also contains a 15 minute documentary \\"New York Serenade\\", which has interviews with the entire band, on how their tour is going, what started it, ect. A rare insight from Bruce and the band.<br />Having said all the praise, the DVD is somewhat lacking in features. It would be nice to have different camera angles, like a lot of concert DVDs have. Also, more extras. The 15 documentary can best be described as a teaser, and leave you wanting more. But to judge the DVD solely on what it is, it is a fantastic conert, and one you will want to re-visit often.
0393316041|4.0|\\"Surely You're Joking\\" frankly and unabashedly has the sole purpose of explaining what its like to be Feynman.   It reads as if you've cornered him at a party, and asked him to explain just why he acted so weird, then transcribed what he said for five hours.    For those who are unfamiliar with Feynman's particular brand of eccentricity, his unwillingness to accept anything he's told as gospel, this should be an eye-opener.   For those who consider themselves the same, if not in intelligence but in approach to life, it's an egotistical trip wherein one has the guilty pleasure of saying \\"Yes, the Universe really is so stupid, isn't it?\\"
B000001EQT|4.0|Like so many of the albums I now find myself trawling for, my first copy of The Slider was on good old 12\\" vinyl. In that original incarnation it only included the first 13 tracks now included on the CD release. \\"Thunderwing\\" and \\"Lady\\" were, if memory serves me, first aired on the B-side of the \\"Metal Guru\\" single, while \\"Cadillac\\" (the great single-that-never-was in my opinion) never really seemd to find a home it was happy with. In feel it probably belongs with the sparser-sounding \\"Zip Gun\\" than with the lusher \\"Slider\\" or \\"Tanx\\" production. Purists may argue that \\"Electric Warrior\\" is the T.Rex album to own if you're only going to have the one, but it is essentially a transitional album bridging the gap between the earlier Tolkienesque folk period and the Glam that followed and ends up being neither one thing nor t'other. \\"Slider\\" lies firmly in the latter period and is as good an example of the strengths and weaknesses of Marc Bolan as writer and performer as you are likely to get. I can think of nobody else in the modern period who has been able to extract such a variety of results from the basic three-chord blues riff. It's a well documented fact that Bolan would have loved to be Elvis, and on the strength of this perhaps he wouldn't have made a bad job of it. It's too easy to treat some of the lyrics harshly, branding them \\"pretentious\\" or \\"unintelligeable\\", (although if it were early 20th century poetry it would be called \\"hermetic\\" and treated with reverence), but that's what Bolan was all about from first to last. T.Rex are probably pretty much of an unknown quantity to most American listeners outside of \\"Get It on\\" (with it's title inexplicably censored for transatlantic consumption). Here in Britain for 3 or so all too brief years he was the epitome of a pop star. \\"Slider\\" more than any other album illustrates what he was about before succumbing to McCartney's Syndrome and putting the wife on keyboards.
B00005QJDG|5.0|These guys are simply the torchbearers for those of us who still believe in excellence in musicianship, writing, and performing! I just saw them in Atlanta and they were beyond all expectations. After a sad concert in Nashville watching my favorite band for 25 years(Rush) struggle to play their own songs, these guys(DT) were absolutely amazing. For the last 10 years they have filled a musical void for me and the show in Atlanta was as good as any band that I have ever heard anywhere. Their playng is flawless. I am a drummer and was amazed at Mike's playing but I was not expecting James LaBrie's vocals to be so great. Sure he is my favorite singer on tape -but can he do it live? I am here to tell you that this guy's vocals were the most amazing exhibiton of singing that I have ever heard-on key and soaring through all of the instruments. I normally don't listen to vocals much-but I do with this band! His first Mullmuzzler is great-better than the second one-try the first one. Anyway-you must buy this album to hear just how great this band is. Thanks guys for staying together. Any of these guys could go play for anyone-but they have the wisdom to realize that they are very special --just as they are. You must buy this!
B00005JKJA|1.0|Sometimes it seems like filmmakers go out of their way to make a film &quot;artsy&quot; or &quot;not understandable to the average viewer.&quot;<br />I am just a average guy looking for some entertainment from home videos.  Mulholland Drive was wacked!<br />The film is centered around a car crash that takes place on Mulholland Drive, one that leaves Naomi Watts with a case of amnesia.  She stumbles into a woman's apartment, falls asleep and is awoken by the woman's neice.<br />This is where my understanding of the movie ends.  Beyond the first half hour it becomes weirder and weirder.  I finally gave up on it and went to bed.  <br />In my opinion, most people who claim they love movies like this are guilty of letting the critics shape their opinion.  They are quick to jump on the bandwagon, but for the most part, fail to have a deep understanding of the film.<br />As an average guy, I had no idea what this movie was about.  I have placed it in my &quot;critically acclaimed, but too confusing to understand&quot; movie category.  Other movies in this category would include: Momento, Pulp Fiction, Requiem for a Dream, Pi, and Vanilla Sky.<br />Don't waste your time.
0316666343|5.0|This is not a crime story.  The method in which Susie dies is almost irrelevant - her murder a pretext.  The sheer intensity of the emotions examined in \\"The Lovely Bones\\" was intoxicating.  I found myself on the train from work fighting back tears of sadness, frustration and joy in such quick succession that I had to stop reading to catch my breath.  <br />This is a study on the fragility of relationships and the complexity of emotions felt by individuals experiencing the same loss.  Each of the characters in this novel experience the loss of Susie, but in so many different ways - some healthy, some not so much.  I agree that the end might have been a bit \\"happy\\" and one can speculate, unrealistic; however, in order to fully appreciate the depth of the feelings examined, I think it had to end on a relatively high note.  Otherwise leaving so much weight to bear that the reader would be unable to digest any one piece fully.  <br />The concentration was on the examination of human emotions, not on the particulars of her death.  As a matter of fact, towards the end, I thought it obvious that the story of her murder and her murderer's capture had become secondary.  Almost awkward interjections with updates of his whereabouts were scattered through the last third of the book.<br />Ms Sebold's flowing prose drew me in from page one and didn't release me until I'd finished the Acknowledgements.  I will be recommending this book to everyone I know.

B000068FUS|5.0|Don't let the dated catergory of &quot;concept album&quot; turn you away - this is much more than that - it is raw, loud rock at its best and there is not a filler to be found.  This powerful, literate and thourghly realized record tells a coherent and well written story but the story doesn't, as one might expect, detract from the music which is full of punk rock energy and arena rock hubris that actually delivers.  This is a rare achievement - usually rock revivalists are annoying, of the &quot;are you ready to rock?&quot; variety, or too hip and ironic to admit they do love to rock and so can't stop smirking.  Today it is refreshing to find compentent songwriters like Patterson Hood who can remind us of what was so great about grand, powerful rock music to begin with.  What is most refreshing, however, is how literate the whole thing is.  Patterson is a smart guy who knows his subject.  I grew up in the south and can vouch that PH has nailed it but you don't have to be southerner to love this album.  Anyone who has ever &quot;turned it up&quot; and listened with closed eyes knows the feeling of a real rock album and how rare that is to find these days.  Don't miss this one.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Techno-futuristic might be a good term to describe this 2001-space-odissey-like musical epic (sorry about the convoluted description...)<br />I was in the dark about these guys until they came out with this album. I was lucky enough to learn about them through ... They are simply light years ahead from most of the acts these days, out there with the Becks, the Wilcos, the Travis and the Doves of today. First listen or a careless listen to the album results in a shocking impression, specially with the two title tracks, parts one and two. But take half a minute (too bad it's so short) to listen to the sample of \\"In The Morning of the Magicians\\" that Amazon offers: you'll be amazed at the depth of the music... the story that these 11 songs carry within will bring you up and down and leave you wishing you had more time in the day to listen to the album over and over (my wife is starting to not like this idea, I have to say.)<br />Packed with echoes from the sixties' psychodelia, themes with harmonies that deserve careful attention (in particular check out the impeccable and ellaborate bass line in \\"One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21\\"), this brilliant work by these guys from Oklahoma produced in me emotions similar to those I experienced back in 1997 when Radiohead released their work 'O.K. Computer'.<br />After this, I will now start to dig into their past works to discover where they come from. Seems like \\"Soft Bulletin\\" is next in line, but so far, this album stands out as one of the year's best without doubt and one of the best I've had a chance to listen to in my life!
B000063COX|4.0|Considering that when you mention Iron Maiden these days people associate them with Brave New World, it makes me wondor how many of them have heard this album. I can honestly say that I feel that this album is one of their best. It's a debut, and I'm not going to say that it doesn't sound like one, but it is raw, it's strong, its passionate and its darkly haunting.<br />Maiden surprised everybody else when they mixed the melodies of metal, the aggressiveness of punk and even some elements of progressive (in the epic Phantom Of The Opera and some of lead breaks which build up and up). Maiden were quite literally in a league of their own. They were one step ahead of every other New Wave Of British Heavy Metal bands and for good reasons.<br />Although this isn't their absolute finest hour I still feel that this is a much better album than &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;, &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;. This is a damn great album, and one that is different to most other Maiden albums (aside from &quot;Killers&quot; which also has Paul Di'Anno on vocals). One of the first albums to start off The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal back in the late 70s and early 80s!!
B000005RT8|3.0|This album is definitely not for everybody; I'd narrow it down to hardcore Macca fans. About twelve years ago Capitol was selling a bundled boxset featuring McCartney, Ram, Red Rose Speedway, and McCartney II. That purchase was the first time I ever heard McII. The album was released in the wake of Wings' fiasco tour of 1980, when Wings suddenly disbanded following Paul's drug bust at a Japanese airport. There were no Wings studio recordings, and Capitol needed product. Paul made all of these recordings at home during the summer of 1979, using all kinds of synthezers and voice-altering machines to create some creative tunes. I guess he never thought this would evolve into an album project. I agree with the reviewer suggesting this was an early techno album. The instrumental songs are a little long but sound great--almost like they could have served as background music in a movie. \\"Waterfalls,\\" \\"One of These Days\\" and \\"Summer Day's Song\\" far surpass most of the material on the first McCartney album imho. I doubt this cd will be reissued anytime soon due to lack of an audience for it. Buy it if want to hear some good home recordings featuring Paul on all instruments, basically tinkering around with his machines. I think the two Fireman albums were another reminder that there is a side to Sir Paul that we are overlooking... check it out.
B000001Y2U|4.0|I've never got into Marilyn Manson before. I'd heard Mechanical Animals and passed off most of it as boring (though there were a few good songs) and I'd heard Smells Like Children which is quite possibly the worst album I've ever had the misfortune to hear. Manson had always come across (to me at least) as style over substance - hiding poor musicianship and worse music by coating it with the controversial image of Satan worshiping drug addicts with an obsession for sex.<br />Not here. This is dark grim music, and I have to admit that at first I didn't get it. It seemed to trudge along for the most part and the lyrics seemed to be nothing other than over the top attempts at offending Christian authority. But patience is required. Although some of the songs here are fast and heavy (Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Little Horn, 1996) and others are still brash and in-your-face (Beautiful People, Angel With The Scabbed Wings, Antichrist Superstar, Reflecting God) (which for a metalhead like me I found it easier to get into them), there are others that are darkly melodic (Dried Up Tied And Dead To The World, Tourniquet, Mister Superstar, The Man That You Fear) and then there are the plain wierd (any other songs that I haven't already mentioned). Needless to say, quite a variety. It did surprise me the amount of good material here. The album has a very strange feel to it that sends shivers down my spine - perhaps partly indebted to the brilliantly designed sleeve with compliments the music perfectly.<br />It does require patience. It requires you to take a look at where the band are coming from and what they are trying to do musically. One listen and it will sound ill-attempted at best and poor at worst. An open mind is perhaps the most important thing to have when listening to this. Forget first impressions. Forget whatever you already think of this band. Take it with a pinch of salt. With time it is very enjoyable - albeit in a dark way.<br />And they say his mother still calls him Brian...lls him Brian...
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed are a brilliant band with powerful vacals from Scott Stapp and excellent guitaring from Mark Tremonti. Alot of people say that Creed sound too much like Pearl Jam and will whine until the end of time. This however is not true, Although the Vocalist (Scott Stapp) does sound slightly similar to Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam, the music of Creed is nothing like Pearl Jam and takes influence from Metallica and the Doors. From the first song 1)Are you ready, opens up with a seriously catchy mandolin vibe which then turns into a wonderful rucus of guitars and drums. 2)What if, is a heavy and angry song filled with an emotin of rage and discomfort about society as we speak of which then turns into 3) Beautiful which speaks of a differnet rage of a relationship breakdown. 4) Say I, gives an insight to how modern people have lost their faith and slows the album down to the influence provided by the Doors. 5) Wrong Way, a masterpiece which features in the film End of days. 6) Faceless Man, a story about guilt and having to face yourself, mellow but heightens to complete brilliance. 7) Never Die, back tothe Doors influence again with brilliant lyrics 8) With arms wide open, probably the greatest song ever,Scott expresses his joy as he learns he is to become a father, powerful and emotional. 9) higher, the title of the song is how you will feel after listening to it. 10) Wash away those years, a sad story about a girl who was raped, emotional and understanding, touches the soul. 11) Inside us all, brilliant song, melodic and spiritual. 12) Young grow old (EU version only), hard and hits brilliantly. In the end a brilliant masterpiece put together. Real band, talking about real issues, depressing and joyful emotions make this album a fantastic rollercoaster of life and the guitars will just hit you like you have been run down by a truck.
B00005OM4Q|1.0|This movie is as slick as candy. Nothing real, nothing touching ... very hollywood. If you know what I mean by that, and don't like hollow films, you won't like this one. You can't get those two hours of your life back. Cameron Crowe cannot deliver reality.
B0000025CP|5.0|One of the best rock-metal albums ever.It's as simple as that.<BR>Halford's vocals are absolutely stunning ,i consider this album as a vocal lesson for all singers!His voice ranges from high operatic to slow blues and angry metal screams.The sound of this album is way ahead of it's time paving the way for later metal bands.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|BROTHERS AND SISTERS 40TH ANNIVERSARY SUPER DELUXE EDITION is the definitive version of the 1973 masterwork by the Allman Brothers Band. Even though it was their first album without Duane, and bassist Berry Oakley died two songs into its making, the band managed to pull things together and not only make their best album ever, but a landmark that inspired everything from the Eagles' decision to go in a more rock-oriented direction and the Outlaws' blend of harmony-heavy country-rock and jam-powered Southern rock, to the jazz-rock fusion artists of the 70s. If all of the latter had TRULY listened to this album, we wouldn't have seen fusion mutate into smooth jazz. This 4-CD set includes not only the original album in full remastered glory, but a second CD of studio jams and rehearsals and then TWO MORE CDS of a live show at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom. No rock fan can afford to be without this album.
B000000OQF|5.0|I enjoyed this CD in high school in the 80's. I still enjoy this CD.  Guns N Roses has a unique quality to their music.
B000001F9E|5.0|This is a GREAT Thin Lizzy album. There are some hot rockers on here, including the title track. \\" The Boys Are Back In Town\\" is overplayed, but there are other undiscovered gems on this landmark album of 70s heavy metal.
0767817710|4.0|Yadda, yadda, yadda...this movie has been picked apart by every film critic for the lack of a \\"deep story\\" or \\"not adhering\\" to the rules of how a true spaghetti western should be created. One can see why Sharon Stone seemed to immensely enjoy her role; she broke the age old \\"western\\" notion/tradition that the town's mysterious stranger has to be a man. Her role as Ellen/Lady is both sexy and intelligent (albeit at times her moves and mannerisms too choreographed and lines predictable...so what).This role is far from her glamorous usual roles (yet she still looks good !). What's enticing about this film is how the pace of action and story telling moves at an alarming rate without losing the viewer's interest.The entire cast is great, almost too great for a mere 108 minutes of film time. But that's the beauty of this flick. Also, the direction or production is pure Raimi style with the intense close ups and bigger than life picturesque back scenes. Yet, an underlying tone of tongue in cheek caricaturism of the typical spaghetti western style exists ;it's almost an homage. Hackman is at his evil best as Herod (think of King Herod from the bible) and a young DiCaprio shows he's not just a young kid playing \\"The Kid\\". This was also one of Russel Crowe's lesser or better known roles before Gladiator or The Insider. Early versions of this dvd do not bare his name or photo on the front cover as later versions do after making it to Oscar status for Gladiator. Crowe's laid back and reluctant character Cort has that seething hatred and vengeful agenda hidden beneath his cool and composed surface just as Stone's character does. While this film is nowhere near the classics by Eastwood it is engrossing entertainment at its best that engages a viewer to find out what's going to happen next. Yes, the ending may be too neat and tidy but overall it's a great rental at best and maybe somewhat a keeper for those who like this genre or the actors...maybe both !<br />As far as the technical aspects of the dvd transfer, both video and audio are clean and void of any major artifacts that plague so many dvds in this great digital, almost perfect age. The 5.1 surround is spectacular ! It truly demonstrates what surround speakers and a subwoofer are for. You will be thrilled with the rocking explosions, bullets ricocheting,wind howling, rain pouring, thunder and lightning dancing around. You will hear dogs barking behind you and a gamut of other special efects that will put some newer, bigger budgeted action dvds to shame ! Bravo for the sound mixers and editors for their Dolby Digital wizardry for this dvd !!!...

0553573403|5.0|This series has got to be one of the best things I've read in a very long time.  Everyone is comparing George Martin to Tolkien, and that comparison is definitely justified.  His storytelling is definitely as masterful as the Master himself, and God, those characters!  Catelyn, Tyrion, Arya, Daenerys, all of them!  They are as solid and unforgettable as Tolkien's bunch, even if they aren't quite as comfortable to read about.  Therein lies the caveat...this is not a white-light twinkie, pixy-fairying through Hobbitland and Elfheim kind of fantasy.  This is ROUGH STUFF.  Lotsa blood, lotsa sex and lotsa downright medieval vulgarity.  But its all a part of this astonishing world he has created, one that ... in even an old softie escapist like me and thrusts me forward into the dark uncertainties of his tale.  Get this series, devour it, and curse George Martin's name for not getting it done fast enough even as you praise his genius, because A Song of Ice and Fire far exceeds your average fantasy.  It will stand with The Lord of the Rings and Dune as a true benchmark literary acheivement above and beyond even the most pleasant tales spun by the human imagination.  Utterly unforgettable.

After a while of not hearing it, I heard it on the radio yesterday (9/21/02) and it meant something to me.  I don't know what.  But, it kind of gave me a peace.<br />3. Woke Up This Morning-love the guitars in this one!  Chad Kroger is kind of annoying though in this song.<br />4. Too Bad-their second hit where I'm from!  I loved it the first time I heard it and I still love it!  This is a great song!  It's in my top three favorites!<br />5. Just For-I LOVE THESE LYRICS!  THEY'RE HILIRIOUS!  This song kind of reminds me of somebody...I LOVE THIS SONG!  This song is in my top three favorites!<br />6. Hollywood-see 'Woke Up This Morning'<br />7. Look What Your Money Bought-guitars make this song dancy!  I like Chad Kroger in this one!  This song is cool!  It kind of reminds me of a sterotype cheerleader (it just does, I don't know why).<br />8. Where Do I Hide-the guitars sound like they're trying to be played TOO cool which is not cool.  But, the rest of the song is good.  There's just something about Chad Krogers voice that sounds powerful and I like it!  This song reminds me of a different somebody...<br />9. Hangnail-the music and Chad Kroger's voice flows very well in this song!  Very nice.<BR>  <BR>10. Good Times Gone-starts off slow like it's going to be a sad song.  This song sounds country to me and that's SO not Nickelback's style.  It gets annoying.  UGH!<br />Anyway, this is a good album.  It has it's special but then again, it doesn't.  It just depends.  Good CD overall.

B000002LQD|1.0|Magic And Loss is either Lou Reed's best or worst album depending on your taste ,but I can't listen to it. I owned it on cassette, and I'm not exactly sure where it is now. I played it in my car stereo one Sunday on the way to band practice, and found it so depressing, I wanted to throw it out the window, and swore I would NEVER play it again. For any record to bring these feelings from someone makes it almost a work of true creative genius just for that shock value, which Mr. Reed has been good at for all of his career. On the other hand you could say it's so depressing that the entertainment value is nil. Makes Berlin look like a Sunday picnic.

This was actually the first thing I ever owned by Lou Reed, after I actually bought a Velvet Underground album I realized what...Rock N' Roll Animal actually is.<br />Overall, competent and dull, no edge from the guy who created edgey rock.For people stuck on stadium rock ONLY.
B000002KKS|5.0|Black Sabbath's Heaven and Hell, is a noteworthy recording in the history of metal.  Coming at a particular point in time, it marked the beginning and end of several significant events.  Black Sabbath, at the time arguably the heaviest of metal bands, was releasing their first album since the departure of founding member, frontman, and metal icon, vocalist Ozzy Osbourne.  Replacing the Ozzman, was ex-Rainbow vocalist, Ronnie James Dio.  Dio's efforts with Rainbow, collaborating with temperamental guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, had produced quality heavy metal with mystical and medieval themes.  Dio, certainly seemed to be a suitable choice to succeed Ozzy.  True, their voices were not at all similar, but then no one could truly \\"replace\\" Ozzy, who brought more to Sabbath than just his voice, but also the whole attitude and persona of a heavy metal \\"madman\\".<br />Dio's style was totally different.  Small in statue, he possessed a rich and powerful voice.  His talent for imagery-laden songwriting that evoked mystical themes, was unique in metal.  In some circles, Dio's stature exceeded Osboure's as a singer, writer and frontman.  The big question was, what kind of results would the collaboration between Dio and the remaining members of Black Sabbath produce?  The parting between Ozzy and the rest of the Sabs had been a jagged one, and Dio would be stepping into a sensitive situation.  Osbourne had a long history of disagreements with guitarist Tony Iommi, complaining that Sabbath's song structure was becoming too experimental, and that excessive time was spent in the production of their records, reaching a zenith on the \\"Sabotage\\" album.<br />For most metal fans, the results could be called \\"magical\\".  Heaven and Hell was the full realization of the potential that Dio's collaboration with Sabbath held.  Produced by metal master craftsman, Martin Birch (Deep Purple, Iron Maiden), the album was a solid slab of metal, that pounded the eardrums, and rocked harder than most recent Sabbath releases.  The album's sound, was a return to the \\"heaviness\\" of previous albums like \\"Master of Reality\\".  The production softened the \\"edge\\" of Iommi's guitar sound, and Geezer Butler's bass is more prominent and dynamic in the mix.  Song structure was basic, straight ahead, and non-experimental.  Ronnie Dio's vocals meshed perfectly with the revamped, traditional Sabbath sound, settling smoothly into the E flat tuning preferred by Iommi.<br />Side one (the first four songs) is simply classic, probably the best side of music Sabbath has ever recorded.  Better than even side one of Paranoid.  \\"Neon Knights\\" is simply one of Sabbath's greatest tunes ever.  Just the first example, of Dio's \\"dreamweaving\\" style of writing.  The song is full of energy, interesting cord progressions, and punctuated by one of Tony's more memorable solos.  The beautiful acoustic intro to \\"Children of the Sea\\", sets up the hard pounding main groove of the song.  Again more lyrical imagery, but a rather uninspiring Iommi solo.  Dio would later use a similar song structure, for his rocker \\"The Last In Line\\".  Geezer Butler's bouncy bass opens \\"Lady Evil\\", a hard riffing song about your local witch.  Iommi's wah wah guitar solo is outstanding, starting out slow, and then trilling and thrilling, evoking a feeling of crawling evil dread.  Spooky stuff.  Capping of the side is the title track, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" a metal epic.  The song quickly establishes a groove for Dio's vocals, as he spins lines about, well...heaven and hell.  Tony Iommi's well crafted extended solo begins slowly, with bluesy licks, then after a signature change, gains speed and builds intensity, finally reaching a frantic crescendo, leaving in its aftermath only the sound of the classical guitar outro.<br />The second half of the album, can't match the first for intensity.  Breaking the gloomy tone, it opens with the spunky, \\"Wishing Well\\", perhaps the most upbeat tune Dio ever recorded with Sabbath.  The songfeatures bright catchy chords, and a nice layered Iommi solo.  \\"Die Young\\" goes back to a heavy tone, with layered guitars and a cool rhythm track.  The tempo ebbs and flows, as Dio weaves another lyrical tale.  Tony revs up for some frantic soloing in the song's outro.  \\"Walk Away\\" is the weakest song on the album.  The tempo and tone, just don't seem to be appropriate and Dio's lyrics are not his best either.  Back firmly in character, the band finishes with the haunting \\"Lonely is the Word\\", perhaps the closest thing to blues in the Dio era.  Again, Dio's lyrics, while not always making literal sense, give the song the desired atmosphere and tone.  Tony takes over for two tasteful extended solo breaks.  As the keyboards play underneath, the music fades on one of metal's true classic albums.  At a time when disco music still lived, there was nothing to match Heaven and Hell for heaviness.  It simply crushed all contenders.  Truly a landmark recording, in many ways.<br />Ronnie James Dio would remain with the Black Sabbath for just one more studio recording, before proceeding to a solo career.  How potent this combination really was, could be seen when Dio rejoined Sabbath in 1992, for the album \\"Dehumanizer\\", another metal masterwork.The song features bright catchy chords, and a nice layered Iommi solo.  \\"Die Young\\" goes back to a heavy tone, with layered guitars and a cool rhythm track.

0385720920|3.0|I had read Fight Club, loved it, loved the movie, and heard about his new Lullaby coming out, which sounded intriguing...<br />I was really into Choke for a while, and the prose was fun to read, for a while.  It does feel like he sticks to the same types of gags, same characters, and I don't feel like this book told me much that Fight Club didn't.  <br />Palahniuk's writing kinda reminds me of the TV show Jack-ass (which I really like, incidentally) where what he's describing is his way of saying \\"I do this in real life, too.  Aren't I weird?\\"  I definitely felt that he intends to shock, not necessarily touch.<br />My final assessment, other than that I did finish the book, and mildly enjoy it, is that with only 40 pages left, I fell asleep reading it...Just when Palahniuk starts to get you interested, he goes off on another screwy path describing druggie faux-colonists or tantric sex positions on airplanes.  While amusing, it wasn't exactly enlightening.
0380977788|5.0|I admit, that I bought this because of Gaiman's name, but Caroline is a book that holds its own without the author's cult fame.  Seeking to find an escape from her prosiac life and indifferent (but not bad) parents, the young Caroline journeys through a door that should lead to nowhere, and finds herself back where she started...except everything is wrong.  I admit there are portions that are not exactly inspired, but that is because the rest of the story is so good.  As for the classification...I'm not sure I would read this to my nephew.  It's good, but there are portions that are subtly disturbing.  All I know is that after reading Caroline, I had a nightmare where my mother was not my mother.  Take that as a detraction or a recommendation as you see fit.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Its the best thrash album ever!!! One of the best  produced slayer albums. Starts off with the classic Angel OF death. Then Piece by piece, which is heavy as hell. Necrophobic is about the fastest song know to man kind. Alter of Sacrafice is just, well awsome. Then theres Jesus Saves and Criminally Insane. Reborn is my favorite song on this album. Then theres Epidemic where Dave plays some crazy drums. Postmortem is awsome and is my second favorite song. And then finally, RAINING BLOOD from a lacerated sky!!! That song is creepy. Now, if you listen to limp bizkit and you think your so bad, listen to this and it will take you several years to recover.
B00005NRN9|4.0|I have been fortunate to see live performances of C du S's La Nouba and Quidam which were both exqusite and breathtaking.  The originality that C du S brings to their performances brings out the child in me and every time I see them I am moved.  This is what circus should be about.   I have seen journey of man several times at the IMAX cinema at the Ontario sicence centre and it is only this large screen format which does this film justice all the acts in J of M are wonderful if a little short, but as a 29 year old man it always brings me to tears.  I think I would recomend buying other C du S movies before buying this one, unless you are a die hard fan.  However, I would also recomend not buying any and saving your money to go and see a live performance!  Nothing can top the thrill of seeing a man flying around a theatre on red silken wings. go to [...] where you can view excerpts from some of their shows.
B00000I07P|5.0|This is one of Bon Jovi's best CDs and I would recomend it to any fans of rock! It has an edge to it but it isnt hard rock. There are some catchy songs on here that would be great for parties or jamming on long road trips!! A must have!
B000002P6R|1.0|I ordered this and returned it twice in the past two months - it is not the Japanese version is the miniature album sleeve, but the same MCA version that can be found in any store, and it DOES still have the glitches and skips in It's In You. The have not been corrected.
0060082569|5.0|I wasn't quite old enough to fight in Vietnam, but after reading this book and listening to this tape, it's as though I had been there.  The book was absolutely gripping and the tape ... well ... for those of you who saw the recent movie, Joseph L. Galloway is the on-scene reporter.  His rough, unpolished voice is PERFECT for this tape.  It's Hal Moore's story recounted by the reporter who flew into battle with him.  A priceless, classic combination.  I've worn out the tape already ... time to reorder.  (Hint: Make sure you get the Galloway edition.  The CD has a slick Hollywood-type doing the narration.  It's not the same.)
6302752337|3.0|I did not love this movie to death but did not dislike it intently either.  Sort of middle of the road.  I actually like Jack Nicolson's character.  Easily the least sleazy between him, Fonda, and Hopper ...<br />Truthfully the story line is quite annoying. The ... haze isn't really my style but I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Liked the scenery of the guys riding through America.  The film sets a mood for the 60's biker ... culture and I can relate to what its trying to say.<br />People who grew up in the sixties or who can related to the ... counterculture will like this film.  Nonetheless, I cannot agree that Easy Rider is the universal all time classic that it is reverred as by all these film societies.
0385501005|4.0|I found this to be a nice light read. Similar to the other Bristish comic fiction but this time it is from a man's point of view. I loved the different side of the story for a change. We always read about women trying to find love, well this book tells us why walking down the isle is so hard.
B000001E8P|5.0|Feeling down?  Listen to song 1 with your stereo turned up all the way.  Even if you feel so happy, the same song fits.  The entire CD is a fun, yet well versed album.  Pulp is creative thinking music and at the same time let-go-have-fun music.
630522577X|4.0|My Fair Lady stands as one of the great musicals of the post-MGM era, largely on the strength of the original play and it's cast. And it has aged well. <br />This is the role for which Rex Harrison will always be remembered. And if he's a bit old for the part, we are still lucky to be able to see the brilliance or his \\"original\\" Henry Higgins. He's obnoxious, prejudiced, and insufferably full of himself and the importance of the English language. Yet, he is touched and changed by Eliza. Stanley Hollaway also reprises his role of Alfred Doolittle with the deft touch of the music hall veteran that he was.<br />Audrey Hepburn, the Julia Roberts of her day, is radiant, vulnerable, and finally regal as Eliza. It is one of her best performances, and a wonderful use of her talents as an actress, dancer, and star. The only drawback to using her is that she is primarily a dancer rather than a singer - and Eliza is a singer's role. A problem that was famously (infamously?) solved by dubbing much of her singing. I disagree with those who find the dubbing obvious - all movie musicals are dubbed. The only difference is that most actors lip-synch to their own voice rather than someone else's. (If you want to be picky - Barbra Streisand has a much greater problem with syncing to a pre-recorded track in \\"Funny Girl\\" that Hepburn does here.) <br />As for the issue of Julie vs. Audrey - I think we are all lucky to have had the enjoyment of seeing (or hearing) both actresses play the role. I really wouldn't want to be without either. Just as different actors bring their own qualities and point of view to new interpretations of \\"Hamlet\\" - Eliza is a part that demands the best of a performer.<br />The team behind the camera makes great contributions. Harry Stradling Sr.'s cinematography is great mainstream sixties camera work. What it lacks in invention it makes up for in the beauty of the lighting and compositions. Cecil Beaton reprises his Broadway role of costume and production designer (along with Gene Allan). He designed for the previous Lerner and Lowe film \\"Gigi\\", and he set a new standard in this film - particularly with the costumes. As a matter of fact, George Cukor pretty much gives him the Ascott scene as a costume set piece. (Hepburn's dress alone is a testament to how costume builders can take a few squiggly lines from a designer and turn them into a real work of art in fabric and feathers.)<br />It seems, however, that director George Cukor clearly does not have much of a hand for musicals - he films the action very conservatively and with few cuts and camera movements. He treats the legendary Broadway show pretty much as if he was filming Shaw's play. This gives the film a stiffness and stodginess that sometimes makes you wonder why all this is taking so long. Contrast this work with Robert Wise's \\"Sound of Music\\" which opened a year later. \\"Lady\\" is clearly the stronger source material, yet \\"Music\\" floats on the energy of its score and Ernest Lehman's script.<br />But while Cukor's vision does not add much to the property, he gets out of the way and lets his actors and production team put on a first class rendition of the show.<br />My Fair Lady is still a wonderful evening's entertainment. The cast, the score, the story, the design are all first rate. If it lacks a little in imagination and pace, well that's a small price to pay for a piece of theatrical legend.

B00005MP58|5.0|10 Stars!!!!  Words cannot express how much I absolutely love this movie.  Every time I watch PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, first wearing out my video cassette that I copied from A & E back in 1996 and now with this DVD, I am so swept away by the story, the acting, the costumes, scenery; everything!  This movie is PERFECTION!  It is so true to the book that whenever I watch this film, I will watch my favorite parts, over and over and over!  I do the same thing when I read the book!  And having a DVD makes it so much easier.  I can watch the chance meeting between Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley and, their glance across the room also at Pemberley 10 times in a row!  Whenever I watch this movie I am depressed when it is over (like the book).  <BR>My only criticism of the DVD is the color on the first disc.  Everything is so faded--it's almost like watching it in black and white.  How did it pass quality control?  The second disc is much better.  <BR>P.S.  I am now in love with Colin Firth!
B00000J7S8|5.0|This was my first Diana CD and jazz album, for that matter. It's still my favorite one. One can see the work that has been put into it. <BR> All tracks are beautiful, but the ones I like the most are: 'Let's face the music and dance', 'Devil may care', 'Do it again', and the bonus track, 'Why should I care'. Also, you wouldn't want to miss Diana's rendition of 'I've got you under my skin'. If you buy this CD (which you should, asap), she'll take over your stereo and never let go!

B00004TH83|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I bought Lara Fabian's english debut album. I only knew 'Love by Grace', the mega success in Brazil and Portugal. You can only guess my joy when I started playing the CD and 'Adagio' began. Love, passion, sweetness... all of these things and more pour out from Lara's voice, making you feel alive and happy. Happy that you have this CD. Happy that you found a singer whose biggest assets are not her beautiful face (beautiful indeed), her charming manner (charming indeed) but her song. Crystal clear, filled with emotions, and loving. Simply loving!
B00005JKDR|5.0|MONSTERS, INC. (G) DISNEY/PIXAR<BR>Voices of: BILLY CRYSTAL, JOHN GOODMAN, STEVE BUSCEMI,<BR>JENNIFER TILLY (& MORE).<BR>***1/2 - FILM<BR>***** - DVD<br />I just bought the DVD, watched it and can't help but sell-all-out on just how well done the film is and just how special the DVD edition was. I had heard mixed reviews from everybody; People who's taste I trust, people who hate movies like this one, and others who can't decide whether they enjoyed it or not; when the movie first came out in theaters.<br />My opinion:<BR>I liked everything about both TOY STORY films, didn't care much for A BUG'S LIFE's story/plot though I still enjoyed the genre of completely computer composed cinema, but as for MONSTERS, INC., I am completely sold on Disney's wizards at PIXAR and permanently at that...they are the one's responsible for everyone else's computer/CGI movie-toons $ucce$$. <BR>SHREK & ICE AGE <--- (which I've yet to see) are feeding off PIXAR's unique style & it's popularity due to critics and audience approval at the box office.<BR>All of them are great to watch and especially interesting to see how they are put together. The time consumation involved is more than most mere mortals dare to bare. The perfection of this new art doesn't seem effortless - in the way that anyone with the CA$H could accomplish. The stories, characters, and overall production is always the foundation but, the quality of it's originality, awe-inspiring jaw dropping finesse & flow keeps all who still have \\"the child inside\\" begging for more. Even if it isn't Disney/PIXAR branded, the similair styled films companies know they have a mint and will continue to keep on trying to one-up the other. <BR>Now, if you are a fan of the STAR WARS - Episode 1 DVD's features and mind boggling behind the scenes info & eye candies, MONSTERS, INC. will fill in that void/absense & fanboy NEED until STAR WARS - Episode 2 & SPIDER-MAN come out in November. <BR>Sit back, watch the flick, set your opinions aside until the final scene is through...you'll realize & see the same thing I did. If you don't, you fall into the category of people who hate movies like this one and will be short-changed in the long run.<BR>Watch and enjoy just how SCARY it is to feel like a kid again, seeing something new and original for the very first time redone, redone, & redone again until this film genre is narrowed down to perfection.

B00003CXI0|2.0|When I went to the Movie theater on the first day of opening I was expecting to have just the amazing-est 2hours and a half of my life. Instead, I stood up few times, got myself coke and hotdogs, (which are expensive) and impatient that nothing in ME moved. When I came home, I re-read the book, and discovered what was lacking-- the display of emotions and humor that packs the pages in the book. Like when Harry invisions himself as the game-keeper assistance after being expelled from Hogwarts. Like when Hermione flings herself to Harry, and says \\"You're a great wizard.\\" Not to mention all the songs and funny verses that was in the book. I believe if they did an arousing \\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy, warty, Hogwarts\\" Like in the book, with a charming tune to it, it would have been so much better. No songs to remember, no place to really laugh, and no place to really cry, makes a not-so-good movie, in my opinion. Yes, the picture was great, but I value the content, not the outside.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Music has been missing so much for so long. its nice to see a young man show such promise. Adams shows signs of being in the same class as Young, Dylan, Springsteen. This album shows no sign of being pegged into a genre. Ryan tackles everything from pop to rock to country. Talented writing and soul-felt vocals shine on this CD that will not wear thin in time.
B000001C6D|4.0|If you were to look up \\"doom metal\\" in the Headbangers' Illustrated Dictionary, you might just see a picture of Icon. Slower and heavier than the masterpiece that followed it (Draconian Times), Icon is a powerful album that takes several listens before you really begin to appreciate it. But once you've digested its subtleties, you'll find yourself returning to it again and again for years to come.<br />Listening to Paradise Lost is all about letting the euphoric melancholia that only they can create take over your senses. And nowhere is this melancholia more in effect than on Icon. Just seconds into the gorgeous orchestral synth introduction to the first track, \\"Embers Fire\\", you'll sense that feeling creeping over you - you're pleasantly depressed. Don't worry, you'll snap out of it in, oh, about 50 minutes. Your only job is to enjoy it while it lasts.<br />The songs flow seamlessly one into the next with the highlights being \\"Embers Fire\\", \\"Dying Freedom\\", \\"Widow\\", \\"Poison\\", and \\"True Belief\\". \\"Christendom\\" incorporates female vocals to fine effect. As in most middle-era Paradise Lost, there are some great melodic guitar solos on Icon. By album's end, you're drained but ready to resume normal life again. <br />If you are into Paradise Lost at all, you need to have this album. If you are new to Paradise Lost and curious to try them out, I recommend you start out with the more accessible classics, Draconian Times and One Second, then work your way back to Icon. Icon is an album for true Paradise Lost aficionados.
6303430570|5.0|When I first watched this movie, I didn't expect much. But after the first viewing I must say that it is one of the best films of the 90's. Why? Because it started such a cult following like no other. Very similar to the Star Wars or Star Trek phenomena. In fact with so many references to Star Wars in Kevin Smith films (Jay/C-3P0 Silent bob/R2-D2) its no wonder it has become almost as popular.<br />I enjoy this film because it is subtle but very true. Kevin Smith has a knack for writing films that hit close to home and are down to earth. None of his movies are completely far fetched (Strike Back and Dogma were a little far fetched, but none the less very good movies with Dogma being the better film) Mallrats which is the worst of them all is not nearly as comical or true as Clerks. I've seen the alternate ending and it is pretty shocking. I'm glad Smith took it out. It was not needed and would have ruined the whole series of films.
B00003CX8T|5.0|Disney's Aladdin is excellent! The DVD release is scheduled for October 2004, the same year the IMAX (big screen) version will be released to IMAX theatres worldwide.<br />The musical adventure of a plain simple street rat falling in love with the princess, takes off into a battle with the greedy advisor to the sultan. Timeless songs, great characters and feel good romance.<br />You'd also want to catch Aladdin Live at Disney's California Adventures Theme Park - the musical version of the film featuring special effects and more!
B00006HBUB|5.0|I think that the Scooby Doo movie is fantastic. When I went to the theatre to see it I figured that it wouldn't be very good. But I loved Scooby Doo so much that I wanted to see it. I was very surprised at what a *WONDERFUL* film it is. I plan on buying the Full Screen DVD edition as soon as it comes out. I plan on buying the DVD the week that it comes out. <br />There are some parts in the film that might be scary for kids under five years old. I would recomend this movie for people six years old and older. <br />I loved the movie so much that the day I went to the theatre to see it, I had to buy the CD. I have listened to the CD over and over. The best songs on the CD (in my opinion) are #7 \\"Bump In The Night\\" and #11 \\"Man With The Hex.\\" Once you see the movie you will want the CD.<br />If you love Scooby Doo, and you haven't seen this movie I suggest renting/buying it the day it comes out. You won't be disapointed if you do.

B00004Z4WR|2.0|THE STORY: Kip Ranes has become what his brother Memphis (Cage) was: a car thief. As he messes up a boost he is caputerd by his employee Calitri. If he doesn't steal 50 cars in 72 hours for him, he has to die. So Kip has to get help from brother Memphis to do the impossible task that will save his life.<br />THE CAST: Academy Award Winners Nicolas, Cage, Robert DuVall and Angelina Jolie are joined by a supporting cast including Giovanni Ribisi, Timothy Olyphant, Will Patton and Delroy Lindo. These names make a lot of moviegoers happy.  But unfortunately they all waste their talent, trying to give dimension to their cardboard characters and almost all of them fail. Except for Delroy Lindo whose Detective Kasselbeck is the most likable characters off them all, even though he is pursuing our \\"hero\\" Nicolas Cage. Somehow I wanted him to get Memphis and that sure as hell wasn't the intention. But Cages character is so flat that he can wave his hands around all he wants, he is just not really likeable and the love to his brother is unconvincing and unemotional so I didn't really cared for those two. Angelina Jolie does what he needs to do: Trying to look sexy and tough with stupid hairdo. But she's only trying. <br />THE SCRIPT: The script by Scott \\"Con Air\\" Rosenberg seems to me like it was written in a short time under a lot of pressure. I can't come up with another reason which justifies this script without insulting him. One of the major problems, and there are many of them, is that the \\"funny\\" lines are anything but funny and the way the black people are portrayed is really clichéd and annoying. Also the script does a big build up, so that you anticipate a great showdown but it never really comes...<br />DIRECTING: Dominic Sena does have an eye for beautiful lighting and that's about everything I think is worth mentioning here. The (few) action sequences are extremly bad edited and slow paced that you feel more like a spectator than a driver. The beautiful cars areshown too short and the transition between scenes often disrupts the rythm of the film and literally activates the breaks. Even the final car chase, which I was waiting for the whole boring 90 minutes is a major dissapointment because it lacks the most important thing: Speed... The climactic jump of Cages (CGI)Car is nothing more than laughable and unrealistic (which in this case, other than in a James Bond-type movie, hurts)<br />THE DVD: Sound and picture quality are top notch and the extra features rather interesting. It shows how many efforts were made, which made me feel sad because the end result could have been much more<br />ALL IN ALL: A slow moving, unfunny, unsuspensful film in my opinion where great actors have wasted their time and collected their money...
B000000WJ2|5.0|This is another class act by Keith Richards. He shows us once more after Talk Is Cheap that he is what keeps the Stones Rolling. He has a terrific flow of lyrics in each song. Keith shines on vocals, guitar, and lyrics. 999 is probley the most hard-rockin' Rolling Stones or solo Stones song ever. Great guitar weaving in that song. Wicked as it Seems has a great open G tunned riff. Hate it When you Leave is even more heartfelt than his Talk Is Cheap song -Locked Away. The album ends with a suprisingly soulful song called Demon. Great acoustics, great soft voice, beautiful lyrics. The only problems I have with Main Offender is the following. Steve Jordan, the drummer. Yea, he's a capable enough drummer I guess, and Keith gives him credits on several songs. But his beats are too repetitive. No slight alterations here or there. The same could be said for Talk is Cheap too. Charlie Watts would have been great on both albums, but I think Keith wanted to make an album w/o any Stones so he could have full credit, so people would know who's driving the Stones. But after his first project away from the Stones, Keith should have invited Charlie to the Main Offender sessions. Steve is a lazy drummer, Charlie is energetic and would have brought new life to the album. This album could have been better also if the drummers were down a bit in the mix. But since this is a great album, the drumming isn't too bad of a problem
B00006FXB6|5.0|Check out my other reviews...I don't throw five stars around like dirt. This is the best hard rock album since Soundgarden's \\"Superunkown\\". It's hard enough for metalheads to dig and complex enough for those who grew up on Zeppelin. In fact, Zeppelin is the best analogy I can come up with. Not so much because it sounds like Zeppelin but because of the diversity of styles and the willingness to take chances. \\"Song for the Dead\\" is a prime example. It starts off with a stunning drum intro from Dave Grohl, then kicks into a driving, almost metal guitar section, before kicking into a sludgy main section that would make Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler proud. Then there's a kickass middle section with a killer guitar solo. It all ends with a stop/start trash outro. Brilliant. <br />Interestingly, the most accessible songs (\\"Go With The Flow\\", \\"Gonna Leave You\\", \\"Do It Again\\", \\"Another Love Song\\") come on the second half of the CD. \\"No One Knows\\", the first single, has a herky-jerky tempo not unlike \\"Leg Of Lamb\\" from their previous CD, \\"Rated R\\". \\"Do It Again\\" recycles the main riff and \\"Hey!\\" shouts from Gary Glitter's \\"Rock And Roll Part 2\\" to glorious effect. <br />Of course it wouldn't be a QOTSA CD without a few shout-alongs from bassist Nick Oliveri and \\"Songs for the Deaf\\" delivers with the opening \\"...Millionaire\\" and the strange and short \\"Six Shooter. To my ears it also sounds like Nick actually *sings* \\"Gonna Leave You\\". If so, he does a nice job. Of course the songs that Mark Lanegan (from Screaming Trees) sings possess an unotherwordly sadness.<br />One more thing. This is a great headphone CD.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I say 'almost' simply because it is seriously lacking in the \\"babe\\" department.  Part of the fun of vampire movies for me has been the variety of either scantily clad vampiresses or the well-endowed and usually scantily clad victims.  This movie had only one female character who, although not bad at all to look at, was totally unused for any sex appeal.<br />That having been said, in every other respect this movie is totally awesome!  Extreme action, state-of-the-art special effects, twists, surprises, humor, super vampires, blood, martial arts, swordplay, cool costumes . . . this movie's got it all!<br />Stop reading this review and buy it!
B000069HKH|3.0|I had hear the song from Bruce Springsten in an english lesson.I think it´s a great song ,because when i heard it at first time i didn´t know that it is a sad song, and i didn´t thought that after hearing ,because this song has a happy melody. Many musicers wrote songs after this day ,many sad songs ,but this song makes myself feel that all will be good in future and that one day all people be happy again.This is my homework and i hope it will be like by you.

0792841344|4.0|This film has a bunch of Jawa rip-offs running around and killing people! That is reason enough to see it! It's weird, these Jawa rips made me laugh and scared me at the same time. A great psychological horror film, but sometimes in this movie, the main characters make the stupidest mistakes. Like the boy going out in the dark to the house were \\"the pahntasm\\" lives and breaks in, for no apparent reason. Short cuts in the plot are a draw back as well. This film isn't for everybody, unless you like thinking movies. It's kind of a cross between Salem's Lot and Jacob's Ladder. See it! It's 50% Laughs and 50% Scares! Amazing!
B00003CXI1|5.0|Very original but I thought it lacked a little in plot and it is a little slow in parts. It is a lenghty movie, at least it seemed like it to me. Nevertheless, I did enjoy it and would watch it again. It is the story of a boy who finds out he is a wizard and gets to attend a special school to hone his skills. He and his friends at school get into an adventure. It is super entertainment for pre-teens and young teens. The effects are good, casting is awesome. I think the creators should be proud. We need more safe quality entertainment available for kids. I do look forwards to more Harry movies. Worth seeing for sure. If you keep in mind that it is geared more for a younger audience, you will not be dissapointed.
B00003CXAT|4.0|Spielberg has always excelled at directing thrillers. While Jurassic Park is far from his best film, it's an entertaining thrill ride for older kids and adults. Others have given a pretty good synopsis of the plot, so I'm going to focus on the technical side and strengths/weaknesses of the film.<br />The visuals are still stunning nearly a decade later. The transfer is first rate with stunning clarity and no analog artifacts that I can see. The dual layer disc is one of the few where the transition between layer 1 and 2 is handled well (some go into still mode during the transition as the least opportune times). Audio mix is quite good as well and managed to give my system a work out.<br />The extras include a very good documentary: test footage using stop motion Go Motion; storyboards from the various effects sequences; trailers for all three movies (although only the teaser trailer is included for the 3rd film. Understandable given the fact that it was still in postproduction at the time the DVD was first issued); an early pre-production meeting that gives us a peak into the creative process and a short documentary on how the foley artists created the sound effects.<br />The film isn't without its flaws. Crichton's original novel was filled with a lot of assumptions and scientific blunders (using frog DNA to fill the gaps? Why when birds are the closest living relatives? The lysine contingency, i.e., the fact that the creatures are dependent on outside food sources for lysine and will die without it is goofy. We're all (including humans) dependent on our food sources for lysine). There's a mighty leap of faith when it comes to extracting the DNA from insects. Who knows what you'll get? Still, like most science fiction the story is a valed morality play so I suppose we can forgive the scientific implausability of the film (read The Science of Jurassic Park if you're interested in any of this).<br />The most important fact to keep in mind is that Spielberg designed (like Crichton)Jurassic Park as an entertainment with a moral. Keeping those flaws in mind, it's an entertaining and at times awe inspiring film. Hitchcock used to alternate his serious work (Vertigo) with his popcorn work (North By Northwest). Spielberg has taken a very similar approach to his career since the early 80's. Although not as powerful or emotionally involving as Schindler's List, it's a lot more entertaining on a superfical level.(like Crichton)Jurassic Park as an entertainment with a moral.

0800177177|5.0|Usually I wouldn't say that a movie is better then the book but in this case I will make the acception. The movie is by far more entertaining with a more exciting ending. Wonderful casting with the very talented Gary Oldham as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as  Van Helsing. I was even able to forgive Keanu Revees lack of talent. He was an \\"okay\\" Johnathan Harker. The effects are wonderful too, they make it a great scary movie. You not only see but feel just how eerie Dracula and his castle are. You get a feel of how mysteriously evil he is but  at the same time there is a bittersweet past that made him what he is. Unlike the book, he has trouble with human emotions instead of just being an almost invisible monster. One of my favorites. Very enjoyable to watch especially in the fall time.
6305609705|5.0|Having read many of the negative reviews of the `Redux' version, I purchased the `original' and have no regrets.  Seeing this movie in DVD format on a large screen so surpassed my original (and multiple) VHS viewings it was like seeing the movie for the first time.  The colors and sound jump out at you and all the dialogue is now crystal clear.  I have always loved this movie and the DVD version makes it an even more valuable part of my collection.<br />Sheen is excellent, a refreshing throwback from his more recently questionable roles (and questionable politics).  This is perhaps his best performance ever, with the possible exception of \\"Badlands\\".  Brando's role is short but incredibly effective, and of course everyone loves Robert Duvall (with his now infamous \\"Napalm\\" line).<br />This all being said, the movie is not for everyone.  It has (for better or worse) become more or less a cult movie for baby-boomers and X'ers alike.  One can argue whether the underlying deep message of `Apocalypse' (if there indeed is one) justifies it's somewhat pretentious and `artsy' nature - either way,  some will be repulsed by the violent yet surreal aura that carries the viewer on his hellish yet thought-provoking journey.  One thing is for sure - this is not a movie \\"about\\" Vietnam.<br />\\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a film one does not forget quickly.
B00005O5JV|5.0|an awesome movie! a must see!
B00006BTCA|5.0|An excellent piece of work. It's rare to find a CD where every song is great. Interpol reminds me of everything from Joy Division to Bauhaus to Echo and the Bunnymen but still maintain a unique style and sound all their own. It's easy to get lost in all the songs as they get better and better the more you listen to them. Very cool experience.
0345448898|5.0|I loved these books!  I've never written an online review before, but I felt like I had to throw my 2 cents in.  First of all, what I think makes these books great is that they are completely original.  Most good fantasy is written with heavy influence from other authors, Tolkien in particular.  Pullman has created something that stands alone and shouldn't have to be compared to anything else.  This is not classic fantasy.  It's also not typical young-adult fiction.  To address some of the other reviews:  no, it's not funny like Harry Potter, and no, it's not religion-friendly like CS Lewis.  Is that a bad thing?  I don't think so.  If you're very religious and easily offended, expect to be offended.  I personally don't think the average under-13-year-old should read these, either.  However, if what you want is an involving and heartfelt story that makes you feel and think and dream, then I've never read anything better.  Also recommend:  Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, Lloyd Alexander, Harry Potter.
078324228X|5.0|Every once and a while a film comes out that moves you on a deeply emotional and personal level. If you are fortunate, the cinematic experience stays with you beyond the drive home after the credits have roled. \\"The Hurricane\\" is one of these rare films that manages to inspire, and affect the viewer in a manner far too films fail to do. The cut I saw of Hurricane was missing the final credits and the colour had yet to be corrected, but the film was and is a masterpiece of storytelling by the acclaimed Norman Jewison. Like many of his films there is a deeply personal story to be told that has far reaching moral, political and social implications. \\"Hurricane\\" is the story of Rueben \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, a boxer wrongly imprissoned for a crime he didn't committ. The story unfolds from two perspectives, Rueben's and from the perspective a boy named Lazarus, who in Carter, finds a hero in need of salvation. Denzel Washington is memorizing in his role as Hurricane, while the rest of the cast have risen to the occasion. Jewison has made perhaps his best film in decades and maybe his best ever. His committment to telling \\"a good story\\" (quoting last year's inspiring Oscar speech) is obvious, as his is committment to social consciousness. He uses the camera as a witness to brutality, history and to one man's salvation and redemption as he explores the life and circumstances that brought Carter and Lazarus together. Like movies such as \\"Chariots of Fire\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"Amistad\\", this film manages to involve the viewer on a highly personal level. We see Carter as a human being in circumstances that test him beyond reason. The scene where he tells his wife to leave him because he can't survive prison knowing she is waiting for him on the outside is powerful and moving. This film is worthy of Oscars in every way. As it stands, this film is a credit to the real Hurricane Carter and the journey he took, and to Lazarus who becomes the catalyst in bringing Carter tosalvation. With a running time of almost two and a half hours, I suspect it will be a bit shorter when released, but hopefully Jewison and co. will leave most of it as is. Don't let them make you change a thing Norman - you've got a real story here and a fabulous tribute to the power of the human spirit (from two perspectives no less!) Let the power of the story
0805053883|2.0|This book lacks the magic that Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you See? has -- the text is forced into the same structure, but it doesn't work, so it's definitely a book we use for the pictures (which are charming) rather than the narrative, which has no lilt and is rather stunted.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I can't agree with the reviewers who say this film has no plot but relies completely on special effects.  Yes, the special effects in this movie are mind-blowing at times (in one scene, he looks up into the night sky to see the moon falling apart, and the time-travel sequences are amazing...and we finally get some Morlocks who will genuinely scare you), but there are other things that make this a great movie.  For one thing, the plot is great, and giving the traveler a reason for his travels strengthens the one thing that was weak in the original story.  The movie is a little short though compared to what it should have been, and the ending seems to come just a little fast - but it's otherwise a great film.  The soundtrack is beautiful, and it's best appreciated in surround sound.  All in all, I really enjoyed the entire movie and didn't feel at all cheated by the price I paid for it.  To me, one of the most impressive scenes comes at the end, where we see Alexander's past and present onscreen at the same time with something so simple as a walk through the jungle.  Ignore the bad reviews and check this one out for yourself.
B00005QDW1|2.0|No Doubt turned very few heads when the band first got together and recorded their debut album.  The album flopped miserably and No Doubt could barely even get a handful of people to go to their shows.  With failure over looking their attempts, they re-grouped and hit the studio to record Tragic Kingdom. After 4 successful singles (&quot;Dont Speak&quot;, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; &amp; &quot;Excuse me Mister&quot;) the album went on to sell over 12 million units and become one of the 90's best albums. With new found success under their belts, they took over award shows, sold out arenas nation-wide &amp; were featured on the cover of every single magazine in the nation. After taking way to much time off, the group returned with their best album -=Return to Saturn=-. However it was slept on and barely pushed 1.3 million units. Now after only 2 short years they are back again, but this album is a disappointment from them.<br />With 3 mediocre, run of the mill pop rock anthems playing on the radio all the time, you would expect the album to sell well, but its not. &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Underneath it All&quot; &amp; &quot;Hey Baby&quot; are not good songs, but with the slickness needed for radio airplay, there were the best choices. The album lacks any really good material, besides &quot;Dont Let Me Down&quot; &amp; &quot;Waiting Room&quot;, the discs only standout material. The reggae influences on the album are not as strong as the group made them out to be, because besides appearences from dancehall performers like Bounty Killer &amp; Lady Saw there really isn't any mixing of the genres.<br />And what is up with all the video game noises? When listening to tracks like &quot;Running&quot; &amp; &quot;Rock Steady&quot; I feel like I'm stuck in a giant game of Tetris, which isn't a good thing. The album though is over flowing with terrible tracks: &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;, &quot;In My Head&quot; &amp; &quot;Rock Steady&quot; are prime examples. This material is not up to the calliber that this band is very capable of doing.<br />I understand that following up an album like -=Return to Saturn=-is near impossible, but I was expecting something a little better then this. No Doubt is easily my favorite band, but this album does little to nothing to reflect their talents and is just a complete waste of music store space. Gwen and the boys need to bring us at least one more great album before they leave this industry, because us fans deserve it and after listening to this garbage, it better be a five star effort. Better luck next time because this just doesn't cut it.me examples.

B0000025T6|5.0|Ever since i bought this album, i have never kept it far from my stereo.  At the time i got this album, i was into Social Distortion &quot;Somewhere between Heaven and Hell&quot;, The Clash &quot;London Calling&quot;, Afghan Whigs &quot;Gentlemen&quot;, and even The Replacements &quot;Tim&quot; and &quot;Let it be&quot;...well, go look up how those albums are revered...and i will tell you, this one is the one that has outlasted them all...it's so original...it sounds like Bruce is in an empty room at night in a chair singing (whispering at times) into a tape recorder...it's spooky...the stories are told with a spirit and Americana that has Springsteen trying to nip at Faulkner's heels...honestly, once you have heard this album and truly heard it, you will never feel the same again...there is definitely some ghost towns on this album and you can't help but feel the desperation and soul and heart Bruce displays here...never again can such a folk album be made, with such blue-collar stories that have a political stance deep down...Dylan was always reaching for the higher mind with even his folk stuff...but Bruce, well, Bruce keeps it simple, and sometimes, that's just how you wanna keep it...
B000066C87|5.0|I'm generally not crazy about movies by Robert Altman. The ad-libbing just seems to get too out of hand. Granted, I loved the opening long shot of \\"The Player,\\" but I was all ready to love \\"Pret a Porter\\" and it just didn't seem to work. In \\"Gosford Park\\" I think he has _had_ to keep things under control or, as a complex murder mystery, the plot wouldn't work. I think the historical accuracy of the clothes, the props, the house, is all amazing (This film could never have been done in the US). I think there are a couple annoyances about the plot however: How does the protagonist (the young ladies' maid) figure out who (she thinks) done it (the scene after her pal says \\"Carpe Diem)? Plus, a plot point that hinges on an American actor playing an American actor doing a bad Scottish accent - Very tricky. There are too many American actors doing full-on bad UK accents, that this is too much to ask of an audience. But overall, as a fan of who-done-its and period films, and a huge fan of TONS of the actors in this movie - Maggie Smith, Stephen Fry, etc etc! - I give it a big YES!
B000003BF1|5.0|This is the best record by the world's first hard rock band. The Stones invented hard rock and heavy metal. If the Stones had not come first, you would not have had Zeppelin, Sabbath, Purple, Grand Funk, Aerosmith, and on and on. This band's bluesy, sloppy power lighted the hard rock match. The Who were influenced by them. The Kinks and Yardbirds were influenced by them. Then after they started hard rock, they continued to stay at the top of the genre. This album is classic. When you listen to it, it takes you back to 1969. It makes you remember what you love about classic hard rock. It also makes you sad to see your favorite bands getting old. Long live The Rolling Stones.
B000002KB8|5.0|The title track alone hints that this album would give birth to an entirely new music form that bands like Zeppelin and Blue Cheer only hinted at. Here we're introduced to Ozzy's sinister wail, Tony Iommi's crunching guitar sound, Geezer Butler's pounding bass, and Bill Ward's unique drumming style. There is a lot of homage to Cream on this record on songs such as NIB and Wicked World, and the use of medleys in their music, but they create thier own darker style of jamming. An amazing album, especially since they recorded it in just 12 hours.
B000006045|2.0|Usually I agree with the majority of reviews and I'll go out of my way to help a product get a four-star average, however I do not agree with the the hype on this particular album. It's far from a masterpeice. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band? Yes, a masterpeice. Dark Side of the Moon? Yes. Houses of the Holy? Most definetly (I've listened to so much music in my lifetime that I could name one from each genre, so I'm not classic-rock biased---I wouldn't write if I were). Mezzanine? Sorry, not quite. I certainly agree that some of the sounds that Massive Attack incorporated into their work are intriguing and original, and Teardrop in particular is a very soothing song---however, my nephew's Bedtime Music for Kids CD is also soothing, but it's not a masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's total sludge, in fact I've heard much worse. Unfortunately, however, I bought the CD on the basis of what other reviews have said about it, and from the gushing remarks, I was expecting God to come wafting out of my speakers. Judging by the lonely way my copy of Mezzanine is floating among friends in an attempt to find a home, that didn't happen, and this will probably be the last time I'll be so adventurous when buying music. To each their own.<br />On a side note, I do enthusiastically reccommend Dirty Vegas' new CD, if you still want something new.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The first time i listened to it I automatically loved it. Its now one of my favorite cd's and they are now my favorite band. I hope everyone buys this CD
B000003TAW|5.0|How YOU doin? This is an awesome cd, and if you haven't figured it out already, buy the cd! There isn't any bad songs on the cd! Buddy holly is obviously awesome, say it aint so, in the garage, only in dreams, and my name is jonus are probably my favorites. Buy the cd, mmkay?
0689835604|5.0|This was my daughter's favorite book for 3 months! (Now she's 6 months and it's her second favorite book after \\"Ten Little Ladybugs\\") Reading this book to her is like playing her favorite game of peekaboo. Her little body trembles with anticipation waiting for each flap to be lifted, and when I lift the flap, she lets out a piercing squeal of delight! Even if there were no flaps, the drawings are a hit - so I've just ordered \\"Counting Kisses\\", as well.
B0000524E5|4.0|Ok I really like this movie I mean the story line was awesome. I watched it so many times at a friends house then borrowed it to take home. My mom watched it and hated it. She did not like the way the girls danced.... i dunno I thought it was great....
0743464117|5.0|Gripping book. Can't wait for the November release of the HBO mini-series on DVD. But sadly, if it's anything like most television stuff, it will be missing the boat in some way. Read the book folks. I couldn't put it down. Seriously. I simply could not put it down. Cheers.
B000068IEU|1.0|I wanted this movie a long while, before actually purchasing it.  And I purchased it not knowing anything, except what the cover depicted.  When I put it in, I realized it was a little older (30 years), but gave it a chance anyway.  At the end of the movie my son (after having kept his ears and eyes covered for a good portion of the movie) asked why it said it was scary on the cover.  After taking it out of the DVD player, I actually looked at the disk to make sure this was what I had paid for and had received such rave reviews.  I'm afraid the only people that could give this movie more than two stars would be deranged.
B000002IAZ|5.0|I enjoyed this alblum alot. There are three tunes, For what it's worth, Rock and roll woman, and Bluebird that are as good as any tunes CSN ever did. I enjoyed the other Neil Young songs on the alblum but did not really care for the softer songs from the other singers. This group was loaded with talent and this makes it a must have alblum for any 60's music fan.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This album has most (not all)of ELV1S number 1 hits from US and UK, and includes A Little Less Conversation as a bonus track. While it is not possible to capture every aspect of ELV1S immense talent on a single cd, and no cd can have all of everyone's favourite songs on it, this album does give an excellent view of the genius of the greatest recording artist of all time. <br />Whether you like rock'n'roll, country, ballads, blues or any variation in between, ELV1S did it, and did it well. From Heartbreak Hotel and Hound Dog, through Jailhouse Rock, Hard Headed Woman, Burning Love and finally Way Down we have ELV1S rocking like no one else could.<BR> <BR>Ballads like Love Me Tender and Are You Lonesome Tonight show a different more gentle side to ELV1S. Crying In The Chapel and In The Ghetto show the feeling and passion the the K1NG can put into a song. And then there's It's Now or Never, ELV1S best selling song (over 50,000,000 copies sold worldwide  between singles and compilation albums). <br />All of these songs are timeless as can be seen from the reaction to the chart-topping soundtrack from Disney animated movie Lilo and Stitch which has 5 of these songs in it. <br />Apart from the excellent selection of songs on this cd (ultimately this selection was chosen by those millions of people who bought the singles) there is a huge bonus in the improved quality of the sound. All these songs have been remastered from origonal tapes and they sound as fresh as if they had just been recorded yesterday. So if you already have ELV1S compilation cd's just compare the sound. You will be pleased. <br />If you are an ELV1S you must buy this cd. If you are not a fan, listen to this cd. If you have any appreciation for good music you will love it.
0316666343|5.0|Reading this brief, intense, and mesmerizing novel is an almost extra-literary experience. The startling mix of gentle tone and gruesome tale grips from the first lines -- and before long I felt as if I were dreaming the story rather then reading it. I found it difficult to concentrate on anything else while not reading, and finally had to put everything on hold just to finish the damn thing (and yes, dreamed vividly of being in the story while still in the midst of reading it.)<br />The Lovely Bones is a tough book to describe -- it feels kind of like the greatest Young Adult novel ever written. Mixing girl's coming of age, suspense, and romance elements with a clear eyed portrait of overwhelming grief, peopled with vividly realized, familiar-yet-mysterious characters, its as pure a page turner as anything Stephen King ever penned, yet from page one evokes a visceral emotional response. There's a unique sense of wonder here, a hard-earned tenderness shimmering throughout.<br />As powerful as The Lovely Bones feels while you're reading it, the novel seems to shrink immediately upon completion -- in memory, the story feels a little small, the characters and conclusion in the end a bit too affirming. But this takes little away from the transporting experience of reading this peculiar and penetrating tale.
B000069HKH|4.0|We've heard this song during an english lesson.We've talked about it.About its background and its intention.I think it's a very good idea to write a song about 9/11!To show the view of a fireman was a very good choice.The Boss explained the impossible situation of the firemen who died as they wanted to rescue other people.He also wants to give hope to the familys of the victims!In my opinion he tries to encourage american people and he tries to support the american patriotism.Springsteen gives an example to \\"rise up\\", to live a normal life again and to show the terrorists that america is \\"undestroyable\\".
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is a very worthy best-picture winner, and the performances by Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are superb. Schizophrenia is a much misunderstood mental illness. It is often equated with having a &quot;split personality&quot;, but that is not really a satisfactory explanation. A better understanding can be gained from this movie, a portrait of John Nash, a brilliant mathematician and ultimate Nobel laureate in economics, and a schizophrenia suferer. Repeated viewings of this movie help one understand the details better. Those with schizophrenia can have hallucinations of people, events and other apparent reality that seem completely real to the one having them but are not. On first seeing the movie, I assumed that Nash's college roommate was a real person. The movie makes it appear that, after years of absence, that roommate comes back into Nash's life and by then has a young niece of whom he is the guardian after she was orphaned. But when Nash later begins to reason out what is real and what is only his hallucinations, he reasons that his visions of the niece at that point cannot be real, because she hasn't been growing any older over several years. Of course, that in and of itself doesn't prove she or her uncle were unreal from the beginning, just that Nash's later visions of her, after she should have grown older but didn't were hallucinations. On first seeing the movie, I assumed the roommate had been real, but Nash's later visions of him and his niece probably never were real. But a subtle clue in the movie clarified things for me on the second watching. Another of Nash's hallucinations comes in the form of his thinking he is deciphering codes vital to national security, under a boss played by Ed Harris. The way the movie leaves some confusions about this (unreal?) subplot include how Nash thinks he receives an electronic implant in his arm, to open a gate where he drops off his solutions to the codes, and one time when he rides in a car driven byHarris's character. But the gate and drop-off prove real, and how can an imaginary implant open a real gate? And how can one ride in a car driven by a hallucination? The ride really seems to take Nash somewhere, so how can it be imaginary? These things might be explained by further viewings, but can remain mysteries, at least before one takes in all the details.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I just recieved the Monsters INC DVD the other day and I was so excited to view it the 2nd time. Disney and Pixar did an excellent job with the story and the animation. This is a movie for all ages not just kids.. I'm currently a college student and still found the movie very enjoyable.  So if you want to watch a great movie that brings tons of laughs and even a few tears I highly recommend buying Monsters Inc.
0307120007|5.0|My baby went crazy for this book and her age (6 months) seems to be perfect for it. Her favourite pages are pat-the-bunny (a fuzzy bunny on the page), peek-a-boo (where Paul's face is hidden with a piece of cloth) and Judy's book (a miniature book attached to the larger book). She hyperventilates with excitement when we get to these pages, and after a few tries was able to make the right movements for Paul to play peek-a-boo and to turn the pages on Judy's book. She is not an avid roller but she will roll across a whole blanket to get to this book. The only negatives of this book is that the pages are thin and have sharp corners. She chews on the pages, so I don't know how long they'll last, and when she waves the book around I am afraid she will hit herself in the eye with its sharp corners. We solve both these problems by only reading the book together (I don't leave it around as a toy).  Other than that, it's hard to imagine a better book for a 6 month old.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Jurassic Park 3 is a fine conclusion to one of my favorite series.  Sam Neil is back as Alan Grant in this action packed adventure.  This may not have the best story, it isn't mind twising genetics but is very well done.  The visuals are jaw dropping and the acting is great.  This is bette than the lost World although not better than the original.<br />  Grade A<br />~Dan~
B0000542D2|5.0|Pop Fan - <br />As an informed student of modern popular music, I (for one) appreciated your succinct, rational analysis of why the Beatles simply don't measure up to the current standards of the music industry. However, I would like to point out one factor in their defense. You of course realize that part of the definition of a great band is not only how well their music conforms with industry standards of innocuousness and professionalism, but also how well they can be merchandised. Moving product -- both the CD's themselves and other group-branded XXXXXX -- is also the hallmark of a great b(r)and. My research has indicated that the marketers and handlers of these Beatles were responsible for a wealth of disposable lucrative consumer products that would compare favorably to the many fan magazines, posters and collectible bobble-headed dolls featuring the likenesses of the great N'Sync. Truly, from the amount of money made from them by promoters, radio payola distributors, and of course, the noble men who headed the Major Labels, I believe you could classify them as the first Boy Band. Perhaps you now begin to see the appeal. They were, as one of them says in the film itself, an early clue to the new direction.<br />(Seriously, since I now feel obligated to post an actual review: I applaud Miramax for restoring and finally releasing on DVD a film that Roger Ebert called &quot;one of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies.&quot; Although I have a feeling that watching my favorite scene, which I reference above -- the corporate teen fad marketer accosting George without realizing who he is --- is going to make me a little sad this year.)
B00006AFUR|5.0|I just saw them in concert this weekend with Incubus and they were AWESOME!  I didn't know it was Jared Leto until after the show, and they were signing autographs......the band was so nice...Jared was sweet, signed my ticket stub.<BR>The CD is great, he wrote all the songs himself and has a fantastic voice, even live!  Thanks for a great show 30STM!!
6305841861|5.0|It's hard to say \\"Evil Dead 2\\" is all that scary, but it's definitely a lot of fun.<br />While chock-full of gory zombie-violence, the main draw of \\"Evil Dead 2\\" is the hysterically over-the-top performance by Bruce Campbell. As the stalwart hero Ash, Campbell abandons the straight-faced terror of the first film and goes right for the diaphragm. His jut-jawed bravado elevates this film from standard horror-fare to true classic. It's much more tongue-in-cheek than the original, and it's more enjoyable for it.<br />The blood-and-guts quotient is lavishly high - but it's too bad that the distributor mandated cutting some of the gorier scenes to avoid an X rating (they aren't even included on the DVD).<br />As if the movie itself weren't enough, the DVD features one of the most entertaining commentary tracks on the market. All participants are affable and informative. It's like watching with a bunch of your buddies--and they just happen to be the ones who made the movie!
0783225903|4.0|In post 9/11 America and the \\"Patriot Act\\" the fantasy world of this film seems errie. I kept waiting for John Ashcroft to appear.  Surely others must see the parallels with our current detentions, disappeared people and enemy non-combatants in our war against terror.  <BR>Anyway, I thought the merging of old and new technology (typewriters for computer key boards) in Rube Goldberg type systems was brilliantly done.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Speilberg had a choice to make. He could either make \\"Harry Potter\\" or he could make \\"A.I.\\". Speilberg chose \\"A.I.\\", and he chose wrong. \\"A.I.\\" is not only long and boring but its' themes are pure plagarism from other and better made films. The film steals from \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Bicentennial Man\\", among others. In fact, if you've seen \\"Bicentennial Man\\" then you've seen a better film.<br />A.I. is sappy, sentimental, boring, slow, depressing, and full of plot holes. Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy sentimental and sappy stuff but this just simply stunk. <br />The idea that the polar ice caps have melted and have flooded coastal areas, including Manhattan, works to the contast of the films' attempt to create a sense of reality...
B000006045|5.0|The first time I heard Massive Attack, it was through Pure Moods 2 (which also gave me Delerium, another mind-blowing band).  I grooved to &quot;Teardrop&quot; for about two years, never realizing that the vocalist was the lead singer of the Cocteau Twins (another favorite group of mine).  <br />The deep voice of Tricky and Liz Fraser's breathy vocals are flawless, and there isn't a bad track on this CD.  My personal favorites are &quot;Risingson,&quot; &quot;Teardrop,&quot; and &quot;Inertia Creeps.&quot;  Other standout tracks are &quot;Exchange&quot; and &quot;Dissolved Girl.&quot;<br />If you like world-beat with a dark groove to it, then you'll love MA's newest release.
6300215954|4.0|A big highlight of most of the vacations our family has taken over the years have been to zoos.  Though the PETA people may not agree, to enjoy these zoos one has to accept that people need to catch these animals in the wild to make it work.  While breeding in the zoos does help, there still needs to be a fresh supply from the wild. <br />While the plot is fairly standard, the reason I titled this \\"one of a kind\\" refers to the type of work that is done.  This is about the people who catch animals for circuses and zoos.  It was shot forty years ago, and while the politics of the time are a bit different, the action of the movie is terrifically exciting throughout.<br />These were the days long before computer-enchanced graphics, which would have been used had the movie been done today.  No, these are real wild animals.  Since I doubt that the animals used can be trained for this type of work, I have to conclude that the footage is real, and that real wild animals that didn't want to be caught were used.  <br />So we get scenes involving giraffes, zebras, rhinos, and one or two kinds I'm not able to identify.  We also get to see genuine interraction with baby elephants, a cheetah, and even a hyena.  With all the animals, it works great both as a family film which can also be viewed at an adult level.  <br />The adult level takes a bit away from a higher rating of what is still a very fine film.  It seems that EVERYONE smokes ALL THE TIME, at least when they're not getting plastered drunk.  The occasional fighting stunts are not done well, and some of the dubbing could have been done better.  And with all the action with the animals, it really didn't need a love story, but the movie seems to think it was important to hook up the only females in the cast.  <br />But these are minor, and yes, it was a different time.  But I will close by saying that every zoo I've been to seems deadly serious about treating their animals like the treasures they are.  And it is a fact that animals in zoos generally live far longer than in the wild (and a lot safer, too).  So while I'll admit there are probably unscrupulous people in this line of work, if we are to enjoy zoos, this type of work is necessary, as are the people who do it.  <br />So relax and enjoy.
B00003CXAE|4.0|Actually, I give the movie 5-stars and the DVD 2-stars.  So actually that would average out to 3.5 stars.  Since I love the movie itself, I was generous and rounded up to 4 stars.  <br />While I am a great, great fan of Grease (I must have seen it at least 20 times during the summer of '78), I must say that the DVD release of this wonderful film is somewhat disappointing.  The fact of having Grease now on DVD is terrific, but for the length of time us fans have been waiting for it, you would have figured we would get a DVD packed with extra features, not just a watered-down interview from VH-1 and a theatrical trailer.  Like George from 2 posts ago mentioned, there could have been deleted scenes, outtakes, commentaries - all pretty standard DVD fare.  At the very least there could have been a cast bio page so we could all at least know what all our favorite Greast cast members have done since then.  With the lean-ness of this DVD, Paramount could have released both the Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of the movie on the same disc rather than 2 separate ones.  It looks like they just put together these DVDs because of fan pressure to release them and didn't put much effort into them.  Heck, I have some old Clint Eastwood westerns like Hang 'Em High and A Fistful of Dollars that have more content on them than Grease does.  And they've been out for a while and only cost me $9.99.  One other note, I don't really care for the cardboard case that the DVD comes in, rather would have preferred the plastic keeper case that most DVDs come in.<br />I guess I shouldn't get my hopes up too much for Saturday Night Fever - due out next week and also from Paramount - to be much better.  Maybe Paramount will go the way many others do and re-release it as a 2-disc set in a couple of years.  But I wouldn't hold my breath for that, judging by how long it took for the first release.  Way to go Paramount.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the most amazing piece of film I have ever been witness to. I saw this 6 times in the theater, and am very happy to own the DVD also.  You will not regret owning this classic. Amelie is a character that everyone can relate to- she is everyone's inner voice. This is a quirky thoughtful piece. I love it.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I read Lonesome Dove when it was first published in the 1980s, and considered it a wonderful book.  I thought the miniseries was extremely good, and I finally bought the DVD version, which I watched not long ago.  I don't see how it could have been better, given the restraints of film-making.<br />A week ago, I went on a beach vacation and re-read the book.  The book is significantly richer than the film, an absolute masterpiece.  It's the kind of book that, even if you hardly ever read anything, you will enjoy reading after seeing the movie made from it.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As i first saw this show my gaw dropped like 2 feet. At the very beginning they were interviewing one of the veterans. The Americans knew they were going to go to war with the Nazis. A military officer was yelling out rangers, navy, air force and paratroopers. No one knew what that was because it was a new \\"idea\\" towards fighting a war. Personally i believe that was the best fighting tool to break down the German war machine. There training they went though was intense. Especially with the company commander. <BR>When they were jumping into Normandy on June 6, 1944 the was unfathomable. I don't want to give the whole story away but this is A MUST SEE MOVIE/MINI SERIES.
B000000JO3|5.0|I have had CD since it came out in 1988 (or was it 87) and I have listened to sooo many times since I got it. I dont have the red cover I have the blue cover in which alot of my friends have tried to steal from me. This music really is something to listen to, songs like look back and laugh, in my eyes, good guys dont wear white and filler are some of amazing songs on this CD it has catchy lyrics and sounds.
B000005ALN|5.0|\\"Older\\" features a George Michael fresh out of a very public and nasty legal battle with his prior label, Sony.  You'd think that he would release an album immersed in bitterness and anger, but, fortunately, that's not the case.  We're instead treated to a remarkably mature album full of warm grooves and blue-eyed soul so elegantly produced, it's almost too pretty for this world.  The opening ballad, \\"Jesus to a Child,\\" spends nearly seven minutes grooving along as Michael mourns over the loss of his lover.  \\"You Have Been Loved\\" is a near tear-jerking track about a mother who's son is dying of AIDS, and in \\"Spinning the Wheel,\\" we find our hero seething in frustration over a cheating lover.  When he sings the lyric \\"I will not accept this as a part of my life,\\" he does so with such conviction you can't help but believe him.  Make no mistake: \\"Older\\" is a dark record, but there are bright moments.  The funked-up \\"Fastlove\\" is a tribute to the one night stand, and it makes brilliant use of the hook from Patrice Rushen's \\"Forget Me Not.\\"  \\"Older\\" wasn't a bust on the charts, but it didn't do as well as the mammothly huge \\"Faith.\\"  If you want to witness how well George Michael has evolved from his hunky dory days in Wham!, you needn't look any further than this fine disc.
B000069AUI|5.0|I'm not sure what Radiohead people are listening to when they compare Coldplay's sound to them, but the Radiohead I listen to sounds nothing like Coldplay. Such a comparison is quite an insult to both groups. Coldplay do sound a bit like Travis, who also is often (yet in my opinion still incorrectly) compared to Radiohead. Even Fran Healy has said in a Request interview that he is embarrassed being compared to Radiohead, adding that comparing Radiohead to Travis is like comparing classical to pop. At any rate, Coldplay are a good band that just got better with this new album. I thought maybe Parachutes was a fluke, but this is a great sophomore album and has proven that Coldplay are just getting started and that they can successfully move in new directions and still keep a large fan following. This album deviates slightly from their debut, but in a refreshing way. It's well worth the purchase. And by the way, if you want to compare Martin's vocals to someone, what about Dave Matthews? That's a much better comparison than Thom Yorke or Fran Healy. And as for the music, I hear more of a Police, Red House Painters, Dave Matthew's Band and Trash Can Sinatras influence, then I do a Radiohead influence.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Easily one of the most powerful and moving motion pictures I have ever SEEN, and HEARD.  The cinematography is breathtaking.  No one should be limited to the TV format of this movie which demands the wide screen. I am in disbelief that this film is still not available on DVD. Ennio Morricone's score is outstanding - Beautiful!  Get the soundtrack, turn up the bass and the volume, a glass of wine...whoa!
1577311523|5.0|\\"Being Present\\" is commonly an undercurrent theme, or a chapter, or a paragraph and sometimes only a bullet point in many self-help books. One picks up Mr. Tolle's \\"The Power of Now\\" and realizes early he will discuss \\"the present\\" for its entirety.     Realizing this, I was convinced he would have to run of things to say about being present in about 30 pages. This could not have been farther from the truth.     It was his ability to completely and profoundly reframe many assumptions we all make (on every other page) that made me purchase this book.   For instance:  -----You are not your mind (you've heard it before?)------  Your mind can do math, remember a list, draw the blue-prints to a skyscraper, turn a witty and timely phrase.... It slices it dices (chops everything into an aversion or attraction experience with or without your permission) but frankly we have trouble turning the damn thing off at the end of the day. Our minds compare everything to our past (which is dead and non-existent) to make way in some nebulous future (has not happened and non-existent). These things are all ok and planning is even important, but... KNOW WHEN YOU ARE DOING IT. Which turns out to be almost absolutely constantly. As Tolle says, \\"This is normal. It's also insane.\\"  -------There are no problems---------  There are no problems. For example, in true emergency something else, something much larger takes over in you, something not interested in labeling or sorting into right and wrong, that has lead to some amazing feats of courage. You may survive, you may not but you didn't have time to turn the situation into a \\"problem\\". That larger you was the You in the present and fully conscious. Many seekers may in fact be so concerned with a list of personal problems that they are in fact setting up a huge mental camp precisely were the action is NOT.  -----The ego hates the present---------  The ego (monkey-mind, brat within (my words)) wants to either be head honcho or hate the gameand make you agree. It will do nothing but point out how being number one in every arena is all that matters, or how much life sucks and was stacked against you all along. It is the ego, in fact, that demands you constantly skip the present so you two can dissect it and see everything acccording to this \\"script\\". It wants a seemless transition turning your future into your past with you asleep at the wheel.  It hates the present.  Reading this book is invaluable to really understanding the benefits, difficulties, purpose and overall scope of being present. So, next time some instructional material flippantly tacks on the advice \\"and try to wake up to the present moment...\\" You have this worthy and consolidated volume on which to reflect.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bottom line, buy this disc!<br />A couple observations:<br />1) A few of these songs really hit rather unexpectedly ... specifically, &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; and &quot;Nothing Man&quot; (not to be confused with the RL Burnside classic). Bruce has so much music left in him and he becomes increasingly more human...if that is possible!<br />2) The guitar parts are more interesting and noticable....in fact, quite memorable!<br />3) I did not notice this till a friend pointed it out...Clarence is not a noticable on this album. However, the parts that he does have seem to fit exceptionally well. Well I think of Clarence I think of Born to Run...<br />4) At this particular point in our history, we are all lucky to have someone like Bruce. This man is special and truly gifted at interpreting the events around him. Bruce's interpretations are meaningful to me and to many people.<br />5) Unlike most of the music these days--my kids can listen to this album.<br />rock on,<br />G
B000059QY3|5.0|I think if maestro Verdi would be in life he would glad to see this production. It is very enjoyable, perfectly singing masterpiece. Everybody who has to be young by libretto is young, Gheorghiu is amazingly pretty and [cute], she signs and looks with sparks in the eyes: she is really Traviata. The production is not just nice performed but perfectly recorded and shows both video and audio quality something of the best available. I do recommend getting this one. I think that everybody who has seen this one would support my opinion that stage decorations and costumes are something that was done with lot of knowledge and artistic vision. Nothing is distracting; nothing pops up but makes the stage unforgettable.
0312265859|5.0|Hard Eight is the eighth in the series of novels staring Stephanie Plum, a gun-toting semi-inept bounty hunter, from New Jersey.<br />In this installation, Stephanie is asked by an old family friend to locate her daughter and missing grandchild, who have skipped town and are now involved in violation of their bond agreement. To make matters worse she has an encounter with a psychotic mob boss and a bumbling attorney who has latched onto her like glue. Toss in her angelic sister Valerie, her best friend Lula and a crazed killer in a bunny suit, and you got another week in the life of Stephanie Plum.<br />I really enjoyed this latest installation of Stephanie Plum. Especially the 'hitman' in the bunny suit. The addition of the character of \\"Klowne\\" was really great, although, the character was very under-utilized in the second half of this book.<br />On the negative side, I  DO think that the Steph-Ranger-Morelli romantic triangle is getting old. Especially since Steph herself prefers Morelli. I think a new love interest would recharge Steph's character and put more tension in Steph's life. I would also LOVE to see a return of Sally Sweet, the transvestite singer from a previous books.<br />Overall, another great addition to the Stephanie Plum legacy! Pass the coffee cake!

B00003CWTI|2.0|So what you need to do is get 7 or 8 short stories each 20-30 minutes long and chop them up and play a bit of each of them at a time until all have finished and your 3 hours are up. It doesn't matter if the stories are completely unrelated as long as each can make a casual reference to something or someone in one of the others. For example you could have a story in which an old guy is dying. The old guy used to be a TV producer. This would allow another story to be about a guy who once appeared on a TV show made by the very same producer. Yes it's a tenuous link but that's fine. Get some very good script writers and excellent actors and you've got an award-winning formula. Oh...and don't forget to throw in a wacky ending that 'links' and ends the last couple of stories; how about it raining frogs (or toads if you wish). That'll get their attention. <br />Yes that about sums up Magnolia. A superbly scripted, acted and directed set of short stories bundled together and called a movie. Each one in it's own right is a gem; you can't fault them. Unfortunately it doesn't work as a movie. It's like ordering a pizza and getting the base, tomato, cheese, ham and pineapple in separate cartons. It may be mighty fine ham but it ain't a pizza.
0743464117|5.0|Band of Brothers is a breath-taking and exciting book that follows the E (Easy) company, 101st airborne division as they went from basic training to the heart of Germany in World War Two. <BR>Ambrose discribes the training that the men went through. The airborne was, at the time, an experimental unit in which soldiers were highly trained in small unit combat and dropped into battle via parachute. <BR>In the states, their training consisted of rifle practice, explosives, hand to hand combat, day and night marching and many more things that soldiers had to know.<BR>After their training, the soldiers went to England, where they had some more training, preparing to fight the germans. <BR>Finally, on June 6th, the Easy company, along with several thousand other American, French and British paratroopers, jumped into france in the first attack of Normany. <BR>Ambrose did his homework for this book. He interviewed many soldiers in the Easy company, as well as some other soldiers that they fought against or with. The result is a masterpiece. This book comes from the view of regular soldiers, and describes their reactions to war, death and coming home. There are regular interviews with the soldiers of Easy company, and from that, they describe it for themselves. <BR>There is little to do with politics in this book. The view is solely from the soldier's standpoint, and how they see it is how they see it. There is nothing from Eisenhower's view, or any of the generals. <BR>In a sense, this makes the war a little narrow viewed. I had some trouble figuring out MARKET-GARDEN, and Carehtan, and only after I did some research was I able to put it in the right place.<BR>This book also is able to give the reader a pretty clear view of the European Theater of Operations after D-Day. Easy Company was at the front of almost every battle in Europe, start to finish. This makes it a good book to read if you are studying the European campaign.<BR>All together, this is a great book, destinedto be a classic among war stories.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is the best concert I have ever seen recorded.  The songs are incredible, the musicianship is incredible, the band and the orchestra are incredibly tight.  The orchestral arrangements are great, and fit in perfectly with the music.  I can listen and watch this concert every night.  The versions on Close To The Edge, Starship Troopers, Gates of Delirium, and Ritual all blow me away.It is also one of the few concerts where the camera actually stays on the musician soing solos, although it would be nice to have some extended cuts from one camera (more than 5 seconds).  My wife had never heard of Yes.  After viewing this DVD, they have become her favorite album, and she is forcing me to send this to all our friends and family whenever a birthday present is called for.  If you want any concert from the 70's progressive era, this is it.  Highly recommended.
B000067DNC|5.0|As this is the second installment in the Stargate SG1 series, I can truely state that I loved it ! I was hooked from disk 1, season 1. The quality of the transfer from film to DVD disk is excellent; a couch potato's dream. I viewed the entire 2nd season in two (2) days and the only reason I didn't view it in 1 day was because had to go to work ! The only problem I have at this point is attempting to contain my anxiety and impatience while waiting for the next installment (season 3). I highly recommend this box set and season 1 to gate fans ! If there is any one, who can tell me when the next season is to be released, please tell me the \\"star date\\"!
B000068QY7|3.0|To some fans, Oasis peaked with their first two albums DEFINITELY MAYBE (1994) & [WHAT'S THE STORY] MORNING GLORY? (1995), capturing fans around the world with the cracker jack songwriting of Noel Gallagher, emotive vocals of brother Liam & the band's well-documented love of the Beatles almost to the point of plagiarism. After winning several hit singles from both of those albums, Oasis released BE HERE NOW in 1997 & from the first single \\"D'Ya Know What I Mean\\", things looked promising. But the album turned out to be an overblown mess for the most part, with songs running on way too long & the band's ambitions just beginning to swallow them whole. However, it did have some bright spots (my favorite song from that album is \\"All Around The World\\", even though it's the longest one at well over 9 minutes). It's no wonder they followed BE HERE NOW with THE MASTERPLAN (1998), a collection of B-Sides that show what good Oasis can do when they just simply played good old-fashioned rock & roll.<br />They tried to return to that ethic for 2000's STANDING ON THE SHOULDER OF GIANTS & while it certainly was no MORNING GLORY (which they have yet to catch up with, let alone equal), it was a step-up from the muddled BE HERE NOW. As for Oasis' newest album HEATHEN CHEMISTRY, it proves the band has hit yet another creative wall again, their legendary changes in line-up robbing them of some sense of continuity.<br />Oasis are probably the biggest Beatles fans in the world & it's often fun to listen to their songs to see which one they were listening to while writing that song. Indeed, moments like those crop up on HEATHEN CHEMISTRY, like \\"Force Of Nature\\", \\"Born On A Different Cloud\\" (yes, the guitar sounds eerily reminiscent of the late George Harrison) & \\"She Is Love\\". While actual songs are hard to pinpoint, the Beatles' typical recording methods (a classical piano flourish here, a distorted vocal there) are hard to miss. Oasis has taken flak for almost copying the Beatles note for note, but these songs show what happens when you do it right. \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" is far & away the best song on the album with Liam channelling the spirit of John Lennon perfectly, as opposed to his horrible performance on \\"I Am The Walrus\\" on THE MASTERPLAN.<br />Another old Beatles (and late 1960s rock) theme was a fascination of all things Eastern, particularly religion. The first single \\"The Hindu Times\\" & the closing \\"Better Man\\" (not counting the instrumental you have to have wait almost a half-hour for) are examples of this & I'm not sure if Oasis is sincere about these Eastern leanings or just simply copying the Fab Four again. The former song isn't very inspired, not being about anything basically & is truly one of the weakest songs Oasis has ever released as a single. The latter is a much better tune that shows maybe Oasis' creative drought might come to an end on the next album, who knows?<br />Unfortunately, most of the songs on HEATHEN CHEMISTRY go the way of \\"The Hindu Times\\", being underdeveloped or too wrapped in their own esoterica to really register with listeners. \\"[Probably] All In The Mind\\" is defintely a good melody in search of better lyrics, while \\"Little By Little\\" simply boasts a great vocal performance by Noel Gallagher, who actually does more leads on this album than before. Maybe Liam had voice problems or was just not into it enough to contribute his usual good works. \\"Born On A Different Cloud\\" & \\"Better Man\\" were written by Liam, who often left the songwriting up to Noel & \\"Songbird\\" continues his growth as a writer on his own, but at 2 minutes, could have used some more weight. Recent addition to the band Gem Archer contributes the quite-good \\"Hung In A Bad Place\\", indicating maybe the band has some great new songwriting muscle, but probably would have been better without Liam's lead vocal (I guess if you're in Oasis, only Liam or Noel can sing, no matter who wrote the song).<br />As you can see, HEATHEN CHEMISTRY lookedrather promising on paper, but instead promised more than it delivered. In all honesty, Oasis hasn't created an even remotely fantastic album since MORNING GLORY & it's probably unlikely they ever will. But a band can still try its hardest to do so & with HEATHEN CHEMISTRY, the end result looks like Oasis just isn't trying hard enough anymore. There's always the next album, but if things don't pick up soon, Oasis will just have their well-publicized squabbles & their classic material (on their first two albums) to really fall back on.rather promising on paper, but instead promised more than it delivered.

B00006F83Y|4.0|I'll start off by saying that I'm one of those who thinks that KYUSS was god.  If you haven't heard KYUSS, then quit reading anything of QOTSA and go do your homework on KYUSS.  Since KYUSS broke up, I've followed all the members off-shoots (Unida, Slo Burn, QOTSA...) and I've really not been a huge fan of previous QOTSA efforts UNTIL THIS ONE.  This is definately the best thing QOTSA has done to date!  I'm completely hooked on Millionaire and the single No One Knows...both have that super-catchy guitar hook (like KYUSS always delivered).  Other stand-out tracks include the hidden track Mosquito, Do it Again, and Hanging Tree.   You wont be able to get them out of your head!!  (Which is why I give this CD a thumbs up!)
B00005OM4N|3.0|This is my review for each of the songs on \\"Britney\\"I'm A Slave 4 U - (3 stars) I don't really like pop but this is a good song. Good beat.Overprotected - (5 stars) This is the best song on the CD.Lonely - 4 (stars) I like the song but I don't like the way she performs this song in her concerts.I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - (5 stars) This is one of the only songs she gets to show off her voice on.Boys - (1 star) This song is terrible it shouldn't even be on this album. The remix is just as bad.Anticipating - (1 star) This song is also terrible.I Love Rock 'n' Roll - (3 stars) This is a good cover song but Britney is no Joan Jett.Cinderella - (2 stars) I just doesn't hit me as a good song.Let Me Be - (3 stars) This song has a good beat.Bombastic Love - (1 star) This song is too girlish for me.That's Where You Take Me - (4 stars) This song makes good sense for a pop song.What It's Like To Be Me - (2 stars) Too popish for me.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out after hearing many demo versions of the songs on it and seeing the band live a few times, if you are looking for something to shine through all of that nu-metal that has been coming out lately, 30stm is IT! They combine an atmosperic sound with vocals and lyrics that make your head spin. If the music of today is just boring you to death and you need something to make your jaw drop order this CD now.
B000024D4R|5.0|Roger Waters has a wonderful voice.  He can write about anything and turn it into a classic song that is revered by all of his peers.  When I think 'great songwriters,' the names Lennon, McCartney, Dylan, Townshend, Page/Plant, Wilson and Stevie Wonder come to mind right away.  But you can't pass up Roger Waters.  Syd Barrett was great, but Pink Floyd under Roger's leadership was so much better.  <br />\\"Roger Waters condemns the avarice and inequalities of capitalism, metaphorically and musically grouping humans as pigs, dogs, and sheep. The pigs are self-righteous hypocrites inflicting their beliefs on everyone else, the dogs greedy money-grabbers, and the sheep witless followers. Dark, cynical, and brilliantly composed, Animals is an ingenious and under-acknowledged album.\\"  The album description is wonderfully synopsized and the concluding critique is shamelessly honest.  It is a hugely underrated album.  The guitars, drums, pianos/synthesizers and vocals are seamless as always.  This is the perfect band, the most underrated, rivaling only The Doors.  Any music fan can listen to Pink Floyd and enjoy their music.<br />1. Pigs On The Wing 1 is the first of the bookend on this album.  Bookending is used often in Pink Floyd's work: Meddle, Dark Side Of THe Moon, Wish You Were Here to name a few.  <BR>2. Dogs is the upbeat and fast number that begins the story telling.  The good thing about Pink Floyd is that they can play hard rock but they don't lost any credibility by making it too loud and inaudible.  Gilmour's vocals and guitars highlight this song.  <BR>3. Pigs (Three Different Ones)reminds me so much of \\"Have A Cigar.\\"  The great thing about this song, the whole album and Roger Waters is that he is not afraid to say what he feels.  Eminem, just for example, and his truthfulness is nothing in comparison to Roger Waters.  Roger has a great attitude when it comes to writing \\"take that\\" songs.<BR>4. Sheep is my favorite song on this album.  It's just great.  It starts out kind of slow, you hear the sheep bleeting and you think it's going to be a slow doicle song, but then it picks up only to slow down again.  Then bam, there it goes again, ending with those great, great guitar chords.  You know the ones I'm talking about.<BR>5. Pigs On The Wing 2 is the other end of the bookend of this album.  Watch out for them, because they're out their.  PIGS EVERYWHERE!<br />But all in all, I can't even begin to give this my highest recommendation because it wouldn't be high enough.  And besides, like every other Pink Floyd album, the artwork and photographs are stellar as well.  But hey, it's where Pink Floyd became famous for the pig.  Everyone knows about Pink Floyd's pig, right?  Fantastic album, highest recommendation possible.
0151003084|5.0|This book was read to me when I was little as a bed-time story. There is nothing quite like Gorey's, well, gorey sense of humor. I very much appreciate a nice twist in life, especially now that I attend a boarding school in highschool. The Harvey and Hutter Company makes posters actually of the book. It's wonderful, but there is that something you miss in reading the small adult picturebook that Gorey intended. Overall, one of the most memorable books I have ever read and by far the most interesting way to learn your alphabet as a child.<br />Not recommended for the weak of stomach.
B00005A46T|5.0|Ive recently read some of the reviews on this album. Almost every one of them complains about not enough rap in it and not enough solos. Well guess what, there werent any solos in the self-titled and there was ONE song that had rap. This is a great album, and if you can't appreciate it for being what it is, then dont complain. If you hate it because Corey doesnt rap enough, then go listen to Nelly or something. If you think its a bad album because the guitar isnt as complicated as in the last album, think again. The new album has riffs that blow the old ones out of the water. If you dont like metal then dont buy this album, plain and simple. Im sure theyll be fine without your money or complaints.

If a voice could put you to sleep this would be it.I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow (Acoustic Version) - (5 stars) This is the best version on the album.Hard Time Killing Floor Blues - (1 star) It just doesn't fit into the soundtrack.

068484267X|5.0|I have read a lot of Maeve Binchy novels set in Ireland, and from that gained a love and respect for the it, but this is not Binchy's Ireland. Frank McCourts Ireland is one of poverty, disease, death, loss, alcoholism and stringent religious ruling.<br />He begins the with \\"My parents should never have left New York\\" and I think that speaks volumes about the Ireland he endured. My Grandfather grew up during the same era in America and his family was also very poor, but next to the McCourts his family could have been the Vanderbilts. Not only is Franks family poor in the daily necessities - food, clothing, blankets, shoes, furniture, healthcare, etc. but there is no extended family support the grandmother, though she does help them monetarily a few times, is the proverbial \\"old bat\\" she is mean to the children, and terrible to her daughter. The Aunt is so bitter over her own infertility that she can't a find an ounce of love or compassion in heart for needy nephews, although her husband Uncle Pa Keating provides something of a male role model for young Frank and possibly the only compassionate member of his extended family. Inside Franks immediate family though you find a different story altogether, though you don't word for word read the brotherly love, you can tell by his actions how much he loves each brother, and his mother, what more his alcoholic father, who leaves them all to starve. Though Frank understands that his father is basically worthless, you also come to understand that he loves him, and in his own way he knows that though he is a hopeless drunk he loves them as well, from the way he never finishes a meal, leaving it for his children to eat, to the way that he tells each child stories meant only for them. Which is why I loved this book so much, he never tells you this is how I felt or what I saw, he tells you what as a child was perceived and lets the reader intuit the truth. I felt a bit abandoned in the end as I never learned what happened to the rest of the McCourt children, or Angela herself.<br />In all this was a book that was rife with sorrow but also made me laugh, Franks follies are so typical of a boy coming of age, and he is so honest in his depiction of his humiliation. I think I would like to know Frank, he must be an interesting and wise individual.t of the McCourt children, or Angela herself.<BR>In all this was a book that was rife with sorrow but also made me laugh, Franks follies are so typical of a boy coming of age, and he is so honest in his depiction of his humiliation.

B000002U8G|5.0|This album has just a little bit of everything.  <br />1. One Of These Days is a very psychedelic and hard as hell rock song.  One of, if not their best, instrumental.  The bass in the beginning will knock your head around and leave it a puddle on top of your shoulders.  The growl scares the hell out of you and then when your defenses are down, the attack continues with everyone just reigning down symphonic bomb after symphonic bomb on your desolated cranium.<br />2. A Pillow Of Winds, if you're ready for it after One Of These Days, is a gentle calm after the storm that you need after track #1.  This song has some beautiful lyrics, done justice only by Gilmnour's beautiful voice.  It's soft and gentle and I think only Pink Floyd can fluctuate between the two with such frequency and ease. <BR> <BR>3. Fearless is a great song.  The acoustic guitar on this is great.  I listen to it over and over and I try to ignore the words just to hear the music.  Yet another poem, yet another orchestral masterpiece.  I think it is ten times better for one reason only, the use of the Rodgers and Hammerstein staple from the classic musical Carousel, a song call You'll Never Walk Alone, which has been adopted as a motton for the Liverpool Footbal Club of the Premiere League, England's best professional soccer league.  (Carousel gets my highest recommendation as well, just as a side note.)  <br />4. San Tropez is a fun, fun, fun song.  This is living proof that you don't have to have an overdramatic song with sweeping orchestration and epic lyrics to be great.  It's just a very simple song, like something that was born out of a jam session by accident.  It's great.  <br />5. Seamus is a bluesy little number that jujst makes me laugh everytime.  I can only imagine the smiles on the faces when trying to record this song.  \\"Seamus... that's the dog.\\"  It's funny, yes, but it's in the same vein as San Tropez.  It's so simple and yet it's so great.  <br />6. Echoes is the Pink Floyd that most fans are familiar with.  This is clearly their most ambitious song ever.  Clocking in at a staggering 23 minutes, this song is nothing less than an Symphony in E Flat Major something or other.  The use of sound and effects is something any fan should have gotten used to after listening to this.  Gilmour's vocals are haunting and showcase Water's poetic lyrics.<br />This is what great albums are all about.  You start along the journey with a temultuous sampling of hard rock and psychadelia but then you reach your destination, that relxaing and gentle, but not too gentle to lost your interest sweeping epic of a song that makes you want to listen to it again.  But Pink Floyd always engineers their albums as a complete experience.  I can never listen to just one.  It's like a Broadway Cast Recording.  You have to listen to it all, all at once.  Every song leads into the next and feeds off of the previous.  It is Pink Floyd's second debut of sorts, ushering in the era of Roger Waters in full force.  It has some of Pink Floyd best lyrics, best music, most unforgetable melodies and sounds and is not to be missed by any fan of Pink Floyd or any fan of music in general.  It is a treat for the ears and enables all of the other senses to kick into overdrive.  Just sit back and let your mind wander.  This gets my highest recommendation.
B000069HKH|5.0|When I listened to this song first time, I couldn't believe how Bruce Springsteen can write one so happy song, about such importand and sad day. <BR>The melody is very easy and the song is singing happy and friendly.<BR>But when you listen to the text you understand that he only wants to help the victims and show that everyone will never forget these special days.He talks about 'the Rising' and a new start of live.     So I like this song very much,because it's avrey good idea to help the victims on this way.I think,that we all must hold together and I hope,that this is a nice beginning.<br />GET THIS ALBUM! - AND MAKE YOUR OWN OPINION!

B00005QIPH|5.0|Perhaps it is a backlash from all the hype; some people seem not to like this album. But every bit of hype is well deserved. I'll add my own. The Strokes have every chance to be the Rolling Stones for a new generation. This is a throwback album, the songs are short and sweet, and every single one of them is good. The so-called 'alternative' scene is so worn and [butt]-kicking, tried and true, rock and roll, and for all the good groups riding the wave, the Strokes are at the vanguard.

Can't wait to get to something more interesting (although The Pennysaver would be) after wasting 2 weeks.

I like the idea to write the song from the view of such a fireman who died for the lifes of other people. With this text,Bruce wants to make courage! The Americans shouldn't give up hope,they should help each other and shaire there sorrow. I would be lucky,if somebody,especially a star,shows his sympathy the way Sringsteen has done. It would make me stronger and that's the most important thing!

B00004XOWM|4.0|not the best, not the worst, what else can i say
B000069HKH|4.0|I heard the song in the last english lesson, I did not know anything about its background, so I did not like it, but after some discussions I heard it again and I loved it.<BR>In my opinion it is a very interesting song. On the one hand it is sad, because of the text, in which a fireman describes how he felt, when he worked at ground zero. On the other hand the title, its melody (e.x. .lalala...)and the last phrases give hope for all the victims' friends and familys. It shows that there is a new beginning and that they will all work together to get back to normal life and that nobody will ever forget this disaster and his victims.<br />I think everbody should hear and think about this song, in memory of the victims and their familys!
B00003CXAY|5.0|Roy,<br />you are incorrect in claiming the DVD release has been 'cut' - U need to understand how 35mm film works - To simplify things I will explain that there are 4 main film ratio formats - yes 4:3 and 1:1.85 are two common ratios you will see - 4:3 for commonly documentary film and things headed for TV shot in video - & 1:1.85, the most common 'hollywoodish' widescreen fomat - what you do not realise is that the 1:1.85 ratio is still shot using the exact same film as the 4:3 ratio and indeed ALL 35mm film ratios - It is a fact that the frames centres are the same distance apart whatever ratio - with widescreen ratios sometimes, rather than 'blind' or 'screen' off the extra film, it is still exposed - so in effect you have your 'in-shot' section (in the centre of the frame) and the tops and bottoms where often if you examine the actual film boom-mics and the like can be spotted - the director and camera-person fully aware that this is ok as it will be concealed when projected - <br />Now... I say to you that the DVD is in the *correct* format but the projectionist at the cinema you attended did not install the appropriate blinds in the projector >> hence, you saw the full frame *incorrectly* and is probably why it 'immediately struck you' like u say...<BR>I would go further to say that since it was filmed full frame and that there are no boom-mics etc.. indeed it could be watched any ratio - 1:1.66 if u like (oh yeh, but not anamorphic) - and no, I dont own a plasma screen

B00005Y7AW|4.0|I bought this CD after hearing Rufus on the soundtracks for Shrek and Moulin Rouge. I was at first a tiny bit disappointed because the style differed so greatly from his rendition of Hallelujah, which was the basis for my purchasing it to begin with. After a second listen, however, I really enjoyed it. He has a unique style that does a good job of complementing such an amazing voice. My only criticism was that the songs California and Grey Gardens were a bit redundant. Check out Greek Song, Poses, and One Man Guy, which I feel are the biggest gems on the CD. Definitely a great album, I'll probably be buying his first one soon.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars just for the \\"giving me the willies\\" factor. I takes sitting throuhg it about 2/3 of the way to get what the frick is going on....or I am just slow. Or possibly I was preoccupied with the bunny-man. It's amazing to see how many movies were sent straight to video because of the sept 11th incident. That is the only possible reason I can find for not jumping on the creepy PR possibilities....think of the halloween costumes! Anyhow if you want something dark, creepy, witha slightly obscure begining, this is one of those.

But not here ?!<BR> Dustin Hoffman played may be his most challenging role ... And , thank you Hollywood , somebody screw up , and made a perfect selection ! <BR> In American cinematography it should be on top of the list : \\" The best modern American comedy classics \\"!<BR> An Oscar winner for Hoffman ,but Ghandi took it prise ... and it deserved it . Too sad .<BR> A must se film for any generation !
B000069HKH|5.0|To see the full effect of the new Springsteen sound in the hands of producer Brendan O'Brien, one needs to see The Boss live. It has been said that life is full of two groups of people. Those who have seen Bruce in concert and those that haven't. To truly love this album, undergo a conversion and haul yourself to the stadium rock venue. <BR>His new tour supporting this album brings the intensity of the E Street band to full force and brings this slick, touching, poignant album to life. Bruce tells a story in concert of loss, grief, rebirth, revelation and celebration and at the end it is a party. If no video comes of this tour (and history shows that perhaps none will) then make a point to pony up the bucks ($86 !!!that is $8.60 per bandmember - an easier pill to swallow) to see the show!.
B000000HTL|5.0|What an emotional journey, this takes you across all feelings and you wind up exhausted and content.  Van Der Graaf Generator is not progressive rock in the same vein as Yes, Genesis, and Jethro Tull but have defined their own category.  The band features intense vocals and crazy sax in a progressive way.  It does take a few listens to get used to Peter Hammil's vocals but once you get it, what can I say???  <BR>     The lead track is Killer, and a very upbeat, intense, crazy, and wonderful track.  The sax is frightning at times and I believe features Robert Fripp on guitar.  The year is 1970 and heads above anything done in this time period.  The second song, House with no Door, calms things down in the musical department with Hammil's emotional vocals turned down a bit but the lyrics may bring a tear to the eye, the first two are the highlights of the album.  The Emperor and Lost are also amazing at around 10 minutes per song.  These feature the same intense vocals, sax, and great keys, I believe a Hammond sound as well as some piano and synths.  Van Der Graaf is a darker type of prog that is heavy at times and again, the vocals have to be heard to witness the full experience of the band.  Be prepared for a roller-coaster of emotions.  Then get Still Life and Pawn Hearts.
B0000542D2|5.0|...gets 10 stars for sarcasm. That is the funniest thing I have seen here yet. As for AHDN, it is still as charming, clever, and amusing as it was when I first saw it. The music still holds up as well of course. Only problem is, you really have to listen carefully at times to understand what the Fabs are saying underneath the layers of &quot;scouse.&quot; Almost as hard as understanding the kids in &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; at times.
B00005JHAD|5.0|Despite the fact that it employs so many of the same devices as Lock, Stock &amp; 2 Smoking Barrels, this film is top-drawer entertainment.  <br />A small gripe regarding many of the reviews here: much as I thought Brad Pitt did a great job, his role was relatively minor and it's a shame that his 'star name' takes so much shine off the great ensemble cast, particularly the excellent Jason Statham (Turkish) and Stephen Graham (Tommy), who really hold the film together.
0743201140|5.0|As an Organizational Development professional and a business leader, my first thoughts after finishing the book are that the majority of the information and guidance in this book is great food for thought for corporate executives. In the current economy where &quot;business as usual&quot; is anything but, senior executives continually turn to old-school methodologies of sustaining their business viability. While the focus on individuals areas for improvement are a standard approach to ensuring corporate success, it bears little evidence that there is a direct correlation that focusing energies on individuals' weaknesses results in positive improvement in corporate morale and performance. And that is what this book is all about - no-nonsense, backed by extensive research from a notable research corporation, stick-to-your-ribs data and evaluation. Does it provide singular actions that individuals can take to leverage their strengths to overshadow their areas of weakness? The process of doing so would require individualized performance plans related to the multitude of variations in the theme combinations. Readers should not expect this book to provide step-by-step actions to take in order to give the illusion of different themes. Take heed - this book does provide the baseline guidance of which every reader can not only identify aspects of their own organization, but also identify areas of strength on which to explore further on a self journey. While corporate America continues to struggle with improving performance by focusing on the weaknesses of its employees, the light is at the end of the tunnel, awaiting to be read. I applaud Marcus Buckingham, Dr. Clifton, and the Gallup Organization in having the courage and guts to &quot;tell it like it is&quot; and send out a wake-up call to business leaders everywhere. Kudos!
B00006950W|3.0|but, not terribly scary... I guess I was hoping for this to be a real terror-inducing ride, and although it certainly has it's unsettling moments, I never really found myself checking the corners for zombies afterward. However, what it lacks in chills, it more than makes up for in pure, stylish violence. Milla Jovovich jump-kicking the rotting hounds is a standout scene, and there are plenty of those slow-mo bullet shots (ala The Matrix) that directors seem to dig so much these days.<BR>But, in the end, the film left me longing for more scary. It seems that the director abondoned the elements that make the game such a terrifying thrill, replacing them with sleek sci-fi action. Not that that's a bad thing really but.. let's just say it would have been a lot creepier had it been modelled a bit closer to it's interactive counterpart.
B0000640VN|5.0|Excellent performances by both stars.  It must have been quiet a big step for Hugh from &quot;Wolverine&quot; to &quot;Leopold&quot; and as for Meg,  just another movie which didn't need much acting seeing that she plays her natural self......sweet, loving, funny, etc.  I would suggest any of the Meg Ryan movies as everyone is worth watching.  This movie is definitely for the romantic at heart!!
0316666343|4.0|I loved reading this novel and feel the author has a lot of talent. Alice Sebold's writing style and her little jewels of descriptions and metaphors grabbed me from the beginning of the book. I found myself wishing the story would continue (a sure sign of a good book, in my opinion). Then the ending came and ruined the reading experience and left a less than satisfying taste in my memory of great books. I hoped for a better resolution, some answers, or just some profound advice on living for the reader, and yet it felt incomplete--as if the writer had to meet a deadline. Maybe there was a profound answer that I didn't catch, but I felt the ending was too neatly wrapped and superficial compared to the rest of the novel (which offered an interesting vision of heaven).<br />Would still recommend this book to any teen to adult reader. Quick and easy read too.
B000001FNL|5.0|Main Course, the Bee Gees big \\"comeback\\" album on the '70s, is very solid from the first track to the last.<br />Heck, most of side 1 is filled with Bee Gees classics like the opening track \\"Nights On Broadway\\", then what follows is just one classic after another: \\"Jive Talkin'\\", \\"Wind of Change\\", \\"Songbird\\", and \\"Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)\\"<br />Side 2 is no slouch either, with the tracks \\"Edge of The Universe\\" and the closing track \\"Baby As You Turn Away\\" being the highlights for me.<br />But every song is worth not just a few listens.  Classic Bee Gees!
B000002GQL|4.0|This is the 1st Moodies album I ever bought, so there's a special place in my heart 4 it, even if it IS programmed sideways, & even if 1/2 of it's rather lame. 4 great songs, 2 that R OK or worse, & 2 that R pretty worthless -- the 4-star rating is 4 the great 1/2.<BR>1st of all, the album should've opened with the Moodies' best song ever, \\"You and Me,\\" an overlooked masterwork -- great cosmic lyrics by drummer Graeme Edge, great guitar work by co-writer Justin Hayward, superb group harmonies. Instead, it starts with Mike Pinder's pointless \\"Lost in a Lost World\\" -- this & Pinder's other song, \\"When You're a Free Man,\\" R the 2 weakest tracks he ever contributed 2 NE Moodies album.<BR>Then the album wastes another 5 minutes with Hayward's slushy \\"New Horizons.\\" Things don't get really good til the 3rd track, Ray Thomas's olde English beer-drinking song, \\"For My Lady.\\" But then it's right back down the tubes again with John Lodge's irritating \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" -- that warbly, wobbly Bee Gees-ish chorus puts me off every time.<BR>Xcept 4 Pinder's 1 song, the 2nd side is 4-star worthy -- \\"You and Me\\" leads off, followed by Hayward's excellent \\"Land of Make-Believe.\\" Skip \\"When You're a Free Man\\" & the album closes with Lodge's rockin' \\"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and Roll Band,\\" which echoes some of the thots Xpressed in \\"You and Me.\\"<BR>Hard 2 Blieve this was the Moodies 1st-ever #1 album on the sales charts -- there IS some great stuff here, but it's sure no 4got10 classic....
B000001FAW|5.0|I grew up with this album: Children of The World.<br />What a perfect follow up to Main Course.  This is such an extension of the previous album... but I almost hate to call it Main Course Volume 2 due to the more \\"upbeat style\\" or \\"dance like\\" music that this album provides.<br />Every song is a gem - I can't pick a favorite.  I guess if I had to choose (other than You Should Be Dancing) it would have to be \\"Boogie Child\\".  <br />I didn't realize until I read another's review that Maurice took the lead on this song.  It just goes to show you how well blended the Brothers Gibb were.  He sounds just like Barry!  My favorite part in that song is the part where they all sing together \\"You can't touch her cause you know she's mine...\\" then you hear (I assume Barry) do his trademark fasetto.  But that whole section is great.  Nice, sexy, slinky song.<br />Of course, other standouts are You Stepped Into My Life, Love So Right, Love Me, and the title track. Can't Keep A Good Man Down is great too.<br />Least Favorite Off This Album (if I had to pick one) is Lovers, but it's still very strong.  Love the little scat that Barry maybe?? does between \\"We'll be Lovers, Lovers, Lovers...\\"<br />Get this album along with Main Course for some prime Bee Gees.
B000003S09|3.0|3 great songs -- &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man,&quot; &quot;Epitaph,&quot; &amp; &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King,&quot; the last 2 sound like a heavy Moody Blues -- 1 OK song at 1st (the 1st 3 minutes of &quot;Moonchild&quot;), &amp; 1 worthless piece (&quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot; -- a WAY better previously-unreleased version is available on THE YOUNG PERSON'S GUIDE TO KING CRIMSON) -- &amp; the REST of it is just MESSING AROUND -- 1/2 the 2nd side (the last 9 minutes of &quot;Moonchild&quot;) is COMPLETE NOISE, not worth yr attention.<BR>&quot;Schizoid&quot; is LOUD, weird, noisy &amp; powerful, &amp; shows what KC would Bcome later (check out KC's GREAT middle period, the albums LARKS TONGUES IN ASPIC, STARLESS AND BIBLE BLACK, RED, USA, THE GREAT DECEIVER, &amp; DISCIPLINE), &amp; the other 2 good tracks have intense atmosphere if U always thot the Moodies shoulda cranked it up more often.<BR>The good stuff will blow yr ears wide open; the rest is a waste of time. Can't Blieve guitarist/leader Robert Fripp is still satisfied with this album -- it really shows its age....
B000059Z8J|5.0|This movie is the quintessential of superhero movies from 1979 to the present day.  Every superhero movie that has come afterward, from Blade to X-men has tried to obtain the absolute perfection achieved in this movie.  Chis Reeve is incredible as superman, paired against the always excellent Gene Hackmen as his enemy Lex Luthor. <br /> If you are one of the few who has never seen this movie what are you waiting for?  Go rent it now!!
B0000027RL|5.0|Pick any song off of this cd and you have a precious gem of fantastic music and energy. From start to finish to start again, this cd flows perfectly together and has no weak spot within it. It's been several years since I heard Pearl Jam as a teenager and as I approach 30, this remains the best compilation of music I have experienced. It is complete. There is nothing unnecessary or trivial in it. There is no song that you want to press skip on. There is no trickery or gimmick. It's solid. This is the finest work produced by this band because they all played as a unit with spirit and emotion. Critics hadn't gotten under their skin and changed them at this point. This is a work of love with an amazing artist in each spot within the band. Drumming to bass to lead to vocals... it's all right on and firing in harmony and passion. I own no other cd that returns or hooks as many other people as Pearl Jam's Ten. Seriously, pick any single song off of it and play it and compare it to the best thing out today and I'll bet you will prefer the craftsmanship and energy of the Pearl Jam song you've chosen.<br />Amazing stuff and something everyone should listen to once with headphones all the way through. You cheat it if you only listen to one song or if you only ever heard Jeremy or Alive or Evenflow. Try Garden, Release, Black or Porch... or any other.
B00003CY0V|3.0|John Torvolta does (surprisingly) make a every good spy but I have to agree with the others watch the opening scene and then stop. If you get it for free watch it the whole way though.  I just don't feel that the plot is thick enough to be worth the money.
B000068TPN|5.0|\\"Saving Private Ryan\\" redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  \\"Black Hawk Down\\" took the graphic violence to a new level, with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR, but of a duration that was almost unbearable.<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood.  In many ways, I consider this to be the most complete of the three.  Writer/Director Randall Wallace (who wrote &quot;Braveheart&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and the screenplay for this film), takes the understanding of war to the next level, by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films, this film has the best workup, the best character development, and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.<br />Based on real events, this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD, which presented the characters in a very anonymous way, we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.<br />Of course, the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary.  However, Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like \\"Pearl Harbor\\", which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.  <br />The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure (both to his children and his men).  Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played, so charismatic and heroic, that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.<br />Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in \\"The Contender\\" with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley, the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt, where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway, the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.<br />This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".  I rated it a 10/10.  This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I picked this CD up after I saw Norah Jones on Letterman. As a singer myself, I was totally astonished by the maturity in her voice and phrasing. I didn't acquire my full style until I was in my 30's! (And I'm still tinkering with it!) I truly love this CD. Every time 'Don't Know Why' begins, I get a big grin on my face--it, like the rest of the album, is relaxed, never rushes or overpowers the listener, and is a joy to listen to. It's amazing the emotions that Norah and her band are able to evoke without pyrotechnics or vocal gymnastics (thank you, God!). Norah has a smoky, sultry voice that to me is reminiscent of Billy Holiday in her younger years, but she has a style all her own. A few of the songs end rather abruptly or awkwardly, as though she and the band couldn't decide how to get out of them, but that's my only criticism, and a very minor one at that. I saw Norah this past June as an opening act for the Indigo Girls (boy, was that a mis-match!), and she has a lot of work to do in terms of stage presence, but that's definitely a youth thing. Her music on stage was as close to the album as is possible to get live, to my delight. Can't wait to hear more!
B00005JKWJ|5.0|What could have easily been, well, a mess, instead became as intriguing as the original.  Sometimes, Hollywood needs to relax on the laurel of the success of the first movie and leave it alone.  However, I am glad that they threw that advice out of the window with BLADE II.  My worry would be that the sequel would not be as action-oriented or smartly written as the first; the common thread found in many &quot;part two&quot; flicks.  What I got was more action than required and a storyline that involved a group of monsters called the Reapers, a vampiric bunch that destroyed humans and vampires alike.  The best part of the movie, outside of the fight scenes, was when Blade and the vampire task force had to join forces to destroy the Reapers.  How can a team work together when distrust almost becomes stronger than the common enemy?  That interesting aspect, along with the betrayal of a cast member and the mystery of the lost and found Whisperer, made this one of the hottest movies around!
6303477259|2.0|While the concert is technically sound I ofter wonder about 2 things: Why another concert video and what's missing from their perfromance? I have no answer for the why except the lure of money but as to what's missing, it's Roger Waters. For anyone interested in hearing a good amount of Pink Floyd music in concert I highly reccommend In The Flesh as a better way to get more bang for your buck.
B000002GQE|5.0|On my way to work I was mentally playing &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, only with a choral arrangement--say, an alto might sing &quot;Dawn is a Feeling&quot;, and imagine the chorus belting out &quot;Peak Hour&quot; or &quot;Twilight Time&quot;?  Has anyone tried taking this great rock orchestral work and making it a choral piece?<br />Anyway, onto the album, which I've heard since childhood.  I love the blend of rock and classical, the ambition of the work, the poetry, as it traces a day from pre-dawn to nighttime.  I suppose it's a rock oratorio; it even has an overture of tunes, as in musical theater.  The music captures the blank-slate feeling of dawn, the innocence of morning, the busy-ness of rush hour and mid-morning work.  &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; sounds like someone is extending his lunch break, taking a walk in the park.  We hear the escape from work into entertainment as evening falls, the approaching gloom and fear as the sun sets (must be summer, if evening comes before sunset), the tired resolutions and regrets of night.  (Although &quot;Twilight Time&quot; is a good song, it doesn't capture the mood of its time of day as the others do.  It really sound beyond twilight, say 9 or 10 pm, its &quot;ahhs&quot; sounding like ghosts in deep shadows.)<br />Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of choirsingers who would love to sink their teeth into this one!

0316666343|5.0|It is not often that I have read a novel that has made me think about it so much after I have read it like this one has.  You truly feel like a part of the story.  What first turned me on to this book was the perspective from which it was written.  But what fueled that inital spark into a true passion for this novel was its ability to make me to feel the entire range of emotions that the charaters were feeling.  The only disappointment that I found was the way in which the novel ended.  While it seemed the Susie &amp; her family had finally found peace, the way in which the reader was left was somewhat disappointing.  Overall, I would recommend this novel to anyone.
0345448898|2.0|haha... well you should DEFINITLY get this book! the best fantasy fiction thriller i've ever read! best book i've ever read, for that matter... the characters, storyline, plot, everything is just perfect! (well i didn't like the end of the third book that much, but thats just my opinion... but get them anyway! lol
B00003CXTF|3.0|At first, I thought this movie was just about the events of Pearl Harbor (like the movie \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\").  Given the length of this movie (about three hours), I see that the movie is more about how the events affected the key players in the film.<br />The attack on Pearl Harbor doesn't happen for quite some time.  The focus is on two friends.  An argument could be made that the nurse is also part of the focus, but given the childhood background, I would maintain that it is just the two friends.<br />The movie shows us their love of flying and their close friendship.  We see them come close, and we see the beginnings of WWII separate them.  The attack will bring them together, and we will watch the events after the attack draw them together.  To be honest, this movie is a bit too long for a buddy movie.<br />This movie would be more effective if it were divided into a buddy movie, a love story, a movie about Pearl Harbor (I think Cuba Gooding, Jr. should have had more scenes for his character.), and a movie about the bombing of Tokyo.  Keeping the movie to any one of this would have provided a very concise story.
0393316041|5.0|A late relative of mine, a world-renowned physicist, once said: \\"One has to be an open palm. As soon as it clenches into a fist, the person looses the ability to learn and to enjoy new things. And that is the onset of old age\\".<br />Looking at our parents and grandparents, older colleagues, and now increasingly often at my own contemporaries and at myself, I am beginning to understand what a hard task it is - to remain an open palm.<br />Almost no one avoids the nostalgic illusion - in our better days snow was whiter and girls prettier, and what we've been taught is the only correct doctrine. One only sees how ridiculous such claims are when confronted with a different, higher breed of people, who remain curious and young at heart at any age. Richard Feynman was one of such people.<br />In case someone does not know, Richard Feynman was a physicist, a Nobel prize winner, a participant of the Manhattan project, the founder of quantum mechanics. I have no idea what it is; they say, though, that a new race of computers will shortly change our world and our perception of it; these computers will be supposedly built on principles foreseen by Feynman.<br />Feynman's book, subtitled \\"Adventures of a Curious Character\\", is his memoir - not written down, but narrated in conversations with a close friend. It is very clear that nothing surpassed his ardent passion for physics. When Feynman spoke about his subject, he rejected all notions of etiquette and subordination; Nils Bohr and Einstein could discuss their new ideas only with him - other colleagues just gaped in awe at any dictum of theirs. Feynman writes about the very *process* of discovery - this is probably the only sincere and authentic description of scientific creativity of such scale in literature. In the closing chapter, Feynman speaks about the scientist's responsibility - not to society or colleagues, but rather to himself and his science; all his recollections, serious and jocular, clearly demonstrate how serious it was to him.<br />They say a gifted person is gifted in anything. Feynman was unusually eager to prove this dubious statement. He came to Brazil to lecture on physics, and ended up playing frigideira and winning, with his fellow musicians, the annual competition at a street parade in Rio. He recorded a percussion-only soundtrack for a ballet, and the performance won a second place at a prestigious competition in Paris. He tackled pencils and brushes without any knowledge or experience in paining, and soon became a hot commodity on the art market. In \\"alien\\" domains Feynman always acted incognito or under an alias - he never wanted to be the proverbial Dr. Johnson's dog, whose ability to walk on its hind legs was judged by the fact that it was a dog, not because it walked well.<br />Feynman's free-time undertakings were usually perfected to a degree which would be the crowning glory of many a professional career. He spent one of his summer holidays working under James Watson, the discoverer of the DNA, and soon was able to read a sound lecture about his own findings to Harvard professors of biology. All this seems improbable; but Feynman never admires himself too much, his boasting is good-natured, and he laughs at himself at least as much as at others.<br />He was a master of that, of course. Almost half the book is devoted to his practical jokes. During his work in top-secret labs of Los Alamos, he developed a taste for cracking safes; the pinnacle of his burglar's career was the simultaneous cracking of three safes containing *all* US nuclear secrets.<br />A womaniser without narcissism, a braggart without pomp, a jester without malice, a unique, but amiable character - Feynman is the most loveable memoir writer that could ever be. He never took anything for granted - having read an article about the bloodhounds' phenomenal olfactory abilities, he set to investigate humans and found out that ours are not much worse, just underused. He hated pompous fools; the description of an \\"interdisciplinary\\" conference, where the narrator's common sense and logic fail in a combat with \\"intellectuals\\", is a real tragic comedy. He was open to any new experience (unless it threatened to damage the thinking mechanism - which explains his abstinence from alcohol and drugs of any sort). Since his childhood, when he fixed radios by thought, to his old age, he remained an open palm.<br />An excellent lesson for any of us.
B000069HKH|3.0|The first time I heard from Bruce Springsteens' new song &quot;the rising was last thursday in the english lesson. Our teacher let us hear the song and then she gaves us the text. For the first time I didn't like it, because I didn't understand the text, but after reading I like the song.<BR>First of all, I like that Bruce Springsteen wrote it from the perspective of a fireman who lost his life. I think you can feel with the man and perhaps you realize how terrible it was for all people who were at the World Trade Center. <BR>Another reason why I like this sing is the text with the melody- On the one hand the text is verdy sad but on the other hand it shows to the people who lost loved ones that thex shouldn't give up hope. The melody isn't sad and together with the text it's a good song.<BR>Last but not least I think the song is a good idea and perhaps it will give hope for some people who lost someone.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Simply stated, a wonderful must have CD for any collection.  Her soft vocals and simply stated music combine to form a powerful symphony off all emotions.  Simply Wonderful.  Enjoy!
B000000H6D|5.0|This is the album that started my love affair with this band.  I consider TON to be one of the most unique bands out there todayand Bloody Kisses is a wonderful blend of the varieties of metal that TON plays.  Bloody Kisses truly is a bridge between the more angry work as is evident in Slow Deep and Hard, and the more sensual and emotional work on October Rust.<br />All throughout this album the group shines.  Interspersed with their trademark songs Christian Woman and Black No. 1, we are treated to the lighter side of Peter's cynical sense of humor as is evident in Kill all the White People and We Hate Everyone.....<br />While the above mentioned songs alone are worth the price of this album, Peter and the boys kick it into high gear at the end of the album with three underrated track in Too Late: Frozen Love and Fire and Can't Loose You.  Give these tracks a listen to while remembering the lost love you can't help but lament over to get the full effect.<br />As always, it wouldn't be a TON disc without a cover tune, and their cover of the old Seals & Croft tune Summer Breeze does not disappoint.  Be warned though, if you are familiar at all with the original version of this song you will be in for a shock.<br />Overall, this is one of the most important CD's in my collection; while it may not be played as heavily as when I was an angst ridden college student, it still holds the feelings I had when I first discovered this wonderful album.  A definite must buy.
B00005JKDR|2.0|Sure, monsters inc is very well done animation wise. The first few minutes I was just amazed by the way sully's hair moved, but after that I noticed that the story was boring. Alot of the jokes we've seen 80 times before and I never really cared that much in the first place. I laughed maybe 3 times through the entire two hours, and for me that wasnt enough when this was supposed to be so good, I'm just glad I saw harry potter in the theater instead of this tripe.
0553260111|2.0|I guess I just expected too much. There was some really good action, but the characters and the plot development were lacking to say the least. Bourne meets up with the love interest Marie and their relationship was just too unbelievable. I couldn't figure out why they were together and it was like Ludlum was just inventing reasons on the fly for her to hang around and be useful. I was all ready to forgive as the story reached the climax, expecting a big finish and maybe a twist that I hadn't expected. But it flopped HARD! He just wrapped it up with such a wimpy ending, very dissapointed and wouldn't recommend it unless you just want a few action sequences (and there weren't even enough of those in my opinion)
0671721720|5.0|From start to finish, this book went 100 mph.<br />I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great space opera yarn.
B00JZO33VK|5.0|THE 1971 FILLMORE EAST RECORDINGS is a great boxed set of six CDs compiled from five shows that the Allman Brothers Band did at the Fillmore East in March and June of 1971, about a year before I was born. I got this set as a holiday gift this year, and am just blown away by it. Some reviewers have claimed that it's a bit tedious, but the truth is, the Allmans never played any song the same way twice, so having multiple versions of some songs sheds light on what the band was like in concert at their early peak. This set features ALL of the live material from AT FILLMORE EAST (DELUXE EDITION) and EAT A PEACH (DELUXE EDITION), but you'll still want the latter for its studio recordings.
6305897786|5.0|Skip this review if you don't want to know anything about the end of this movie, suffice to say I loved the whole thing, including the end! WHich makes me want to ask &quot;What is wrong with people these days!?!?!&quot;. Ok, so there's no blood soaked ending, no huge sfx demons errupting out of the ground, no end of the world, but lets face it, this isn't buffy the vampire slayer we're watching. This is a subtle, beatuifully underplayed masterpiece, one that, thankfully,  doesn't sell out to shlock at the last minute. Depp's character, Corso, walks purposefully towards a future we can only guess at. His intention is clear, but the detail his ultimate fate is left to our worst imaginings. Superb.
B00005JA2B|5.0|LEFTOVERTURE was Kansas' breakthrough album. In a way, it's a concept album about a person's search for meaning in life, although one song, &#34;Cheyenne Anthem&#34; is about the displacement of native Americans, which in effect makes the album's concept about all of humanity's search for meaning and purpose in life. This, along with POINT OF KNOW RETURN and THE ESSENTIAL 3.0 KANSAS, is one of the first Kansas CDs you should buy.
B00003CXAY|5.0|Magnificent, magical, mesmerising and moving.<BR>********************************************<br />I saw this for the first time as a student and it changed my whole way of seeing environmental issues and was a launch pad for learning about everything from minimalist music to Hopi indian culture.<br />A truly wonderful and unique cinematic experience. The Philip Glass sound-track gives an epic symphonic quality to the film. <br />It's a rare and magnificent beast that every American should see.
B00006AFUR|5.0|The only word i can use to describe this album is AMAZING. I have never seen or heard a band with such talent, intellegence, and melody. If you do not have this C.D. you must pick it up a.s.a.p. This C.D. seems to Capture your emotions and open your mind as well as deliver pulsating guitar riffs, perfect vocals,  melody, and UNDESCRIBEABLE drum playing. This album makes every individual who listens to it become part of something special, and that should always be known and remembered as a Flawless album filled with AMAZING talent.
0767802470|5.0|Previous reviewers have gushed enthusiastically about this film, so I shall forbear from doing so.  I agree with their overwhelmingly positive assessment, and add only the following -ALL SERIOUS FILM BUFFS MUST BUY THIS DVD.  It is a home run on every level.  The 3+hr directors cut can be plodding at times, but that is an extremely minor quibble.  BUY IT, and be blown away!
B00005ASOC|5.0|You all are wearing me out with all these negative comments. This is our latest social code, it seems: to denote anyting attempting positive race relations as too much 'political correctness.' Have it your own way. The director of \\"Forrester\\" is the same director of \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" Yes there are similarities. Your point? And while you're nitpicking about that, know that \\"Hunting\\" is also a variation of \\"The Karate Kid,\\" \\"Scent of A Woman,\\" \\"Dead Poets' Society,\\" and a film from the 60's, \\"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner.\\" So film plots borrow from one another. Just watch the sublime, tender, witty, beauty of this movie and judge it on its own merits and for yourself. The 'conjunction' sequence between Connery and Brown debating proper grammar is special. Or the scene at Yankee Stadium where a broken Connery delivers a monologue to Brown (which I think should've garnered him an Oscar nomination). And the DVD has a nice appendix of the making of the film along with the original trailers. Isn't there room for appreciation of this movie along with all the others? After all, how different is THE WIZARD OF OZ from ALICE IN WONDERLAND?
6304467540|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I could watch it over and over again in one sitting!  It's highly addictive.  You cannot finish watching one and nort go on to two.  The way each movie ends leaves you wondering about the next.  I highly recommend this collection to anyone who loves old Italian Godfather type movies.  The book is really good, also.
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks is perhaps one of the greatest television phenomena to have ever graced our collective sets worldwide.  Twin Peaks popularity is due to the shows never-waivering endever to explore not only the ultimate struggle between good and evil, but also that ever elusive \\"inbetween\\".  It is a story that incorperates all aspects of the human condition: love, abandonment, loathing, greed, lust, dispair, grief, friendship, secrets, madness and the myriad ways people try to escape it all.<br />  Yes it sounds depressing.  And at times it is.<br />  However when the landscape of Twin Peaks has worked itself into your mind and the twists and turns common to Lynch have melted away your yearning to hide, one simple truth is simply undeniable: people are in fact WEIRD.<br />  If you can come to grips with that, Twin Peaks is just the vehicle one needs to steer through it all and maybe find some answers.<br />  Of course, the only answer I want now is when the next DVD is set to hit stores and how soon I can complete my collection.<br />  It's never fun knowing only half of the story.<br />PLEASE GIVE US SEASON TWO!!!!
0060920084|4.0|Bryson is a very good travel writer and a clever social critic, but people expecting a book on par with A Walk in the Woods might find themselves a bit disappointed.  Bryson is very funny, but I think he employs an English sense of humor which tends to run a bit more biting than the American brand.  He's clever, he's more accurate than many of us want to admit, but it gets tough to read a couple hundred pages from someone who sounds an awful lot like a cynic.  Like the back of the book says, he's as observant as de Tocqueville, but he's less optimistic.  A good book from a good writer, but be warned.
B000002BFL|5.0|If there were any justice in this world, this album would've sold the 11 million copies that Born In The U.S.A. did, due in no small part to its widely misunderstood title track. Alas, as Springsteen proposes on this album, there is no justice. While Springsteen's best-known and best-selling music may always remain his early songs filled with cars, girls, and the dreams of youth, and while that may be the image that most people have of the man, this album is undoubtedly the work of a mature genius. Not since the early Bob Dylan records has the seamy underbelly of the American life been explored so thoroughly and heart-breakingly in popular song. Influenced, obviously, by John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (actually, the movie adaptation, as one sees in the linear notes) as well as other literary and news items focusing on immigrants, the working class, and the downtrodden - as well as drawing upon previous songsters who have explored this territory, such as Dylan and Woody Guthrie - The Ghost of Tom Joad is a set of story songs, done in the heart-breaking and plaintive way that only Springsteen could do them. The stories are mosly set in California, often near the Mexican border, and involve the deeds of illegal aliens and other working class heroes involved in America's secret economy. Musically, this album is bleak and involved mainly Springsteen alone on acoustic guitar and occasionally punctuated with harmonica, as on his Nebraska album; however, a few songs feature other players, including some intriguingly subtle keyboard work that fits the mood so well you hardly know it's there. Springsteen sings these songs in the slurring drawl that they deserve, paying little heed to pitch or meter, and they can be hard to understand at times. This album doesn't make for easy listening. One cannot play this as background music, driving music, or at a party like one can many of The Boss's records with The E Street Band: this is definitely an album that you must devote your full attention to. It is one of the few records that truly deserves to be listened to when you're alone at night in your room with the lights off. Be prepared to cry, be prepared to feel your heart ache - be prepared to be moved. One of the true masterpieces of American rock music, and a criminally overlooked record which I hope some day will receive the praise it is due.
6304140428|5.0|I consider this one of the most intelligently written and acted movies ever filmed. The psychological devestation that George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor)inflict upon each other casts a spell which, though it at times makes the viewer uncomfortable in its realism, is impossible to turn away from. George Segal and Sandy Dennis are the unfortunate co-passengers on this mad ride to \\"truth\\". Though they are not stupid, they are naieve and inexperienced to the point of seeming arrested development, and  George and Martha go in for the kill. This is the film where Elizabeth Taylor shattered her glamour image, a pretty brave thing to do at that time, and it worked. Though her beauty was always obvious, I was never a big fan of many of her film roles, until I saw this film. It is not only her best performance, but I consider it in the ranks of the top female performances ever filmed, and Richard Burton is equally superb. That they were able to play so well off of each other in spite of, or maybe because of, their personal off-screen relationship, is amazing. Movies that do not insult the intelligence are rare these days,... I guess most of todays paying movie audience wants glorified ear-splitting music videos, with the plot secondary, if considered at all. This film is a perfect example of the mostly forgotten noble intention of the medium, which was ,yes, to entertain, but aspired to craft an experience that would also move you, make you think, and, stand in awe struck appreciation of REAL talent.
B00005JKDR|1.0|Monsters Inc. does not have the magic of the Toy Story series.  The story is long, boring and doesn't have any of the creativity of it's predecessors.  Mighty Casey has struck out.
B000069HKH|4.0|When I heared the song the first time I didn't really realized that this was a song about the 11th September 2001. But then I heared it again and then I know that the song gives hope for the people who had lost beloved people. I think the song is so successful in the USA because it shows the view of a fireman who had lost his life in the WTC. If you hear exactly to the text you could have the same feelings as the fireman. Until his dead he had hope and he thought only about his &quot;Mary&quot;. For everybody who had lost a beloved person could this song be a good help to get over the pain of the 11th September because the melody isn't sad . I never heared a song before which was so emotional. It's a very wonderful song.
B000067J1Y|5.0|This film is brilliant, with wonderfully hilarious acting by Charlie Sheen, Lloyd Bridges, Jon Cryer, and Cary Elwes. And although his scenes in the film are minimal, Ryan Stiles has probably the most hilarious scene in the entire movie at the very beginning as pilot &quot;Mail Man&quot; Farnham. The movie, directed by Jim Abrahams, is every bit as funny as Abrahams' other films, most notably &quot;Airplane!&quot; So, if you have seen &quot;Airplane!&quot;, etc, but haven't yet seen this film, you should most definitely watch this. You will be glad you did.
B000069HKH|4.0|I didn´t really know where the song is a about and how the song might be,before I heard it the first time.The only thing I knew was,that the song is from Bruce Springsteen and that he talked to the widows of several fire-fighters,before he has written the text.<BR>I like the idea which had inspired him,because I think that after having had the talks to the widows he got more and more an idea of the pain and the emotions they feel.Bruce Springsteen wants to encourage the Americans and in a way all people in the whole world not to give up hope and to fight for a good and hopefully better world-that´s where the titel &quot;The Rising&quot; stands for!<BR>Another reason,why I like the song is the melody and the refrain.It isn´t a sad melody,what most people-me,too-might have expect.The message of the song is visible in it´s melody and the refrain-the people have to stick together and to &quot;rise up&quot;.<BR>In general I think that the music and the lyrics of &quot;The Rising&quot; are inspiring and very comforting.<br />---&gt; GET THIS SONG!!You´ll love it!
B00005JL78|4.0|You'll enjoy this stylish blend of sci-fi and film noir if you're willing to suspend your disbelief at the door. Many have decried the illogical holes in Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's otherwise excellent screenplay, but in the end these deficiencies hardly matter. Movies dealing with predestination never answer the big questions effectively - they just use them as the springboard for a story. And \\"Minority Report\\" tells a pretty good one, even if it does reveal where it's going too soon and is occasionally marred by Spielberg's trademark mawkishness. Tom Cruise is hugely enjoyable as the frantic John Anderton, and Colin Farrell does a fine job of making you hate Detective Witwer. It looks great, sounds great, holds your attention for all 147 minutes, and will even have you giggling at the spectacular product placements and some unexpected comedy.  It's not a faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick's story - it's better, although Act 3 does see the writers wandering into Hollywood-ending territory and has Spielberg wrapping things up on a typically optimistic false note. Still, it's refreshing to see a bunch of filmmakers tackling a sci-fi adaptation seriously and successfully while still keeping an eye on the box-office.  If you're going to spend close to $100 million on a sci-fi project - and, let's face it, these days you have to - then you also have to consider the return. The result is a memorable film that strikes a savvy balance between deep thought and commercial appeal. \\"A.I\\" flopped because it glorified the former and \\"The Time Machine\\" failed by pandering to the latter.  \\"Minority Report\\" wisely walks the middle-path.  It won't have enough explosions to thrill die-hard action fans, nor quite enough depth to really please sci-fi devotees.  But for the rest of us, it works.
0440219078|4.0|I was given (pun unintended) this book as a gift shortly after its publication, but never took the time to read it. Well, I finally did, so here's an adult approach to the novel. First off, I have to say that the first 150 pages of this novel are stunning. The writing is brilliant and the ideas, though simplistic (but then, this is expected for a children's novel), are provocative. I'd say the best description of this would be that this book is the one Philip K. Dick would have written, had he written a children's novel. Unfortunately, the depth of the writing collapses in the end. I guess Lowry suddenly realized she wanted to keep the book under 200 pages in length, and just quickly wrote an ending that lacks almost all of the intelligence of the earlier work. Issues simply are'nt resolved that easily. Well, all in all this is a great book, more mature than I expected (dealing with the issues of puberty and abortion certainly don't usually fall in the children's novel category), but with an ending that could have used quite a bit more polish. Recommended.
B000002KDO|5.0|So begins \\"After Forever,\\" which follows the somewhat dated drug paean \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and kicks this album into high gear.  One spiritually searching lyric after another follows.  For a band with a reputation for being doom merchants, this is a startlingly uplifting, emotionally complex and \\"deep\\" album just below the surface.  For that reason, it's one of my very favorite heavy music albums, and in my judgment, the definitive effort by Black Sabbath.
B00001NFCY|5.0|While most rock bands today prefer obscenities and graphic references to drugs, sex, and how unfair the world has treated them, Creed is definitely an exception to the rule. Instead of focusing on their inner darkness, they choose to open up to their audience and present them inspirational anthems, both soft and hard. While the most popular single from the album is \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" (lead singer Scott Stapp's ode to fatherhood), there are many other tracks that deal with everything from preserving one's youth (\\"Never Die\\") to dealing with ex-girlfriends (\\"Beautiful) to helping a female friend cope with rape (\\"Wash Away Those Years\\"). The band has been blasted by fellow musicians and the media for sounding like Pearl Jam rip offs, but anyone who seriously listens to Human Clay can see how wrong they have all been. Definitely one of the best albums of the year.
B000002U94|4.0|As several other reviewers have noted, &quot;Live Bullet&quot; launched Seger into the big time of the rock world.  What also bears mentioning is that &quot;Nine Tonight&quot; basically signals the end of that heyday.  After this album and tour, his star began to fade, and his music, for the most part, lapsed into self-parody.  (How many times can one hear Bob pine for his lost youth without screaming, &quot;Enough already!&quot;?)  In a perfect world, this album would be the sound of a bad-booty rockin' machine going out on top - and that's how I like to imagine it.<br />By the way, I just burned a CD of my double vinyl of this album, and it timed out at 79:54 - it just does fit on one CD in unedited form.  So how's about a remaster, EMI?
B00000JRTX|4.0|&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is one of the few romantic comedies I appreciate.  It's a lovable, hilarious look at the wackiness of love and weddings.  Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant are fine leads, though MacDowell's character is written rather weakly.  There really isn't much for her to do, except perform the duties of &quot;unrequited love interest&quot;.  The other characters are very vivid, though.  Hugh Grant truly shines in the role of his career as bumbling bachelor Charles, whose main characteristics consist of being late to weddings, stumbling over words, and fear of commitment to one woman.  Grant is romantic and sympathetic without being coy, and I found myself falling in love along with Andie MacDowell!  But the best part of the film is the supporting cast.  I think it is responsible for the film's status as a comedy classic.  Charlotte Coleman is perfect as fiery Scarlett, David Bower is hilarious as David, a bumbling bachelor like Charles, but lacking his suave charm, and Simon Callow is fondly memorable as flamboyant Gareth, perhaps the funniest of them all.  My favorite performance, however, is that of Kristin Scott Thomas.  As the icy, longing Fiona, she's an understated revelation.  Director Mike Newell has called her performance the best of the film, and I agree.  Scott Thomas is a great ensemble player (see &quot;Gosford Park&quot;), and here's hoping she lands another comedy soon.<br />There is a pitiful lack of special features on this DVD, but at half the price of most, it's still worth owning.  A movie this fun doesn't need lots of extras to justify its purchase.
B00000099Y|2.0|if you don't like this band and worship the members as gods, you are an inferior being and for that i look down my nose at you even though i'm only fifteen like i know what the hell i'm talking about. the benevolent reverend maynard told me to be myself and open my mind to new ideas so i snub people who have different opinions from me. tool are the most amazing, intellectual, spiritual, aesthetically pleasing sonic experience i've ever had and because of that, i'm in a class all my own and can't be touched. nevermind the fact that aenima has gone platinum and everyone else who owns it thinks the same exact thing. i'm still my own person and i'm still better than you because tool are gods. you can come crawling back to me when you've realized the musical genious and sonic voyage that is tool, and only then will i treat you as an equal. i'm open minded. i listen to tool.<br />has anyone else had this experience when talking to a tool fan? they have this single-minded ferocity similar to that of a born-again christian or a member of the 'holy rollers'. it's weird.<br />anyway, as for the music, i like the songs eulogy, message to harry manback, hooker with a penis, intermission and die eier von satan. i'd like the rest if i hadn't heard the singles a million times and if the rest didn't get so boring. it just kind of goes on and on, and isn't really as layered as you may be lead to believe by these reviews. BUT this is a fine album for just about everybody. you might as well buy it if you haven't already. whether you like it or not, this album/band is pretty influencial for a lot of bands, even though pretty much all of them [stink](just about every radioband after '96 or however long it took a band to get together and make an album after listening to aenima, alice in chains, and nirvana.)i think the fact that this band has a weird cult-like following should say something too.  i liked this when i was in high school(about the time it came out), but then i moved on to other kinds of music that have more going on. i'm past my tool phase.<br />i saw them live too. they sound great, they're very tight(not as in 'phat', as in they play together exceptionally well). the show is great. they dont do much on stage and it helps immensely if you're high on something. but as for the MUSIC... only if you like it. the new show is mostly lateralus. i hated lateralus so i hated the show. lateralus was EMPTY and BORING. yeah i said 'empty'.  nothing special. nice visuals from time to time.
B000021YQV|4.0|I, being a fan of differnt types of music, recently purchased Toxicity by System of a Down. I had heard three songs from the disc at a retail store and had seen the videos, and i enjoyed them. Was I disappointed? Evidently, by the rating I gave the disc, i wasn't.<br />I purchase music on a frequent basis and i must admit i could listen to the disc all the way thru without changing tracks. I admit i have some music which i bought for just a couple of songs( haven't we all?!), but to have a disc or tape that you can listen straight thru is a rarity.<br />If you have an open-mind, musically and are tired of the radio-friendly music. Check out SOAD's Toxicity.
B000066NW0|5.0|Personally, I think Avril has done it. I simply luv her voice. I bring her music to work and everyone likes it. No coworker complains and just thought who is this girl? Michelle Branch? No. Avril has her own music, written by her own talents, and her hit single &quot;Complicated&quot; has been on the MTV charts for 18 wks. I'm impressed that she is showing her true self side, doesn't dress shabby, and has a positive attitude on the outlook of life.<br />Anyhoo, here is my personalized review of Avril's songs:<br />Losing Grip: Great song w/ her venting out her anger over someone. I listen to it when I'm having a bad day w/ my bf or at work. 4/5<br />Complicated: A hit song for over 18 wks. on Billboard Charts. I like her video. Another great song to groove and sing-a-long. 5/5<br />Sk8er Boi: Surfer song. A bit of punk rock mixed in. 4/5<br />I'm With You: My least fave song. Still good to listen to when having a bad day ;). 3/5<br />Mobile: Another great song to groove to. It will wake you up at work. True, everything is changin'.  5/5<br />Unwanted: My next least fave song. Her voice sounded a little bit like Alanis Morisette. 2/5<br />Tomorrow: What can I say, I like this song on a bad day or a <BR>so-so day. 5/5<br />Anything but Ordinary: My fave song! I can listen this more than 5x/day! I do think sometimes I'm weird myself, this song reminds me of who I am LOL. 5/5<br />Things I'll Never Say: Another fave! I can listen to this all day. It makes me think of my bf. Definitely romantic. 5/5<br />My World: This is another fave! Listening to it makes me think of how hard life can be growing up as a teen. 5/5<br />Nobody's Fool: Avril can rap. It'd be cool if she rapped with other pop/rock artists. 4/5<br />Too Much to Ask: Not bad. 3/5<br />Naked: When I'm feeling down. My least fave,too. 2/5<br />Make an investment today. You won't be disappointed. Play this cd at work. None of my coworkers complained, they luv her voice!<BR>I have also tried Angela Ammons. She should be another great voice out there. She definitely needs more publicity.
B00003CY6M|2.0|This movie is, well, how can I say this...dumb! Yea, that's it.  This movie is so far fetched, I have seen more plausible alien invasion movies than this!!  I mean, c'mon, what kind of guy would spend his last hours of freedom searching for a girl who he only spent a couple hours with? And fly across the country in search of her the night before his wedding? What!????  Talk about unrealistic! And to think that someone as hot as Kate Beckinsale would still be on the market after 3 years is highly unlikely.  Though romantic saps will love this movie, it is far too improbable and out of reach for my tastes.  This movie is so unlikely, I can't even classify it as a fairy tale. Don't tempt &quot;fate&quot;, stay away from this movie!! Rent or buy something more realistic, like Black Hawk Down.
B00005OAIE|5.0|After hearing John's first cd, &quot;Inside Wants Out&quot;, I really connected with him.  On &quot;Room for Squares&quot;, he takes that connection to a whole new level.  By giving the listener a self-depracating look at the different situations in his life, he has enlightened us all with catchy songs suitable for any occasion-  early morning driving, late night studying, and everything in between.  He is a rare talent whose formidable chops on the guitar are matched by his acute talent for writing precise songs.  My prediction:  in ten years, we'll all still be rocking out to both his newest cd as well as &quot;Room for Squares&quot;.
B000002TQV|5.0|and since I'm already halfway there, I'm way out of the band's demographic.  Bought this in early '96 and still listen to it at least twice a month.  I put this one ahead of OK Computer.  You kids can have Kid A and Amnesiac.  For us older folks who usually only rock out in the car, listening to Kid A is like taking a valium... do not drive or operate heavy machinery.  The Bends, on the other hand, is a masterpiece.  It was the Revolver of the 90's.  The musicianship and production are unparalleled, and the range of moods coupled with wild stylistic changes from track to track make this a must have CD regardless of what your tastes in music are.

6305350205|1.0|I still remember my friend's one-line review of this movie as we left the theater. She was reacting to the final scene with Spock, McCoy and Kirk singing (off key) around a camp fire, one of many pathetic and ineffectual attempts at humor. About a dozen of us had ditched work to see Star Trek V when it came out and, boy, were we disappointed. What an embarrassement!<br />This movie has little offer non-fans. If possible, it is even more annoying to life-long Trekkers, such as myself, with its violations of the canon with regard to Sybock, the renegade  Vulcan (I won't spoil it, if you are determined to watch it) and out-of-character behavior by Spock and others.<br />The movie that confirmed the odd-numbered Star Trek movie curse. Watch II, IV, VI or First Contact (VIII) again, instead of wasting your time on this turkey.
B000069AUI|4.0|Another great album from Coldplay... I recommend you buy it now!
B000002L9Y|5.0|The album, with its vaguely eerie edge (thanks in large part to Lindsey's instrumental and vocal arrangements) is highly recommended.  The only disappointments are a couple of Stevie's contributions.  I find I enjoy the album more with each listening.<br />1.  Big Love:  9/10; excellent pop song from Lindsey with a catchy guitar riff; has a dark, almost menacing atmosphere (fyi the feminine &quot;ah&quot; voice at the end is actually Lindsey's, not Stevie's as noted elsewhere among these reviews--thanks, voice modulator).  The only trouble with this song:  once you hear Lindsey's sublime acoustic version from The Dance, you're never going back again.<br />2.  Seven Wonders: 8/10; Stevie's best song on the album can be haunting at times.  I really like her vocals on this, and the riff is catchy too.<br />3.  Everywhere:  9/10; catchy hit track from Christine. I'm sure you've all heard it.<br />4.  Caroline:  7/10; fine contribution from Lindsey; some say one of his better compositions.<br />5.  Tango in the Night:  7/10; excellent vocals, catchy chorus, and a good guitar solo.<br />6.  Mystified:  7/10; a Christine song; not my favorite on the album, but all the same, a fine pop tune.<br />7.  Little Lies:  10/10; some dismiss this tune, but it's one of my favorites, with its unforgettable synthesizer hook, underlying eerie quality, and immediately catchy chorus; even the backing vocals by Stevie (&quot;...tell me lies...&quot;) and Lindsey (&quot;...tell me, tell me lies...&quot;) sound great.  listen to it loud or with good headphones to catch all of the song's nuances...it will become even more enjoyable.<br />8.  Family Man:  9/10; probably Lindsey's best or second best song on the album.  Very catchy; the interlude, with its distorted &quot;am what i am...am what i am&quot;'s, is rather striking.<br />9.  Welcome to the Room...Sara: 6/10; a solid tune from Stevie.  But it's hard to give the song an 8 or 10 rating--while Christine and Lindsey aren't afraid of a little innovation on their contributions to Tango, Stevie sticks to her old formula here.  But this song is no Gypsy, Sara, or Rhiannon.<br />10.  Isn't It Midnight:  10/10; Christine's vocals are particularly well suited for this somewhat dark song.  One of the best tracks on the album, one of my favorite Mac tunes.<br />11.  When I See You Again:  3/10; my least favorite Stevie tune of the 5 Rumours lineup albums.  By far.  I haven't come to find it catchy yet, it kind of drags and is very repetitive at times.  This seems to be one of those songs that isn't going anywhere and doesn't know what it's doing.  <br />12.  You and I, Part II:  10/10; Lindsey sings lead on this Buckingham/McVie collaboration.  It's a slightly odd tune.  But very catchy.  Very catchy.  Also one of my favorite Mac tunes.  Sometimes I listen to it 6 or 8 times in a row.<br />Bottom line, really great album, well worth the investment.
B00003CXI1|4.0|What a wondrous little film!  Though I would have liked to see this film stay closer to the book itself, I cannot complain about the sequences, special effects and the pure wonder of the fantasy and magic that pervades the entire movie.  The characters were terrific and the story line was true to the book for the most part.  The cast was exceptional and fun to watch.  I would reccomend this film for any child and for adults who wish to get lost in their own childhood again!
B00005JKDR|4.0|MONSTERS, INC. is a movie that when I saw it in the theatre didn't really knock my socks off as I thought it would. Juts a few things short of interesting and for me, not as entertaining as Toy Story or A Bug's Life. (Even Toy Story 2 was a little better than this.)<br />Some standout performances by Billy Crystal (America's Sweethearts, Analyze That) and John Goodman (Emperor's New Groove, What Planet Are You From?)and even Jennifer Tilly (Stuart Little, The Muse) and of course some great gag bits and slapstick humor for a computer generated film. Directed by Peter Doctor (writer of Toy Story 1 &amp; 2) who gives the film a flavor of color and flare.<br />The story is that of the concept that monsters scare you under your bed in and in your closet as a kid and this is how they do it. Very mechanical and very routine. Their job is to collect the screams of the scars and then turn it into power and energy for Monstropolis. There is one fear; the Monsters are more scared of the kids they scare then the kids themselves. Guess what? One gets in the Monster world. I'll let you imagine what happens next.<br />Now the DVD extra's are amazing. There is a very funny NEW short called Mike's New Car, which is short but hysterical. There are games, and Monster training videos and manuals and CDRom extras too. Music videos and a ton of production information on how the film was made and produced. The extras on the DVD are worth it alone. You'll enjoy this one. (9-22-02)
B000001FS3|3.0|Would someone please care to explain to me what is just so great about this album, because I for one don't really see it and think this has got to be one of if not the most overrated album of all time. Now in all honesty I do absolutely love Where the Streets Have No Name and I found out some other amazing gems on here as well, but overall I was disappointed in it. I have always enjoyed U2's music and I loved their Best of 1980-1990 collection, but afterwards when I started buying their separate albums I found that U2 is not much more than your average run-of-the-mill singles bands. There are some albums out there where all of the songs are great not just the singles, but sadly there are other albums where the singles are just about the only good songs on the album, and I'm sorry to say but the U2 albums I've gotten so far fall into the latter category. In all fairness I only own All That You Can't Leave Behind, The Unforgettable Fire, and this one, but frankly I was somewhat disappointed in all of them and this has made me think long and hard if I ever want to complete my U2 collection. I'm not saying that this or the other albums are bad--in fact I think Walk On, Where the Streets Have No Name and Bad are arguably the greatest songs U2 ever made and can compete with being some of the greatest songs ever written--but I'd have to say that all things considering these albums just aren't up to snuff. I'd hate to say this, but I think U2 is another very overrated band who don't have much other decent songs with the exceptions of their hits. I just don't understand what all the fuss is about this band and particularly this specific album. It definitely doesn't belong to be in the list of the top 10 albums of all time. Highly overrated indeed.
B000053V7Q|2.0|If you have the original version of this great film, in whatever format, hold on to it!  This is not the original movie!!  I love Elvis and I love \\"Elvis: That's The Way It Is.\\"  But this new release is such a butcher job, depressing me so much that afterwards I had to watch the original to set things straight.  Everything that made this film such a unique in-depth look is gone.  A look not only at the King, but the whole Vegas scene at that time.  Keep in mind that Elvis' return to live performance was as much anticipated by the celebrity world as it was for average fans.  The feel of that is lost in this edited version.  Sure, raw footage of Presley is always great to watch, but that's all there is here.  Instead of a thorough, complete documentation of an event, we're left with nothing more than a bunch of videos strung together with no apparent relationship.  And that's okay, but it's not what I bought this DVD for.  Yes, many songs are gone, but the interviews were important, too.  That's what makes a documentary, folks!  I missed seeing all the preparation at the International Hotel leading up to the moment, and prepare they did.  The souvenirs they sold for pocket change are now worth hundreds, if not priceless.  I like that history aspect, cut out of the new release, of course.  One scene I was particularly disappointed to see cut was the beautiful montage of casino lights on the Vegas strip, underscored by a smooth bluesy rendition of \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\"  What a sin!  \\"Elvis: That's The Way It Is\\" was done right the first time, in 1970, and it still works for me.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it!!!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I just do not understand all of this bitching and moaning that's been going on and on about this marvelous piece of cinematic magic. So what if they touched-up this movie? E.T. is wonderful anyway, changes or not, and I think the changes make it be that much better. I had never before seen it in the theatre until this year and I was totally blown away. It was like I was watching it for the first time. I heard and noticed things I hadn't before. Plus since this is the computer age with loads of wonderful technology at our fingertips, I say why not touch it up and make it better? Sure a sense of nostalgia comes in when you see the original version, but I think all old movies should get this sort of treatment. It just enhances them better than ever. E.T. is and always will be a classic forevermore, no matter what!
B000067CQK|5.0|This disc is simply the best sounding version of Ziggy out there.The packaging is superb and having the bonus songs on a seperate cd is SO much better than cluttering up one. The description of the disc outright states how it comes so everyone who complained about the packaging can only blame themselves for buying it. The person who complained that he only played 1 song from this on his latest tour should remember that he has 35 yrs of music to choose from, and only a little over on hour to play, and that this was not his only album. This is my 4th version of Ziggy on cd and will be the only one played until something better comes along. Thanks for all the great music David.<br />p.s. Dont forget ti buy Heathen
B000068FXR|4.0|Their most under-rated and overlooked album, it's also my personal favourite. Brighter than Crime of the Century, yet free of the over-ripe sentiments of Breakfast in America, this album strikes just the right balance between introspection and listen-ability.<br />None of the songs on this album ever became radio hits, but this is highly misleading and more than a little unfair to the quality of the songs. There is some great music on this album; Sister Moonshine, Lady, The Meaning, Two of Us. However, my favourite has to be Soapbox Opera, a moody and atmospheric piece that effectively conveys our modern society's sense of spiritual drift.<br />This is not a deeply philosophical work, and those looking for \\"meaning\\", \\"depth\\" or \\"originality\\" should look elsewhere. Tramp preferred peasant food to haute cuisine, a preference that opened them up to charges of superficiality throughout their career. Again, unfair, considering that their stated purpose was to bridge the gap between the excesses of progressive rock and the shallowness of mainstream pop.<br />A consistent and rewarding album, this is one of the two Tramp albums (along with Quietest Moments) that have stood the test of time. Whereas, Century seems dated and Breakfast has always been overrated, Crisis improves with age. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that none of the songs were played to death on radio; an ironic silver lining to a greater cloud of injustice.<br />A word needs to be said about the recording. This digital remastering is superb and renders obsolete the prior CD recording. If you have the first CD, the improved clarity and energy in the second remastering makes it a worthwhile purchase. If this is your first Crisis purchase, make sure you are getting the right CD and aren't wasting your money on a lousy earlier effort.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Tom Waits. How does one properly give Tom Waits the credit that is due to him. I love this album, and I'm only currently on my 6th time listening to it.  Given that it's definately not as good as Rain Dogs or Small Change, it is still an amazing body of work. The songwriting is so amazingly vivd and haunting, it amazes me that one person could write this wonderfully.  No other artist that I listen to can move me as much as Tom Waits. The sincerity to his voice and passion in every note the man sings, god I cant even express it.
B000068FY0|4.0|A variant of progressive rock that some have called sophisto-rock, Supertramp never really broke any new ground - beginning with Century, they just produced a consummate trio of albums confirming that meaningful music doesn't have to be obscure and that listen-ability is preferable to the pursuit of originality for the mere sake of originality.<br />Century wasn't their first album. I still have the vinyl versions of their eponymous debut and their follow-up \\"Indelibly Stamped\\". However, Century was the first album to bridge prog for the masses, mixing the layered instrumental harmonics of the prog genre with the hooks and melodies of mainstream rock. The result is an album that progerati will often denigrate as a \\"sellout\\", \\"prog lite\\" or \\"dumbed down\\". Ignore such arrogant snobbery. Century is an inspired album with some truly captivating songs. It starts with one of the most sublime of album intros: \\"School\\" is not only a brooding musical statement with a memorable instrumental midsection, but provides an intelligent counterpoint to that other prog anthem, Floyd's \\"The Wall\\", making a more thoughtful protest than the trite, \\"...We don't need no education\\". Throughout their careers, Supertramp railed against the creativity-stifling straightjacket of rote schooling, but there is a stark clarity and clean simplicity to \\"School\\" that sets it above their later efforts in tracks like the \\"Logical Song\\".<br />The remaining songs are just as well crafted. Hide In Your Shell, Dreamer and Rudy decry the isolation that pervades modern culture. Bloody Well Right attacks bloody mindedness. Crime of the Century, the titled album track, rounds things off with a biting indictment: \\"Who are these men of lust, greed and glory?/Rip off the masks and let's see./But that's not right - oh no, what's the story?/There's you and there's me/That can't be right...\\"<br />Want to make the world a better place? Start with the face you see in the mirror.<br />Any band willing to confront hypocrisy this frankly is worth listening to. And when the message is combined with such fine musicianship, the result is an album of major stature.<br />A final note on the quality of the recording: make sure you purchase this digitally remastered version. I own both the older A&M disk and the newer one and the difference is like night and day. The murky sludgy sound of the prior effort was a terrible insult to the vinyl original, but this new one sounds, if anything, better than its progenitor.
0790729628|5.0|BladeRunner is a great movie, Great Atmosphere, great Audio, Great Visuals... But I would say that the &quot;Orginal&quot; version was better... The big diff. is that they removed the voiceover, which gave alot to the movie. Heard some time ago that Ridly was planing on releasing a DVD with both version and a Special Ed. Version...
B000068FXX|4.0|This was the album that had Tramp detractors switching from charges of \\"lightweight\\" to accusations of \\"pomposity\\". While such criticisms contain a grain of validity, they do make you wonder about the misplaced expectations of such critics. This is Supertramp, not Bach. The group was striving for a crossover sound that blended the often inaccessible complexity of art rock with the often too accessible superficiality of pop. Such fusions are often half man, half horse, and it takes remarkable talent to pull off an album that is unique and whole in its own right, while managing to remain both accessible and significant.<br />There is nothing groundbreaking about the Tramp sound. Its blend of synthesizer and guitar was similar to that of any other Prog group, from Yes to King Crimson. Hodgson's falsetto vocals were no different from those of any other band, and the use of background sounds from Big Ben to Churchill was a cautious imitation of Floyd. Yet their particular mix worked because their choice of subject matter, hooks and talent were blended to produce a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Quietest Moments scales from bright optimism to melancholic reflection without seeming either flighty or ponderous. Tramp's achievement was neither great insight nor great innovation, but wholeness and balance.<br />Those looking for depth, novelty or intellectual challenge are advised to look elsewhere. Supertramp produced workmanlike music that bespoke fine craftsmanship more than ostentatious spectacle. They weren't poets, crusaders or geniuses and never pretended to be. Their music was designed to speak to we common folk, perhaps taking us on a higher intellectual journey than the pop of the day, but not so far, nor so fast, that we lost sight of the ground.<br />The charge of pomposity probably stems from the inclusion of the Fools Overture track on this album. To some, it sounds vague and its lyrics obscure, but it is my personal favourite among all of their works.Quietest Moments is not for all tastes, but if you like crossover prog rock and are not too full of yourself, you will enjoy this album.
6304983778|5.0|As a child this movie made me believe in Santa all over again. It is truly magical! The legend of Santa Clause presented in this movie will always be the &quot;real&quot; Santa to me!
B000002KKS|5.0|This was a good start for Sabbath with Dio on vocals after departing Ozzy as last 2 records with Ozzy were not good. Dio made the band alive again after this record, great songs including Heaven & Hell, Die young & Neon Nights, if you are a Sabbath fan you should own this CD, I also rate the recording 5/5 compare to other Sabbath recordings (as good as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath)
014028009X|5.0|Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the funniest, most enjoyable novels that I've read.  I don't often break out in audible bursts of laughter when reading, but I couldn't help doing so with this one.  It is a very modern story, and it is, at least to my mind, in many ways on par with the brilliantly-directed, hilarious British comedy-drama television series Cold Feet.  The story and characters are very different, of course, but it has the same flavour and feel (for lack of a better description!); suffice it to say, if you are familiar with and enjoy Cold Feet, you'll enjoy this novel.<br />Bridget is a chain-smoking, alcohol-swilling, overly weight-conscious, man-obsessing, 30-something &quot;singleton&quot; with an addiction to self-help books and chocolate.  She is also one of the most delightfully entertaining characters one could hope to come across.   Some of the situations she gets herself into--well, they are just hilarious.  But the book is more than just a comedy of errors, misunderstandings and mishaps.  It is also highly insightful--both with respect to men and women (and I should imagine a lot of men would find this book enjoyable too).  So far as women are concerned, however, I can't imagine anyone who could not find something to relate to in Bridget's character (whether or not one smokes, drinks, etc.).  So long as one has spent at least a portion of one's life single, one will be able to relate.  Indeed, it is that bond, that ability to relate that makes Bridget both so hilarious and so endearing, for ultimately it is ourselves, our own foibles, insecurities and obsessive moments that we are chuckling at.  <br />The novel covers one full year in Bridget's life, with one month per chapter.  It is written in diary format, which is a wonderful way of structuring the novel as it allows for a lot of humour to come through in ways that would be impossible otherwise.  Never fear, though, for the diary entries are more for the reader's benefit and enjoyment rather than being that which one would actually write, with the result that chunks of it read like a novel complete with &quot;recollected&quot; dialogue.<br />Although a familiarity with Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is not necessary for the enjoyment of this novel, a familiarity with that work (particularly with the BBC/A&amp;E dramatisation featuring Colin Firth) does enhance one's appreciation and enjoyment of this novel as it is, in fact, a very loose (and modern) parody of Pride and Prejudice (with actual reference being made to that particular dramatisation).<br />In short, I enjoyed this novel (and its sequel Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason) immensely, and I recommend both novels extremely highly.  I particulary recommend them to those who enjoy British humour at its absolute best, for the humour here is quintessentially British.  It simply does not, at least in my opinion, get any better than Bridget Jones!
B000002KMY|5.0|I really loved Heaven & Hell when it was released, but after I heard Mob Rules, I hoped that recording was as good as H&H but because the songs are fantastic makes you love the album, each song is better than the other, all are good & the most remarkable song Falling off the egde of the world is my all time fav. song. Buy this CD right now.
B00004U28G|5.0|Yes, this is a very funny film, All through the film is entertaining and my words &quot;Buy it you will like it&quot; there is also a gag reel at the credits.
B000002KET|5.0|Can't say much, best of the best, if there was a 6th star I would have chosen it, I highly recommend this album. Great job Sabbath.
0312979479|5.0|This is, by far, hands down Agatha Christie's best novel. I'm a sucker for a group of people stranded somewhere (House, island, wherever) when suddenly a murder occurs.<br />Christie gives some brilliant and insightful background information to her shady suspects and unravels the story as carefully as a ball of yarn.<br />A fantastic read that gets better every time I pick it up. Highly HIGHLY reccommended.
B00006F7IM|5.0|Baseball Movie???  Ok, so maybe thats the sport involved, but this is a blatant sports comedy.  I sleep through baseball games on a regular basis, but this is by far my favorite sports movie ever....... period.  This is a comedy that takes place in sports and not vice versa.  Take the time to watch it and you will see why this is rapidly becoming one of the classics of our time.  This one will not be reconstructed or duplicated.  Ok, so I am not saying to watch it with your 8 year old son, but this may be one of the few \\"classics\\" that your 15 year old son will agree with you on.  Take a chance and enjoy the show.
