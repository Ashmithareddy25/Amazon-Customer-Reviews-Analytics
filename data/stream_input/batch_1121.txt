B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I really liked this movie and it killed me to see these unjustified 1 star reviews. I won't give it 5 for a good reason but it is definately worth the watch.<br />We have 3 stories that give the impression they are not tied together. At the beggining, they aren't. Later in the movie they are and some people simply wanted it to happen faster than Mr. Eastwood wanted. Have a little patience and you will like this movie.<br />This is why I gave it 4 vs 5 stars. Although slow paced, it just seemed like the ending wasn't the ending. You will have to watch to understand. It takes so long to finally \\"close things out\\" that you are like, \\"That's the end?\\". Maybe a part 2 later?<br />But, the 3 stories, if you take the time to enjoy them and pay attention to the situations, the foreshadowing of what is to come pays off.<br />Damon (George): Is a psychic that can commune with the dead. He is very good at it but he is drained. Think of it from his perspective. If you had to give news to people that made them cry for so long, after a while, you won't want to do it anymore. They did NOT sensationalize this. He doesn't see evil or bad people. He is giving that news \\"move on with your life\\" or \\"I'm sorry I made your life so hard\\". Although they can be happy tears, they are heart breaking just as much.<br />Marie: French woman on vacation has a near death experience being drawn under water in the tsunami back in 2004.

1591843790|4.0|I love the smell of a new book. I also love the pull of a new idea.    Lucky for me then, that Enchantment has both.    Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions is the tenth and latest book by tech legend Guy Kawasaki - former chief evangelist for Apple, co-founder of Alltop.com and founding partner of Garage Technology Ventures.    Enchantment - the concept - is the process of delighting people with a product, service, organization, or idea. The outcome of enchantment is voluntary and long-lasting support that is mutually beneficial. Kawasaki says his first enchanting moment was meeting his wife. His second enchanting moment was seeing the Macintosh, which convinced him of its ability to make people more creative and productive than they'd ever dreamed.    Enchantment - the book - distills Kawasaki's experiences as an evangelist into valuable lessons and examples that you can put into practice in your own career.    Enchantment - the concept - can happen anywhere, Kawasaki writes, whether you're trying to win over a skeptic, attract new followers to your cause, or even change the world.    At 224 pages (including a quiz), Enchantment - the book - is a short enough to consume over a weekend, even for a slow reader such as myself.  It's divided into 12 chapters including \\"Why Enchantment?,\\" \\"How to Make Enchantment Endure,\\" and \\"How to Enchant Your Boss.\\" Each chapter is further divided into several sub-topics that make for remarkably easy navigation and easily digestible bits of content. Kawaski writes in a breezy and personable style whose simplicity belies the hard-won lessons underneath. And it comes with one word of caution: It can take weeks or months for enchantment to occur, Kawasaki writes, so prepare for a marathon, not a sprint.    Enchantment - the concept - rests on two fundamentals that everyone must master: likability and trustworthiness. Kawasaki devotes an entire chapter to each and in each includes specific activities to help youalong. For example:        * To be more likable, perfect your handshake, use simple words, project your passions, and swear - but only when your audience supports you.               * To be more trustworthy, it's important to \\"Bake a bigger pie.\\" Kawasaki divides the world into \\"eaters\\" and \\"bakers.\\" Eaters think that if you win, they lose. Bakers think everyone can win with a bigger pie. Twitter, for example, made a bigger pie because anyone can provide news and updates. Google made a bigger pie by taking advertising out of the hands of big ad agencies and giving it to small businesses.     I found chapter four - \\"How to Prepare\\" - particularly useful for its discussion of a \\"Premortem.\\" It's an idea Kawasaki borrows from Gary Klein, author of Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions. Companies rarely conduct post-mortems on a failed product because there's usually no money or people left to investigate. Premortems, on the other hand, are useful because they can help you prevent failure rather than explain it.  To conduct a Premortem, Kawasaki suggests assembling your team and asks everyone to assume the project failed. Your task is to find out why the failures occurred and come up with ways to prevent them from happening.    Other insights:    Chapter 5 - \\"How to Launch\\" - is useful for its discussion of storytelling. Enchantment runs on inspiration, not information, Kawasaki writes. And the ones with the best stories are the ones who win. When you're pitching your product, find the narrative that best suits your goals: Will the world be a better place because of your project? Is this David vs. Goliath, or perhaps a Profile in Courage? Structure your proposal with a beginning, middle and end and you'll increase your chances of success.    The chapter is also useful for its suggestions for demos: if you're trying to wean people off their spreadsheets, make sure your TM1 demo shows these attributes:        * Easy - people must be able to try it without much training, guidance, expertise or time.               * Immediate - When people are interested, let them try it out right away. Don't waste their time with forms and approvals to get started.               * Inexpensive - Ideally, the only cost should be time.               * Concrete - at the end of a trial, people should observe concrete changes in the way they work. (think back to the importance of stories).               * Reversible - if people try your cause and still don't like it, they should be able to reverse their decision.      There's lots more I could cite, but I'll stop here for now. With any luck I've already enchanted you. If I haven't, you can always check out Guy's site.

0446567337|5.0|I actually saw the film before I read the book (I usually do it the other way around), but I have to say that I enjoyed the book more. While the movie was excellent, the book provides much more. However, there slight differences between the two. I read the entire book in just 3 days; I couldn't put it down. This is a beautiful love story with a realistic plot and great characters. I feel like I can relate to a lot of this story in my own personal life, so I think that helped me fall in love with this story. This book is definitely a tear jerker, but it is one that I will be rereading.    This is the first book I've ever read by Sparks, and after reading \\"Dear John,\\" I want to read more of his stories.

It was cool to just turn the music loud and enjoy it again, without it being a tougher album or group to find. You should know, there are two versions. One with NYC Cops, and one without it, because they pulled the song for a while after 9/11. An overraction, since the song is not an attack on cops or NYC. But it happened. I think it's on each one now. Either way, check the track listing or whatever. Great record, great band. And they keep making good music with each new record.

030745455X|4.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire is the second of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, and a worthy sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I'm still not sure these are the best books I've read, or even nearly the best, but they're certainly enjoyable. The characters become more real in this book, or at least more complex. I enjoyed seeing Lisbeth building her new life, and the old hurts breaking through to break it down were convincingly revealed with a nice sense of timing. The action, when it happened, was fast and furious. Dark scenery and busy streets were powerfully evocative. And the mystery unfolds with twists and turns but a convincing feeling of connection, and satisfying conclusion. There are questions still unanswered, and disaster still only partially averted, so I'll certainly have to read book three.<br /><br />The book is long, of course, at 630 pages. And long descriptions remind me of books I read as a child, making me think how movies, and books, today tend to move so much faster and leave so much more for the reader, or watcher, to work out. The author's commentary on events and politics is fascinating--refreshing since he's not American and America's preoccupations aren't the center of his universe--but they slow the story, making me skip bits and cut back, trying not to be such a lazy reader. The journalistic and investigative processes are described in detail, and really did draw me in at last. And the mix of characters, helpful, evil and in-between is very neatly drawn.<br />Lisbeth is certainly a strong female lead and I'm really quite eager for more--looking forward to the next.<br /><br />Disclosure: I did it again. We watched the movie first. I like the book better.
1439148953|4.0|Out of the three Toibin novels I've read, \\"Brooklyn\\" was my least favourite. (The other two are \\"The Blackwater Lightship\\" and \\"The Master.\\") However, that's like being the worst Discworld novel; it's still far better than most of what's out there. The language is purposely much simpler than the other two novels, and the plot always moves forward, having no flashbacks at all.    The plot begins in Ireland and moves very slowly. The audience sees the monotony of the day-to-day lives of the characters. After Eilis gets settled in Brooklyn, time condenses and a whole summer is covered in a page. Upon her return to Ireland, the time expands once more. Eilis' two weeks in Enniscorthy feel like a couple of months. It's a neat narrative trick.    Eilis as a character is very interesting. Throughout the entire novel, she only makes one decision for herself. Everything else, including moving to the States and getting married, is a decision someone else made for that she's gone along with. Even if she doesn't like the decision, she pretends to be happy with it as shown when Eilis smiles through her fear of moving to the States so her family will remember her smiling. Tony, her love interest, is a one-dimensional character, but he's meant to be. There are hidden depths, but Eilis doesn't care about them. Their whole relationship can be summed up in one scene: Tony full of emotion and happy, sharing everything with Eilis, and her standing apart from him, comforted by the knowledge that he will never know her as she knows him.    However, if the reader doesn't like Eilis, they're not going to enjoy the book. She is the focus of the story and what drives it along. If one doesn't enjoy her voice, the novel could become annoying fairly quickly.    There's an unexpected twist that seems very convenient and just an excuse to get Eilis back to Enniscorthy. However, after talking to the author, it became a bit more believable. Also, that part of the story was based on something that truly happened. Reality can be very unrealistic at times.    I think Brooklyn is ideal for fans of coming of age stories as well as immigrant stories.

This \\"could\\" have been a great tribute to Medal of Honor recipient Lt. Murphy and his team. The author was far more concerned with blathering on about how smart he thinks he is and how all liberals are \\"bad people\\". I deleted this off my Kindle after getting sick of reading his political views. Apparently, nobody ever taught the author that a \\"liberal\\" is someone who is willing to consider all sides of an issue before reaching a conclusion. I am a Navy Combat Veteran AND a liberal.

B001Q9E9F6|4.0|\\"The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More\\", written by Chris Anderson, explains a relatively new shift in business strategy and consumers' purchasing habits. Technology, especially the internet, really facilitates this trend. Businesses have typically followed a model in which a company sells a lot of a small collection of products. Chris illustrates this using the entertainment industry, including music, movies and books. Historically, it wouldn't be profitable for physical retailers to carry a very wide selection of things and in turn most consumers, only faced with a few of the most popular choices, wouldn't really have many choices at all. It created a \\"hits\\" environment where the most popular products accounted for a huge percentage of revenue and business.           The internet and the availability of online retailers with limitless, virtual shelf space allows for businesses to sell a much broader plethora of books, songs and movies. And interestingly enough, consumers have responded by moving away from hits to whatever their hearts desired. It created a longer tail in the probability distribution by placing more individual consumers at the end of the curve. Businesses, like Amazon and Netflix, now recognize that the less popular products actually make up a more significant portion of revenue. The digitalization of books, movies and music has also reduced production costs and makes it even easier to sell these items online at even cheaper prices.           It's an interesting read that introduces a relatively new and clearly successful business model. Like a lot of similar books in this genre, it can seem lengthy and repetitive at times but overall it shows some great points. It provides insight and information on a couple of today's popular and successful companies that are benefiting from this trend towards the long tail.           I would recommend this book as a read for people interested in business, especially those in the retail entertainment industry. Business students would also find the book beneficial as technology allows for more companies and industries to move in this direction. Before reading the book, you can also check out his article from Wired magazine, which introduces the Long Tail theory and provides a good foundation for the book.

B001Q9E9F6|4.0|In the words of the author, \\"The era of one-size-fits-all is ending, and in its place is something new, a market of multitudes. This book is about that market.\\"  In the book The Long Tail, Chris Andersen unveils to the reader the profitable market prospects in what he calls the \\"Long Tail.\\"    The author puts across three forces that have given rise to the Long Tail or in other words the forces that have given rise to the market of niches. First is the democratization of the tools of production, \\"...Give enough people the capacity to create, and inevitable gems will emerge. The result is that the available universe of content is now growing faster than ever\\" (pg. 54). The second force is reduced costs of consumption by democratizing distribution; \\"The Internet simply makes it cheaper to reach more people, effectively increasing the liquidity of the market in the Tail. That, in turn, translates to more consumption, effectively raising the sales line...\\" (pg. 55). The third, and last force is connecting supply and demand, \\"...introducing consumers to these new and newly available goods and driving demand down the Tail\\" (pg. 55).     The book is almost like an economic research project where the author has mainly drawn upon examples and cases from the media industry (as well as five examples from manufacturing to services), to explain his theories in the evolving market and his three forces are consistently reflected throughout his examples. The author's main pitch is that there is an equally high profit for a marketer to invest in catering to the previously ignored niches, as compared to marketing hits to the mass market. This idea is more conceivable with many retailers moving to cyberspace where the \\"...economics of inventory and distribution are far friendlier to niche products\\" (pg. 205) with customer orders being pulled in from third parties right when the order is placed. So why not tap on the profitable prospects these markets have to offer? That is the question the author consistently implies throughout his book by putting forward arguments and cases for embracing the Long Tail.    \\"One of the consequences of living in a hit-driven culture is that we tend to assume that hits are a far bigger share of the market than they really are. Instead, they are the rare exception\\" (pg. 118). This is the theory the author stresses throughout the book supporting it with several case studies from Rhapsody to Borders and Amazon.com among others. Interestingly he presents cases where brick and mortar stores sell a higher percentage of the \\"hits\\" because of the limited choice available, while the same retailer online sells a much smaller percentage of the \\"hits\\" with a much higher margin of their profits coming from the \\"non-hits,\\" the niches, and this is all because we as consumers have a wider variety and choice online. \\"In books, Barnes & Noble found that the bottom 1.2 million tittles represent just 1.7 percent of its in-store sales, but a full 10 percent of its online (bn.com) sales\\" (pg. 130).     The main key though for the niches, as the author puts it, is in the filters that automatically sieve out the \\"noise\\" and give us what we want. Today, the ability of consumers to share reviews and perspectives on different products have given rise to post-filters and this sometimes allows \\"non-hits\\" to possibly become \\"hits\\" through the reviews of other customer and word of mouth. This hidden power in the hands of a few that the author presents is a similar concept presented by Malcolm Gladwell in his book \\"The Tipping Point.\\"    The author also brings to the spotlight Pareto's 80/20 principle by first explaining common misconceptions people often have with their understanding of the rule and then posing a very simple question, \\"Even if 20 percent of the products account for 80 percent of the revenue, that's no reason not to carry the other 80 percent of the products\\" (pg. 131). This is what Amazon.com does and this statement is of greatest importance to businesses today especially given our ever growing shift to online e-tailing where inventory costs and shelf space no longer limit the business to only carry hits for the mass market.     After the author presents his concept of the Long Tail by supporting it through several recent examples, case studies and research, he then goes on to answer questions about the Long Tail that the reader, who could be a potential or current marketer might have. Such questions revolve around pricing issues, demand, timing and the microstructure within the Long Tail.     The author does not refute the fact that hits are important. Instead he states that all hits eventually end up in the Long Tail and so it only follows that the market ought to exploit the profit potentials the \\"head\\" and \\"tail\\" have to offer collectively, \\"If you have the products at the Head, you find that very quickly your customers want more and you can't offer it. If you just have the products at the Tail, you find that customers have no idea where to start. They're unable to get traction in the marketplace because everything you're offering is unfamiliar to them. The importance of offering the stuff at both the Head and the Tail is that you can start in the world that customers already know: familiar products that tap into and define a space\\" (pg. 148).    The book is about our evolving culture where we are now embracing mass marketed hits as well as niches, \\"The shift from generic to the specific doesn't mean the end of the existing power structure or a wholesale shift to an all-amateur, laptop culture. Instead, it's simply a rebalancing of the equation, an evolution from an \\"Or\\" era of hits or niches to an \\"And\\" era\\" (pg. 182) ...\\"Most things fail the hit test, yet somehow they continue to exist. Why? Because the economics of blockbusters is not the only economics that works\\" (pg. 167)    The author also brings to the forefront arguments against the biggest advantage online stores have to offer, namely arguments against having a lot of choice as it is often thought that it confuses customers and deters them from making a purchase. However, though this might be true in regular retail stores where the label on the product is the only source of information for the customer to choose a new, unfamiliar product, online it is a different story with the ability to \\"Google\\" products, read previous customer reviews etc. In addition, the author also states \\"The alternative to letting people choose is choosing for them. The lessons of a century of retail science are that this is not what most consumers want\\" (pg. 171).    Towards the end of the book, the author explains nine rules for creating a thriving Long Tail business by reflecting back on the findings from the research and case studies previously presented. The rules form a skeleton on which an enterprise can build on to formulate its own strategy to gain the advantages the Long Tail has to offer.     The book finally ends with an exciting prediction by the author of the future of retailing. This prediction though far reaching, does not seem inconceivable when you think of the rate at which technology (of cellular phone for example) has grown, which has been far beyond what we might have expected a decade ago.     The prediction is based on the development of a 3D printing technology called Solidscape T66. \\"As 3D printing technology extends beyond brittle plastic to a range of materials, from metals to synthetic fabrics, we may be able to self-manufacture spare parts, toys, perhaps even entire machines that we've downloaded from some virtual retailer....Like everything else, tomorrow's Long Tail of Things will be aggregated, efficiently stored as bits, and then delivered to your home via optical fiber...In the worlds of entertainment and information, we've already lost the capacity constraints of shelf space and channels, along with their one-size-fits-all demands. Soon we may lose the capacity of constraintsof mass production, too\\" (pg. 226).    Overall, I thought this book was a good read with interesting, well-supported theories explaining the evolution of retailing happening right before our eyes.
0446678430|1.0|This is the third book I have read in the Rich Dad series and by far the worst.  It is nothing but 335 pages of \\"blah, blah, blah\\" that never has any useful information in it.  I started to read a chapter thinking, \\"Hey I'm going to learn something cool in this chapter\\" and then by the end I realized that the author mostly repeats himself about three times and never puts any content in the chapters.  I'm pretty sure the only reason he kept writing the books was because they were an \\"asset\\" on his balance sheet.  It was also kind of annoying how the author constantly would say \\"I'm rich and you're not!\\"  Overall, terrible book; don't waste your time.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I found the first book of the series to be extremely clever. I LOL'd a few times, which is a bit unusual for a Fantasy novel. I found the second book to be just as clever. You get so sucked in to the narrative that when you are pulled to the present time in the book you forget that you are within a story within a story.    Love, love, love this series. This and TNOTW are the best books I have read in a long while. I was actually shocked by some reviews that gave it one star. In my opinion, the plot does move forward in book two. We are given a few more pieces of the puzzle, there is action and adventure, and we learn a bit more about the characters. Instead of having the author tell us everything, we are given the opportunity to try and form our own hypothesis about what is happening.    I'm just sad that there will be another long wait until book three comes out...

1401302378|5.0|\\"The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More\\" by Chris Anderson is an extremely thought-provoking work which deals mostly with the concept of shifts in the consumer demand curve as well as the emergence and importance of niche markets.  Anderson first explains how contrary to the traditional 80/20 rule, in which 20% of products constitute 80% of business, the internet introduces a 98% rule.  This rule decrees that 98% of the products on the internet are chosen, and that 90% of the products that are only available online account for about half of all online sales revenue.  Due to the emergence of the internet as well as improvements that have been made in other arenas, Anderson stresses that there are now many more niche products than \\"hits.\\"  Anderson believes that these niche markets are extremely profitable and uses Amazon.com as an example.  While Barnes & Noble bookstores are only able to carry about the top 100,000 titles, Amazon.com is able to stock around 3.7 million, a large competitive advantage due to the fact that about 25% of their book sales is constituted by titles outside of the top 100,000.  These niches are becoming increasingly valuable and increasingly accessible due to all of the new search options as well as online product recommendations.      Anderson believes that this will all contribute to the flattening of the demand curve, with niche products gradually becoming more popular, and \\"hits\\" declining in popularity.  The internet will prove to be a key component in capturing the potential value in the \\"long tail\\" of the demand curve.  I think a great point brought about by Anderson is his belief that Walmart is \\"elitist\\" due to the fact that they only have enough space to stock the most popular of products.  This is a different view than most have of Walmart as they possess a reputation for having a huge selection of all types of products, but upon further review this seems to be accurate as Walmart does not actually havemany niche-type products.  I found the points made in \\"The Long Tail\\" to be very interesting and well-supported and I definitely agree with the majority of Anderson's theories.

Thank you for giving fans like Aja and I your wonderful music and your awesome dance moves. May you, your music, and your dance moves live forever.

006016848X|4.0|Dr. Gray's classic metaphor for male/female relationships is informative, well written, and creative...for the right crowd.  There is no author who can speak to every person who might be interested in his subject matter, and Dr. Gray makes no effort to try.  This is a metaphor, a story, not a technical readout of the human brain and how it responds, chemical by chemical, to each situation in a relationship.  Like most metaphors, it's a simplified version of the truth.  It's designed to get you thinking about your relationships in a new context, so you can understand and work together better.  I've found the information useful not only in romantic relationships, but professional and personal relationships as well.<br /><br />I do not believe the author meant any kind of insult to either of the sexes, especially as the book is written without partiality to either gender.  He does point out a few quirks on both sides, but I felt he treated each gender uniquely and fairly, (albeit with a little tongue in cheek).  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys learning through stories and metaphors.<br /><br />--Matt, [...]
B0041KKYDI|4.0|127 hours is a greuling one on one face off with the overbearing willingness to survive at its most extreme. While this isn't the first film to depict the extremes humans are willing to go thought to survive, it is to date one of my current favorites.     I have a new found respect and admiration for James Franco.I once believed he was just another actor out there relying on \\"his looks\\" and going for the easy,\\"BIG MONEY\\" Hollywood rolls, but 127 Hours has swayed me the other way. Not only does it prove that he is serious about acting, but that he is a versitile actor able to take on serious dramatic rolls as well as action and comedy.I hope that in the nearing future he is able to expand more and get some great parts in future films    Anyway, enough \\"groveling\\" and down to business. If you aren't familiar with 127 Hours,I'll break it down for you as breifly and to the point as possible. As stated, it is essentially a \\"survial\\" film, but much more than that..you get to experience the days as they  tick by the hour,minute and second of one man's experience and near impossible decision. Aron Ralston is an experienced climber, and on his weekend away at the Canyon Lands National Park, he finds himself between a rock and a hard place...litterally.     As hard as he tries, there is no way he can remove or lift a half ton boulder pining his hand at the bottm of a crevice. Faced with dehydration and no possibility of being found, Arron comes to terms with himself and his awkward position.     He finaly does what most of us probably wouldn't do, and that's amputating his own arm to free himself with a very small,dull knife that has been widdled down next to nothing from daily chipping at the rock. It isn't as gorey as you might envision(I've seen allot worse up close and personal and in other films),but you do really get to see how excruciating it is.    I surprisingly liked this film, and it just wasn't the story.The story itelf at first glance isn't that captivating, butJames Franco's performance is. Not many actors  can hold your attention in such a role where they are more or less the center of attention throughout the entire film and Franco does so surprisingly well. He does so effortlessly and at one point in the film, with humor. As horrible as his situation was, I was laughing and giggling uncontrollably because it was done in such a real way.Well worth watching and owning, 127 hours  keeps you front and center  from the time it begins.
0446364495|5.0|Robert James Waller has a unique ability to use words in such a simple yet profound way. I admire his talent. In this book he creates beautiful complex characters in a short book without cheating anyone or anything.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This is a well conceived zombie apocalypse tv series based of a popular comic.  The characters, for the most part, act in a believable manner, though there are some instances of over dramatics that irked me in places (Without going into spoilers, Andrea's actions at the RV in the aftermath of the camp attack come to mind as the most memorable example of this.)<br /><br />The first five episodes were strong and very character driven.  I particularly liked how the characters (even the minor ones) were testing the boundaries of what is now acceptable in a post apocalyptic world of people making choices.<br /><br />The main reason I didn't give this one five stars is the sixth episode.  To put it bluntly, it was a stinker and I didn't care for that episode at all.  I don't really think I can adequately describe what I didn't like about TS-19 without spoilers except to say that it was overly predictable and riddled with cliches.<br /><br />That episode aside, I am very interested to catch the new season when it comes out in the fall.  It's dark and edgy.<br /><br />I haven't had a chance to look at most of the extras, but they seem like standard fare (behind the scenes of each episode, commentary from the creator, and so on).

B003ITZBVI|5.0|When I first saw this come up on my suggestions I was a little skittish.  Most Batman themed cartoons/animations I'd seen except for one have stunk, but this one?  It blew me away.  The first thing to catch my eye was a favorite actor of mine in it, then the cast as their names went by before the title appeared; I had recognized almost all of the actors and actresses, all of them phenomenal no matter what challenge they had had before them.  The second thing that caught my eye was the animation itself.  Incredible.  I haven't seen animations this well done since the early 90s when I was little and Disney still had (although they have it back now) a cartoonist department.  Throughout this entire movie I couldn't get over how well done the drawings were.  Another plus for me was the editing, cinematography, and sound!  All  amazing in their own respects but as a whole did well together and really brought this cartoon to life.    I got sucked into the movie and really felt for each and every one of the characters.  The plot kept me interested from the moment the first image came onto the screen and has had me watching it everyday since.  And as I watch the movie again and again I have only seen it get better and better.  It continues to blow me away.    All in all, a must have for any movie fan, no matter if you like Batman or not.

0756404738|1.0|The first book created a lot of hype for \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" but Rothfuss has failed to deliver.  I expected a hook or climax in this book, however Rothfuss refused to move forward with his character and plot (If there is one).  The same questions presented from Day 1 exist after Day 2, and new questions aren't asked.  When comparing page 1 Kvothe to page 1000 Kvothe, the only difference you find is that page 1000 Kvothe carries a large purse of wasted time.<br /><br /> Additionally, the lack of quality in this story is shown through the excess of sex and coincidence (in agreement).  I have now begun renouncing recommendations I have made based on the first book, and no longer look forward to the following book(s?).  It's quite a shame; after reading you wonder two things: \\"Why did I read this?\\" and \\"How does he expect to conclude everything asked by book 1 and 2 with book 3?\\"
B00457X7XQ|5.0|A thought provoking and thrilling page turner.   I couldn't put it down.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I heard this group on the Grammy Awards and had to find out more about them the next day.  I immediately ordered this cd and I am knocked out by how good they are. How nice in this day when most singers just sound the same and do the same boring stuff, to find singers who actually are blessed with great voices and also very good musicians and who do tunes that you can actually hum along with.    I look forward to hearing more from them and I enjoy this cd at least once a week.    Highly recommend them to you if you have never heard them before.  Welcome back real music!

B004LSJCJM|5.0|Recently saw Joe in Tucson. GREAT performance!!! Joe performed 3 songs off of Dust Bowl. Slow Train, Dust Bowl, and Heartbreaker. This album shows off Joe's true diversity. One reviewer talked about the lack of quality in the songs. What are you thinkin? These are great!! They show off Joe's creativity and diversity. Every song is an adventure. I bet Joe could take each song and create an album using the theme of each song. Joe if you read this, during the Tucson show I wonder how many people caught the Tommy Bolin lick from Stratus? It was during the Jam ' Just Got Paid' ( Oh Yeah, Jeff Beck also still does Stratus.)Don't think I've heard Joe do that lick before, had to be listening. Great Show Joe!!!

B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This is a very well-acted movie by mostly unknown actors except for Matt Damon.  However, for over an hour I wondered what the French news woman had to do with this entire plot.  Her role and that of Matt Damon (as George L) weren't coming together, and indeed they don't come together for the first 90 minutes.<br /><br />There are three protagonists here.  First there is Marie Lelay, the French journalist vacationing with her news editor on a tropical island when a serious tsunami hits and wipes out the coastal village.  Both survive, but she has a concussion that forever changes her; she experiences the pathway to death before she is revived by two men who find her swept onto the beach.  She writes a book about her experiences that gets published in the US for American audiences.  I believe if this entire storyline were taken out of the movie (except for her book and her tour in the US) the movie will be faster-paced and shorter by a good 20-30 minutes.<br /><br />The second protagonist is Marcus, twin brother to Jason who gets killed by a truck as he is running away by a group street gangs.  Marcus tries the rest of the movie to get back to his brother, and starts finding psychics on the internet to meet in real life, all who turn out to be quacks...except for George whose craft is phenomenal.<br /><br />But George, the third protagonist, doesn't want to do readings anymore, yet he is coerced by his brother to get back into it because that his how his brother can make money off of him.  His brother wants nothing more than for George to get back into conducting readings again because George has a natural gift with that.  George sees it more as a curse, though, and only does readings after the people  persuade him to do one, which always turns out making the subjects admit to deep secrets of their past.<br /><br />These three story lines develop slowly.  For someone expecting a fast-action thriller or suspense will be deeply disappointed in this movie.  This is more of a drama whose theme is connecting with the afterlife, and Clint Eastwood does an excellent job refraining from making this either a religious movie or a SciFi/horror/thriller movie. He gives a sensitive slant to this topic which gives all the characters a human touch.<br /><br />It's a shame this movie is not well-received by the general public.  When seen as a drama this works well, and anyone who believes in the afterlife would enjoy this.  Damon plays a convincing psychic.ecting with the afterlife, and Clint Eastwood does an excellent job refraining from making this either a religious movie or a SciFi/horror/thriller movie.

B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I only know of Dexter because of the Showtime series, and turned to the books, really, to compare the original story to the TV adaptation which I love. This may add some subjectivity to the scales, but that's just how it is.    With that said, I actually greatly enjoyed the book (which I read on my Kindle). Lindsay has a unique writing style which, even though he sometimes makes very poor choices, kept me from peering at my watch at every turn of the page. I finished the book relatively quickly and was left wanting more, which is always a good sign. Furthermore, Lindsay expertly structured his first novel. When the chapter was over, it felt like the right place for the chapter to end, and the next to begin; it got to the point where I could sense the change in chapters and I absolutely love that in a book. Likewise, the book ended exactly as it should--not too abruptly, not too drawn out, but just where it ought to.    I was also pleasantly surprised that Rita was not a major feature of the book. She served the purpose of illustrating Dexter's socializing skills, but Lindsay never quite lingered on her. There was no melodrama (thank God).     The final verdict is this: the book is clever at times but not exactly high-caliber literature. In terms of writing, it's just a step above your \\"run-of-the-mill\\" suspense authors, with an added sense of comedy, and, of course, a major, book-long \\"twist\\" (ie: rooting for a murderer). Lindsay's conceit works fantastically and, despite his more unfavorable choices, that makes the book worth a read.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of the previous installations in the series but this new version is better in my opinion. Love that now they have this with no ads available and allows for smooth gameplay with no intrusions. If this is the start of the Amazon app market then I might make this my default stop for apps in the future.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i like how they switched up the game with freeing birds instead of killing pigs. oh, and people stop reviewing the experience you had getting the game and rate the game itself.

B000KJU1MS|4.0|This is a great item for any kiss fan to have in their collection. However the product had smashed corners on the box when I received it, which I was not happy about. This volume of the three part set gives you great insight to why peter and ace were no longer in the kiss line up, and how the band lost some of its popularity in the 80's. This is a must own for any true kiss fan.

But the rest of the album is uncohesive.  Now I can tell the results of not having all the members of the band in the same room for recording does to an album. Most of the songs have no depth.  It seems like they half fast it to put out a new album.  You think a big band like the strokes would avoid making the same uninspired album twice in a row and especially after such an anticipated wait.  I just hope the fleet foxes and tv on the radio avoid the same mishap. I just waisted $3.99.

B004J4WQ46|4.0|The Strokes have been absent for 5 years, an eternity these days. Since their last album, released in January 2006, the band went on a long self-imposed hiatus, during which Albert Hammond Jr. issued two critically well-received solo albums, and Julian Casablancas also released an under-the-radar solo album. The band finally got together again in 2010, with some touring (headlining Lollapalooza), and trying to record a new album. Apparently that was harder than they realized. Recordings from the initial sessions were scrapped, and tensions within the band were such that on this eventual end result, the 5 band members were never in the same room at any given time. What to make of this? Well...<br /><br />\\"Angles\\" (10 tracks; 34 min.) starts off promisingly with the 1-2 punch of \\"Macho Piccho\\", reminiscent of the \\"First Impressions\\" sound, and \\"Under the Cover of Darkness\\" (1st single), which reminds us of the classic \\"Is This It/Room on Fire\\" sound: tight with great melody licks and great band interplay. Great choice for a single. \\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\" is a nice addition as well (with great guitar work from Hammond), but \\"You're So Right\\" misfires badly. The first half of the album ends with an explosive \\"Taken For a Fool\\", another track reminiscent of the classic Strokes sound. Great first half of the album! The second half kicks of with an intriguing \\"Games\\" (featuring a drum machine instead of real drums), which reminded me of what the Cars would do if that band would still be around. However, after that the album starts to falter badly. \\"Call Me Back\\" is a pensive that goes nowhere. \\"Gratisfaction\\" is the last worthwhile track on here. The last 2 tracks don't go anywhere, and are quite disappointing.<br /><br />In all, a mixed bag for sure. Several members from the Strokes have already publicly disavowed themselves from the album. Interestingly, all tracks are credited to the Strokes (almost all of the tracks of their previous albums were credited to just Casablancas). Given the hard time it was for them to come up with this 34 min. collection of music after a 5 year lay-off, one must really wonder if this is it for the Strokes. I really don't see them making another album, to be honest. Yes, they are touring, playing major festivals (they are one of the headliners of the upcoming Coachella festival), but I don't see much of a future for them as a band. This is their weakest album to date, even if it has some great moments. But of course, compared to the drivel that is heard on mainstream commercial radio, this is a masterpiece. That said, I think this is really it for the Strokes.en the hard time it was for them to come up with this 34 min. collection of music after a 5 year lay-off, one must really wonder if this is it for the Strokes.

It comes with behind the scenes extras and commentaries, but the movie itself is the same!  I expect this is because they decided after the first 2 Ultimate Editions that they would wait and re-release all 8 movies at once in another Ultimate Edition, but this time a Box Set with extended versions of all films - to entice everyone to buy all the movies yet again.

I used to DVR all of the reruns on TV, and I was SOOOO ecstatic to see them at a decent price on Amazon, so I quickly snatched up the first 3 seasons! To my UTTER disappointment so much of the original music had been changed!!! It's really sad to see a scene that used to have certain music in the back ground, which MADE THE WHOLE SCENE, and suddenly there's some music that's totally inappropriate for the year, and totally bastardizes the cheesy early 90's flow that made 90210 so fantastic! I was very disappointed and I wish that this was made clear to me prior to my purchase! And then they have Darren Star's commentaries and he completely ignores the fact that his show, that he's so proud of, has been edited so much that it no longer has its original appeal. Of course, I'm going to keep them because the show RULES despite the mid-90's ska music that sets the background for a bunch of kids in carry-over-80's clothing. If there HAD to be changes made, it could've been WAY more subtle (and someone should have done their research because having music that sounds like the Black Eyed Peas most recent album in the background of a club in 1990 is just ridiculous).

B004S8NBDI|4.0|[[ASIN:B004S8NBDI Angles]] deserves the over-exposure that so many new albums are getting these days.  While \\"Under Cover Of Darkness\\" has already gotten significant play, this album is chock full of other songs that deserve attention.<br /><br />The Strokes are splitting the difference with this new album.  In some ways, this is more of the same music that fans have come to love from previous albums like [[ASIN:B00005QIPH Is This It]] and [[ASIN:B0000C9ZLD Room on Fire]].  \\"Under Cover of Darkness,\\" \\"Taken For A Fool\\" and \\"Gratisfaction\\" are great examples.<br /><br />And in other ways, they have clearly integrated more styles in these songs.  \\"You're So Right\\" sounds like some kind of hybrid between the newest MGMT album [[ASIN:B0037W68F4 Congratulations]] and classic 80s rock guitar solos.  The same could be said of the closing track, which alternates styles a bit more.  In fact, a full range of 80s influences are on display on this album.  \\"Machu Pichu\\" has a ska guitar part reminiscent of early albums from [[ASIN:B000PHX4VA The Police]]. The instrumentation on \\"Games\\" reminded me of classic Duran Duran, and mixed with Julian's vocals it is a stark contrast indeed.  \\"Two Kinds Of Happiness\\" somewhat starts in the same vein, but then takes on more of a classic rock flair for the chorus and guitar solo.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Metabolism\\" really could fit right in on the newest Muse album [[ASIN:B002GZQYMK The Resistance]].  The vocals are operatic, and the instrumentation takes a page out of classic metal.  But The Strokes have a way of smoothing everything out so that it all sounds like rock.<br /><br />There are some soft moments on this album too, like the melancholy \\"Call Me Back.\\"  And the album closes with the deliberate \\"Life Is Simple In The Moonlight,\\" which mixes more harmonies that the other tracks.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />While bands like The Decembrists and Spoon have changed their sound dramatically when compared to their earlier albums, The Strokes have just fine-tuned their sound.  This definitely has the sound of their classics, but also has new ideas sprinkled here and there.<br /><br />I think it's impossible to judge this album against their earlier ones.  The Strokes have produced some of the classic albums of the last ten years.  It's going to take some time to put this new album into context.<br /><br />There is enough here to keep most hard-core fans satisfied.  Still, there will always be naysayers.  No album is going to please every fan, especially after all the time The Strokes spent on side projects.  But for those asking if this album is worth purchasing, the answer is a definite \\"yes.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy.is definitely has the sound of their classics, but also has new ideas sprinkled here and there.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|It's not the game, but Amazon that gets one star. It is a major pain to download. You'd think a major company would figure out a way to simplify the process, but no Amazon makes you jump through hoops by forcing you to change all your settings to the 1-click.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|Ok, so I didn't do any research into who wrote what song or how they recorded them. I won't shove garbage down your throat regarding if they were bored, losing their touch or blessed by an angelic muse.     What I can tell you is that this doesn't sound like anything out there, but The Stokes.   Angles brought out a feeling of nostagic fun for my wife and I. Yes, it is a bit different than their previous albums, but I think the positive outweighs the negative here.     Angles starts out new and fresh for several songs. The vocal mix towards the end of Machu Picchu gave me chills. Under the cover of Darkness is the kind of music that drew me into this band. Two Kinds of Happiness is chock full of those passionate vocals I love and is probably my favorite song on the cd.   Best part was catching my wife dancing along to Taken for a Fool and Games in the kitchen while making lunch. Games made me feel like it was 1984 all over again :)    The album has a few songs that don't appeal to me whatsoever. For whatever reason some just feel mediocre. You're So Right screams bad Radiohead to me. Call Me Back reminds me of I got Nothing to Say, just not as good (yeah, that song grew on me) Also, with a very short run time, I wish there was an extra song or two           Strong solo efforts from Albert Hammond and Julian Casablancas have kept me more than satisfied, so maybe I wasn't dying for a new album as much as others. Maybe my expectations weren't as high. What I can't deny is enjoying the music on this album and I hope you enjoy it too.
0688163173|5.0|I loved this book, it was a page-turner, like fan blades. There are enough secrets and plot twists in here---not to mention mystery---to satisfy the most jaded reader. Although the movie was fine, nothing beats the book. Read this book!

0756404738|4.0|I finished A Wiseman's Fear last night.  Although, I feel you can't truly review a middle book until you've read the final...I'll try to anyway.  Compared to The Name of the Wind, this book was not as good or satisfying.   The book is 996 pages, and of those, maybe 10% (or less) are pertinent to what I consider the main drive of the plot (Kvothe's quest to find the Chandrian).  Frankly, I felt like it was spinning its wheels too much.  Too much time was spent on things that didn't seem to matter to the overall arch (although this could be fixed in book 3, we'll find out).  And don't get me started on how infuriating his relationship with Denna became in this one.  I was rooting for them in the first book. After this one, I feel like she is just a horrible person.  If you have read His Dark Materials, I would compare much of this book Maggie Malone's storyline...  while important to the overall story, it just didn't need to be that involved and long winded.  Also, I can't fathom how Rothfuss will wrap up everything in one last book.  I will not be happy if the book simply ends with him finishing his story to the Chronicler.....it must continue on in the present day and have a proper ending!   Wiseman takes place for about a year or so....that leaves like 5 years of story for Kvothe to tell until he winds up as an Inn Owner.  That said, there was a lot to like, with some interesting new information....if book 3 was ready right now, I doubt I'd be complaining as much.    For those of you who loved the first (like me), hopefully all my review did was set your expectations to be a little more realistic.  I tried my best to not spoil any actual events.   One final thing though, I love Auri.
B002PEP4SC|1.0|It is aweful that I am unable to purchase this book because of where I live. If publishers want people to buy books, they need to wake up and be prepared to sell them.     What are my serious options if I want to read this book on my kindle? Have a friend who lives in the US buy the book, register my kindle to their account, send the book via whispernet to my kindle then me re-register my kindle to my own account?    Perhaps I could purchase an ePub from somewhere, strip the DRM, convert it to mobi and upload it.    I'll leave the last option unsaid, but you know it's what's at the back of everyone's mind when they run into road blocks like this :(    NOT HAPPY.

0670022411|2.0|I was really excited to read this book. It seemed to a lot of potential. I am always excited to find a really good read, and thought this one would be a goodie. I was wrong. I was off to good start, but the book fell apart for me and I had a hard time finishing. Diana is not very interesting, and the romance she has going on with Matthew left me bored and cold. There was no sexual tension, or passion, or even any witty banter, nada, zero. There isn't much fluidity to this book. There is a lot going on towards the end of the book, but it seems as if the author had all this research and information to share and she crammed it in at the end to add it to the plot and make it work, but it didn't work for me. Too many characters uncovering to many things, way to much going on, and not very interesting or vital. The book really had potential I guess that's why I was so disappointed. Ultimately, good idea that had too much theory and science, not enough feeling, personality, and excitement to drive the plot.

B004SBS8LA|3.0|Rovio Mobile's decision to launch Angry Birds Rio (for Android) exclusively with the Amazon Appstore is leaving millions of users frustrated with the very limited U.S.-only release.    Angry Birds Rio is very good. It is, by far, the best reboot for the Angry Birds franchise. The improved graphics, new game music, new characters make 'Rio' the best best Angry Birds iteration to date. I know this because I have the game on my Mac and on my iPod touch which is available worldwide.    Leaving out international Android users is not a good way to launch an Appstore. If Apple can release the game worldwide, why can't Amazon?

0670022411|5.0|I absolutely loved A Discovery of Witches. The story is about Diana Bishop, an extremely powerful witch who has eschewed her considerable power for all of her life, since her also-extremely powerful witch parents were murdered in Africa when she was 7. Diana has spent her life becoming a book historian (which is the true occupation of author Deborah Harkness) and works at Oxford as a professor and author.<br />Unfortunately for Diana, she is destined to become everything she has shunned. She discovers a book called Ashmole 782, which is a palimpsest. This is a manuscript that has another written over it, one that needs a certain type of light or power to be able to read. The book is one that has been sought after by witches, daemons and vampires for hundreds of years, as it is rumored to be a detailed description of how each type of \\"creature\\" was formed, or how they evolved. These three types of creatures do not like each other and do not intermix. Ever.<br />Diana is somehow able to get Ashmole 782 out of the library wholly by accident, or because her power is so great. Many creatures become aware of this, and subsequently aware of her power, whether she uses it or not. Diana becomes an instant target.<br />Fortunately, while working in the library one day, she surreptitiously uses magic to get a book down from a shelf and is spotted by Matthew Clairmont, who also happens to be a 1,500 year old vampire, as well as an extremely-well respected scientist. Despite all of the odds against it, they fall in love and travel on an adventure that does not come to a close at the end of the story. I am eagerly awaiting the sequel!<br />I enjoyed this book for many reasons, not the least of which is it's \\"highbrow\\" pedigree. It is full of accurate science and history, which I find fascinating. The author uses her considerable knowledge to highlight everything from history to biology and DNA, bringing a fascinating glimpse of how science has changed over centuries.<br />I have always found basic romance novels to be dull and uninteresting. I truly enjoy a bit of romance in a book full of history. This book reminds me of several past favorites, not the least of which is Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.<br />In all, I found this story to be very engaging, the characters to be well-drawn and complicated and the history and science to be fascinating. I would recommend this book very highly.c romance novels to be dull and uninteresting. I truly enjoy a bit of romance in a book full of history.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Originally I was getting an installation error after downloading to my Droid X but I found a fix:<br /><br />1) Mount the SD card from your phone to your computer<br />2) Enable the ability to see hidden files and folders for your OS<br />3) Browse on the SD card to /.android_secure/<br />4) Delete the file named \\"smdl2tmp1.asec\\"<br /><br />Found this fix when searching the help area of the official Android Marketplace web site.<br /><br />This definitely has some of the best graphics in the Angry Birds line of games and looks the most polished. Appears to have a lot more secret items to find than the previous ones. I find it hilarious that they changed it from killing pigs to saving birds trapped in cages. Either people were feeling sorry for the green pigs or it was just too violent for a game with a tie-in to a Fox movie?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Thank you very much for a fantastic download and awesome app store.  Sorry too all that are not in the US and cant download.  Oh well...that's why are country is the best in the world.  :-)
B001E75QH0|4.0|As always \\"Indie\\" movies are great! There's just one suggestion I would make, add the aspect ratio, wide screen or not. These DVD's are wide screen, for those of us who can't afford one of those fancy wide screen TV's, it's kind of a pain. Almost half of the TV's screen is the black bar created from the ratio of 16:9
0765318741|5.0|I read this book over and over when I was much younger. The idea of the story completely captured my imagination every time I read it! I wanted to be that \\"last man on earth\\", to fight the good fight.<br /><br />The funny thing is, I recently read the book again. What a difference time and maturity can make in perspective. The idea is still there, to be the last man, struggling against evil, but that really isn't the main premise here.<br /><br />Yes, this book probably influenced all the post apocalyptic and zombie stories that were written after it was published.<br /><br />But this story is, and always will be, the story of a man coping with the death of civilization as we know it. He also struggles with personal loss and grief while trying to come to terms with devastation on a global scale.<br /><br />If you like zombie/vampire stories, by all means read this. Make sure you look at the publishing date when you do. Then you will realize how many clones of this story are out there.<br /><br />If you like stories dealing with one man's struggle against overwhelming odds, read this as well. The last scene, where the crowd quiets as he walks into sight is epic! When he realizes what he is and what he represents to that society gave me goosebumps. Very deep and very powerful!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|From download to running on my phone was about 3 minutes. Works perfectly on the Droid incredible. I have been playing the free version from the android app store and this version is more polished and runs smoother. So far very fun and addictive. Awesome game, especially for FREE!

I, for one, am looking forward to see how it all turns out and what Diana will have to give back to the goddess!  A good read to get me through the last throes of winter.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Box stock Droid 2 with up to date OS and non-market applications allowed, but no luck installing Angry Birds Rio. From the Android Marketplace I have always had to do the \\"Unmount SD card\\" work-around for the Angry Birds games, but since the Amazon App Store requires you SD card to be mounted, there is no way to get it to install. Looks like I will miss out on the free app of the day, and I wonder if I will ever get it at all.     Disappointing start for the Amazon Marketplace.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another great angry birds game. Graphics look great and runs very smooth on my Samsung Epic 4g. Very happy i was able to get this for free!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I could not be happier about the $.99 that I just spent on this app!  I have had the free Angry Birds for months and the ads are beyond annoying.  Sure, it is bad when the little ad on the screen makes it impossible to figure out an angle but the worst problem, by far, is the new video ads.  These ads would come up at full volume even if your phone was set on silent mode.  So much for letting the husband sleep while I play a quick game of Angry Birds in bed.      They are all gone for an easy $.99!!!!   I will continue to shop on Amazon apps.

I first went to application,unknown sources and ok'd all that, then I tried to open my email and install but that didn't work so I scanned the barcode and that worked with no problem. (I have read many post about the DROID X making you amount SD card I did not I had any problems and I didn't do anything but download.) This and the fact that at 2am when I first tried to download the app store was down are the only reason for 4 stars not 5. The game itself is great. I'm sure after awhile all the kinks will be out for the app store.

0316044695|3.0|First, my son is a Marine and I'm fiercely proud of him and what he's doing, so please don't take any of what follows as evidence that I'm one of the bleeding-heart, anti-war liberals that Luttrell rails against in the book.  Luttrell is a genuine hero, who came very close to giving everything for his country, and much of the book is thrilling and inspiring, but I think there are some very serious problems with it, both in style and, occasionally, substance.    The style problems aren't unusual in this genre.  Much of the first half of the book feels bloated with material that could have been omitted without taking away from the central story.  Luttrell's description of his early years may be hugely relevant to him, but it tells us very little that we need to know about what follows.  If I were editing the book, I'd spend much less time on his youth, somewhat less time on his SEAL training, and more on his experiences in the attack and his long journey to escape.  Whenever I see a book with \\"[Author] with [or, worse, as told to] [Ghostwriter]\\" on the cover, I know that there's a good chance that it will read as this book does.  There are two voices, one coming from someone with notable experiences but little or no talent for writing and one with a talent for writing but none of the relevant experiences.  The result is a combination of folksy and polished that is usually the best of neither.    It obviously requires an extraordinary amount of self-confidence to be a member of any of the special forces.  That attitude understandably permeates the book, but this reader would have hoped for more introspection and self-analysis.  Instead, Luttrell seems to want merely to focus blame on others, particularly the \\"liberal media,\\" a phrase he uses until it's monotonous.  This is one of flaws of substance in the book.  As other reviewers have observed, he gives a very confused explanation of the team's decision to let the local goat herders go, saying at one point that his vote for that was a \\"Christian\\" decision, at another that it was based on fear that the \\"liberal media\\" would reflexively force the team to be prosecuted, and at another that it was based on the practical concern that the goat herders' tribe would come looking for them.    The entire discussion fails to consider one of the fundamental reasons we have rules of engagement at all.  Ignore for the moment the morality of killing unarmed civilians.  Winning a war in which you're fighting an insurgency, even if it is one that is largely fueled by outside forces, requires that you get and keep the general population on your side.  If the SEAL team had killed those civilians, regardless of whether they were Taliban supporters, their mission would have been a failure, even if they had ultimately killed or captured the team's intended target.  Luttrell makes the mistake of thinking that he is in a traditional war in which merely killing the enemy is enough.  The war in Afghanistan, like the war in Viet Nam before it, will be lost if the population thinks we are attacking them or occupying their country.  Perhaps more than any area in the world, Afghanistan has shown - over the course of millennia - that it will not be occupied or conquered.  When Luttrell suggests that the lives of civilians are less important than the mission or when he shows disdain for or ignorance of local customs and culture, he betrays the cause for which he's fighting.  Similarly, his dismissal of the outrage over Abu Ghraib shows a lack of understanding that what occurred there did more to damage our cause than dozens of terrorists ever could. Sometimes the sacrifice that is called for is not shown by bravery under fire, but by accepting the fact that there is something more important than the mission you were given and that the ends don't always justify the means.    Luttrell and the rest of the SEAL team deserve our admiration, gratitude, and respect.  I just wish that his book about their experienceshadn't been burdened by what were, in my view, misguided attempts to lay blame, which ultimately distract from the inspiring story of their heroism.

B004H4XI5O|4.0|Foer is a journalist who got interested in memory, trained for a year, and won the US memory competition in 06 -- then went to London to the world match and lost by a wide margin.    The basic idea of experts is that most people plateau at a certain level. Example: we learn to drive at 16 or so, get better, and, soon after, we get comfortable with it, say that's ok, and don't work any more on our driving skills. The OK plateau.    Experts push themselves past where they are comfortable, to the point where they fail, and, then, they carefully review why the failed and practice more until they pass that plateau. In the case of the author, he worked on memorizing cards in a shuffled deck. (Basic technique, associate each card with a celebrity or person you know well.) Foer got a point where he could memorize cards at so many seconds per card. He worked with a metronome. Then he pushed the metronome to the point where he could not memorize so fast and messed up some. Then he carefully reviewed why he failed, adjusted his technique, practiced more, and passed up that plateau.    One thing Foer discusses is the role of memorization in education -- though not in as much depth as I would have liked. In ancient Rome, rhetoric and speeches were an essential element of education (and on into the middle ages). Not so surprising that memory was a big part of the system then since you need to remember your speech to give a good one. In the modern world, there has been a decline in the role of memory in education. Foer wonders if this has been whorthwhile or not, although I wish he had pushed himself more on this question. Personally, after teaching in universities for 12 years, mostly writing and humanities, I think students should be asked to memorize more in humanities classes. I sometimes got the impression that students believed they learned more if they had an exam or two which allowed them to demonstrate, both to the instructor and themselves, that they had learned something in the course. Asking students to only write a paper, especially if they get little to no feedback on it, often has the result that students wonder if they learned much of anything in a course. And, if they did learn something, was it only something they learned on their own, and was there anything useful that went on during the time the course met.

I have been disappointed to get emails and adverts for weeks about this alternate app store release and feel I have been mislead. I get an email today telling me how to get it all set up and I excitedly went through the Amazon Android App Store install then had the utter disgusting user experience of being told that I cannot download any applications as the store is US only. Epic fail. Waste of everyones time and a very poor decision. How to alienate customers. Rovio, why did you agree to go along with this sham? Surely you didn't need this painfully weak minded platform to push your new release causing nothing but frustration for customers. Hateful experience. Aren't you guys based out of Finland? - shameful sell out!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Finally an angry birds with no ads, it plays very smooth. I like the change from the original so far haven't played much into it but it seems very well done.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Great for exhausted evenings.  A bit campy but fun.  Just let the music roll over you and ease the long day away.  Doesn't remind me of my small town high school.  Different era.  But the feeling of not quite being in or being totally out transcends eras.  Searching for that place/person that accepts you as is and encourages you to use your talent.  Listen for some truly funny lines.  Jane Lynch really gets the lion's share.  The show is evolving and I look forward to Season 2.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|must have... for us in the United States LOL... the graphics are sweet and love the extra birds! Grab it now, unless your not in the US ,and then at that point I suggest moving here.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the original Angry Birds.  The slingshot concept is simple, accurate, but yet so addictive. Rio is adding to an already excellent franchise!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Game is unavailable in UK. What is the point...? Releasing exclusive for amazon appstore game which is available only to us market. What's funny even free version is unavailable so there are no restrictions its just management of amazon being daft
B00064ADR0|5.0|If you're a Johnny Winter fan , the 'Legacy Edition ' of Second Winter is a must have . The improvement on the sound quality is excellent . But the reason this is a must have is the added material on the second disc . Early In The Morning - an instrumental and Tell The Truth are included on disc one . Disc two is killer . It opens with Sonny Boy Williamson's Help Me , continues with Johnny B. Goode ,Mama Talk To Your Daughter ,It's My Own Fault ,Black Cat Bone ,Mean Town Blues ,Tobacco Road , Frankenstein and Tell The Truth - all taken from the Royal Albert Hall Concert in 1970 . The sticker on the CD cover states that the version of Frankenstein is the first recorded version of the song ...Johnny's guitar takes the place of Edgar's synth ( with a long drum solo in the middle ) -great version ...it's a great cd worth of music . I generally shy away from remasters or rereleases unless the original is unlistenable , but this is an absolute must have for any Johnny Winter fan
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Good game. Better graphics. No problem installing for my vzw fascinate. Very addictive game.  Good job. Thanks amazon to offer this game for free.  Thumbs up.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon app will only allow this to install on the SD card.  Installation has an error, and then SD card unmounts itself.  SD card continues to unmount after reboot.  The only solution is to uninstall Angry Birds.  There is no option to install this on the device itself, and installing on the SD card causes errors.  I have other apps installed on SD card with no trouble.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|They did a awesome job! New goodies, very nice graphics. Thank you Amazon way to start the app store! Can't wait to see tomorrows Free app.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|A perfect old school shooter will incredibly vibrant graphics. Beautiful on a Tmobile G2. And amazon really needs to get rid of this 25 word minimum....
B004SBX112|5.0|Great app.  When I installed it,  it didn't replace it with a new app but it updated my other version by  taking away those pesky ads that get in the way.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's angry birds, but unlike seasons it tries a slightly different spin. Guys cut amazon some slack, they're new at this! Great game all around.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry birds plus no ads is perfect.  I was excited to see the update available for my incredible plus when I installed it,  it didn't replace my previous game..  just removed the ads.  Just perfect
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love the new update to angry birds. real clean, and fast.now i want this facelift on the regular angrybirds game. thanks for the free app amazon. works great on evo 4g.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another fun game to add to my angry birds collection.  It's great not to have irritating ads on the top either.  Who knew flinging birds could be so much fun
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's a really fun game! A must have if you like Angry Birds series. Works just fine with Verizon's HTC Droid ERIS
0805028846|5.0|This book is one of five different books on this subject that I have and this one is my favorite. Good photography and clear instructions. Examples that are interesting and clear for students starting out. I teach a college level three-dimensional design course and I recommend this as a reference to introduce students to thinking about paper in a three dimensional way.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why amazon has region locked their app store is beyond me.if they want to emerge as a true competitor to the android market then they should do away with this restriction.
B004JK61K0|5.0|I use K-9 Mail on a daily basis, and it's a great email program.  Had no problems connecting to imap or pop3 accounts, has lots of configuration options (really like that I can set a 'quiet time' for notifications), and does everything I need it to.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I've been an Angry Birds fan from the start. So far Rio is even better than the original. The graphics are much improved and the annoying pigs are gone! This is definitely a must have...especially since it's free right now.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like it alot! it definitely has lived up to the hype! good job developers and Amazon for making this come thru for Android! five stars
B004SBS8LA|5.0|been checking for this release all night every 10 minutes. finally!!! i hated that iOS got it first, but it was only a 6 hour delay for android.
B000WQWPJQ|4.0|A movie worth viewing again in BluRay. The sounds of the waves really enhance the feeling of that struggle to overcome it. The still loneliness is punctuated by crisp audio. Picture quality is ok, a bit on the grainy side.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I initially had the same problem many Droid X users were having in trying to download the Angry Bird Rio game from the new Amazon Appstore. I searched many forums and finally came across a solution that worked. This is what I did:  1. Make sure you allow installation of non-Market applications in the Applications settings on your Droid X.  2. Download and install the Amazon Appstore application. Make sure you have an Amazon account.  3. Connect your Droid X to your PC via USB cable.  4. Switch the USB Connection type to USB Mass Storage (click on usb connection under notifications).  5. Find the USB Mass Storage folder under My Computer.  6. Open the .android_secure folder directory.  7. Delete the smdl2tmp1.asec file in the directory. DO NOT delete any other files you see in the .android_secure directory, you may end up deleting your applications and other associated data.  8. Once deleted, disconnect your Droid X from the PC.  9. Install the Angry Birds Rio game.  10. Enjoy!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the graphics, and the fact that they didn't change the game play while giving us more variety. In the first levels, you are freeing birds, but the second levels, you are killing monkeys. There are new challenges, such as the palm trees on the second levels that you have to figure out how to deal with, and that keeps it interesting. There are also awards. It plays really smoothly on my Android HD2.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Once again they made a fun game and was happy to get it for free from Amazon! To the person with the Htc hero, its not powerful enough to play. The original was horribly laggy on my hero and wasn't worth the pain to try to play.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|have to love the no ad part along with FREE! but basically just angry birds with a twist.  running great on my nexus one.  I would pay the $1 our even if it wasn't free today.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Having been a fan of Gregg Allman from the Allman Brothers and his solo albums this album marks a new beginning for Gregg in that he gets back to some earthy blues roots with a stripped down band featuring Dr. John on most tracks . This album is refreshing without horns and a big production and Gregg's voice is still about the phrasing and delivery , conveying the message in it's simplicity and one which the first take done with spontanaeity is the best . It's an album that gets better the more you listen and a must for any blues and Gregg Allman fan , well worth the wait and I hope he makes another one soon in the same genre .
B004SBS8LA|1.0|not compatible with Droid Incredible! but they don't tell u this until u waste 30min trying to get the download to install. no reason why this shouldn't work, the Android market ones do.
0743270754|5.0|This is the first time in a long time that I'm really sad the book came to and end. I feel as if I've lost a friend, and a wise one at that. Doris Goodwin does such a good job of placing you in Lincoln's cabinet meetings, learning his thoughts and words as recorded from them in personal diaries, by the end you feel as if you've known them all personally.    It was also interesting to learn about what the mood was in the country at that time. Lincoln was a master at judging the appropriate time to present items to his cabinet, congress and the public. He held off on items he wanted desperately to push through but knew they wouldn't be accepted before the masses were ready for them. (i.e., the Proclamation of Emancipation, the 11th amendment abolishing slavery) What an incredibly wise man.    He was also a man with deep moral convictions and a kind, tender heart. It pained him to have to have deserter's of the army executed and if it were at all possible, he would pardon them--much to the chagrin of the Secretary of War.    From the very moment he stepped into the White House he was besieged with problems of enormous importance that would require a measured response and a firm belief in the union. Lincoln was just the man for the job. In fact, I think he was destined for that job. I seriously doubt any other could have handled the various factions that warred within his own cabinet--a cabinet of rivals, by his choosing. He didn't want men around him that would be yes men or demur to his rulings. He wanted men who would stand up to him if need be to express their point of few and to rally for the people they represented. Each man he chose was the best for his job in more ways than just skill. Together they represented the emotions and thoughts of the entire country. They fought amongst themselves, sometimes bitterly.    Lincoln was able to step back, listen to all of their viewpoints and take them into account when reaching his own decision on what was best  for the country. He held no grudges and was never vindictive. In the end all of them came to love him, some more reluctantly. To know that he could change the opinions of men who were certain he was just an unschooled farm boy of limited intelligence and no political savvy was nothing short of miraculous in my opinion. They all came to recognize his intelligence, wisdom and ability to see beyond the moment.    What a great loss they must have all felt when he was assassinated. The country was left in despair. One of my favorite parts of the book was when Lee surrendered and Lincoln said: Thank God I was able to live to see this day. My purpose has been fulfilled. (Not verbatim) In less than two weeks, he would be assassinated.    I will have to read the biography of Andrew Johnson now, to see how the country fared after such a loss. I know that \\"it all worked out\\" but I'd like to know how the people of the United States could gather up such courage after losing the one man who had managed to steer them faithfully through a horrid, long war and give them hope for the future.    On the Mystical side, I couldn't help but feeling that there was a higher power involved in his election and throughout his governing of this great country. So many things had to happen at just the right moment in order for him to have been elected, re-elected as well as lead this country in a way no other could have done.    He wanted Reconstruction in the south to be fair. He had no desire to punish them or hang those who led the confederate armies, much different than what many others in Congress thought should be done to the South. He viewed the North and the South as one and wanted the South to be welcomed back into the fold, like a long lost child. For him, it was never about retribution. He simply wanted the country to become whole and heal itself.    A remarkable man that deserves all the praise given to him.    The love and intricate work that went into this book by Dorris Goodwin is evident throughout. She is a gifted historian who brings history to life and makes you wish you could have been there to see it all.
B004SBX112|1.0|this app is not compatible with the Droid Incredible but they won't tell you that until you waste 30min of your time trying to install it.
0439023521|3.0|This book takes place in an area that used to be the US.  However, now it is broken into 12 districts and ruled by the \\"Capitol.\\"  Formerly, there had been 13 districts, but that district was destroyed during an unsuccessful rebellion by all of the districts.  Now in a punishment that could only have been imagined by Shirley Jackson, the Capitol requires the remaining 12 districts to draw the name of a boy and girl from each district each year to participate in the Hunger Games.  In the Hunger Games, each contestant must kill all of the other contestants until only one is left standing.  This book is told from the point of view of a contestant from one of the poorer districts, Katniss.    The book is certainly a page-turner (I finished it in one day), and although the subject matter is inherently violent, the book does not dwell on the specifics.  So, why didn't I give the book five stars?  The reason is that when I got to the end, even though I knew this was the first book of a trilogy and the story has not finished, I was surprised to find that I didn't feel the desire to buy the next book.  Although it was an interesting book, I just didn't feel drawn enough into Ms. Collins's world or to the characters to worry about how the story ultimately turns out.  In sum, this certainly is an entertaining way to spend a few hours, but ultimately not satisfying enough to make me go back for more.
B004L49K20|5.0|I have been a Duran fan since '82. Throughout the years, I have stuck by them, album by album. My favorite album, of course was Rio followed closely by the first self-titled release. The albums since those two have been hit or miss, especially with the public.  Now, on their 13th release, they have recaptured the magic of the first two albums. I cannot get over how great this album is - it's modern, yet retro. This album would not be misplaced after the release of Rio (as Mark Ronson wanted this to be a follow-up to that album).  Stand out tracks - The Man Who Stole A Leopard, Too Bad She's So Beautiful, Runway Runaway, Being Followed, Blame the Machines, Mediterranea, Girl Panic! and the title track.  If you are a fan of Duran, or eighties music in general, you will definitely enjoy this release.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Was afraid to order a used movie, but when I got it I was very surprised at how great the condition was!
B00394A4UK|5.0|I can't really fathom why I bought this book.  Probably because I was excited about the movie.  But I was totally disappointed after seeing it.  So I must have bought the book way before I saw the movie, then was depressed once it came up in my rotation of reading.  I remember the book, when it first came out, did not get good reviews, and so I was hopping on this bandwagon late as it was.  But I gotta tell ya, I loved it.  It was a real page turner and had I been on a beach, would have made a great beach read.  The writing is clear and crisp and the dialogue and action propel the story right along.  There's not a lot extraneous exposition (read BS) that tends more often than not to weigh novels down.  And thank god, for once, it's not overly long, with the ending (even though I already knew it from the movie) taking place at the end of the book, not some 50 pages in with a lot time killing till it succumbs to the last page.  I say bravo, Mr. Lehane for a great book that should have been a better movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|a great spin on the original. works great at a great frame rate on the sprint samsung epic 4g. a must have i mean for free you can't go wrong.
B004SBX112|1.0|Angry birds seasons is one of the best games on android I would recommend it to anyone one who wants to kill time. Any age can enjoy this game
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Works great on my Evo4g for Sprint<br />no problems downloading this game for FREE and no problems during installation or game play<br /><br />Way to go AMAZON APP MARKET for giving us 1 free paid app a day!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far the Best Bible app available, especially considering that it is free!! It has multiple translations, in multiple languages, and is downloadable for use when not connected to the internet. The bible reading plans and other helps are very useful. I appreciate the zoom feature, making it easy to get the text to a readable size for every individuals personal taste. It also will read the passages to you (if your phone supports this) if you want to listen to passages while driving.
B0042K4QK4|1.0|Terrible, terrible, terrible, in every respect.  The only redeeming quality is attractive females in bikinis, which is probably the only reason this show received a green light in the first place.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Trusted source issue is just silly if you ask me.  So is the 25 word minimum here. So I need a few more words: Hey Amazon! :P
B000KN7BOA|4.0|I recently re discovered some of the \\"aussie\\" recordings the brothers did & liked the hooks & harmonies enough to take the plunge on this set. While I would not consider myself anything close to an avid BG's fan this 1st LP is impressive on several fronts. 1-this lp plays like anyone elses greatest hits including thier peers the Hollies or Beatles. 2-The recording process took just over 3 months they were'nt given too much time as they were still \\"unproven\\" . 3- The performances & most of the songs are stellar. 4-You get mono/stero versions. The stereo is very impressive as it spreads \\"stigwoods lavish production\\" over the stereo field ( I haven't heard it in mono yet) & you get a decent bonus disc which is in stereo. Some of the things on this debut that I don't like (small in #)are the somewhat flowery \\"pop\\" production by Stigwood & 1 of the brothers has a tendency to \\"quaver\\" his vocal chords a bit much, otherwise thier 3 part harmony stands with the best of best in the UK. If you're a fan of a group like the EasyBeats you will enjoy this as well. This reissue was nicely done.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works great on my thunderbolt.  especially love the free price. thanks amazon.  I can't wait to see what is next.  I really like that there are no annoying ads in this version
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install on OG Droid.  Tried unmounting SD card to no avail. Time to work out the bugs.  And whata the deal woth the 25 word minimum.  How annoying.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Helloooooo the world is bigger than that Amazon, also big fail on letting us download, install the appstore but then not use it ...
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Please... why put people through all the trouble of signing in, downloading the amazon app, activating the 1-click nonsense &amp; finally getting the app only to be told that the app store is not yet available in my region? What a waste of time!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|this version of angry birds is probably the best version to date. looks an works great on the thunderbolt. no ads an the graphics look great. already looking forward to future updates.
0441013597|5.0|I got this book since I had heard how amazing it was and how, as a women, I should read it since all my male friends had. I did not regret this!
B0000DC14V|2.0|I remeber the original and it was black and white,the color was   poor and the sound track,especially the dialog was very spotty.I  didn't realize this was colored over.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|AB Rio works great on the Xoom and it's a lot more colorful with more detailed graphics than we've seen before.  I had a brief issue when I first started it but after that all's well.  I had to crank up the brightness as the warehouse scene is a bit dark for my tastes.  I like the idea of rescuing birds rather than wiping out pigs.  And you folks who are giving this one star because it isn't available in your region yet, exactly what do you think you're reviewing?
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon apparently checks the apps before they allow them on there store apparently not. Doesn't work on the Droid 2, just Force Closes on startup. Terrible, come on rovio use the proper Android Market at least Google knows what its doing!     Also why make this US-Only I have to travel to Europe on business often, are my apps just going to stop working when i leave the country!!    Don't Download Terrible!!!
B004S8NBDI|4.0|No tracks to skip, I like it a lot!  It's got a classic strokes sound but with some really cool and interesting additional effects and arrangements.  The vocals, instrumental performances, beats, harmonies, and melodies shine well in clearly distinguishable tracks that work well together as an album.  It's short and sweet, like their first two records, I'm not disappointed; it's a great improvement over the bloated FIOE.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The game has a better UI than the orignial one. It's nice to see a change in the story line. I was getting sick of those pigs. It's a very fun game but it does lag a bit on my Droid. It doesn't force close but it does shut off on its own. It might just be insufficient ram. (I keep a couple of apps locked in memory). It's a great game nonetheless.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|poor,from Amazon!  only available in the United States,of America...............  poor,from Amazon!  only available in the United States,of America...............  poor,from Amazon!  only available in the United States,of America...............
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's game is a classical example of a book that takes a simple principle and style and exemplifies the necessary characteristics of a good easy read. From beginning to end the reader grows more and more entranced in their growing relationship with the main Character Ender.  It takes only a few chapters for the reader to eventually come to the conclusion that they will in fact choose to create a relationship with Ender and inevitably care about him.<br /><br />Ender's game is a book that will leave the reader with a life long impression about what a main character aught to look like and feel like.  Ultimately, the book will end and the reader will feel both remorse and gratitude.  Remorse because the book had to end, and gratitude to the author for the opportunity to know Ender and his intoxicating and riveting story of boyhood and heroism.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The DVD was a gift for a friend.  She says she is very happy with it.  Sound of Music is her favorite movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game. downloaded just fine on my phone. contact beat getting anything for free. thanks amazon. look forward to more free apps. download this now.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|this is by far the best of the series yet. game play is smooth and graphics are wonderful on my new thunderbolt. a mist have for all angry birds fans.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wonderful app which lets you not only read books, but also purchase and sync in the app. One of my favorite things is the ability to adjust the default scheme and brightness of the reading area.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on rooted htc evo. Same great angry birds but no annoying ads. Also doesn't appear to be any killing of pigs in this one. Great start to the new Amazon market. Thanks
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Running  gingerbread w/new HTC Sense and runs smoothly...well worth the dollar except that amazon is advertising it as free just hope I can download it more than once w/o having to pay after flashing phone over again
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Droid 2 VZ.  Was amazed to see the upgraded graphics.  I agree with others -- freeing birds is more uplifting than killing grunters.  [If you don't dwell on the initial premise that the birds were kidnapped ;)].  Was a little leary of having to accept outside apps -- but I double checked the email senders domain was valid and the link tooked me to my logged in Amazon account.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I would put down five stars, but for some reason, it wont let me download it yet, so as such, I will reserve my 5 star judgment for when I can play it.  I do have high hopes though, as I have loved every iteration they have put up to this point.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great game.  I am on AT&amp;T but my phone is unlocked so game installed and worked fine.  only problem is it won't exit when I am done playing.  I am sure it will get fixed though. Nexus one and the best.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Though this appears to be a movie tie-in, it's not just the same old Angry Birds with a few movie related tidbits.  They've gone a long way to revamping the UI here, so while the game still plays like the Angry Birds that has taken the mobile world by storm, it does so sporting a whole new look, giving a new depth to the field of play and animating the scoreboard for a nice little touch.<br /><br />There were some minor issues installing this on my stock Droid 2 Global, causing the game to load to a black screen and not return to the home screen.  A reboot seemed to fix the issue just fine.  I also see the idea behind launching Amazon's new Appstore with this game, but it does seem like a bit of a hassle to install a market to install this game when I already have a perfectly fine market on my phone.<br /><br />All in all, a very nice (and somewhat surprising) upgrade to an already entertaining game.  I'm not sure if Rovio is considering applying this same graphical upgrade to the original game and Seasons, but I would be all for it if they did.  Still not sold on the separate market idea, would love to see this game show up in the standard market (so folks on AT&T could get it, too), but I'll give the new market a fair shake for the time being to see if any other exclusive gems pop up.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Let's me download the app for the appstore and add credit card details etc then can't download since not in US.... well done amazon why didn't it say in the 1st place
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Beautiful new version of the best tablet game out there.  It runs great on my Archos 70 IT.<br /><br />But, why do we still shoot from the left?  Over ninety percent of the world is right-handed.  Shooting from the left is needlessly un-ergonomonic, and covers the screen during play.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Great game but after last today it won't open and freezes my phone. Please fix. So we CAN PLAY!!! Please
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Slickest UI and the most free content. Very responsive developers. They have an excellent utility for Bible reading plans, and a wide variety of plans.There are a lot of Bible versions, many of which are available for download and offline use. My only complaint is that you can't use the reading plans offline (but I bet they are working on it)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have downloaded the Amazon App Store App and I have tried downloading and installing Angry Birds Rio several times but it will not install and it will not give me a reason why. This is very upsetting as much as I love Amazon. I just want to play angry birds and they do not even have a FAQ section to tell me how I can install the a correctly. All it tells me is that the app will not install. I so hope they come up with a fix soon.
B003XX2PPO|1.0|Creo que este disco es horrible hasta su portada.Pienso que ya no le intereza mucho cantar buenos temas como los romances que fueron sus minas de dinero...
B003L1ZXCU|3.0|This is no doubt science fiction set in what seems to be the present day, initially the logic and plot are sound and with only a little suspension of belief you can imagine it happening. Unfortunately unless you are up to speed with the terms used in computer networks and social networks it at time leaves you scratching you head and wondering what the author is getting at. The whole premise of the book is that the \\"villain\\" of the story has died but before he died he let loose a programme, daemon that was able to manipulate events depending on external actions. For example early in the book an employee is electrocuted when he uses his swipe card to enter a building. Approximately the first half of the book is fast paced but without much character development however it seems to lose its way in the rest of the book where it is mainly a long battle and this is where the realism stops. There is to be a follow up book as the first few pages are supplied at the end of the book. I will read the next one if only in the hope that it pulls everything together.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I too jumped through all the hoops to download the amazon app store, downloaded the Angry Birds Rio (of which I have both other versions that work fine), but when I tried to install all I get is \\"Application Not Installed\\".  I have made sure my phone allows third party applications, and still nothing.  Very disappointing. Trying to install on a Droid X.
0790729601|4.0|Eraser is Arnie back at his best; off beat humor, out-sized heroics and lots of firpower. Vanessa Williams as T.I.A.G. eye candy. James Caan as the crusty mentor. And a special appearance by a scaled-down battleships cannon which only Arnie can use properly, of course. There is a plot in there somewhere, but thats not why you get a Arnie movie is it? As the saying goes - More Bang For Your Buck!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is a fun game, by hybridizing Angry Birds with a movie somehow dilutes the special quality of the original. Freeing birds is somehow less satisfying than destroying pigs, and the redesigned menus and polished animations don't have the simple charms of the original.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A free paid game with no ads. Very nice!<br /><br />Works just fine for me on Droid X.<br /><br />Generally speaking if the file downloads properly and you are having difficulties installing it is something wrong with your phone. Try clearing your .android_secure folder on your SD card as sometimes that helps. This may wipe ALL of your app settings/data though...
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|i got this app so that I could photograph documents and search them. that function has not worked AT ALL. I will keep trying until I find one that works.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|As complicated as it was to install everything, getting this app was well worth the effort. colors, gameplay, and simplicity are still its main features.
B004KUAHAO|4.0|Love listening to this CD.  Luckily for us Joe is not an artist who is content just churning out the same old comfortable groove.  While the sound that emerged in Black Rock is still there, he has been able to find new ways of taking us on a wonderful musical journey.  With the sad death of Gary Moore there is no one that I know of that plays this great musical genre as well as Joe does (happy to be proved wrong - power trios need not apply).    The only track that I have a little quibble with is his \\"homage\\" track \\"Heartbreaker\\".  When I first heard the Free version so many years ago the hairs on the back of my neck stood up - to me its their best track although Wishing Well seems to get that nod.  I still love listening to it.  While Joe's version is good, it just does not have the majesty of the original, and unlike say \\"Tea For One\\", he really does not do the original the justice it deserves.  A small complaint about the only journeyman track on the CD.    Cannot wait to see him in May and to hear him play the music from this great CD.
0515142247|5.0|I'm a new reader of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels and I'm hooked.  Die Trying is an excellent follow up to Killing Floor the novel that introduces the hero Jack Reacher. Child's plot is another tightly woven one building at a dramatic pace and captivating the reader on every page.  Child's main and minor characters are nicely developed and his scene setting is detailed enough to impact the imagination with great visuals; you feel like your right there seeing what Jack Reacher sees.  I've already bought five more and I'm looking forward to reading them all.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|another great game from rovio. thanks for giving us games that are both his friendly and addicting. being free was nice too. thanks amazon and rovio.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|One of the best games on one of the best markets! Free or .99 cents, I'd still get it. Works on my old Eris like a champ.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought this headset for use on Skype and playing games online.  Its very easy to hook up.  Plug it into your mic and headphone ports, and it works.  Cant ask for more than that.  The sound quality is good, and the microphone is crisp and sounds good.  I am easily heard by others.  It doesnt sound 'tinny' on the other end.  Also, a couple of the reviews state that the bass is horrible with this headset.  Ive found the sound quality to be great, especially for the price.  You arent going to be knocked over by the bass from these, but you will be pleased.  If you need more bass than these provide, spend the money and buy a headset designed for it.  Overall, Ive very happy with the product, and would recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|went through the whole process of looking in my account and setting up 1click, only to be told I can't download a FREE app because I don't live in the grand old USA. Would have expected this from Apple but not Amazon. Get your acts together.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just as easy to install from Google's market.  A few extra steps but I was playing the game in a matter of minutes.  Not sure why other people were having problems and hope they get them fixed. I'd readily buy apps from the Amazon app store in the future.
0782008372|1.0|This Republic transfer is worse than VHS, worse than Beta, worse than broadcast tv on a CRT (for those who remember that); it looks like the picture was shot through a pebbled glass table. And it's in standard letterbox format. Pass, pass, pass.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Graphics are much nicer than previous versions, game actually has depth/3D feel. Game runs extremely smooth on my 800mhz processor tablet. I like the objective of freeing the birds and not just trying to get rid of the pigs...
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Great idea: free app of the day, but downloadable only in USA!  This is the best way to start an AppStore, congratulation Amazon...  What a shame...
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I am a huge fan of SATC and am so happy I bought the entire series.  I'm addicted to watching it during free chunks of my weekends.  Best splurge I could have chosen!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|First of all, when the Amazon links were published they did nothing but redirected to Amazon front page. Then from somewhere I found the download link to Amazon Appstore which returned me some error message in XML. Finally, through XDA Developers forum I was able to install the Appstore, but installing Rio was still not possible. Through the same forum I found the APK for Rio but it seems that Amazon's retarded geographical restrictions are quite strong, the game just occasionally give different kinds of error messages that give no other option than quit. You have to be connected to Internet to be able to play. Crappiest user experience I've seen on Android and both Amazon and Rovio are to blame. I hope companies would understand that in 2011 the markets are global and should be from the very beginning.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|kind of stupid to have to download this from amazon. it would be easier to put this on android market instead of having to deal with all the crap from amazons app store
B004SBS8LA|1.0|What exactly would necessitate a \\"geographic restriction\\" on a digital product for an open-source platform? In the case of Angry Birds Rio, two other products from the same developer are readily available in Google's Android Market (for free, no less). Amazon has a proven e-commerce presence in Canada, so collecting payment isn't an issue. I was able to buy e-books via my \\"Canadian\\" Kindle while on a beach in the Dominican.    If we wanted DRM and locks and restrictions we'd just buy an iPhone.
B000TLMWLK|1.0|This video did not play all the way through to the end so I could not see all of the artists that are listed on the box. Buy it somewhere else.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is another great game of the angry birds series. This time the angry birds are out to rescue some captures birds rather than looking for their eggs. This twist on the original story gives the game a fresh perspective. The game play is the same as other angry birds games. I found the graphics and performance for this installment of the game much better on my Nexus one than the earlier episode. It currently includes two sets of challenges with 30 minigames in each. Placeholders within the app suggest more fun should be on its way soon. Overall a great app and highly recommended!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have a Droid X, and I downloaded the Amazon App Store just for this game, downloaded the game, and it won't even let me install it... Disappointing.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I have two young girls, 3 and 1. The 3 year old loves this movie! It also happens to be a movie that I don't mind watching with her.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|This album is probably the least good of the four, but since the other three are ridiculously good, it's not a bad thing. There are two GREAT songs (\\"Under cover of darkness\\", and \\"Taken for a fool\\") that  remind you of the early albums, two bad songs (\\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\" and \\"Games\\", the last one sounds like a song from the 80's, and it has a riff stolen from one of their own demo songs) and two good ones (\\"Gratisfaction\\", and \\"Life is simple in the moonlight\\") The rest of the album is alright, with \\"Machu Picchu\\" and \\"Call me back\\" standing out. This album sounds more dark and experimental than the other three and may take a while to feel it. Nevertheless, it's The Strokes, so it cannot be bad.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i buy from amazon all the time but i cannot donwload from here because i am in costa rica, central america, they do not want my $
B004SBS8LA|3.0|i was able to play when i first dwnld..then froze my 2 week old samsung epic (first time my phone froze). Even when i go back to market it will not start game. also on the level where there are the swim tubes a board kept bouncing over 3 min lol. Plse fix, love graphics!!
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Soundhound does what this app does but does it for free and faster.  Soundhound's free version also has unlimited tagging.  Shazam isn't bad but there are better alternatives out there.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the Kindle, and being able to read my books when I'm not able to physically have my Kindle in hand, is pretty fantastic. I would suggest this app to anyone who loves reading, whether or not they have a Kindle.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I use this app daily, and I love it! Does exactly what it says...kills tasks. I highly recommend all Android users have this app or something similar.
B000W91RUG|5.0|so happy to find a great deal on this item to start off our collection of the series. we finished the season in one night
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I know it's a marketing tie-in for the movie, but the fact remains that this is a much improved update over the original Angry Birds. Graphics are sharp, clean, and more detailed; very vibrant color pallet. Also, without the ad-bar from the original free version of AB, the interface is much more responsive with less stuttering. EVO 4G
B001FB4VXU|5.0|so glad to find the item at a great price and add it to our series collection such funny show i hope it doesnt end any time soon. hurry season 4 i need you on dvd along with season 5 of biglove lol
B004SBX112|5.0|Well worth a $1 purchase, this version eliminates the ad-bar from the free version WITHOUT losing your game save and progress.  With the ad-bar gone all the input lag that the game used to have (when tapping to activate special birds) is gone. This is the way the game was supposed to play all along!  Plus regular theme updates for all the holidays? For a buck, this is a must-buy! EVO 4G
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my new HTC ThunderBolt!  if it doesn't work on your phone, then you need to start getting a better phone.  It also works on my girlfriend's Droid Incredible.  Just follow the directions and check off unknown apps from your applications settings menu.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Well worth a $1 purchase, this version eliminates the ad-bar from the free version WITHOUT losing your game save and progress.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Runs smoothest ive seen on my galaxy tablet. very polished and nice. looks like we get more levels later this year too. great time waster.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|More balanced than Seasons (which gets randomly too difficult at times) however it is still the same ole Angry Birds which is good, but is getting old.
B003629IPW|5.0|What an awesome video of the last days of this Entertainer, who was a gift to all. His drive for excellence, his knowledge of all aspects of touring from casting, lighting, filming everything is shown along with how kind he was to all around him. Absolutely no ego and all love. Michael, you will never be forgotten and will go down as one of the greats-EVER.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm living this game so far. I was disappointed by the St. Patrick's Day update on the holiday version because it is so laggy. I was pleasantly surprised by Rio, it is fast on my Vibrant.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Better graphics the the previous versions and good gameplay. Like the change from destroying pigs to freeing birds. Runs great on Sony X10a.
B003XRELEI|5.0|Thanks to Kindle, I am rediscovering Kurt Vonnegut. I used to devour any of his writing that came my way, but it has been 30 years since I have read any of his titles. So it is a great joy to rediscover an author with my kindle.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is a popular Vonnegut title, but not usually the favorite of readers, it does not follow most writing conventions. Reading this title is sort of like playing dodgeball. The ideas come careening from all directions, and the reader is not able to prepare for what is in store.<br /><br />Vonnegut does not pull any punched in this book. It is a revealing look at human nature, and the society that we live in. The language and ideas may pose some problems for the modern reader, even though the book is not that old.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is not heavy on plot, in fact most of the action is revealed early on. The fun is in how he gets there. What he does not reveal, and what most people find hard to follow is that this is a story by \\"The creator of the universe\\" who makes the characters and then lets them roam in the world of his creation. I will not give away the ending, I am not here to provide any spoilers. The creator shows up in the story and is integral in the ending. This is not a technique that can be pulled off by a lesser writer.<br /><br />The book is sprinkled with Vonnegut's whimsical drawings, and this adds greatly to the enjoyment of the text.<br /><br />Put on your seatbelt, you are in for one heck of a ride.
B004SBX112|5.0|It is so fantastic to finally have an ad-free version! The ads loading occasionally slowed my game down enough to be frustrating, so I love that I can support the developer and run a much smoother game now! I played a quick level, and I have to say, it's like night and day the speed at which it loads. It you're an addict like me, and the ads bother you or slow your game down on your phone, this is a very well-spent $1.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon sign a deal with Android and make it harder for us to download the app.  disgusting.  What a waste of time.  no angry birds Rio for me, forget this.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is one of the must have title for android phone. Game is much more polished than the original angry bird. And what's even greater is that it's free on amazon appstore on its first day.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Really? Could you not have told me before I went through all the trouble getting the amazon app store? Why do I have to give amazon my payment info when I only want to get a free app anyways? Not happy at all.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Much better graphics and smooth game play.  5 stars from me.  I can't wait until they update it with more levels.  It works great on my samsung Vibrant.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I've read plenty on this website about the thoroughness of the two extras DVD's, and I can't help but second that. I was fascinated by all the background behind the making of this movie, and it kept me up a few nights just wanting to watch the next feature, even as someone who didn't care for the book as anything special (don't hate!).    Yet I just had to comment on the technical marvels packed into this film.    The quality of video and sound on the two main feature discs blew my mind. Of all DVD's I've ever seen, this has had the most crisp and heart-pounding sound of anything I've ever watched. Mind, you, part of this is that I watched it on a PS3 and got the uncompressed Dolby Digital track, which was incredibly satisfying even with just 2 great stereo speakers and a bumping subwoofer. So really, if you have a PS3 or any other especially good sound system and a good TV you cannot get many better experiences than this DVD. The sound Oscars went to all 3 LOTR films for a reason - every sound is effect is appropriate and impactful.    The image is also particularly beautiful. The colors are warm and rich with color, making every frame a gorgeous picture. The battle scenes are appropriately dark and everything as they should be, but when all different colors are bright and distinct in other scenes, and in Fangorn Forest's verdant green vistas especially, the picture hypnotized me.    I guess I'm saying that we all know these are great movies. Get this release for the extras if that's your thing, but this release's best feature in my mind is the quality of the sound and picture - they're on a level I have never seen. And I'm not that picky with sound either, so it stood out even for me - you don't need to be a fan to appreciate this release, and the same goes for the other two Extended Edition releases. The Two Towers is just the one I happened to watch recently, so I have the freshest memory of it, but I own the other two releases as well and they are equally excellent all around. I don't think I can use enough superlatives to praise these 3 DVD releases, and I'll be watching the Return of the King tomorrow to finish off the trilogy. I know I sound like a fanboy, and so be it - a lot of other DVD's will sorely disappoint me after these Extended Editions, I have no doubt.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Finally, I can play an ad-free version of this game. High arc shots were so frustrating when the poorly placed ads got in the way. Well worth the $0.99.
B004A8ZWSS|1.0|I wish there was a negative star system. This movie was REALLY bad and I love both cast members. Just slow, boring and I couldn't wait till it was done.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have a Droid Incredible running stock 2.2 froyo and it will not install for me. I've tried installing other apps from the store and they work. I'm only having issues with Angry Birds Rio.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game! It's as good as the original and much better than Angry Birds Seasons. The first level is not too hard so you can progress nicely at the start. Played it for more than an hour last night and could barely tear myself away to go to bed.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Finally 5 stars. Ads gone. Well worth. .99. Do reals. 25 words is really a lot. omg omg omg omg omg omg omg seriously wtf.
030746363X|5.0|The most important text on personal improvement since Talent is Overrated.  This book should become an asset in your everyday life.  You should wind up with pages of notes on actions you want to take in your own life after reading this.  I hope that he will consider for his next book an exploration of cognitive enhancement.  The only thing better than a high level of physical fitness is an extraordinary mind to accompany it.
143350393X|4.0|This is a large volume so let's take this one step at a time.<br /><br />Binding:<br />The binding is Smythe Sewn.  That should provide many, many years of use.  The cover, while not leather, is soft, it doesn't feel plastic or rubbery.  It's definitely not leather but is a nice substitute, much better than old imitation leather.  I do wish it was bound with more than one ribbon marker in it but I guess post it notes and tape flags will have to do the job.<br /><br />Printing:<br />The printing is a good size for both the notes and the text itself.  Very easy to read.  I am also very pleased with the single column format.  Certainly not traditional but still a good choice.  The choice to put color illustrations and maps in the main text area was a fantastic idea.  However the printing is not as consistent as I would like.  Some pages are noticeably darker than others.  Some pages appear bolder than others.  It doesn't make it unreadable but a little attention to detail that would have been nice.<br /><br />Translation:<br />So, there's not much to say about this.  I personally really like the translation.  I don't know that it will ever be my favorite translation but I do like it a lot.  Some may not like it's \\"literal\\" philosophy.<br /><br />Notes:<br />I found the notes to be very comprehensive and balanced.  Many study Bibles will provide one view on the scripture or doctrine and no other view, which is great if you happen to believe that I suppose.  This one gives you a more balanced picture.  Here are the views, now you make up your mind which one makes the most sense.  I can appreciate that.  There's also the sheer volume of notes and articles.  It's like having a commentary library in the Bible with it, which is great for study, but not as great for carrying sometimes.<br /><br />Of course the Bible has all of the other things you would expect, cross references, concordance, maps in the back, reading plan.  An amazing amount of information in a surprisingly small package.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its not perfect, but it was smooth. I thought Amazon would use its amazon.com app for this, but its good. Of course, this would suck if you have AT&T, but its their fault, not Amazon. Love competition.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has all the resources you could ever need to get into the word-devotionals, in depth reading plans, and even ways to bookmark verses with one click.  I have been able to get into God's word like never before, and love how I don't have to remember where I left off.  It even catches you up if you happen to fall behind. Some tools I've used are short term marriage devotionals, woman's devotionals, in depth chronological reading plans, and, simple ways to share via Facebook and Twitter.  This app has truly helped to enrich my life. The Bible app in dozens of translations, and dozens of languages with a simple click to change-finally!
0439023491|4.0|Picking up right where Hunger Games left off, this is a fast paced sequel that leads right up to #3.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|N&atilde;o liberaram pro Brasil, grande coisa!!!!! Assim n&atilde;o vale, pelo market &eacute; poss&iacute;vel baixar jogos, porque aqui n&atilde;o &eacute;. P&eacute;ssimo n&atilde;o gostei deveriam tratar melhor todos sem discrimina&ccedil;&atilde;o
B0015AARJI|5.0|I was hesitant at first to order because they were being shipped from overseas. It was the best deal around so I ordered two and thought it would take a month to get them.  Got them quickly (under two weeks)and my kids have had no complaints!! Will definitely not hesitate to purchase from this seller in the future!
B004KA9MQO|4.0|I'm not too sure about this album. I enjoy listening to Jennifer Hudson she has an amazing voice. I still think she can do better than what she has done on this album. I want her to show her voice more like Mariah Carey, and Whitney Houston, I know she has it within her, she has a powerhouse voice. Some of the songs aren't up to the potential that she can achieve. Some of the songs on this album she shouldn't even be singing. I know people are going to agree, and disagree with me on this, but that's what I personally think. She is better than some of the songs on this album. The album isn't bad, I do like half of the album. There is a few songs on this album that I like:<br />1. Don't Look Down<br />2. Feeling Good<br />3. Believe<br />4. Still Here
B004SBS8LA|1.0|not available in the uk. i would love to give this a positive review, but id be playing it now if it were on the normal market
B004LP601S|3.0|Some of the songs on this album are cheezy. I really don't think Panic At The Disco is back at their full potential. I find listening to this album boring most of the time. I really enjoyed their last two albums, and I really didn't expect the downfall this bad from them. Yes their last album was released 3 years ago, but this album could have still been better than it is. This album is defiantly a step down form their previous album. I personally don't recommend this album. I don't like the musical style on this album much. I personally think most of the album is filled with filler songs that aren't up to standard, left out songs that would of been on their previous albums, but didn't make the cut. The only songs I like on this album are:<br />1. The Ballad of Mona Lisa<br />2. The Calendar<br />3. Trade Mistakes<br />I've liked Panic At The Disco since the beginning, and this album really makes me disappointed. I really wanted to like this album, but I can't.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Figured there weren't many ways you could improve on the original but this is a cool storyline and a different angle to the game. I'm not sure I love the whole theme of trying to help the birds escape as I really liked knocking out pigs, but this game is fun none the less.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Snagged this on opening day of the Amazon Appstore of course. The graphics and framerate seem improved, and I like that the environment can become an obstacle. Plus, it was FREE!!!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|why you let me download and install the appstore and see the game but when I click on &quot;get app&quot; you say &quot;the market is not available in your reagion&quot;! please remove the apps i cannot install..
B004SBS8LA|1.0|you've lost a client in the most absurd way you could... The Internet opens gates but companies shuts them. you could not have done it worse
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds definitely stepped it up with this new addition to the angry birds family. Rio visually is much nicer. The game overall is much faster, due to the new ability to skip scenes and less time delay after you kill/release the last target. Great game!
B003Q6D25U|5.0|This second was the icing one the cake!   Not only did the director do a good job of making you not only think something other then what actually happen was the problem, but also prolong the suspense (i think on purpose) the increase the stock horror when the scary stuff came around! I also enjoyed the fact that not only did events happen in the day but also in the night. I have yet to buy the DVD/Blu ray but im about to now after seeing it in theaters and again from the Red Box lol! One main thing i love about this movie, unlike other horrors that have bloody overly dramatic violence, this movie truly displaced Dark Romanticism, which is something you really don't see any more these days in a lot of stories. I give this movie a A+
0765326353|5.0|I had my reservations about this book after reading the back cover. I decided to try it though since I liked the Mistborn trilogy and to be a bit different about this time and actually listen to the story on audio book while doing housework.   Well, I don't think my home has ever been so clean during the time I was listening to the audio version :P.   The characters have depth to them and are multilayered and their stories are fascinating as they unfold.  However, the main arch story is slow to build and you know you have a long wait for the whole series (fortunately Sanderson is a fast writer though) but this first book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I even found myself yelling at places (while doing the dishes) \\"Yes you can, yes you CAN, come on, TURN AROUND!\\".     I even convinced my husband to listen to it as well and after much nagging and pushing he agreed to \\"give it a try\\".   I think he was done with it within 3 days..and was practically unreachable the whole time due to having the headphones on! LOL.    I recommend for anyone who likes Mistborn, Lies of Lock Lamorra, WOT, Name of the Wind, SOT etc.
B000001C6M|4.0|All the songs are very good .The only problem here is the production that is terrible. If you like something between heavy / thrash metal with very melodic and high energy solos and music then this is your album. I am a huge fan of Slayer and i like almost all their albums. i would have rate 4,5 or 5 stars this album if it had a better production.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle app for Android is amazing, I love how you can sync it with your Kindle so that if you read few pages on your android it will ask you if you want to go to that page on your Kindle once you start reading. Now I can have all my books on the go.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|getting force close on epic 4g cm7.  installs fine but soon as you click to open force closes everytime. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|I've always been a big fan of this movie and never really understood why it wasn't more popular. But now, watching the director's cut on blu-ray made it feel like a whole new movie. I've watched it many times but, and I can't really put my finger on it, this cut makes it seem like a different flick. Loved it.    I think I've read here and there that the audio or something is wonky. Mine was fine. So I'm not sure if some are bad copies or some people just have better hearing than me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game and other angry birds games,i play this one most of the time  on the train ride to work and coming from work
B004SBS8LA|2.0|For a free game, Amazon really makes it hard to purchase Angry Birds Rio. First you have to download the app. Then you have to search for the game. After the game tells you \\"oh yea, its free, save $0.99\\" the amazon app store says you cant purchase it, because you dont have one-click-purchase turned on. After turning that on, it still gives you the same error.        Double ewe tea EFFE, amazon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|way better than first people shouldnt rate down if it wont work just ask for help because this is a really great game so dont make it look bad
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Not funny, offering angry birds for free only today, let people download the app store and install it, using the EU amazon logins, all working fine - just to tell us then the product is not available in our region. US is not all, there is a whole world beside it! This behavior sucks ... my Nexus One is the same phone as in the US, Amazon is Amazon, sharing the same database ...
B004SBS8LA|1.0|like a bunch of people it wont install for me. i have a droid 2. i had the same problem with angry birds in the android app store. but at least to get around all i had to do was unmount the sd card install, then remount the sd card.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I don't know why everyone is complaining. This is better than the original and plays great on an Evo 4G. Great intro to the new appstore.
B004SCI9BS|4.0|Odd that different users seem to be getting different download bit rates, but I just downloaded this from Amazon mp3 and my tracks are 246kbps (VBR), just checked in my iTunes player.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Way to make it different and keep it entertainment for us. And I can see this is gonna be supported for months to come.  Awesome app.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not all of us have trouble following simple instruction or have reading comprehension problems.    The new Amazon app store is a welcome addition to the android ecosystem and what a better way than to launch with an Angry Birds game.    Users of the other Angry Birds games will be instantly at home since the game play hasn't changed, why fix what isn't broken.  It is a bit odd at first to be busting up something other than pigs but monkeys fall over just as easily.    This game is a great addition to the Angry Birds world (nice to see Rovio getting some of that Hollywood $$) and the app store a great addition to the Android world.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Amazon, you should disclose your geographical restrictions before you make people download your Amazon Appstore app. I'm really not happy, being an Amazon.com customer and all. Major fail
B004J00QLU|1.0|There is no need to use a task killer on Android 2.0 and up. Don't install this... your battery life will suffer and your phone will act strangely. Even Google recommends avoiding task killers.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is great! now an easy place to get Android Apps and not have to dink around with payments I can do it painlessly via Amazon!  AB Rio is great fun and gives a new great twist to the AB saga.  can't wait to get further into it!!
0385333846|5.0|At random points in time I still think of Billy Pilgrim. Obviously, I have never been to war, but this book, more than other war experience books I've read, is the one I feel has best helped me imagine and understand the personal and psychological effects of what it must be like to be a veteran. I'm sure I can't understand it truly, not having experienced it, but there is something about the way Vonnegut wrote Billy Pilgrim that makes me feel like I connect to the madness. There is a passage in this book where Billy Pilgrim envisions a war documentary in reverse, with bombs being sucked out of the sky and the world being repaired, and I don't think any passage from any book has had a more immediate and profound impact on me than that one.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on Verizon Thunderbolt. Easy to install if you already have a amazon log in. All you need is the new amazon market app
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This app wont finish installing on my Droid X. Someone please fix this. This is really annoying. just like this 25 word minimum review. words words words words words words words
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Beautifully designed graphics, plus I appreciate the new objective (freeing birds rather than just destroying the pesky pigs).  Kudos to Team Rovio.  A great way for Amazon to introduce their new App Store.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|works perfectly on T-Mobile g2 rooted with cyanogenmod. so much fun, I do miss the pigs but the premise is the same. The new features are a little hit and miss, but the amount of hits overwhelms the little flaws in the overall package
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Really awesome improvements in this RIO edition over both Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons.  Awards, Trophies, Boss Battles, various enemies and also friendlies to set free. Many more levels to come as well.  Works flawlessly and I love it.  Droid Incredible.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Looks great, feels great, controls are great. Quality soundtrack too. This is just a fun, addicting game that's always challenging but never frustrating. I think the promo video actually undersells it.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|dont know what to do now. i love the graphics. great game.....after playing for a few hours, now it wont open at all..moto droid 1
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the graphics and the game plays very smooth. Great job and keep em coming, please. Btw, I hate 25 word min reviews - sigh...
0756404738|4.0|Not as good as the first book. This book is great, clever and fun to read but 'Kote' is really starting to bug me. Yes, his life has been tough but I wish he would hurry up get over himself, ditch the 'inkeeper' and be Kvothe. Plus I have a hard time liking Denna's character and she just grated on me more as the book went on.
B004SCI9BS|5.0|Horrible bitrate! Only 96kbps?  I know the Strokes are lo-fi but come on.  I would have spent more for the 256kpbs version.  Also, it would be nice if Amazon MP3 told this info ahead of time.  Would have saved me $3.99 cause now I need to buy it again.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Lots of hoops to jump through fort no results.Downloads fine. Will not install though. HTC evo. This app is the only reason I added this amazon market.
B000002KLP|4.0|This is the classic Prince before his mega superstardom days.  His third album proved to be as successful as his second due to the more diverse sound, harder lyrics, and more cutting edge music videos, although MTV were too racist to play them.  Dirty Mind was the first album by Prince to use more rock/New Wave elements in his music.  The powerful title cut, \\"When You Were Mine,\\" \\"Uptown,\\" and \\"Sister\\" were prime examples of the 5'2\\" purple guy doing his best to win more New Wave fans, while \\"Head\\" and \\"Party Up\\" were funky, rawer, sexually explicit, and/or politically explicit and my two favorites on the album (also \\"Uptown\\" too).  \\"Party Up\\" was co-written by Morris Day from The Time and the lyrics were beyond powerful, especially near the end of the song - \\"You're Gonna Have To Fight Your Own Damn War, Cuz We Don't Wanna Fight No More\\" and it repeats itself over and over making any  listener amped up no matter what thery're doin'!  \\"Uptown\\" is simular to \\"Party Up\\" (also a \\"do what you feel\\" song, yet more tame than \\"Party Up\\" because of the lack of profanity and anger).  It foreshadows some of his anti-war/party anthem songs such as like \\"Controversy,\\" \\"1999,\\" \\"Housequake\\" and \\"DMSR.\\"  \\"Head\\" (like the title cut) was one of Prince's first sexually explicit songs that also foreshadowed future hit songs of that nature like \\"Do Me Baby,\\" \\"Jack U Off,\\" \\"Darling Nikki,\\" and \\"Erotic City\\"  Overall, his songs in 1980 were no big deal because the sexual metaphors successfully covered up the explicit words that R&B/Hip Hop artists today blatantly use along with the cursing.  It was'nt until 1984 when \\"Darling Nikki\\" came out that Tipper Gore successfully lobbied to slap a Parental Advisory sticker on almost every album that was released from then up until today.  Despite his stronger and harder rock songs, he was still just an R&B artist until 1983 and his songs were still too raunchy to be played on most radio stations.  All in all, this album is what made Prince what he is today because of the introduction to the raunchiness and harder music.      For You and Prince was the disco/R&B classic era.  Dirty Mind and Controversy was the New Wave classic era.  From 1999 to Sign O Times was the clasic superstardom Prince.  The rest is history!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|this is sio lame. who cares if its free if it wont even work? wont install on original droid, amazon sucks. why couldnt this just be in the regular market.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The flagship app for the launch of this Appstore isn't available in the UK.    It's all very misleading. I have now installed the Appstore for apparently no reason.    Please make it known to the user where an app is available for download and where it isn't.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Amazing, thanks Amazon for giving this away. The graphics are fantastic on my Evo 4g. Love the new gameplay of freeing the birds from cages.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I don't think that people know how to install this app on their Droid X's correctly. This game is by far much improved and works flawlessly on the Droid X.  Music is great and game play is a really nice addition to the series.    Go to settings  Applications  and tap on the check to make it green on \\"Unknown Sources\\"  go back and download the app again  (ALL THIS INFO IS IN THE VIDEO FROM AMAZON)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Ridiculous Amazon....  we are in the android world to be open not to have monopolies...  why do you have geographical restrictions on your market?  I bought million things on amazon, and when I try to download an app on my mobile I get this silly error...  Thank you AMAZON
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you actually read the requirements and limitations, then you will realize that this is (1) for ANDROID phones ONLY that are (2) not on AT&T. SO, if you have at least managed to read through the relatively simple language then you realize that this is either for your phone or it is not.     Requirement issues aside, the instructions provided are VERY easy to follow and VERY simple to do correctly if/when done in order. Angry Birds Rio is a great continuation for those you appreciate and enjoy all the rest of the Angry Birds.     FIVE stars for Amazon, Android and Angry Birds.
1932907009|3.0|I've found this book very helpful in many ways. The problem is that any book that claims to have THE answer or THE formula for a great movie is setting you up for disappointment. I have no doubt that if you follow this formula, you could end up with a career much like Blake Snyder's - two mediocre credits to your name and a whole bunch of uncredited script doctoring jobs. For people who want a little more from their writing career, I would caution you against sticking too closely to Snyder's formula.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome app! Amazon stop letting people post reviews unless they download the app. bunch or morons here leaving bad reviews that have nothing to do with the app.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|If you love phone lockups, this app is for you! Within 2 levels of playing on my Evo 4G - which is solid as a rock no matter what else I throw at it - this game started locking up, hard freezing the phone. I couldn't even get into the Applications list to force close it. After a phone reboot it seemed to work fine - until a few levels later when it froze the phone AGAIN.<br /><br />Graphics are nice, a minor upgrade from the original title and seasons. Regardless, even on the Evo 4G it has moments of severe choppiness. The entire premise is sillier than the original title and the game, itself, got VERY NOISY. All the trapped birds on the screen (that's the premise, folks, not pigs - save birds!) constantly make noises, noises as loud as the Angry Birds. Endlessly. The new \\"scoring\\" page looks like garbage, as well, and it feels like they're trying to make a casual game even more casual. In the levels I played - the 10 I could play throughout phone lock ups - the game was far easier than the original.<br /><br />Sorry to say I can't recommend this, even during the one-day free promotion, because if it locks up my Evo 4G, I'd hate to see how bad it chugs on a Droid phone with a 600MHz processor, and the noise just grates the nerves.
B0049U4NQO|2.0|I haven't read the book yet.  Just wondering why the Kindle edition is more expensive than the hardback copy?  Does that make any sense?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I know this is angry birds we're talking about so you know, the usual is expected but this one takes the graphics and buttery smooth play and animations to another level. good show folks. (and not a bad app store there Amazon) .
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just downloaded amazon app store and downloaded angry birds rio to Droid 2 and HTC EVO for free.  Both work great.  I like the new setup for the game.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|On HTC Desire: An error occurred while purchasing Angry Birds Rio - Please try again.  - FAIL    On PC - Geographical restrictions mean you can't install - FAIL    Very poor showing from Amazon AppStore - Uninstall
B004SBS8LA|5.0|In this version, instead of smashing into the little piggies, the Angry birds are freeing other birds and fighting with monkeys in Rio.<br />Unlike the Seasons, which was a pretty hard to get 3 stars, this version is easier even though you might not get 3 stars on the first try, which makes it more enjoyable.<br />The visuals (color and background art) have been upgraded and I think is better than the original version.<br />Well worth the price.
4770031246|5.0|So far I've tried six or seven different recipes from this beautiful book. The full color photos of each lovingly packed bento are fabulous and there are photos of cooking techniques also. The instructions are clear and simple to follow and the food is delicious.  I love the tamagoyaki and make them often. There is also advice on how to pack foods safely and attractively. To be honest though, I've only made a few of the things in here for bento lunches.  They make great light dinners too!  Even if you have no interest in bento, the recipes are a delicious mix of Japanese and world cooking and this book is sure to be a useful and beautiful addition to any kitchen.
1439107955|5.0|[[ASIN:1439107955 The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer]]    In spite of the almost overwhelming academic talent of the author, he seems  to be consumed with his mission of making this book popular reading by the  average individual.  While the information is particularly appealing to those  of us who have had experience with cancer, in my case prostate CA in 1995,  colon CA in 2001 and outer ear melanoma in 2007, the book is so well-written  that you almost forget that you're reading such a technical medical journal.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Huff post had a wide selection of news topics from current domestic and world events, to dining, green living, and gossip. Fun app to catch up on what's what at the end of the day.  Only problem is some articles require external links.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet: It is so much smoother it's incredible, better than the lite beta version. And - it saves your user data from the free version, just takes out the ads!!!!!
B002ZG98FU|5.0|Loving almost all Rachel McAdams movies I decided to give this movie a try. I loved the trailer and it had well known actors like Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford so I knew that it had to be half way decent.     As I started watching the movie I found that movie's theme and message connected with me. I think that this is not only a comedy but also a tearjerker at some moments. I would recommend it to all who love comedies and romance!
B004KA9MQO|3.0|This sounds ok, but I'm still waiting for Jennifer to deliver that knock out soulful album that we all know is within her.  I don't like the computerized sound, she would sound much better with all real and live musicians.    She should also consider getting with the writers from the movie Dreamgirls, because the songs she performed in that movie were all very good!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Do a region check first next time. Waste of time to download the app, entering all your information and then get informed that it doesn't work for you.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If you have a samsung captivate you are screwed... Your phone does not allow applications to be installed from &quot;unknown sources&quot; you need to root.

Not a big fan of having to use the amazon app store but it is ok...

B002ZG981E|5.0|Christopher Nolan has become one of those select few directors who can bring complex and subversive ideas to projects that can be dressed to effectively entertain the movie-going public. He's had a consistent track record and major success with his two Batman films that only at this point in his career (with a script he's worked on for over a decade) could he possibly deliver a movie like this under the cautious eyes of a major studio. And the gamble paid off. Inception was a crowd pleaser and critical hit, not to mention one of the handful of great films in the fog of a dismal summer lineup for 2010. Fortunately for us, the movie inspires if not demands us to return to it repeatedly and the blu-ray edition is the best way to keep returning to it.<br /><br />The presentation of the film is perfect in high-definition. Great detail is on display and colors and contrast are well-balanced. The DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio track is very robust, too. The sound effects and Hans Zimmer's score really stand out here. There's no commentary track from Nolan (I don't think he's done one since Memento) but the Extraction Mode - a collection of specific behind-the-scenes mini-docs you can play during the film or separately - takes care of that, providing more than enough info about the challenges of bringing this film into fruition. All together, you've got under an hour of material here and I prefer watching them separately. And that's on the first disc.<br /><br />The second disc has a fascinating documentary about dream research, a comic-book style prologue to how DiCaprio and Gordon-Levitt acquired the job they perform at the beginning of the movie (it's decent but it doesn't give you anything that'll make you appreciate the film any more), 10 isolated tracks from the film's score (very nice), conceptual art and promotional materials. I haven't bothered with the bd-live content yet.<br /><br />All in all, a great package. The blu-rays are wonderful and they even sweetened the deal with throwing in a movie-only dvd and digital copy code. If you enjoyed the movie during its theatrical run or want it in your collection, this is the best way to obtain it.e-only dvd and digital copy code. If you enjoyed the movie during its theatrical run or want it in your collection, this is the best way to obtain it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This ad free version is much more enjoyable, seems like it runs smoother as well. Download it for free while you can! 25 word minimum
B004SBX112|5.0|Everyone who is giving it a one for it not working or not available in your region is a fking retard. It's a review on the -game- not your crappy phone. It's stupid idiots like you that make it difficult to find a good app or game to play. If you can't play it or opened the app don't rate it. Anyways this add on is pretty sweet and is updated often. Most definitely worth paying the 99 cents so you don't have the damn ads in the way lagging your phone or covering the screen. So instead of buying your fat ass a dollar burger at Mcdonalds buy this game. It'll last longer. It's also perfect for kids.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It runs faster, and has better graphics than any of the previous Angry Birds.  The gameplay experience is much more polished.

Anyways this game has everything you loved in The Original Angry birds and Seasons and then some. It looks a lot smoother and plays fantastic. The new additions are fun and makes it new and refreshed. This is a brand spankin' new Angry Birds here. This game is a Must Have, you'd be stupid not to download it right now since it's free. Even if it was 99 cents I would still buy it. So if you are one of the few people that didn't download while it was free. BUY IT. So instead of buying your fat ass a dollar burger at Mcdonalds go buy this game. It'll last longer and it won't make you feel bad when you are done with it. Yeah It's also perfect for kids.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why release this in US only??!! Whats the timeframe to roll this out to the other countries of the world?  Talk about the best way to p*ss off your customers right from the start - will DEFINITELY be sticking with the Market for Apps after this!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A lot nicer looking then the other angry birds, runs smoothly on the captivate and it didn't give me trouble on install. The download issues are most likely because everyone is trying to download this app while it is free.
B00314VYNE|5.0|I bought this item for my granddaughter. She is a huge jessie fan and this doll is very hard to find you can't find jessie in stores and alot of the other websites i checked she was sold out.But after looking for a long time i finally found her on amazon.com. and i was surprised to not see \\"sold out\\" in big red letters so i ordered it on the spot and it made my granddaughter so happy.          thank you
B004SBS8LA|1.0|it's impossible to have a region locked app store... it's a non-sense policy. i wish that amazon explain this restriction and won't continue on this way.
B004QPOVG4|5.0|I Have all the AC/DC DVD's. I'm kinda disappointed that either a song was omitted or they didn't do it in concert, \\"Anything Goes\\".
B004SBS8LA|1.0|After seeing the screenshots, and being an avid player of angry birds I was eager to explore this new game. However, after going through all the obstacles that amazon presents (yes, I'm a frequent customer, but it's still a huge hassle) I downloaded the game.  Unfortunately, when attempting to install, it just gives a vague installation error. I've tried at least 10 or more times of constantly redownloading the game to no avail. I'm very disappointed and fear they won't have this fixed until the \\"free\\" part has expired.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Doesn't matter whether I dl this app from android or amazon market, every time I select a book it kicks me out to the mobile website, saying the order cannot be completed from the mobile site, please add to wishlist and purchase from computer.... Wtf is the point of the app then?!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Yes you do need to do a little work to set up the Amazon account with 1-click but its really not that difficult and is NOT a reflection of this app. It would need to be done for any app from Amazon. Big deal. The game is great! Going to be calling in sick tomorrow...
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This site's is amazoning! Thank you!  It's great.  Much better than anything else! The details are wow.  Oh and thanks for the paid version number more ads.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Can not download the Amazon App store on the biggest wireless provider in the country. AT&T doesn't support this. It would have been nice for them to mention that in all the time they've been hyping up this game and the Amazon app stop recently. Everyone except AT&T Android customers are able to play the game.

B004RF2KAC|5.0|I love anything Jennifer Hudson sings! She could sing the theme song to Facts of Life and make it sound half decent.  For those that aren't enjoying this new CD I have to ask how often you listen to her original cd or the Dreamgirls soundtrack.  It's good to finally have an R&B singer with her own voice who doesn't have to be compared to someone (ie. Keyshia Cole compared to Mary J. Blige).  She may not write her own songs but she puts her self in to every song she sings and I absolutely love it. It's also good to see an artist that isn't just churning out cd's every year because the industry says thats the norm.
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|Disconnected and implausible plot with horrible sound and subtitles. There were long scenes in which the dialogue was almost inaudible. The subtitles were so small as to be nearly unreadable AND white subtitles on a pale background......<br />I found it generally boring with little satisfaction as each character's \\"situation\\" was resolved.<br />Give me Gran Torino any day for a movie with plot and heart.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this App. Use it more than any other. It's easy to navigate, switch versions. You can highlight and bookmark. The MANY different bible versions are web-based, BUT you can download versions as you like. So if your network is down, you've still got your bible in your phone! But my favorite thing of all? Audio. NIV, NASB and NLT (and probably others) are all available with audio versions. LOVE THIS!
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I love this new music from Jennifer Hudson.  She is one of the best singers in the music business today.  My favorite tracks are \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Everybody Needs Love\\".  They are groovy dance tracks with a retro tone. These songs contain a positive message for anyone who is lonely and down and out. Jennifer's songs are very personal, but I can pick up on themes that I can apply to my life.  This is what makes her music stand out for me.  The title track \\"I Remember Me\\" and \\"I Got This\\" are personal reminders that I am a special and valuable person.  These two songs will definitely strengthen my spirit when I need a pick me up. The song \\"Believe\\" is an autobiographical song about the faith of a special neighbor.  I like the spiritual tone of this song.  I love the beat of the track \\"Where You At\\".  \\"Feeling Good\\" has been covered many times, but Jennifer makes this song her own with her sensual vocals.  I love horns playing on this tune. \\"No One Gonna Love You\\" is a soulful jam.  I love the piano playing on this track.  \\"Still Here\\" is a song that makes me remember all the people who have passed away recently.  Their spirit lingers in my mind and my heart.  This song is very touching. \\"Why Is It So Hard\\" is a song about the difficulty about loving someone.  This song is a smooth jam that relaxes me. \\"Gone\\" is a sweet love song about a special person. \\"I Remember Me\\" is an entertaining R and B album.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds Rio is a fun additive game. The graphics are a step up from the old version - nice 3d feel environments. Installed and runs extremely smooth on the Sprint Evo 4G. Excellent Amazon store experience. $.99 is a no brainer - buy today!

B004GHBQ7O|5.0|Don't be fooled by armchair critics, this is a very good concert video. As usual, Green Day provided a high-quality product at an incredibly fair and affordable price. What's not to like about the DVD? The video quality is perfect; the sound quality is perfect; the entertainment value is perfect. Not only that but the older songs were welcome---cool--Awesome As F**k. They are a fun band to watch both live and on DVD, and I HIGHLY recommend this.  Don
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I like it.  Its about time they changed things up a little.  Just as addicting as the original and Seasons.  Great that it was free for a limited time too.

B001EGFQNU|3.0|This album does indeed contain all of OMD's 'hits', but it comes up short of actually containing all the best of OMD's work. I mean how could you say that Forever Live and Die, Secret and Milky Way are anywhere close to being as inventive and brilliant as 'Almost', '2nd thought' and 'Stanlow'? Where OMD succeeded to me was in their groundbreaking electronic work of the 1980 Organisation album. Where they failed was in trying to become too commercial and 'poppy' in the mid-80's, even though these commercial tracks may have appealed more to the masses. Skip this album if you really want to hear what sets OMD apart...get their earlier works instead, if you don't already have them.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|fortunately i can get it for my ipod touch. the 99 cents is worth it to avoid this racket. unistalling amazon app store too. very disappointed. usually i love amazon...
B004FECNIO|5.0|First off, this film is not for everyone. I understand the dissapointment upon theatrical release. People saw the Spielberg name and cool visuals and instantly thought it would be an exciting family film.    That's not the case though. This is a very dark and very emotional movie. It deals with subjects rarely touched upon by most modern films.     Without spoiling anything, this film brings philosophy and spiritual thinking to the science-fiction genre. It is amazing to look at thanks to the brillant art direction, cinematography, and lighting along with the excellent direction by Spielberg himself.    If you can surrender yourself to its story, you will be rewarded with a film that is truly beautiful in both appearance and story.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|The first BluRay received was defective---skipped 3/4ths through the movie then froze. Emailed Amazon and a new copy was delivered the next day! Great movie...great service!  Thanks!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works brilliantly. Much better looking than original Angry Birds. Better quality music and visuals. There are not as many levels currently, however it does appear that more levels will unlock later in the year.  Easily recommendable.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Joe has released his best album to date with twelve new songs,everyone is a listening pleasure. I cant say enough about this cd dust bowl.
0375703764|5.0|This book was just beautiful. Not only was it wonderfully written, but it didn't conform to how people think the \\"standard\\" novel should be written. It is also one of those books that I couldn't get out of my head after finishing it. Highly recommend this novel!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|cant even download it.  what a waste of effort. why is this not on droid market? words wo wo wo wo wo wo www what crap
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Real good, love the new graphics, people please stop giving bad ratings just because your phone can't handle this game or is to hard to set up a account ect ect, come on bottom line is that this game is outstanding.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I find it hard to browse with unless you know the product specifically. I prefer the website over this anyday. I like the fact that you can check on your products shopping progress within the application.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|graphics differently have been updated. looks a whole lot better. runs great looks great. comes with 2 themes the third won't be out until may. I can't wait HTC EVO.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great new addition to the Angry Birds family. The graphics and music are much improved, and the game play is as fun as always. Installing using the new Amazon App Store was fast and easy. Too bad others are unable to figure it out or read plain english that indicates it is only available in the US. This is a five star game and will be tons of fun to play through.
B0000CNY27|5.0|Just some thoughts...<br /><br />Escape From New York (1981) is one of those movies that has stayed with me throughout the years, even if I go many many years without seeing it.  It has that kind of power.  This movie stars a lot of John Carpenter alumni from previous films he made, such as Donald Pleasence, Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, and Charles Cyphers.  Kurt Russell, who plays Snake Plissken, went on to star in Carpenter's remake of The Thing (1982).  I like Isaac Hayes in his role as the self-proclaimed The Duke Of New York.  The Duke is my favorite character in the movie.  I like the vehicle he drives as well.  Donald Pleasence is great in his role as the President of the United States.  Basically the plot is this:  The future has a crime rate that is out of control, and New York City is now a maximum security prison.  The President has been captured by inmates after Air Force One crashes in New York, and a man named Snake Plissken has the goal of freeing the President within 24 hours so the President can attend an international summit.  Does he make it?<br /><br />This is a movie that has become a cult classic.  The special effects are low tech, the budget is low, but the movie is awesome.  The musical score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth is great as usual.<br /><br />I highly recommend this classic low budget movie.
0747230617|3.0|it was just an \\"ok\\" transaction. my book feel apart when i got it but i knew it wasn't in great condition...I just glued it back together.
1569242739|5.0|The title says it all.  This book has the most delicious cupcake recipes ever.  Not only are they scrumptious, but they are also visually appealing.  I have to say, this is a small cookbook that everyone should own.  The recipes are easy, and everybody loves the cupcakes whether they're vegan or not.  Highly recommend.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|It's a bit uneven at times - but I really can't find anything bad to say about this very fun, very entertaining book. This is book two, so don't even think about starting here - grab the first and enjoy it also. I hope there are more books to come, and not just the \\"third\\" day. This has the makings of a really legendary series.
B000YL98RG|5.0|\\"Hitch\\" is a highly enjoyable farce which I purchased a couple of years ago, enjoyed and passed on.  I repurchased it when a friend moved to Los Angeles and was welcomed with a newspaper interview as \\"the real-life Hitch, only better looking.\\"  You can check all this out at [...].  RW
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Downloaded the appstore and tried unsuccessfully to install the the application. Received \\"Application not installed\\" error without much of a lead on how to proceed.  Evo 4g<br /><br />Update:  I was able to install the application after removing the smdl2tmp1.asec file from the SD\.android_secure directory.  Now it works well.  Pretty, fun, and nicely updated graphics and mechanical elements while maintaining the fun and feel of the original.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its Angry birds.. Do I need to say anything else? Apparently I do to fill the twenty five word minimum. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|So Amazon appear to have shot themselves in the foot here, by blocking people around the world from accessing their App store (only after taking my one-click details - legal?) they will just force people to get cracked copies of the app and lose a lot of customer loyalty
B004LP601S|5.0|This is a spectacular album, and don't miss out because of any sort of negative review. There is not a single song that I don't love on this album, and im not one of those people where if it is by Panic! at the disco I love it. I have listened to this album and every song has meaning, and its very cool to listen to the transition from hard core to softer throughout the album. This is my favorite panic album, and don't wait another minute to listen to this great album.
0385738757|5.0|The Maze Runner took be by surprise, leaving me waiting impatiently for The Scortch Trials. It was AMAZING! The story was way more intense, the rules are gone, and now people are truely going insane. I would love to say much much more about this sequel, but I don't want to say too much or give anything away. READ THIS BOOK!
1591843790|5.0|Recently, I decided to stop reading marketing books because they all said the same thing. Had this book been written by anyone different or not pulled on my Apple fangirl cord I might not have read this book. I'm glad, however, that I decided to. This book is refreshing, a quick read, yet also one that keeps you thinking for a while. I actually gave myself several days to let it marinate before I wrote about it. After letting it digest for a few days I went back to revisited my underlines and scribbles, and as directed set myself an action plan. Guy's sign off at the end of the book is \\"Be well, do good, and kick butt\\" and that may very well sum up the entire message of the book!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Not sure how powerful of device is needed to run this new Angry Birds app, but I have some cutting edge devices by Samsung and the app still lags. It's really horrible!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Obviously anyone who is anybody has played Angry Birds and has most likely loved it. This new version is equally as good if not better since you are now freeing birds instead of destroying pigs.
B0031CO3WA|1.0|I bought this for my son with high hopes as previous Schleich toys have been top notch.  This, however, was a major disappointment.  Parts do not fit well together and plastic is brittle so that some of the posterior wings have broken off.  I would strongly discourage you from buying this.  The barn, safari truck, 4 wheel drive vehicle and horse trailer, go for them, but avoid the plane.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Downloads but won't install on evo. In US and have amazon account. If I try to unmount SD card, it says SD card is required. Any ideas?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This plays great on the Motorola Xoom and has been updated - it looks a bunch sharper with overall smoother play and better graphics.     These birds are so angry!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I liked this movie as it is very informative. Although I have to say that I was already aware of many of the malpractices shown especially in the meat industry for past couple of years and I have already made my choice for better life-style. But the movie doesn't give a solution for the dilemma of McDonald's $1 burger versus more expensive vegetables in the grocery stores -- especially for the poorer class.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Rovio chose to distribute through this limited store rather than the 'real' Market - let the 1* reviews flood in!  Quite happy with the other Angry Birds games, but this one is, literally, unplayable.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Following an advert in the metro this morning was looking forward to this. Was able to get the appstore but not the app. A disgruntled UK user.  In this case - Amazon Fail...
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Been rolling with the ad-laden market app since it was released.  The ads are a PITA!  They are always in a key part of the screen and when the 3G signal is weak (i.e., at my desk at work), loading a new ad makes for choppy game play.   So happy they've finally released an ad-free version.  Double happy that I scored it for free!   Works great-HTC Incredible
0061726826|5.0|Delirium reminded me of several dystopian books that I loved, such as The Hunger Games, Uglies, and Matched. The fact that love is looked as a disease makes it seem even more daunting and important, because people hate it and it is forbidden. I can't imagine not being able to show that I care for my family, friends, and many other people in my life. I can't imagine someone wanting to get rid of the most amazing emotion possible. This premise of this story<br />was just so amazing.<br />Lena was a pretty sweet character that was trying to follow society, that is until she meets Alex. I really liked Alex, he was sweet, strong, and motivated. I liked that the romance took time to develop and that it wasn't instantaneous. The book has a few slow parts that felt like the pacing of the book was a bit off. The ending was also rather sudden and definitely left Oliver with somewhere to go in the series. This is definitely not the first book to have love be a disease, but the way that it developed was more enjoyable and gorgeous.<br />Oliver's writing was gorgeous and enchanting that left me wanting more. She entwined two characters that want the simplicity of love. I would recommend Delirium to anyone that loves Dystopian novels or enjoyed her first book, Before I Fall.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|not in my region such a joke/ fail by amazon. close your crap appstore and leave it to the proper market. rubbish rubbish rubbish rubbish rubbish idiots.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is the perfect time waster. The gameplay is simple, and the levels do get progressively harder. I like it, the rest of the family LOVES it! And this version is ad free. The ads seems to make the game lag at times. I imagine there are no such problems in this one. Definitely worth the money!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love this app. just a tad pain to set up but once you are through....watch out! angry birds is in a new world! love the 3-D look! works well with my LG Ally!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Thank you Amazon!  Finally I can play my favorite game without ads obscuring the structures I'm trying to destroy.  Upgrade saves progress, so don't worry about losing your saved game.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|So, dear Amazon Appstore creators, what made you think it would be a good idea to restrict access to your flagship app (and as such I see the first free app on day 1 of the store)?    Didn't you think that people all around the world would be pretty annoyed by this?    I for one am not a happy camper right now!    I seriously hope you wont repeat this!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great so far, although first few screens are very easy to get 3 stars.    Thanks for providing this Amazon.    Next to get the $0.99 Regular and Seasons Angry Birds without the ANNOYING ads.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why Worldwide users can buy \\"Kindle App\\" for Android Terminals on Google Market, but we cant make the same on Amazon Appstore?   This sucks.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am living the look and feel if the new AB RIO... It looks awesome on my EVO... Thanks Roxio for another wonderful title. I look forward to besting all of the new levels.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rooted droid x. No problems. Installs and plays fine... Why do I need 25 words to describe this? Still not there? Come on! There, 25.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This new version is a slight change in the original Angry Birds UI, for the better. This new UI is more polished and exiting. i for one like the new direction with the same simple and addicting gameplay that we all love and come to expect from Rovio.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just started playing but it looks to be the best one yet. Better graphics, cute story, etc... I am sorry for the people that can not play this title yet, like At&t customers. But instead of giving it one star, call AT&T and complain. After all having more choices is a good thing. Its one of the thing that sets android users apart from ...well lets just say...those other guys.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I don't understand why a game made by a European company about a film set in south America is only available in the US? surely we're at a point in time when location doesn't matter that much!
B003BKF696|5.0|One of the tags almost describes the album perfectly: beautiful melancholy.  The album has a darker tone, but it's not overwhelming.  The album plays in an almost linear fashion with only subtle hooks and track making way to track in a very fitting fashion.  Musically, it's complex despite the slow pace driven by Matt Berninger's fantastic vocals and strong rhythms.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I got disappointed when the app store after downloading it and signing up it mention that the download is not allow for this region. That is the worse customer service ever
B004SBS8LA|1.0|why would they let european customers register and install the app only to see the message: the app store is not available in your region. poor cs.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Took some time to get running on rooted nook color but figured out pretty quick.  Real smooth graphics and no ads which used to lag the game.  When your addicted to angry birds you find a way to get the app installed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is fun, same as other angry birds versions. Some people giving one star for installation issues are not rating the game. Perhaps amazon needs a better review system in general as I have seen so many reviews on various items that get low reviews based on the company or the delivery etc.  I will say that if you never installed an app via amazon what an annoyance..the first time.  You need to install the amazon AppStore app., not installed yet? Then it will install. If you ever bought mp3's , you go through the same type of thing.  Don't have your phone set for third party apps? You need to set that up too, under settings on your phone.  Then after all that, you need to install the angry birds.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I wondered why the 1 star reviews. Only available in US. Don't worry, I'm sure it will be available everywhere soon. It really is better than the original in my opinion.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have Android 2.2 on my phone, Amazon Appstore for Android installed, 1-click set up properly and Angry Birds Rio is the ONLY APP out of my 5 downloaded apps today that WILL NOT INSTALL!! Awesome job! I have deleted, re-downloaded the app, rebooted my phone and still get \\"Application not installed.\\" WTF.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Lack of availability in the UK is inexcusable under any circumstances.  Fix this now if you actually want to have any traction in the market.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|How are people in Europe supposed to get this application if people like Amazon, wont let you download it.  It's supposed to be FREE and yet they put restrictions on where it can be downloaded. Why hasn't ROVIO done anything about this, surely it's there responsibility to make sure we can all get this.  Amazon Appstore #FAILED
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the smoothest and most efficient app that I've found for quickly noting things on Android. It also automatically stores all notes in the cloud, which really comes in handy if you have irreplaceable notes stored on your phone.
B004L49K20|5.0|I've had this iTunes release for months and this album is by far the strongest Duran Duran effort for many years. I have all their albums and this is definitely the most addictive since Astronaut. The songs are smart, funky, melodic, and grow on you more and more. My favorite track: The Man Who Stole a Leopard. This song is just classic and original, with a sensuous feel like no other. The orchestration is excellent on all the tracks and Simon sounds just perfect after all these years. They proved to me that all you need is indeed now because this album stands on its own, regardless of their past efforts. My only question is why the ugly album cover? But the music is just priceless....I've played it into the ground and still ready for more.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The camera acts up horribly in this. Its almost un playable in its current state. At times I can't even see my bird after pulling back to launch it.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Much better than the original, but zooming on htc evo is messed up for the second world.  Better ui, no ads, cumbersome amazon appstore install
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I surely miss the reason why so many people have rated this app low. It's free, for God's sake! Go get it! I wonder what Amazon will come with next..
B0013FSL0C|5.0|Excellent, for many people do not believe in therapy, I understand very well the series because my family came from cuba. THERAPY was the only thing we accept    the exile. Gabriel BYRNE is excellent as the therapist, I went to many in 43 years living under the idea that that some days sometimes the depression does not appear.  Although, in holidays the problems come again.TO LISTEN THE PROMBLEMS OF THE OTHER PEOPLE IS THE BEST THING WE LEARNED OURSELVES. I LIKE THE SERIES   BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH MANY SITUATIONS IN LIFE AND IT IS HIGHLY ENTERTAINING.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The twist of freeing caged birds is a lot of fun. Installing the Amazon Appstore was fast and easy on my phone (original Droid).
0061729078|4.0|Huxley gets to the essence of the psychedelic experience, he articulates every aspect very well. It's quite impressive to make such a personalized experience sound so appealing and universal. It's not JUST about the trip, it's about what makes up the trip. In Heaven and Hell, he mostly speaks of visual arts from different cultures and time periods, with astonishing insights into possible thought patterns of said times, as well as mentioning insanity numerous times and goes into religion a bunch of times in both books, lots of religious overtones. Heaven and Hell was an interesting sort of history lesson though. Both books are gripping and impressive. Definitely recommended for anyone interested in psychedelia.
B004SBX112|5.0|Yes, you can still get the free version if you don't mind the ads. If you've thrown away hours and hours of your life playing these games (as I have), you know how annoying those ads can get after a while. I would have paid even more money than this to get rid of the ads, so thank you for the bargain.<br />If you haven't yet played this game, go grab the free version and try it out. It is a great casual time-killer game that you can play while sitting in a waiting room, etc, or you can just play it for hours and hours rather than sleeping. The choice is yours.<br />I think that once you get into the game, however, you'll start to get annoyed by the ads and you'll consider paying the small price for this ad-free version.<br />I was worried that it would overwrite my game and I'd lose all my saved progress, but it did not, either on my Droid Incredible nor on my Galaxy Tab.<br /><br />UPDATE (4/18/11): No Easter content update?? For the paid version???<br />UPDATE (4/20/11): STILL no update. Rovio is taking the blame... their twitter feed is just a long, sad litany of them telling people \\"sorry, it is our fault, should be there soon\\" etc. They are saying this is new to them and they'll do better next time. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt, but I'd REALLY like to see this update happen before we actually get to Easter.<br />UPDATE (4/21/11): Update finally pushed out. I hope all parties do better next time.
0307454541|5.0|The plot is expertly and cleverly crafted, the exposition is detailed and intriguing (although a bit lengthy) and most important, the book's uncompromisingly addictive. I don't think I've read another book as fast. If I didn't have work this would've been finished more than 24 hours ago. The middle of the book (around pages 200-490) was my favorite part. It was just extraordinarily gripping. I'm slightly disappointed by the ending as well. I can't pinpoint it but it's soured my overall view of the story a bit. But the ride is totally worth it, and it just may be my new favorite book.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my rooted Incredible.  The graphics have improved nicely.  Nice sounds effects too.  My favorite time killer at work is back and better than ever.  Lets see if they can keep it interesting.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|us represents just around 4% of the world population, would be great to make it available for the other 96%...extremly poor performance of both  amazon and rovio
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Very good read. Only thing I didn't enjoy was the inclusion of the POV of so many minor characters. The main characters' chapters included in this one are all enjoyable to read.
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki has really done wonders with this book. He points out the authentic way to build \\"trust\\", one of 3 critical factors at being \\"Enchanting\\". He also has great balance in this book on using and harnessing the power of social media. I love the \\"Enchantment can happen with a Facebook status update\\" line. I absolutely recommend this book. It's perfect for entrepreneurs, B2B, B2C or SMB's peoples...or anyone interested in building relationships, and your business.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I actually first read this book years ago, and picked it up again after seeing previews for the television show that will be based on the novels.  I loved this book, and in addition to being an epic fantasy, this series impressed me with the various points of view used.  While a number of novels now use the different points of views of various characters, I feel that this novel is one of the best I have ever seen at actually developing three-dimensional characters that you can relate to--there is no simple 'good' and 'bad' team in this series, and it makes for much more interesting reading.  I highly recommend the entire series, and look forward to the next one!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome, runs excellent on my nexus s, game play is fun, graphics are awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet see sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloaded, won't install.  I have the same problem with Angry Birds from the App store, but there I can unmount the SD card and install and everything's fine.  Here, I need the SD card to install, but the install fails.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Big song and dance made about this but you can only get it if based in the US. I'd rather the Amazon app would have told me this before letting me go to the trouble of setting up 1-click payment and a payment method!
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I THOUGHT THIS WAS 1 OF THE DOPEST 3D MOVIE SO FAR!! STEP IT UP WAS A LIL BETTER THOUGH
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I love my kindle, and I generally don't mind when the kindle price is the same as the mass market paperback (usually aroun $8.99) but I draw the line when the paperback collection is being sold for a full $10 less than the kindle collection.  I know it's really hard to turn a manuscript into an ebook, and the costs of eInk has really been going up lately, but still, at nearly $2.50 per book, I would almost rather have second copies of the paperbacks than overpay for the kindle versions.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|...and better than ever.  Very smooth gameplay on my X.  This game is soo addicting.  Keep it up Rovio, another must have game.  I will get my life back once completed.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm new to the Angry Bird Scene....with a new not so modern phone (LG Optimus S)  With that said...I read the steps carefully & now i'm enjoying this game.   Clean, Smooth, no lag, & fun.....a must get!!!  Ohhh yes very important.....No AD LINKS. YES BABY!!!
0060765488|4.0|At the time of the publication of C.S. Lewis's The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe the world was still in the early stages of recovery from the largest, most devastating, and most costly known war to mankind at the time, 1950. WWII was truly a battle of good verses evil, and good prevails. What exactly C.S. Lewis's experiences were during the war are unknown to me however, I venture to say that he knew about the evils mankind was capable of and also knew of the good man was capable of.  He lived in Europe at this time and had first hand experience in the dealings of daily life during war.  It appears that in this book Lewis is clearly writing about his experiences, but to the extent that his allegories are based on direct or indirect experiences aren't completely clear to me. What is clear is he wrote of his beliefs, his own faith, and how they came to be questioned and ultimately restored through the writing of this story.<br /><br />These themes of good versus evil, loyalty, prudence and faith become evident as the story unfolds. Truth be told there are numerous themes that apply to this story. The theme of maturation could be applied; you see the children are dependant on adults in the beginning of the story for their well-being. Then they pass though the stage of trust versus mistrust, questioning the very existence of Narnia, and arrive at the stage of innovation versus guilt. During this stage they figure out how to solve problems and over come difficulties on their own. You see them take control over their destiny, as they become the rulers of Narnia. This can be applied to the people of Germany, who so susceptible and dependent on their government after World War I that they crave a solution, that is then brought to them in the form of a new charismatic leader who promises them not only a rebuilt life, but that they, the people of Germany, will be come the rulers of the world. This is similar to Edmond's plight in the story. Themes of unselfishness and selflessness are all throughout the story and example of this is the role of Mr. Tunnis who knows that he will be stoned if the witch finds out that he did not do as she wished, which was to notify her that a daughter of Eve had entered Narnia. He still decided to go against her wishes and sacrificed himself for the safety of the Lucy.  This selflessness is also seen in the beginnings of the Third Reich by those who were willing to give up their new found sustained lives, their comfortable economic conditions that their leader had provided, to grow, expand, and protect the safety of their country. These citizens, these soldiers also conformed to the requirements of their government out of fear, much like Mr. Tunnis.  They too wanted their lives to change realizing that their world was becoming increasingly irrational. They continued to support their government despite of this, out of fear, out of conformity, and out of a sense of obligation.<br /><br />While undoubtedly there is a strong undertone of the religious beliefs of the author, as a student and of history and sociology I found myself continually drawn to the similarities of Narnia and the German town of Dachau. The people who lived in this town did not support the Third Reich and were proud to not be active participants in the dealings of the government, having heard rumors of the deeds that went against their own beliefs of humanity and dignity. Like the children who heard Lucy's description of Narnia, they did not believe that this was happening in their back yard. They instead chose to believe the reassurances of the government they did not support. Their understanding, their belief system did not support the stories that they were being told, just as the other children could not comprehend the stories that Lucy was telling them.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Beware.. after you got prompted to enter all your details like Mobilenumber, Credit Card etc. This Message appears: \\"The Amazon Appstore for Android is not yet available in your region.\\" Why AFTER collection all the personal information. Very Bad Amazon
B004SBS8LA|5.0|people are rating the system in order to attain this app and that's dumb.  the game has been a little revamped and graphics are smooth.  finally, there's more to do other than to just kill pigs.  great game!  FYI you must enable &quot;allow &quot; apps outside of the Google market to install anything from the amazon market.  its under your settings and very simple to do.  good luck
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love this app.  It works like a dream. I've read several books on it already. Love that I can sync my kindle and this app to the same place where I left off reading.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|By all means it is not easy to get the game on Captivate (any AT&T phone) but it is doable.  The game itself is the jewel of todays marketing - promotes a movie, creates awareness of a new store (grand opening Amazon App) and boast sales on Apple Store but creating word-to-mouth campaign. It is very easy game for the first 15 levels (hook-up the new and warm-up existing players), moderate for the next 15. Casual gamers may stop here with some degree of satisfaction, and it is getting harder for the next 30 levels. For really hard-core gamers there is more - find the pineapples. This one is going to be epic! With all this marketing the developer has got what he needed. Enjoy free updates and more similar games to come!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I have to ask that question. Where did she get that name, Temple, in the first place? It's an odd name but just asking. Anyway Clare Danes is completely unrecognizable as the autistic genius Temple Grandin whose age ranges from 14 to 40 in this movie. This movie is truly an inspiration about Temple's amazing life. First, she's diagnosed with autism at 4 years old and suggested to be sent to a mental hospital. Her mother (played wonderfully by Julia Ormond) refuses to do so and works hard at reaching her. I don't know the exact moment when Temple started talking but she doesn't quit.    As she gets older, Temple is sent to a boarding school where she gets to ride horses and bonds with science teacher, Professor/Doctor Carlock, (played beautifully by David Staitharn). He reaches out to her as a friend, teacher, and mentor as well.     Temple spends a summer on her Aunt and Uncle's cattle ranch in Arizona. There she has an epiphany with the livestock. Her aunt is played by Catherine O'Hara. The film shows how Temple's mind thinks in visual pictures and how she relates to the world.    She goes to Franklin Pierce College in New Hampshire where she must prove her machine helps her to calm down. She goes to graduate school for animal husbandry in Arizona where she encounters sexism, male chauvinism, and harsh treatment in a predominantly male-dominated field. Even though Temple dresses like a cowgirl almost all of the time and eats jello or yogurt, she doesn't fit with the guys nor does she try. She's much happier with the animals particularly the cattle that goes to slaughter. Temple's driven to improve the cattle's final days at the slaughterhouses.    At the same time, Temple's demeanor is often strange because of her autism. She lives with it but it doesn't define her existence. That's the what the message is all about. This movie does prove how far Temple was determined to go.    In the special features, I wished that they added more about Temple's life, a biography,or more to understand her. They offer a brief five minutes of the making of the film.     Still, it's an extraordinary piece of film-making that would have easily won a Best Actress Academy Award for Clare Danes but she was already awarded an Emmy and Golden Globe Award for her performance in this role. Hopefully some day, the screens will have movies of high quality and substance like this to inspire us.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Great concept.  New graphics and gameplay.  I enjoyed the game quite a bit.  I like that fact that it's not all given to you all at once.  There are other episode to look forward to the rest of the year.  Why not 5 stars?  Because it is simpler.  Getting \\"3 stars\\" on each level wasn't as difficult as \\"Seasons\\" or even the regular game.  Overall, it's still a welcome addition to my Droid X
B003UESJHO|5.0|Mark Wahlberg may have been the main role as Mickey Ward, a Lowell born and raised boxer, with his overbearing mother, Alice Ward, played brilliantly by Melissa Leo (an Oscar winning performance as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award and the Golden Globe Award). Christian Bale plays his older half brother, Dicky Englund, in his Oscar winning performance. He also won the Golden Globe as well.     Both Leo and Bale submerge themselves into their characters almost unrecognizable at times. You just want to smack the sense out of Dicky sometimes but you can't help to like him even if he wasted away on drugs and alcohol in a crackhouse. Leo's Oscar speech may have earned her a spot on the permanent Oscar reel highlights of unforgettable speeches. Her little faux pas came after she saw the people in the crowds. We're lucky that she didn't faint into elderly Kirk Douglas's arms that night. Leo's an actor's actor. She's everywhere in bit parts and finally until two years ago, she earned her first Oscar nomination in a small film, \\"Frozen River,\\" about a desperate mother in upstate New York. Leo's acting career spans three decades including a role on the series, \\"Homicide,\\" and I've been watching her ever since grow and evolve as an actress.    The film also casts a police officer O'Keefe who is really a cop and trainer. He's the real deal and he even had to audition for the part. Amy Adams earned an Oscar nomination for her performance as Mickey's girlfriend, Charlene, and she showed another side of her acting range.    The film had some minor issues but it was a great film to watch at times. I really related to the characters who were blue collar and working class. Mark Wahlberg did a superb job but he's a neighborhood boy who lived nearby in Dorchester. This project was very personal to him as well. Jack McGee was fine as the father, George Ward. I don't recognize the seven actresses who played Dicky and Micky's sisters.    I thought it was wonderful that they filmed this movie in Lowell, Massachusetts. Besides the fact that I would have preferred a full-screen version, the widescreen was fine. I enjoyed watching with French subtitles below by my choice. I just wished that they had incorporated more into the special features category to help know more about the history of the brothers, the family, and the actors. The making was about 30 minutes long and okay but I thought the DVD could have even incorporated the Awards especially for Bale and Leo who won many awards and rightfully so for their performances.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|\\"Note: AT&T Wireless does not support the Amazon Appstore for Android.\\"    That is what Amazon is says when the you click to get the app.    Until this gets resolved with AT&T - these apps are not available to AT&T Wireless users.  Bummer!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a great change to the old Angry Birds style.  While this is essentially the same gameplay, the look and feel of the game is different as the game has more of a &quot;plot.&quot;  The sound style is better and not as cheesy, while the presentation has taken a small overhaul.  A must download for Angry Birds fans.  The only problem (small) that I have is that it seens easier so far than others in the franchise. Not a huge issue for a cell phone game though because it has quite a few levels and is intended to be played for short spurts at a time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Felt compelled to rate a game for the first game based on all the unfair 1 star reviews.  This is yet another quality Angry Birds game.  While it's unfortunate only those in the US can access it at this time, it's unfair to punish Rovio with 1 star ratings when it's an Amazon issue.  Rate the game, not the store!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Another perfect cell phone game. Easy game to play with your children as well. There are multiple game modes in this game and I'm sure one will suit you. The object of the game in all three is to use your finger to make a slicing motion and cut up all the fruit while avoiding bombs. It may seem too simple at first but you will keep trying to beat your score over and over. The addition of the new arcade mode in the latest update is my favorite game mode and keeps me coming back for more. A great buy at $0.99.
0439023513|3.0|Unfortunately, after the first two books, the third seemed to come out of nowhere in its execution. Unexpected is always a plus in my opinion but I do not think the \\"twists\\" and lack of resolution in the book were well executed. Over all, the book felt disjointed and repetitive. For a while, Collins had me very intrigued but then reading became more tedious. It simply didn't hold my attention as fully as the other two novels and (SPOILER) it ended bitter sweetly, however there was absolutely no resolution at all. The ending was very quick and incoherent. Character development was lacking and the reader experienced very little character progression except for Katniss. Although she is the narrator, in the previous books we saw differing interactions as well. The heroine we knew became very whiny and dependent. It seemed very rushed and out of character. Over all, it was a solid read but I had higher hopes.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|best angry birds ever ... better graphics and gameplay and thanks to Amazon for a free no ad version ... makes gameplay incredible and incredibly fun
B004GHBQ7O|5.0|If you're a Green Day fan, this is the best live package yet. The word \\"awesome\\" is not hyperbole. You get not only a CD of concert recordings from around the globe (America, Canada, Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Australia) but also the DVD of an unforgettable performance in Tokyo.<br /><br />Greatest hits as well as longtime favorites are included. Every song is played and sung at full throttle. The stage show is off-the-hook showmanship, a constant stream of flashing images and exploding fireworks and walls of sound. Billie Joe, Mike, and Tr&eacute; are all over the place, leaping, flailing, belting out one great anthem after another and urging the crowd to go crazy. And what horde of screaming, shouting, moshing fans can match the pure, rabid, raving insanity of the Japanese?<br /><br />After more than 20 indefatigable years together, from obscurity to the popularity of \\"Dookie\\" to criticisms of inauthenticity to \\"American Idiot\\" to ensuing superstardom and Broadway success, Green Day has arrived at a creative and professional peak. They are no longer derivative, no more a simple rock or punk band: they are themselves, an original phenomenon. No one's going to forget The Who, The Ramones, The Clash, or The Replacements, but Green Day is making vital music that speaks to the world today.<br /><br />Does this album surpass the live \\"Bullet in a Bible\\" from 2005? That's a matter of taste, but I think it does. \\"Bullet\\" was recorded during the \\"American Idiot\\" tour, so half of the set list was from that CD. The new album is longer and more diverse, with songs from the length and breadth of the band's catalog, so it's a worthy purchase even if you already have \\"Bullet.\\" Since the CD and DVD have different tracks, a total of 24 tunes are covered. And unlike the previous DVD, this one doesn't break up the momentum of the concert with interviews and documentary footage between musical numbers.<br /><br />As we await the next studio album, the time is right for another release that reveals how electrifying Green Day is live. Now get this thing, crank it up, and bang your head!!!electrifying Green Day is live. Now get this thing, crank it up, and bang your head!!!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I have been waiting for this box set of these great scfi fliks to lower a little bit. So randomly I check on the price here on Amazon,and what do I find? Two sellers selling UK. versions, stating they are region free. Beware the mighty scammers who try to sell you region free dvd or blurays. UK. does have region codes as well as U.S., I believe they are region 2.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works like a charm! no complaints at all. I love the way it syncs so if I go to another device, I'm right where I left off.<br /><br />Droid Incredible rooted 2.3
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have used this knife for chopping limbs, splitting firewood with a baton, and a little whittling (firesticks) so far. It works very well for all those applications. With a 1/4\\" thick blade, you don't have to worry much about breaking it while splitting wood using a baton. The molded plastic sheath has excellent retention, but I replaced the nylon strap belt loop with a Tek-Lok belt clip device. I like the handle shape so far. It is comfortable to hold while chopping, but I did add a paracord lanyard wrist loop for use while chopping. The knife was very sharp as received and held that edge quite well. I am very pleased with this knife.
B004L49K20|5.0|I can't think of any reason why you wouldn't want to buy this album. It's so catchy and strong musically. The four founding members are in full force showing off their musical talents as they did during their ablums Rio and their debut. John Taylor's bass is up in the mix with his disco funk bass lines and Simon LeBon's voice sounds better than ever. The songs are excellent, everything from the catchy \\"Being Followed\\" to the really well written \\"The Man Who Stole A Leopard\\". This album from beginning to end is superb, no fillers. I actually think they are going to get a new generation of fans with this release.  It really appeals to everyone, but it's like gold for longtime fans like myself. I wasn't a huge fan of the Warren Cucarullo years although they did have some good tunes, but the albums weren't as strong as their first two albums(Debut and RIO). This album up there with all of them...it's that good!  Hard to believe and a testiment to a group who can still be youthful and fresh as Duran Duran.  They are incredible musicians and their pop status has often over shadowed their musicianship.  Ask any bass player about John Taylor, if they are \\"real\\" bass players they will know him and respect him just like the greats.  I'm blown away with Simon LeBon's voice and how good it sounds as well as Roger's drumming. The only mistake they made was releasing the title track as their first single.  The title track is actually the weakest song on the album.  They should have released \\"Being Followed\\" as the first single.  The best album I've heard in a long time.
B000001EL3|5.0|Destroyer was a master stroke, excellent first time collaboration between KISS and producer Bob Ezrin.  It almost borderlines on a concept record in my opinion though it isn't and wasn't intended to be, it very easily could have been.  Bob was a real positive force for the band and expanded their sound adding strings, choirs and piano on songs like Beth and Great Expectations, story lines and sound effects to Detroit Rock City and God Of Thunder and put a calliope, much to Paul's chagrin in the breakdown of Flaming Youth.  I can't say enough good things about this album.  There are about 4 or 5 KISS studio albums where they got everything right and this is one of them.  It's awesome front to back and back to front.  Unfortunately I can't say the same for KISS' next collaboration with Ezrin, 1981's Music From The Elder.
0307272702|5.0|This book is long overdue, and its truth is becoming more and more difficult for the establishment to deny.  Fat does NOT make you fat- sugar does.  Several years ago, I spent a great deal of time in France watching the French enjoy their cream sauces, fresh vegetables, and fatty meats.  Contrary to what Americans believe about the French, they eat little bread. Have you ever seen how thin a real French baguette is?  And they only eat a few small slices.  And those desserts?  The French eat them only for special occasions;they are not in any way everyday fare.      When I read this book I recalled a dinner I once shared among the company of several French nationals.  Guiltily, I tried to eat the fat off of my rib eye steak as inconspicuously as possible (I adore steak fat)as not to appear poorly bred or uneducated amid such cultured people.  A little old French lady (almost 100 years old) noticed and assured me that the fat was indeed good for me, especially my brain, and that there was no reason to deny myself.  She admitted that the fatty edge has always been her favorite part of the steak. She seemed to know intuitively that fat is not the problem.  I can only wistfully hope that the younger French generation can resist the ever increasing \\"americanization\\" of their food culture.    In any case, this book was written for me.  I'm the radical mom who denies her kids sugar; I'm the soccer mom who brings grapes and cheese cubes instead of Hohos and juice boxes for a snack.  I am trying my darndest to help my children resist the constant barrage of sugar that is proffered up to them on a daily basis at school and at the homes of their chubby friends.  If only Gary Taubes's ideas could get into the schools. I shutter when I look at the lunch menu posted on my refrigerator.    This book is a must read.  The middle-aged woman struggling with her weight (and health) who thinks sugary low-fat yogurt, wheat crackers, apple juice, and carrot sticks is a healthy lunch needsto read this book so that she can satisfy her real cravings with healthy food and lose weight in the process.  It's so sad that we've been taught to deny ourselves real food.
B000001ELL|5.0|I think the band went a little over the top with their stage costumes during this period but this is still a great album.  Some hate it because it's disco but if a band does something well I can appreciate it and Kiss did disco wel.  Unlike their venture into new wave pop with the follow up Unmasked a year later.  Unlike Unmasked, the production quality still holds up on this album which is weird considering they have the same producer.  What's most important are the songs and the songs are solid all the way through, about the only song I skip over is Gene's X-Ray Eyes.  Not his worst showing but far from his best but all strong showings from the band members, Charisma however is amazing and I've never understood why he's never performed it live.  Amazing showings from Paul and Ace and even Peter with Dirty Livin'.  The original band may have been on their last legs at the time but despite all the problems surrounding the band back then, it's a great album. The album cover was great, real simple and too the point and the inside poster was awesome too.  It's too bad they didn't stop to really soak up this time period because it's a great album and they had a great stage show.  Some of the stage costumes were too \\"Vegas.\\" With a little tweaking the Dynasty era would have been an out of the park, home run instead of a triple.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|this is only for US. it seems the rest of the world is from Mars or so... I never though they would let us down this way
B000001EKX|5.0|Hotter Than Hell, KISS, Destroyer, Dynasty and Lick It Up are all Five Star studio albums by the band and a must have for any fan.  The only critique I have of this album is the tracking order.  The production isn't ideal but it has a certain uniqueness and charm to it.  KISS was spending a lot of time in Hollywood at the time and they recorded most of the album in Los Angeles, while the first album was recorded in New York.  To me, if you want to be taken back to 1974-1975 and imagine what it was like to be in an up and coming rock band, this is the album for you.  The album cover is just bizarre but works and is kind of cool with all the Japanese theme writing on it.  It almost makes it look like a rare import.  A very cool album and if you want to check out what KISS was like live at the time youtube their January 31, 1975 San Francisco performance at Winterland and check out their epic performance on Midnight Special later that spring.  History in the making
0439023521|5.0|I've been thinking about reading this book for a while now, caught my attention because I kept seeing it everywhere!  Even the grocery store!  Well I'm happy I finally added it to my reading list.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, it's unlike any story I can really recall.  Very good read.  Kinda short, I burned through most of the book in one long Saturday.  As soon as I finished reading it I thought about how wonderfully it would translate to film and sure enough, movie coming out next year!  So now I have that to look forward to as well as the following two books.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Amazing graphics in the latest installment of the game. Great introduction to the Amazon Market! Not enjoying the 25 word minimum for this review. Will result in fewer reviews.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It's a simple yet visually appealing and addictive. Love it!  The people that are complaining are doing so because they can't follow directions. Its not Amazon's fault that AT&amp;T doesn't allow sideloading.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It just keeps getting better! Graphics are impressive. No issues with gameplay. Don't rate this app poorly because you can't read. Go complain to At&amp;t.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|droid 2 verizon wireless and it downloads but doesnt install. i click install and says application not installed. some one please help me out! i am at a loss as to what im supposed to do.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|love all of the other angry birds however the game loads fine initially but when you get to a level the game just closes just unplayable on HTC evolution 4g please fix
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Installed and plays fine on my Droid X, however, the gameplay mechanics for Angry Birds is getting very stale. It's the same formula over and over and over again. Time to switch it up, or better yet, ride this money train into the ground with the repetitive gameplay.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|OSCAR, GOLDEN GLOBE, AND GRAMMY WINNER JENNIFER HUDSON IS BACK WITH FIRE.     PLEASE PURCHASE ON ITUNES SO THAT SHE CAN GET AHEAD OF THAT WOMAN BEATER. THANK YOU!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon and his team deliver another rapid series of laughs. This musical in three acts follows the ascendance of would-be supervillain Doctor Horrible. The lyrics are hilarious through and through, and in a delicious twist, Dr. Horrible's nemesis Captain Hammer is the most odious superhero ever put on screen.    But wait, there's more! This DVD edition comes with Commentary: The Musical!, which is an opportunity to add ridiculous meta songs to the original video.    If you've enjoyed Firefly, Buffy, or anything else Whedon has done, or if you like musical comedy, or if you're entertained by egomaniacs, you should buy this.
B003O2RQKS|5.0|I've watched it at least 10 times.  Definitely one of the best concert DVDs in my collection.  The incredible part is that he played pieces from 4 composers of different eras and completely different music style.    And he plays all of them extremely well - full of energy and passion, besides technically brilliant.  Audiences in Vienna obviously agree,  as he drove them to their feet many times.   2 hours of note-perfection playing with style is indeed impressive!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Cool game, love angry birds. Like the change to saving birds. Killing the pigs, although fun, was starting to get old, lol  This works on my incredible. Even better, it was free
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not a bad game in the least. Rescuing parrots is a good break from the green pigs. Works great on my Droid X. This is a great game.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|title says it all, but i need 25 words... amazon dont let me download a free app. this market was supposed to be great but its not :P
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I get the application not installed error like many others. This is a bad start to the new app store.  Please fix as soon as possible.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome sound and graphics ! I really enjoyed this game and I have been waiting for this edition ! I can't wait for the movie
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is awesome, 5 stars hands down! I downloaded it from www.Amazon.com and after setting up my account which was difficult it worked fine. Love having a alternative to Googles marketplace!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|A free app should be a free app.. I have .93 credit in my Amazon account (left from a Christmas gift card) but Amazon says it isn't enough to cover the charges (zero?) and wants a cc number ... which I am not about to give out at this point.  So how does 93 cents not cover a zero purchase?  totally weird.. I tried multiple ways to get it to work and have decided the app isn't worth the hassle.. I've gotten lots of other free Amazon things with no problem.. so don't know what the issue is today.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Runs smooth as silk on my Droid Incredible!!!! your phone totally sucks if it can't handle this awesome game, jus sayin!!! vivid colors!!! no problem whatsoever!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm expecting great things from the Amazon App Store; time will tell.  For now, the app worked perfectly and the Angry Birds app is a real treat!  Great new graphics, music and interface.  Awesome!
0765326353|1.0|I am a big fan of Sanderson. I loved the Mistborn trilogy and I think he is at least a worthy successor of Robert Jordan. But this book is not very good.  The concept is nice, don't get me wrong, and it certainly contains quite a number of novelties. But reading the book you get the feeling that parts of it were written by someone else. Fast, clever bits are mixed with boring, long winded pieces of text. I understand from his homepage that he wrote this book many years ago, and has dusted it off and rewritten parts. It shows. The real Brandon is in there, but he is collaborating with adolescent Brandon the Tolkien fan and Brandon the creative writing student.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I can't get the app to install.  I've tried 4 times and every time it gets about 3/4 of the way done, it force closes.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I only worked out with this DVD for about a week or two. I have to say that I get pretty annoying when I start the DVD because the intro is so damn long. No joke, it has to run about 5 minutes or so and you cannot skip it or fast forward. I'm the type of person that likes to get into the workout right away so that I can be done with it. She's not a bad instructor as she can be encouraging for those who need \\"tough love\\". The workout is very intense because she really does push you. I do at times wish that there were more exercises but overall it's a decent DVD that can get you pumped and ready for your day. I would probably give it more stars if it wasn't for the intro and lack of more exercises.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I followed Todd's instructions for the Droid X on my Droid 2 and got RIO to install. It's great! For those who need the instructions:    1. Make sure you allow installation of non-Market applications in the Applications settings on your Droid 2.   2. Download and install the Amazon Appstore application. Make sure you have an Amazon account.   3. Connect your Droid 2 to your PC via USB cable.   4. Switch the USB Connection type to USB Mass Storage (click on usb connection under notifications).   5. Find the USB Mass Storage folder under My Computer.   6. Open the .android_secure folder directory.   7. Delete the smdl2tmp1.asec file in the directory. DO NOT delete any other files you see in the .android_secure directory, you may end up deleting your applications and other associated data.   8. Once deleted, disconnect your Droid 2 from the PC.   9. Install the Angry Birds Rio game.   10. Enjoy!    Again thanks to Todd for the installation instructions.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use this on a daily basis. Great app easy to use and because it if streaming over the internet AM sounds like FM. I would definately recommend this app for anyone who listens to radio.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|installed Amazon app and also installed RIO and started the game and after the first level screen , the game closed and all my other Angry Birds apps that were there before on my phone are gone . I had paid Angry birds app bought from Market place that is gone too ? I am uninstalling Amazon and App and will stay away from it after this kind of a stunt from such a huge store
B004SBS8LA|1.0|it wnt dl to my droid2 ive dled everything necessary and when i click install from here it says it cant and all i can click is done
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Others have already given wonderful synopses for those who want to know a bit about the story itself.  I'll confine my comments to my own experience.<br /><br />If you love books, this is -- to some degree -- a book about books (or rather A book).  But, more than that, a great deal of the story takes place in and around places that many book-lovers would love to visit or spend time:  Oxford University, the various colleges in Oxford, a grand library, castles, etc.<br /><br />But, even without such a rich setting, the characters themselves are wonderful.  I love that the author didn't choose to use the same old well-worn templates that we've all seen before.  (For example, someone has suggested that the two main characters should have more conflict.  I, for one, am bored with the usual positioning of the man and woman being constantly at odds with each other for an entire story.)  Both characters are complex, both are opinionated and, yes, there is some conflict.  (It's not like watching an old 'Thin Man' movie, if you understand my meaning.)  But, at the same time, the two characters are more realistic than many of the stories that would have the man and woman constantly challenging each other over every little details.  (Honestly, that tired-old-routine has run its course to the point that I think many fiction authors actually think that romance is supposed to be 90% hateful venom and only 10% romance.)<br /><br />At any rate, I found both characters to be wonderful.  They were realistic in their personalities and they behaved somewhat with each other as you would expect them to in their situations.  I don't want to seem as though I'm belaboring that point.  It was just refreshing to see an author write two characters that actually LIKE each other, despite their unique perspectives.<br /><br />As far as the plot, I confess that I had no clue that the story would be as deep as it was when I started it.  I read this on the Kindle and, it wasn't until a day or two into the book that I realized how long the book was actually going to be.  And, I was really pleased when the book took an unexpected turn that indicated that the whole story wasn't going to play out in two locations within a square mile of each other.  I had no idea that it would involve lots of travel (and hints of more travel to come).<br /><br />The book IS the first of a series so, don't be disappointed that there's not a total resolution at the end.  With that said (and without spoiling anything), I didn't feel dissatisfied at the end of the book as I often am when reading a new-release book that's part of a series.  It wasn't uncomfortable or disappointing that the story didn't end....because the author did a good job of tying up lots of loose ends while leaving herself with plenty of room to continue the story in (an)other book(s).<br /><br />My wife may have summed it up best when she finished it and said, \\"Bummer.  I really am going to miss this characters until the next book.\\"  To me, that's the mark of a great author.  When you connected so well with some of the characters that finishing the book feels a little like guests have left your house and you might not see them for awhile.<br /><br />Overall, it's one of the best books I've read in quite awhile.  I'll look forward to getting the next one.how long the book was actually going to be.

B001NLKT60|5.0|As with the first book it was a great book. The book picks right up were the first book left off and keeps your attention throughout the whole book. This book does a great job of setting up for the last book in this series. I loved the book and could not put it down. I think this series is a must read for any reader.
B004S8NBDI|4.0|Just as a PSA for anyone who found themselves on this page after reading the review of another entry for the same album (http://www.amazon.com/Angles-Strokes/dp/B004SCI9BS/), the MP3 bitrate seems to be corrected on this item.  Windows 7 reports per-track bitrates between 245 - 255 kbps, which is consistent with 256kbps VBR.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Wow is all I can say, this book picked right up were I was left hanging with the second book. The book really closed the series out with a great ending. I was gasping for more every time I had to go to bed and put this book down. I was never board with this book at all. This book as well as the series Ranks 1,2, and 3 in my list of best books. Please please please if you are thinking about this book or series read it, you will feel like you have lost contact with family members when the book is done.
B002WIDRM6|3.0|This is a nice CD don't get me wrong, but I think the hype of \\"Need you Now\\", put great expectations on the CD and oversold it.  Its good but I wished there were more songs on the CD like need you now.  All three share in leading songs, but the \\"lady\\" in the group has such a good voice that she should've had more lead songs.  Overall its a decent CD, but I just expected or wanted more.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was a great book, it started out slow for the first few chapters giving you all the details and background info. Once this is done the book takes off and just keeps going. I never found myself board with this book and could not put it down. The author makes you feel as if you know the characters in the book. You will love this book, there is a reason it is rated so high on Kindle.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I have the Samsung Galaxy S (Facinate) on Verizon Wireless.  Amazon app installed just fine, game installed just fine however it would not load.  Went to taskkiller to kill both apps, relaunched game, game plays just fine now.  Phone running android 2.1
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is by far my favorite Bible reading ap, easy  to use, lots of different versions &amp; reading plans.  highly recommended! 6 stars out of 5!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Unbelievable,    Not available in your region error. This just blows!!!  Have bought lot's of stuff off Amazon, but this is just the most crappy decision of Amazon!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book will make you laugh, and make you cry all at the same time. You won't want to put the book down until you have read the entire thing.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I picked this up because my brother recommended it, and I just wish I'd known about it sooner. The story is really original and interesting, without being too fantastical (though it comes close at times). This show isn't just about cooking meth, that's just the vessel for characters and surrounding story. It's about cancer and its treatment, teaching, and most of all family drama and all it entails. The acting, especially from the lead role, is superbly done, and the script is also excellent. Being a Chemistry Major, I liked the fact that it all is done very well in the show, straying from being too simplistic while still showing a lot of depth. Someone on the show obviously knows their stuff, though I can't admit to knowing about all the procedures involved in synthesizing crystal meth.     I can't wait to check out the following seasons, I can only imagine what craziness will happen. It is a little violent and gory at times, and contains controversial subjects, but no one should have that keep them from checking out this show.
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|And I really like butter. I first heard about BFL and expected some sort of Kate Bush meets Tori Anus or even worse, some kind of Feisty thing. And so wrote her off as some indie/pop flavor of the month a la Santigold. Then I watched a live video of her on YouTube and was bitch slapped up side my head with my preconceptions. She's beautiful and talented (as were her band, all women) and absolutely nothing like what I expected, yay! The Kate Bush comparisons I get, like Kate she is a singular artist on a singular course, and like Kate her music resonates with me emotionally but the comparisons end there. This is a great album, musically, sonically, lyrically. I like its almost psychedelic ambient textures and rhythms. I like its strength and lack of preciousness. I like the quiet emotion, melodies and unusual instrumentation and arrangements that are more akin to progressive rock when it was actually progressive than to most contemporary pop music. That one time pop idol and now avant-garde crooner/composer Scott Walker makes a guest appearance on The Big Sleep just ups my respect for Natasha Khan.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love this e reader. the only thing I have against it is that it doesn't show page numbers. instead it gives location. how is anyone supposed to know where that is relative to a physical book. I would give it five stars if this changed. the nook got it right.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|great for school and just about anything! if you are a student or just someone who wants to know a lot of things, get this app! love it for iPhone love it for HTC evo!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I would rate the game but it won't install &gt;:(. HTC evo 4g. please six while its still free. it wouldn't be fair to customers if you didn't.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I waited so long for this game to come out! it is awesome. its fun but challenging at parts. this game has the perfect blend!
B004CR5TD0|5.0|Due to time constraints, this will be a short review.    This album is one of the best creative musical works I've encountered.  Listen after listen I continually find arranging/orchestration gems that make this album appear deeper and deeper every time I put it on.  For example, the incredibly slight shifts in the drum pulse of \\"Unluck\\" or the rhythm of the auto-tuned vocal loop of \\"I Mind\\".  This guy is on a very serious musical level, and his ability to orchestrate is superb to say the least.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have the Droid X....won't let me intall Angry Birds Rio. I downloaded the Amazon App but if this is how my first experience with Amazon apps will be, I may consider uninstalling it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works perfect on my Atrix. Looks smooth and runs great. If you played the other two version you well love this one also! working on Atrix 4G
B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome 3D and colorful graphics, very fun. rovio outdid themselves. i love that it was free and they didn't charge also. simple to install. verizon wireless droid x
B004SBS8LA|5.0|If people have qualms about Amazon &amp; their policies, this is not a soapbox for that. This is a section to review Angry Birds Rio. With that said, this app is 5 stars hands down. I've grown weary of the first 2 AB's, &amp; expected much of the same, but was pleasantly surprised. Graphical improvements, a minor but much welcone variety to gameplay mechanics, &amp; new touches in little places make the game fresh again. Bravo. On behalf of my fellow Amazon app reviewers, I apologize to the dev for the low star ratings received thus far simply because some people can't read a TOS. (For comparison's sake: Original Droid, Project Elite 4.2 rom. Runs brilliant.)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|as the others, this is great....kinda miss the piggies though, also great having an add free versions of the other bird series. got to love the birds
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love this game on my Evo 4G. entertaining for hours. a little different from the original game, you dont kill the hogs anymore, but free other birds instead. i love this game.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install on my Droid X. Usually this can be fixed by unmounting the SD card. Not this time, since installing to the SD card is required. I see no additional benefit the amazon app store offers me right now over AppBrain.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|This is a upgrade key.  The reviewer that spent a day and a half trying to install it never installed the actual product.  No doubt Amazon and Docs to go could do a better job showing that, but the app itself is great.  I use it constantly. Download the main product and then the full version key...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Same addicting fun as original. Also has better graphics and animation. Plus it's fee without advertisements. Can't complain about that. Buy it if you liked the previous two.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think its the best angry birds yet. flawless on evo 4 g. best of all its free today. thanks amazon app store !!!! I'm telling everyone about it.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Controls are more precise and visuals are much improved. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Angry Birds.
B0007TKNKG|3.0|Everything about this movie can easily be made fun of.     At the same time, everything in it can be moving. In a cheesy kind of way.    Depending on your love of Sylvester Stallone and the eighties. Depending on your interest in Mr. Stallone's usual views of the world and what it takes to be a man. This is another one of Stallone's movie where he will go against all odds, never give up and go after his goal no matter what. His usual speech is there. It's fast. It's simple. It can look cheesy but it is honest and heartfelt. A feel good movie that is, to me, impossible to hate. I think that there are more people who are going to like it than they are people who will hate it. Those who do not like Stallone will probably not like him in it though. It's the kind of movie that you catch on TV late at night and you get caught up in it just for the heck of it. And, darn it, it is a tear-jerking film at various points. The music and the songs adds a lot to it. The soundtrack is still playing in my stereo to this day, especially the song in the beginning (\\"In This Country\\") and during the tournament (\\"The Fight\\").  I recommend not only the DVD but also the CD.     I miss those little gems. Seems to me there were more of those films in the seventies and eighties. Clint Eastwood and Check Norris also did a couple like that. Kenny Rogers also (\\"Six Packs\\").     This is why those who loves Sylvester Stallone love him.     Over The Top!
B004SBX112|5.0|I agree with another review that said to try the free version and if you enjoy that, spend the dollar to get rid of the ads. Definitely worth it in my book.  Also, this works fine on the Droid Incredible.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I live in the UK and cannot download - I am not happy. Geographical restrictions WTH!!!!!?????!!!!!    An apple fanboi has it on his iphone and has been taunting me all morning - i not happy.
B0016PM722|5.0|My husband was very pleased with this ligh saber.  I bought it for him for his birthday and its been great.  Well made.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome upgrade to the angry bird franchise they really put the time and effort into this app, can't wait for updates and what not :)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|hmmm...amazon need my \\"one click payment data\\" to realize, i cant get that game cuz i´m from germany? lame :-(
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game is amazing. Installed with ease and seems that it will have regular updates, glad to see amazon app store up and running, the gameplayis similar but instead you rescue birds rather than take out pigs. So far so good
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I spent about 20 minutes on this goat rope.  It will not install in the Droid 2 (Verizon).  Unfortunately, it's not available yet on the Verizon App Store.  Why do I need apps from Amazon in the first place?  From what I saw from the availale apps, these are the same apps I install directly from the current app store.  Why do I need yet another later.  Oh, and I'm really not that thrilled with making global security changes to my phone to support a 3rd party app store.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Have only played a few levels but so far I actually prefer the original Angry Birds.  But this is still a lot of fun.  Especially as a free app right now!  :)
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love it, I'm using a droid X and its awesome. Runs smoothly, no ads, no ads, and doesn't lock up my device. I am enjoying this treasure!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Downloads fine, but wont install on the EVO.  No error message given other than app not installed.  Pretty bad start to the app store.  They better have easy refunds or no more purchases from me.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Game works flawlessly and looks amazing. The extra steps needed to download the app (or any app for that matter) is un-needed, but I'm not going to be using this market as my primary app downloader, so no worries.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install on droid x. Glad i didn't waste money on this one. I stick to the original app store, at least I can find out if it works before I buy it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It lets me download then when I click install it says \\"Application not installed\\" and the only click option is \\"Done\\"     I have the first Droid.       :( I just want the new Angry Birds :(
B004SBS8LA|1.0|So iPhone users worldwide gets Rio today yet android users outside of the US suffer.  I don't see why Amazon and Rovio are withholding a sale from potential customers. If Android wants to be on par with Apple then this kind of nonsense needs to stop.  Shame on Amazon and shame on Rovio.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I think that the graphics on this one are the best yet.  It takes a different turn in that you are freeing birds rather than getting the pigs, but the game play is the same.  I think that the graphics are really well done.
B0034G4OY0|1.0|At 70 years of age I have certainly have seen my share of movies. Often I am titillated by the advance publicity filmmakers spin about their latest and greatest form of entertainment.\\"Hereafter\\" is a film that could really get our minds and imaginations hyped up. All of us would like to know about life after death even if it is fiction.....this is not the film that would do it. I must confess that this is the most boring film I have ever seen..I suffered through the dialog waiting some special effects or great revelation ..it didn't happen. It is a rare moment when I throw a DVD in the trash after viewing it. In this case I did, and broke it in half so that no one else would suffer through it either....Gee, with all the fancy special effects movie makers have at their disposal they could have done much better.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This is one of the most popular apps on Android devices, iPhones and many other platforms, too. And, when you try it, you'll be amazed that in a few seconds, it can identify a song that is playing on the radio or in a public place, and the Shazam app gives you instant access to buy the song, share it, see YouTube videos, get the lyrics, and so much more.
B003NX76BM|4.0|Some of the reviews here are brutal, which is a mystery to me.  I happen to love dogs but didn't think that was at the basis of my interest of a story about a woman dog trainer.  Fiona Bristow is a survivor who has recreated herself following pretty tragic circumstances.  She relocated herself to Orcas Island in Puget Sound and is devoting her life to dog obedience training and as a volunteer with the Canine Search and Rescue.  Fiona also trains dogs for search and rescue.<br /><br />Enter Simon, a wood artist and furniture designer who has recently moved to the island, along with a new puppy given to him by his mother.  He enlists Fiona's help with his little terror, Jaws.  Fiona and Simon don't have the typical romance, which makes this fun and enjoyable.  He's prickly, grumpy and blunt.  She's airy and attainable.  They are not complete opposites but the differences make it work.<br /><br />I found the dog training segments enlightening and illuminating....it told you a lot about Fiona and gave you insight as to why she's a survivor.  And, a lot of the stories were just plain funny.  Fiona's dogs were loving and typical of the breed.  Jaws was perfect for his grumpy owner.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of the In Death series under J. D. Robb so I'm less sensitive to the murders outlined in this book.  The serial killer plot was suspenseful and made me nervous as I anticipated the ending.  My criticism is that the end was anti climatic and could have been more exciting.<br /><br />Otherwise, I found this to be a solid addition to Nora Roberts' body of work.  You have to read between the seams and weave Fiona's talents into the fabric of the story.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I am constantly getting force closes and not enough memory messages, but i have over 40 mb available. app store still needs some work it appears.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The app is really good. All the one stars are just from AT&T users.  It sucks it's not working on the network yet but the app itself is very good.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I am using this cable to connect a progressive scan DVD player to my HDTV.  The video performance is outstanding (for DVD).  The price is about one fifth what the advertised price was at the local big box.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|This was a great book.  I read it in two days.  I love all Jodi Picoult books.  She is a great author.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is one of the most popular apps on any platform - iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Nokia, and more -- in the world with over 100 million users. And, once you try it, you'll see why. In just a few seconds, it's magic when it can identify any song playing on the radio or anywhere a song is being played. And, you can get the lyrics, share it on Facebook or Twitter or via email, watch YouTube videos and of course, you can also buy it from Amazon MP3. Try it! You'll be amazed how well it works.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds is back with more bird stinging fun.  This time we head south (at least it is south for me) to help free other poor helpless birds.  A slightly different twist vs. just 'getting those darn pigs.'  Despite what someone else said, this works just fine on the HTC Droid Incredible.  At least it works perfect on my Froyo 2.2 (non-rooted) Incredible.  Try it out.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|First to all of your outside of the US - Amazon App Store is NOT available for you right now, that is stated on each product page.  STOP leaving reviews complaining about it - that has NOTHING to do with the game.  Slam Amazon all you want, but don't rate the game 1 star just because you can't get it on Amazon.  That's not a game review.<br /><br />This is another GREAT game - it's very different.  All new theming, same birds (so far) and some great new additions.  If you love Angry Birds this is a MUST have - absolutely great game!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was blown away by how many translations that were available, even when you're offline and not connected to a network connection. I love the reading plans that help me get into the Bible everyday. The user interface is clean and uncluttered. It makes for a great reading experience. I've been using this on my Droid for a while, and it just keeps getting better.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Here we go again, another service \\"launched\\" which caters only to a small demographic of the world, locking out other regions. Aptly demonstrating the lack of understanding of the Internet and a true global market. They aren't innovating, trying to push boundaries, but meekly follow suit, with a desperate attempt of being \\"rebels\\". Oh well. No offense meant to Rovio Mobile, for a superb game.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Game is just as good if not better than the first. Hope they keep adding updates and not just forget about it after the movie RIO. Also cool that its free on this new amazon app store.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why allow me to install the app, select my payment details then tell me only availble in the US !!
B004RLN3QG|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is nothing if not old-school, releasing an album a year since 2000 despite touring relentlessly.  That's a refreshing change from the modern norm of artists going years between releases/tours.  \\"Dust Bowl\\" is the latest in Joe's increasingly-impressive catalog.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Slow Train,\\" an original that features a clever instrumental intro mimicking the start-up of a steam engine, a blistering solo, and an arresting vocal.  \\"Dust Bowl,\\" another original, is a twang-and-tremolo treat with a vocal reminiscent of \\"Book of Dreams\\"-era Steve Miller and a spooky spoken-word voice-over by Peter Van Weelden, Joe's current favorite amp guru.  The rollicking \\"Tennessee Plates\\" features a rocking duet (both vocal and instrumental) with John Hiatt.  Next up is a cover of the Bobby Troup/Leah Worth jazz classic \\"The Meaning of the Blues,\\" with some more of Joe's tasty soloing; definitely not the Miles Davis version!  \\"Black Lung Heartache\\" is another original that deftly blends some unusual stringed instruments with a crunchy rock riff. \\"You Better Watch Yourself,\\" an old Little Walter hit, is meat-and-potatoes blues-rock that gives the wah pedal a workout.  \\"The Last Matador of Bayonne,\\" another original, slows the pace but features a soaring solo in Joe's trademark style.  Joe's Black Country Communion bandmate Glenn Hughes joins in for a duet on the Paul Rodgers/Free classic \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and their affection for the material comes across in a fine performance.  Another cover, of the Tim Curry/Michael Kamen grinder \\"No Love On the Street,\\" keeps the classic blues-rock vibe going and features guests Beth Hurt and Blondie Chaplin.  \\"The Whale That Swallowed Jonah,\\" another original, is an up-tempo number with a nice blend of acoustic sounds (including Joe on mandolin) with electric.  Vince Gill drops in for a visit on a cover of his \\"Sweet Rowena,\\" a guitar/vocal duet that is one of the album's high points.  The album winds up with \\"Prisoner,\\"written by Blue By Nature's Karen Lawrence, a song Barbra Streisand made famous when she sang it on the \\"Eyes of Laura Mars\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />I suppose it is to be expected that an artist will always describe her/his most recent work as \\"the best yet\\" (as Joe does in the liner notes here), but in this case I would agree.  This is a collection of finely-crafted, affecting performances in a variety of styles.  Joe's vocals have never seemed more relaxed and confident, and the guitar work is exemplary (duh!).  Joe says he was worn out from touring and needed a break when this album was recorded.  I'm sure that was true, but this album sure doesn't show it.  Highly recommended.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I went through the somewhat tortuous experience of installing the Amazon Appstore app on my Android device, only to find that no content is available in my region.    Amazon is getting people outside the US to install the Appstore app on their devices under false pretences.    I have a long relationship with Amazon, whom I have previously trusted. That trust relationship has been severely eroded to the extent that I am going to cancel my Amazon Prime membership when it comes up for renewal.    This is not the way to treat loyal customers.
B004J4WQ46|3.0|You kind of know its over when critics are all calling the newest release by any band a \\"return to form.\\" Because, what this really means is that at some point in the past, the band veered away from the style that had made them successful in lieu of something new and experimental, which seldom sits well with fans and critics. In the case of First Impressions of Earth, neither group were particularly pleased, as evidenced by the band's fervent attempt to recapture the magic of their earlier releases on their latest LP, Angles.<br /><br />To cut down to the core, this record is all surface, no substance. There are some catchy tunes here and there, but the record is too damn polished to be the Strokes and the songs are altogether not memorable, at least in comparison to the highlights on their first two albums. At its core, Angles is a recycling of the styles and moods that the Strokes built their career on, but this time around the sound is anything but fresh. They've become more accomplished musicians, but frankly that might be serving to the detriment of the punk-inspired gnarl of Is This It. First single Under Cover of Darkness is one of few highlights, but even it recycles the shuffle beats and punchy guitar strums of previous gems.<br /><br />Strokes fans dying for a new record will likely be somewhat satiated, but critics are not likely to be impressed with an OK record from a band capable of much better.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|How can you give this game a 1-star rating when you haven't even played it! It's awesome! Stop b**ching cause your phone company screwed you. Talk to them.
1400052181|5.0|I am not a big reader, nor do I care for sciency-type books but this story fascinated me from beginning to end! Couldn't put it down & it has been churning in my mind since I finished it. Wonderful book, interesting story & raises many good, but thought-provoking questions about science & stem cells. Can't wait to pass this book on to my friends!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|One of the best things about the SB-700 is that it is pretty much an SB-900 minus a few things. It has less power than the 900 and it can't Command more than 2 groups of speedlights, you can control group A and B and that's it. It is nice to have full control of all the groups in the shoot but if you absolutely need those three groups individually dialed. Then turn one of them to SU-4 mode and that will let you set it off in synch with all the other flashes but you will have to go to the unit to make the manual power/zoom adjustments. It can be an inconvenience but it will save you the price of another SB-700. If you are in an event where anyone else has any other camera and their flashes are going off keep in mind that any flashes set to SU-4 mode will go off anytime someone else takes a flash picture. That may not mess up your exposures but it will probably mess up their exposures and will surely drain the batteries of those flashes in SU-4 mode quickly.     For those of you who are buying your first flash and just want to make your pictures better by having a dedicated flash. This is a great choice. The SB-900 is more powerful and has a few more features but it is also much bigger and bulkier. I own both. In a few weeks I have a western Caribbean cruise with the family and I am already planning to bring the SB-700 and my D90 with me, my Nikon 18-200 VRII and my Sigma 12-24. There is no way I will bring the SB-900, too big.  The SB-700 supports Balanced TTL, High Speed Synch (FP Sync) and its just a well rounded little brother to the SB-900. It includes a diffuser and clip-on Incandescent and Fluorecent Filter equivalent to a full CTO and Full Green Gels. Its very handy to have both of this. They are solid built and you just clip them on to the front of the flash and that's It. No need for velcro or sliding in flimsy gels or anything like that. Oh and did I mention that the SB-700 lets you use the clip-On filter and then put on the diffuser on top. Yeah in this this new generation of speedlights that is possible. An upgrade from the SB-800's.     Overall I will recommend this as a great addition to your Wireless CLS team of flashes or as a dedicated on camera flash with a few limitations that may or may not affect you depending on your needs.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|it won't let me even download the game. HTC Droid incredible. I've tried it multiple times and it keeps telling me to fix the 1 click settings and I have.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Not available in the UK despite all the hype. and it only tells you when you've entered all your details. How irritating is that then!
1593977476|5.0|I enjoy her humor and the consistancy of my Trenton family. Yes, it always turns and changes, but I enjoy what Grandma and Lulu are going to do or say next. I read more serious material and less serious, but Evanovich just makes me laugh.
B004L49K20|5.0|I'll admit it: back in the day I was a \\"Durannie.\\"  In the mid-80s I played Duran Duran's albums relentlessly.  I was also an enormous fan of the side-project Arcadia, and especially loved the luminous sounds Nick Rhodes achieved with synthesizers and the occasional use of genuine orchestral strings.  I grew disenchanted with the band's sound, which had changed a lot, in the '90s, but I still liked them.  But I always wished they'd recapture that luminous sound of the first few albums and from time to time, in a song here and there, they did.    This entire album, from start to finish, is the sort of thing I've been hoping for since then.  I've been excited since I caught the title track on YouTube weeks ago, and now that the CD's in my hands I'm amazed at how far the music has blown past my expectations.  This is the album I've been wishing for since I was a teenager.  Light-years more mature than the '80s songs, but with all of the beauty and vigor of that early music, it's virtually perfect for long-time fans and should resonate well with new listeners, too.    I haven't even decided which track is my favorite at this point; given that only three of the tracks got four-star ratings from me, and everything else got five stars, it's going to take me a while to figure out.  And many, many more replays.  I'm going to enjoy every second of that.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I got tired of angry birds and this brought me back ^_^ a must have &quot;twenty five words blah blah blah blah blah blah blah&quot;
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Compared to the good and now old version of angry birds this is by far the best thing they come up with. I must say the way graphics render and the smoothness is just epic; on the old angry bird lag was the main reason i stop playing it
B004SBS8LA|5.0|looks amazing graphics wise and is a fun change from killing pigs. really 25 word minimum? kind of ridiculous amazon. seriously still need more words?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed just fine on my Droid X. Works just fine, too. Beware of bad reviews due to user error. Just a new version of a fun and familiar game.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Downloaded the sample to my Kindle and found it compelling enough to purchase.  Sad to say that about half way through the book the story became a silly and unbelievable \\"love story\\".  I did not even bother reading the last couple of chapters, just read the last page to see how it ended.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is the best book I have read in a long time. The author catches each character perfectlly. If you have a hard life and you want a bookto make your life seem good buy this book. It made me cry and I have never cryed while reading books since Serious Black dies in Harry Potter. Amazing. AllI can say.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent new sounds and music, smooth performance even on my OG Droid. No pigs but plenty of exotic birds to free. Would have been ok paying, the 99 cent list price, but free launch day special is even better! Well done Rovio!
B00275EHJQ|4.0|Cute movie for kids as well as entertaining for adults. I love how the storyline is about the original characters. We watch this movie a lot. Although, i would suggest it for children probably closer to a year old and older. My 9 month old doesnt stay interested for long. He tends to be attracted to movies with more upbeat music and dancing characters than Toy Story 3 has, like his favorite [[ASIN:B0044RFTBK Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]. I would suggest buying Toy Story 3 for your movie collection and i got a great deal with fast shipping from Amazon.com, as usual.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great interface, global in station scope and genre. Using this w/the sleep timer for meditation or retiring for the night is addictive. Gem of an app.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Cannot download from spain. Shame. Adding the fact user is prompted to complete the 1-click purchase settings, a lot of steps for nothing in my case. :(
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is even more addicting than the original, with much improved graphics. The game runs perfectly and looks beautiful on my ViewSonic GTablet.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not really sure what issue the Droid X people are having? It installed fine on mine. What is very confusing to me is why there is a ridiculous 25 word minimum in order to post a review. Great way to discourage people from reviewing apps. Way to go, Amazon!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent colors and graphics. Nice addition to the Angry Birds' games. I liked the music theme at the beginning of the game. Recommended to everyone. EVO.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am in 9th grade and i just finished reading The Hunger Games. This book was a mix of suspense, survival, leadership and fighting for your death. From hearing people rave about this intriuging novel, i decided to check it out from my local library and dig into the fascinating wonders on Panem(the country when Katniss live in The Hunger Games) Once i started reading this book, I was not able to stop. From heartwarming forgiveness to bow and arrows zooming through the air, this is a book I recommend to all young adults. Check it, read it and love it! Just like I did! I enjoyed it and so will you!!!!! READ IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|On a Gigabyte x58a-ud3 motherboard with 12GB of Corsair Dominator RAM, this CAN work.  This is a rewrite of my earlier review saying it could not fit, a review I wrote when a little frustrated and tired during a system build.    Ok, here's what I did, and it is keeping my CPU below 50 C even under heavy load (but no overclocking).  I simply put the fan on the \\"backside\\" of the Hyper 212 Plus, meaning I have a pull configuration.  I get good flow.  Part of this, I believe, is because the pull of the CPU fan is combining with the pull of the case fan about 3\\" away from it, creating a little wind tunnel effect.  If I hold a small piece of paper near the heatsink on the other side, the paper gets sucked right onto the heatsink and sticks there.    (My ambient temps are about 25 - 27 C, and the idle temp of the CPU is averaging 37 C.)    As a contingency, I also ordered a second fan that does(with rubber bands) sit securely about 3/4\\" above the normal position, which clears the RAM and still pushes a lot of air into the heatsink.  But I am not using that second fan now because the \\"pull\\" set-up seems to be keeping my CPU cool enough.    Installation was pretty easy.  I did ask my wife to hold the motherboard up at an angle while I put the bracket underneath, but other than that, two hands were enough.  I used a razor blade to pack thermal paste into the tiny seams of the surface that touches the CPU (this heatsink does have the copper pipes exposed on the bottom), and then put two beads (in a cross-shape) of paste directly onto the CPU.    My case is a Cooler Master HAF X, so of course this heatsink fits.  And, as a bonus, the HAF X allows access to the bottom of the motherboard, so I can easily reach the bottom bracket if I ever need to, and I won't have to take out the motherboard first.    As for quality, the workmanship seems great.  Despite a little rough treatment, including banging a knuckle hard against the cooling fins when unplugging a SATA cable, the cooling fins stayed straight.    Like most system builders, I put in the hours researching, and this seemed like the best performer for the money, and the one most likely to fit with 12 GB of RAM.  I'm glad I kept trying, and I'm glad I picked the Hyper 212 Plus.    Considering the heatsink and case, I have to say Cooler Master's engineering and workmanship are top notch.    [EDIT, 3/31/11] NOTE: Ran BF:BC2 for almost 45 mins at high settings, never went over 57 C, and that's with just the \\"pull\\" configuration.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|working great on dx level 19,no flaws and its free.Graphics are better,and freeing birds instead of killing pigs.I ran outta stufff to say why 25word minimum lol.I do short reviews.
B004ISVH5W|1.0|Richard Ashcroft is one of the greatest songwriters of our time.  Albums like \\"Urban Hymns\\" and \\"Alone with Everybody\\" are classics that never get old.  That's why this album is such a disappointment.  I hoped from more from Ricky.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Much improved! Better graphics and snappier response (especially in the absence of ads) compared to older versions of Angry Birds for Android phones. Download and installation was a breeze. I am not sure why so many people are having trouble... Make sure your Android allows installation of non-market applications!     Settings > Applications > Unknown sources (check).    Moto Droid (Android v. 2.2.2)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It's not like this is Rovios first Android game and there's still problems installing on HTC phones. They fixed it on the original so ky would think it wouldn't be an issue now. Way to start off with Amazon guys!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why entice everyone to download your new appstore for android and only when they try to download the free app, restrict them with the reason it's only for US users?  I'm closing my Amazon account in next 10 minutes...    How hard to use to put a label 'Only for US Users' ?????
B0049PNOS2|5.0|Although Amazon posted the format as NTSC, the version of this DVD I received is PAL so would not play on (North American) standard DVD player.<br />My Phillips DVD player plays both formats so I was able to view the DVD, but some customers may not have this option.  Many people in the USA have only NTSC format DVD players.<br /><br />Other than that one issue, the performance, concert, audio and DVD quality is GREAT!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game plays well on my s7 tablet. Much better than on my Droid2. Screen is just the right size to get the angles right.  Keep up the good work.
B00004R99U|5.0|It was nice to be able to go to Amazon.com find what I wanted and order it. I have this movie, but it is on VHS so getting it on DVD was great.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|You go through the whole process of purchasing with so much excitement about the new amazon app store, which in my openion is much superior to google's market, to only find out at the end you cannot download it!!! and why???? Because of my geographical location! thats so strange, amazon will ship a fridge around the globe, but not able to provide a download link!!!!!  I thought this app store will solve my problem of not being able to purchase apps from google's market.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I kinda miss the stupid green pigs but the Rio birds are so much cuter. The graphics are much smoother and I love that this has no ads.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game, one of the best in the series. Too bad its not available for everyone outside of the US as of now but i'm sure it's coming soon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Installed easily on my Droid and Nook Color. Looks like upgrades over the rest of 2011 will keep me coming back for more bird flinging action.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Mainly rating to offset the fools who are giving one star. IT clearly states does not work in the US so don't bother complaining if you don't live in the US. Also if it doesn;t download successfully in a browser try a different one. I used Firefox for Android to download because it wasn't working in Dolphin Browser.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It won't install on my Droid 2, and doesn't give a reason. This is very frustrating. This was a really bad first experience w/the Amazon app store.
B004QYZATW|2.0|i turned this off. i love depp and i love jolie. first and foremost, the incidental music killed this film. also, depp is wasted on a naive character (even if there is a twist or something. doesn't matter). and jolie walks around like she's on the red carpet. she's almost entirely a statue for the first twenty minutes (or like a vanity fair cover). the director exhibits a cartoonish idea of elegance. go watch mr and mrs smith or salt. go watch public enemies.     the first few minutes (all the surveillance stuff) was clumsily shot and edited. it simply had no flow. it was meant to be both comic and exciting, but a film can't really be both a thriller and a comedy. the brilliant 'charade' proved that four decades ago. that was an amazing comedy that failed as a thriller.     also, leaden dialogue.     avoid this.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|A little smaller size than i figured.  smaller than your pinkie.  not so fast shipping but overall it did the job.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Was excited to hear about Rio, was looking forward to downloading and playing. Take a wild guess what I'm doing now Amazon, writing a negative review due to the fact that this game won't install on my Droid 2 Global. Congrats Amazon for rushing this with proper testing and development, kudos to you and your developers. Thanks
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Are you planning to include Latin America? I'm a great customer of amazon and I'd like to purchase apps through your store for my Motorola Milestone.
B004QYZATW|4.0|Angela Jolie...what more can I say, combined with Depp I thought they had very good chemistry together which made this movie very enjoyable to watch, the plot was a little on the thin side but the ending was a semi-surprise.    Entertaing movie especially if you enjoy Depp or Jolie, not a deep movie but you will not be checking your watch.
B004S5D3B6|5.0|How do you decide on a rating title for a movie?  \\"Two-thumbs up\\"?  I don't know.  In any case, it was very good.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is great casual game.the Rio version has new items, new backgrounds.it is rewarding to help the birds escape their cages. the game is also challenging as you progress.kids and adults alike love Angry Birds Rio it seems :)
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Well done Amazon... Made me waste my time downloading the Amazon app on my smartphone to discover the app is only available to US residents!    I wonder why this is information not placed on the game's page.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Its fun and it looks better but the original and season still are more fun to play. It is still a must download for AB fans, especially because there are no ads to be found and its free!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This ap is a great way to stay regularly in the Word of God.  I love the reading plans especially.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is the best Bible app on the android. Easy to use has great number of versions to choose from online and offline. Great set of daily reading plans to choose from and great connectivity to people. Also allows you to share what you are reading on Facebook or Twitter.     Improvement needs to be made on the bookmark facility as there is no way of categorising them. It also needs the ability to highlight text when they have been bookmarked.     Great app over all.
B000FZERIG|4.0|I collect Beatle solo CDS and needed this one \\"Living in the Material world\\".  There a few tunes I had forgotten about like \\"Sue me , sue you Blues\\" having read the back story behind this tune.<br />For the most part,I like this CD and if you enjoy The Beatles/George Harrrison, I bet you'll like this effort from George.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I've tried several times to install this app, including multiple downloads.  And every time I get the same useless error message \\"Application not installed\\".  Great first impression of the AppStore!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Finally a version of Angry Birds that works very well on my mytouch 3g. Seasons didn't work. The graphics and sounds is great. It's not slow, and it's alot of fun. Thanks, Amazon! I totally recommend this.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Of all the complaints I read it appears that people do not read or look for directions before they start something.  The video was very helpful and the appstore and Angry Birds loaded easily and worked perfect.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Same awesome angry birds! Just new levels. I'll keep buying these games as long as they keep making them.  Rio seems more sleek than previous versions. It is also nice to have an ad free version available.
B004L49K20|5.0|I may be biased as I've been a life-long fan, but this is Duran Duran's best album for a long time. I got hooked to the band with The Reflex in 1984, followed them feverishly through the 80's but even for a fan like me, their late 90's albums were way too much off the mark. Coming back in their original line-up in 2003 was a true bliss for me, but even then, the Astronaut and Red Carpet Massacre albums only did it for me because I was so happy they were back.   This new album however, All You Need is Now, brings back the reason I loved them in the 80's. It even has some Arcadia influence in it, I think. Mark Ronson is a true fan of the band and his influence on the album is awesome. The current teenagers might not fancy it but this is a winning album for all of us who grew up in the 80's. And there are a lot of us! Go embrace your youth, put your worries and stress of daily life aside and go enjoy this music. And for people who've never seen them live: they are AMAZING. Their show doesn't involve dozens of dancers, twenty costume changes or flashy acrobatics, but they play music. And they do it well. They interact with the audience. And they have fun doing it! Go see them if they're playing near you in the coming months.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Would love if they also had this on the Android Market. I don't want 2 market apps to check for updates. Can't play ABR if Amazon App store is unistalled. Please Rovio end exclusivity and make it open to everyone even AT&amp;T customers, since I could be one in 12 months thanks to a buy out.
0061801313|5.0|excellent series- if you like gossip girl, one tree hill or any teen drama series youll love this.  much better than the tv show.  great addition to my collection.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|In this movie, ESPN broadcasts a computer-simulated fight between Rocky and the current heavyweight champion [which is likened to the famous 1970 Ali-Marciano computer fight]. The computer fight inspires Rocky to make a comeback at an advanced age.<br /><br />Kevin King, producer of Rocky Balboa, discussed in the Rocky Balboa DVD bonus feature that the Rocky Balboa movie was inspired by George Foreman's comeback to win the title at an advanced age. In his comeback, George was older, wiser and re-invented himself to become a popular fan favorite. Foreman went on to win the title in an amazing comeback after a 10 year hiatus from the ring.<br /><br />Former heavyweight boxer Pedro Lovell appeared in both the original Rocky movie and in the 2006 Rocky Balboa movie. Like George Foreman during his comeback in real life, Spider Rico in the Rocky Balboa movie is older and wiser. Spider's screen time in Rocky Balboa involves reading the Bible and quoting scripture to inspire Rocky just prior to his bout with Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (played by real life boxer Antonio Tarver).
B002ZIAC26|5.0|An excellent album and I like it better than Devotion.  I didn't buy the CD until recently.  I heard the samples when Teen Dream came out a year ago but it just didn't seem to match the beauty of Devotion.  When Teen Dream was listed in several best of 2010 lists, I then thought to take the chance and would also get a free DVD with the CD.  When the CD arrived and I listed to Zebra, Silver Soul and then Norway, I knew this was a winner.  And it got even better. How about the beauty of Lover of Mine?  And 10 Mile Stereo is awesome.  Even the slower and soulful Real Love is powerful.  I can't see how Beach House can top this record but I felt the same after Devotion and was very surprised. BTW, I wasn't that thrilled about the DVD but it's interesting and was free with the CD.
014241011X|2.0|Unlike some of the other reviewers who have given this book a low rating, I'm not going to complain about the appropriateness of this book for children.  The fact is that most children are much tougher-minded than we necessarily would like to believe.  Many, if not most, children I've known have a somewhat twisted sense of humor, and nevertheless have grown up into compassionate and rational adults.  Children are far more discerning than most of us give them credit for.  The highly sensitive or imaginative children who may find this book a bit too scary aren't likely to pick up a book about witches anyway.  My one precaution would be that this is NOT a book for children too young or immature to know the difference between fantasy and reality - but any child whose vocabulary, reading level, and attention span are equal to tacking this novel is almost certainly advanced enough to handle it.<br /><br />I can't say I didn't enjoy \\"The Witches\\" at all.  I did.  But it failed to captivate and delight me as some of Dahl's other children's books have done.  I very much enjoyed \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" and \\"Matilda\\" is one of my all-time favorites.  \\"The Witches,\\" however, was just a little too silly for my tastes.  I expect more wit and cleverness from Dahl.  The premise is intriguing, and the beginning is fun to read, but once the actual witches made an appearance in the story, I found it increasingly difficult to suspend my disbelief.  The conflict is fairly predictable, and the story itself is drawn out far longer than it needs to be; the novel could easily be trimmed by about 50 to 75 pages without losing anything important.<br /><br />Of course, the target audience for this novel may well appreciate its silliness, but even as a child I believe I would have felt let down by this one.  It's not a bad book by any means, but if you really want to appreciate Roald Dahl's trademark twisted wit, pick up \\"Charlie\\" or \\"Matilda\\" instead.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i am disappoint. y u no let me download? y u need an android app store anyway? The market is so much better. geo restrictions ftl.
0061989142|4.0|I liked this book.  It didnt have much in it that I didnt already know but its a cute coffee table book and a good addition to my collection.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Force closes right from the start. Never opens. So it doesn't deserve a single star. The app store is cool looking and works well though...<br />Mytouch 4g
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app from YouVersion takes away all of your excuses for why you just don't have time to spend reading God's Word.  I have this app on my iPad, and now on my Android and it's wonderful.  Where ever I am, I have access to my Bible, reading plans and notes (which has my prayer list in it ;)).    This is by far the best Bible app I've ever used, and the available screen options for my Android makes it easy on my eyes no matter what the setting is.    Thanks YouVersion!
B004SBS8LA|2.0|Only US?!  We all can get it from \\"alternative\\" sources but android users need a better app store! First step is disponibilize it for EVERYONE!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Great price. Went on amazing, my daughter loves them. They're a lot bigger then you think, so make sure you have plenty of room to space them. We have the princess canopy bedroom set so her whole room matches. I will be purchasing these again when we move.  The only down side is it came with these gems, and im not certain if they come off the walls like the decals, so we wont be using them.
B004J4WQ46|3.0|I think we can say with certainty Is This It was merely an anomaly for The Strokes. It appears they unable to replicate the overall sound that made them so popular in the first place. While bands usually mature and grow throughout their career, it is difficult to appreciate music that is so far removed from the original sound.    Most of the record feels like another Julian Casablancas album than a record from The Strokes. It will satisfy most of the die hard fans, but isn't really good enough to attract any new ones. There are 3-4 good songs on this album, and the rest can really be overlooked. Angles would make more sense if it was 2003 and the band was still growing, but after a 5 year break this is a huge disappointment.
B00284BNKC|5.0|I think that this is a must see for any developing adult. I know that there are many movie out there about the destructiveness of drugs. However, I have never seen one hit at the core of peoples emotions the way this one does. The people in this movie, do everything they can for their addictions. You travel with three seperate people, and get to see every stage of their drug addictions. It shows you the effects of several different drugs. You watch the entire process of these functioning adults who turn into a complete mess that have literally ruined their lives, making it even more dramatic. It was amazing to see what these people would go through just to get a fix. The drugs altered their mindset and completely destroyed there sense of perception. This movie is not afraid to show people the worst of the worst. There are certain scenes in the movie that provoke such strong emotions because of the horrible things that are happening to these people. So many times in the movie these things could have been prevented, but were not because of drugs. This movie does an awesome job at allowing you to feel the pain (on a much smaller scale obviously) these people were experiencing.  I think that this is an awesome movie for a coming of age person to watch. Maybe, it could scare some people away from the harmful effects of drugs.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Would like to download this app, but I can't. Or I get an error that payment failed or wrong region :-( (I live in Europe). Please fix this before the free download period has passed.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|They give the app for free for one day but they block it in my region... now it looks like i have to pay for it later -.-
0743277465|5.0|We all know the person who succeeds at anything he touches. \\"Art\\" is the book that sheds light on high and repetitive achievement. I must admit I was first attracted to this book because of the author's youthful success in chess and the great movie that followed his story. But Josh is no one-hit wonder. (In fact, he goes into great detail about why it was so important to him to grow beyond this one area of his life.) In this book he outlines step-by-step what it takes to be a successful adult learner and how each of us has the potential to master new skills and interests. Josh has compiled a fascinating study of the integration of psychology, body mechanics, repetition/rote and generalization of skills from one field of study to a completely different/non-related one. I'm not an athlete, so some of Josh's detailed explanations of his Asian martial arts training went beyond my interest. But the lesson of how to learn new things was not lost on me. I highly recommend this book to lifelong learners and to those who want to learn new things fast.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|feels like an updated system of play for this great series. More kudos are due to Rovio for great work. I had zero issues on my now ageing MT3GS.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|the graphics seem much clearer, first 2 levels are a piece 'o cake and already found a golden pineapple. i give the game 5 stars but the download process sucks. i guess Amazon is giving a better deal than the Marketplace to the developers. install took forever but its the free app of the day, and angry birds with no ads makes me ecstatic!!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Sounds like others are having the same issue. what's up with that? also stop complaining cause you cant install because you are not in the US.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love Angry Birds Rio.  I did not think Angry Birds could get any better.  I WAS WRONG! Makes me want to see the movie.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|No problems downloading the Azmn app nor installing and playing the Rio. Graphics look good and a bit different than the Angry Birds that we are used to. Have fun!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|first learned about Adele through my kids, then an appearance on Saturday Night live and I fell in love. I have followed her ever since and this CD does not let you down.<br /><br />One of her songs (My One and Only) is being sung at my upcoming wedding, and is just the perfect fit.<br /><br />Soulful and innovative, her music is timeless.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Nice interface.....classic angry birds....most people are rating if they can get ths app store in their country and not the app itself. Great game. The graphics look great and if handles really well. Playing it on a huge droid x screen. Loving it.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|For me, it's always a GREAT day when my man Joe releases new tuneage.  I am NOT a professional music reviewer, but I love everything he's ever done, not to mention his humbleness.  My kind of guy all around.  Especially in the absence of Stevie Ray (I'm still grieving).  I know that all music is down to personal taste, and for me, Blues does it mighty fine--'specially Joe's!
B000HC2LI0|1.0|Last year I tried to buy a surprise gift to congratulate my boyfriend on the promotion he received in work. While I was very happy with the reaction (he was totally surprised, happy about the gift and very grateful for the thought) I was less than thrilled with the results.   The quality of a couple of disks were less than great as the voice was not in sync with the lips of the actors and actresses. That was tolerable. What was not tolerable is that months later as we progressed through the series WE DISCOVERED MOST OF THE DISKS DO NOT WORK.  Yes, that is right, from the last couple of discs in Season #3 until the end (Season 7) only three of the discs work. More to my frustration is that I have written a couple of emails and I have not gotten a response.  The bottom line? Although there are some great things to buy on this site, the buyer should be ver careful. Even though it is a pain, in hindsight I should have sat down and loaded each and every disk the first week I bought the series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I. Rooted my atrix and am able to install non market apps,  for anyone who. Can't install it id reccomend rooting your phone,  it's completely worth it
0312330537|5.0|The way that he combines words is just fantastic. He has a way of describing people, places, emotions, situations with just the right descriptors so that you feel you are there, experiencing the story with him. Excellent. My only regret is that there is not a book to follow! I guess I will just have to read it again.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Running super fast on my Optimus S, much faster than the standard Angry Birds.  Levels seem a bit easy to beat early on, but they eventually get much more difficult.  Awesome app, thanks Amazon!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Easy download and install. No issues so far. Fun and addicting game. Dont listen to low raters that dont know what they're doing!  just try it! Verizon Droid X
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Lost :)    Season 4 :)    Amazing on Blu-Ray :)    just buy it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This app won't open on my Sprint HTC EVO. I'm really disappointed! You can do better, Amazon! Please fix ASAP! I need my Angry Birds fix!
0811875555|5.0|This is a great book and a good value as well.  I enjoyed reading about the how and the why behind the visual design of the movie.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why bother with the Android App Store, only to release it in the US only.  This is absolutely 100% fail by you.  Terrible, Terrible.    I'm sure the game is pretty good though.  Probably like the others.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I have an HTC Hero with service from Sprint and I can't get the app downloaded.  I get a message that says it's not available on my phone..??  I guess this is the same as AT&T. Anyone else have that problem with Sprint?  I couldn't post this unless I rated the item, which I have never played so I just put in a rating of 3 to get this posted.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is one of the apps that really rounded out quality, polished gaming on Android, and it's still fun today. Runs just like on iOS - Highly recommended.    edit: I posted this review from my phone, somehow one star was checked instead of five. It was my mistake and it's fixed now!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is my favorite Angry Birds yet!  I love the 3D look.  Works great on my Samsung Transform!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|You want me to turn off a security feature on my phone, opening it up to installation of apps not just from Amazon, but from anywhere? You must be joking.  If you want to sell apps, do it via the Android Market.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I would love to try this app.  first I have to go do the one touch, then I dowload. When i hit install it does not have a progress bar it just says can not be installed. I live in the US, and I have Verizon not AT&amp;T.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Works perfect and saves your game progress of you already have the free version from the marketplace! Making us put a 25 word minimum review sucks tho amazon!
B004J00QLU|3.0|To the only other current reviewer: Just because it is not needed on your device does not make it a bad app or even a below average app.     Task killers are unnecessary on 2.2+, that is Froyo (2.2) and Gingerbread (2.3). There are users running 2.1 Eclair, and they may have a use for a memory management app. Before my Froyo update, I used task killers (the free version of this app as well as others) and they worked quite well at what I wanted it to do. I am giving it three (3) stars because it is not any better than the free alternatives that are offered.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|having the same issue as others with my droid x. downloads fine but simply says application not installed when it tries to install from the amazon app market. can't download without an sd card. i'm sure its a lovely app, i just can't get it.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This game gave me the avian flu. You need to watch out for this crap. I thought it was eradicated.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|If you have ever played any of the games you will notice that there are a few variations, but for the most part it stays true to the concept. If you have never played the games then just sit back and enjoy a movie with a great story and killer effects.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|At some point in the near future, astronaut Sam Rockwell comes face-to-face with himself and his own past and future while getting ready to return to earth after a three-year stint as an industrial miner on the moon, where he lives alone with an artificial intelligence.  Over the last three years, normal communications with earth have been interrupted by a solar flare, meaning he can only receive pre-recorded messages.  When a mining accident leaves him with choices to make about staying or returning to earth, he must weigh considerations about seeing his family and new-born daughter against his other values.<br /><br />Imagine combining stylistic elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien while removing the ET aspects of both.  Moon does this and overlays this retro style on a modern story that examines the interaction of memory, identity, and desire in human experience.  The common sci fi element of dystopian futurism is also present without heavy-handed messages about the evilness of corporations, which is what you might expect from a Sundance film.<br /><br />Definitely recommended and even enjoyed by my family who doesn't like the same movies I do.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I first played this game on iOS and was excited to see it come to Android. I was afraid it would lack the polish of the iOS version, but I was not let down! It is a beautifully made app that somehow finds a way to sneak replay value into the repetitive action of slicing fruit. Feint achievements, things to unlock, and different game modes make this a winner. Try using multitouch and use two swords for extra fun (although I didn't find it to be that helpful toward my score).
0670022411|3.0|I give Harkness credit for her imagination.  This is certainly a genre that's been tackled, thoroughly, as of late.  She finds ways to make her version of witchcraft fresh.  However, the love story takes away from the fun otherworldly business.  The story is put on pause so we can watch Diana eat and go horseback riding with her hot French vampire.  And a lot of it is eye-roll inducing.  Still, the story, the mythology, the history, make it a book worth reading.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome sauce,  have to love Rio.   I think Amazon is on to something with the free app a day giveaway.   What a great way for them to entice you to check out their store.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|What's the point? Why allow installation of app store and gladly take my credit card if I cannot install anything due to stupid location restriction. Sorry Rovio, it might not be your fault
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is truly amazing. I can choose a bible reading plan and take it with me where ever I go. You will not be sorry with this app. You will never be without God's word, a devotional or your reading plan. No excuses! Just like keeping God in your pocket.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Got it for free today; no problem downloading and installing to my Samsung Captivate ( non stock, rooted and running Cognition )   Game play is excellent.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|installs fine on og Droid and plays great.  its nice to see some new screens compared to the original.  great game. definitely recommended especially if you pick it up for free today.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome little spin on the usual formula and an actually decent tie in with a movie (one that makes sense that is). Thankfully though the game doesn't change much from what you already are used to.
0763639184|5.0|I love this book. (I assume my 8-mo old does, too, but at this point her taste is not too discriminating.) The pictures are bold, bright, and charming; the rhymes are clever enough to entertain the adult who's reading; the meter is catchy and fresh. Occasionally, I change the final \\"Hello, Mom!\\" to \\"Hello, Dad!,\\" because I think it's unfair that the majority of children's books focus on mothers rather than fathers. Other than that, this book is perfect!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|What can I say except that it's a great way to pass the time.  Had no problem downloading and installing since I followed the directions and I already knew I had to check the \\"Unknown sources\\" box under Settings - Applications (okay, that last bit was a bit snarky, sorry.) Anyway, it even installed right onto the MicroSD card without having to move it.  Okay, back to it I get before my lunch hour is over.  Kind of feel sorry for any of you out there that can't allow installation of non-Market applications.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|rovio and angry birds continues to impress with this angry birds sequel! great upgrade and well worth it. looking forward to using this on a tablet.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is a bit different from the other two titles, and the graphics are nicer as well. highly recommend for lovers of the angry birds titles... obviously
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game been waiting for this to come out. nice new twist on it go from killing pigs to saveing birds. cant get much better than this game!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The gameplay in this version makes much more sense than previous versions.  also watching all the colourful birds fully away as you free them is very satisfying.  this version runs very well the archos internet tablet.
B001HN69AY|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie was a hot mess. I can't even begin to talk about what went on, because it was so haphazard and disorganized. I viewed it already knowing what the story was and I still could find nothing intelligible in it. Whatever Terry Gilliam was trying to say wasn't comprehensible to me.    There are obviously people who like this kind of movie, but to me it seemed to be pure self-indulgence on the director's part. The whole thing needed stripping down and remaking by someone to whom telling a story mattered. As a 5-minute music video it might have worked; as a two-hour movie it just meandered pointlessly along, a series of barely connected scenes in which anything that Gilliam happened to think of was filmed and included in the movie.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|doesn't work droid x wasted 30 min of my life trying to reinstall and change settings! wished that it would work hope other apps work better than this
B004SBS8LA|1.0|It wont go past the opening screen and says I have to download it again. Not worth this frustration. I have the Epig 4g running Froyo EB13, any hints to getting it to work someone tell me.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|It has taken 6 years for an announcement of the Book 5 dance with Dragons release. Book 4 was abysmal, so my advice is to not start the series.
B00026WUBE|3.0|This album, recorded in the 1970s, is something of a potboiler by Dylan. It doesn't contain much that is memorable (the exception being 'Forever Young' in both fast and slow versions), but it represents mid-period Dylan fairly well. It's probably only for hardcore fans; anyone who wants some Dylan in their collection but not everything has many more interesting and influential albums to choose from. It's also very short, an issue with a number of Dylan's offerings.    Worth a listen if you really love Dylan.
B000WIHSD2|5.0|This product was a great buy.  When I received this I was pleasantly surprised as it is on 3 10\\" records.  That was not specified when I made the purchase.  I didn't notice until I placed it next to a stack of recently listened to records and had to do a double take.  It is on heavy vinyl.  I am not sure if it is 180 or 150 gram but you definitely can tell that there is an improved sound quality.  I highly recommend this for an Queens of the Stone Age fan or just a Josh Homme fan in general.
B003UYUP58|5.0|I heard about the book on NPR and ordered it on Kindle awhile back and just now got around to reading it.  It's not a quick read, but it is written so even we non-medical, not scientific types can follow it.  I found it to be a fascinating \\"biography\\" and history and accounting of the enemy--cancer. The book is very well written (thank goodness for the Kindle dictionary--I needed it), and for such a serious subject, it remains lively enough to hold interest.  I learned so much!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|very poor way to launch an app store. I thought amazon were a multinational company!! I was going to purchase ad free versions of all the angry birds games but am unlikely to do so now. rovio, I hope you are reading these messages
B004SBS8LA|5.0|everything you didnt like in the original and seasons is changed in Angry Birds Rio. And free for limited time!! download it asap....no ads too!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|THIS GAME IS TOTALLY AWESOME! LoL it took about 2 minutes to install and was super easy. For those giving bad feedback, just take a minute to read the instructions; it would probably do you wonders. Game play is awesome, loving the new UI and it's so nice to be shooting more than just pigs!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I found the story to be interesting and liked the way the book was \\"divided\\" in half--in the Room and outside the Room.  It was thought provoking to imagine a little boy who had never been outside of the tiny shed, never in the sunshine, never exposed to general germs, not to mention his lack of social contacts. I found the writing to be good, but not great.  It was a beach book and entertaining.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love it just as I have all the other angry birds.  So far I am only freeing birds and that feels kinder than killing pigs... even if they do have that satisfying pop and flashing 5000.  I just hope I don't run out of bird games to play before the next update rolls around.. withdrawl would kill me!
0312600844|2.0|This is the first Franzen book I have read so I can't comment on the connections to his earlier writings.<br /><br />Fiction, to me, doesn't have to necessarily be believable but there should be a good story.  I think there may be a good story here, but the book suffers from a overly verbose author and a timid editor who didn't put a sharp pencil to the manuscript.  One of the major tenets of writing is to \\"... make every word count.\\"  In \\"Freedom\\" there are way too many that don't.  As such, with other interesting books to read, I gave up on this one about half way through.  No, I'm not advocating a Readers Digest condensed version but a much more slimmed down version that tells the story without letting all the superfluous verbage get in the way.
B004EAQNO4|1.0|I didn't want to give this movie even 1 star. This movie makes me angry that I waisted my time and money on this ugly excuse of a movie. Totaly worthless trash! Hate it!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Graphics are much nicer than the previous AB apps available. Game play seems smoother, the new interface is also very nice. I like the change to freeing the birds and not just destroying the lil piggies. No ads is definitely a plus.Took some effort to load it on my HTC inspire (AT&T) but well worth the effort.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|New graphics and music are great, and gameplay is smoother than ever, even on my lowly Optimus S. Angry Birds better than ever!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having the Bible on my phone. This app has everything I need, and a little more. The reading plans are awesome and it even has audio Bibles!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|As if in Germany there are no dollars to pay for Apps, so very bad start in the market. 0 Stars from me. I'm sure only because you dont want to give the app for free. Not with me
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Got it for free on the grand opening of Amazon appstore! Better graphics and sound than original. Fun like the original but better. Challenging game but doesn't stress you out either. I would recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app so much!  I love the variety of translations and the Bible study plans.  It's really hard to believe that this app is free!
0811870413|5.0|I followed the book as closely as I could.  The result of the Basic Country Loaf was Fantastic.  Nice caramelized crispy crust.  I have never been able to accomplish this before even with spraying water into the oven regularly and with a large pan of water in the oven.  Several of my friends I have shared the bread with have raved that it the best bread they have ever eaten.  These friends are regular bread bakers themselves.   One of then has purchased the Book after reviewing my copy and also purchased a Cast Iron Combo cooker also.  I highly recommend the book.  I am elated with the results.  The results are repeatable.  My GREAT bread was not a fluke.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|this game is pretty fun and has some awesome graphics but I would not pay a dollar for it... good thing its free today! hopefully there's more good free apps to come from amazon
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I didn't know this was coming today, but I am soooooo excited! It's very fun so far. I find it a little disingenuous to give the game 1 star because it wouldn't install properly on your device. Give them time to iron out the kinks on the first day the market goes live, won't you? It's not Rovio's fault.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Great resource for reading books on the go, on your phone.  Access to thousands of free books on Amazon.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Read the news about the launch of Amazon Appstore. Super hyped, I click the link. I see Angry Birds Rio is free for a limited time. Enter frenzy: click link, install Appstore, start it, tap Angry Birds Rio, tap Get App, get error saying \\"The Amazon Appstore for Android is not yet available in your region\\". ARRRGH! Customer satisfaction? Zero! Extremely frustrated? Yes! Why would I need another restricted Appstore? I already have the Android Market. What's different is that I had the Android Market installed on my phone when I purchased it. For the Appstore I had to go through quite a few steps just to install a useless application. Amazon FAIL.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|This app has someo thing best remote desktop performance out there. Unfortunately the android version lags a bit behind the iOS version. It works fine on my phone, but on my Xoom there are a few issues. It used to force close. They've fixed that so it runs, but it only supports two resolutions and neither are the Xoom native resolution, so you have to slide the screen around. This is functionality the I pad version has. In addition, it does not support bluetooth keyboards, which once again, the I pad does. It feels quite obvious that they prioritize iOS development and just did a quick fix to get this to work on tablets. Here's hoping the increased attention the Amazon app store brings will encourage them to at least bring the android version up to the iOS level.
0786955570|2.0|The rule book isn't detailed enough and I was constantly left wondering what I was supposed to be doing. Once I got the hang of the shallow game play, I became bored and shelved it. I'm really disappointed because I was so excited to play.   For future games, make the rule book longer so the rules arn't vague.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|Now it's complete....my collection of horror movies...I Love the Saw movie franchise...sad to see it end but glad it did to avoid any stupid plotlines like some horror movies have been known to do...not naming names but what would Jigsaw do in Space seriously....just saying....but this movie is worth the buy and watch....
B004GYY714|5.0|I've tried more than a dozen radio apps and this one is by far the best. Huge selection of stations. That would be enough for me, the on demand shows put it over the top. The UI takes a little bit to get to used to but once you've done that it's a very powerful app. Combing that with a RadioTime account for keeping presets and it's easily the best cross platform program I have.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|soy un consumidor frecuente de amazon, de hecho me dedico a vender productos de ustedes en mi pais venezuela, y hoy quise probar la app de su market y luego de muchas trabas(oneclick setting,extra donwoadeds and etc) me dicen \\"lo sentimos no esta disponible para su region\\" porque no decirlo desde un principio'?!     vamos que han empezado con muy mal pie! si querian hacerse de un hueco en android han fallado..    lastima se veia buena la idea solo que la ejecutaron de forma pesima      si existieran las calificaciones negativas esto tendria -5
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It has updated graphics, new types of materials to smash through, and Rio birds in cages instead of pigs. in my opinion, it's more satisfying to free birds from cages than beating up pigs. A+
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Wow this game is awesome! Totally redesigned interface, objectives, and music. The game play also seems much easier then compared to the original Angry Birds. Hope fully with Amazon doing their app store it will lead to higher quality apps on the android market.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Droid X.  For all of the Angry Birds games, I have to unmount the SD card in order to get the game to install correctly.  For this one, it will give an error if the SD card is unmounted, and tells you to mount the card.  Trying it this way, I get the same problem as the other AB games. An installation error.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love Angry Birds, and have been playing on my iTouch for about a year, this is a fun, vibrant version. Works great on the Droid2
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Best version yet, Graphics are better then either previous version and runs so so much better then earlier versions. A much more enjoyable experance
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cd, and jhud to. she's such an amazing women and artist.. Album shows just how versatile she is as an artist, love her so much !!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I could not put this book down. I learned more about World War 1 from this book than I did during my 8 years of High School and College. The characters are real, the story is real, and the enjoyment from reading this novel is real. I have read all of Ken Follett's book and this is my favorite - it looks intimidating at almost 1000 pages - but you don't notice the length once you read the first page. I recommend this to anyone who would like to learn a bit of history as well as being entertained while doing so - in my top 10 of favorite books!  I cannot wait for the other 2 to come out -
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Will not let me install on HTC Evo don't understand why.  downloaded just fine. unsuccessful. and then this thing wants me to write twenty five words...
B004EBZX6W|4.0|At the time of this review, Amazon has version 2.5.2, but the Android Market has version 2.5.6.  So I guess that's one thing to keep an eye on--is Amazon supplying outdated apps?  Also, the Amazon Appstore app is telling me I should \\"update\\" this app (Wifi Analyzer), but of course, I would be updating to an older version.    Update: now up to date.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I see the app in the store, can read details about and even click to download without any warning that the app is not available outside the US. Amazon, you can do better than this.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The Amazon music store is easy to use and includes nearly every band and song available through normal retail sale. Some indie bands may be missing, but the overall selection is solid. The MP3s can be played on any of your devices so you're not locked in to a particular company's products.
B0009PAVI2|2.0|The Tamrac S.A.S. Compact Filter Case is well constructed, rugged, and will hold filters securely. That said, I found two problems, on minor, one major, with the design:    Minor: the pockets don't expand in true \\"accordion\\" fashion due to how they're sewn to the back. The result is the front pocket is smaller than the back.    Major: No photographer in their right mind would entrust their filters (as shown in the product image above) to a case where anything would touch, contaminate, and possible permanently damage them. That's why all quality filters come with some type of hard container for storage. The size of the container drastically reduces the size of the filter the MX-S5363 can hold. A practical maximum limit may be as small as 50mm.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Make sure it works completely before you release it......should have put it out on the Android Market instead of doing something with Amazon. For whatever reason it will NOT install to my Droid X. Unknown Sources is marked to allow acces, yet the software will not install. We'll see how Amazon works in the next few days, otherwise I'm ditching the Amazon Android Marketplace and putting protection back on my phone....how dumb to put it somewhere other than the Android Market    ***EDIT***    one problem I have since found with Rio - you can only play so far until it won't let you go any longer. I've beat both levels it comes with but the next listing says 'May 2011' - guess that means I have to wait until May to get any more games to play. Geee that's really dumb...good thing this thing came out as free so I didn't have to waste money to get a short amount of games
B0021L8V0M|4.0|wow grate movies of course its fiction and farfetched  but its still good  Angelina Jolie, did a real good job as always. I cant believe some of the   comments my god its a movies. Am pretty choosey in the movies I buy  am very seldom wrong and I was right on with this one glad I bought it.  by the way I have over 5,000 movies. give this movies ****
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The only benefit of the real kindle over android is the screen size and battery life. If you are used to Android screens, you're all set.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|why oh why launch the new appstore with a blaze of publicity, then only allow yanks to use it? whats wrong with the rest of the world?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|fun and cool game! glad to finally own some angry birds! works great on the good ole Motorola Droid. highly recommended clean fun! glad Amazon launched this store.
B0001WTVUW|4.0|The Day After THIS MOVIE give you some idea what it might be like after  a war using atomic  bombs not very nice they did a good job making this movie.  It is a little dated. I thought the movie \\" Thereds\\"  was better more realistic  but that movies hard to come by. all in all I give this movie The Day After ****
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds really stepped it up! A bit different from the other versions. It takes a while to download but totally with it. A rio success!
0756404738|5.0|If you are hesitant on buying this novel based on reviews, i say don't listen to them! You will never know till you have read it ;-).  I wasn't disappointed, couldn't put this book down!  We actually get to see some stunning battles which involves our stunning hero, Kvothe.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|nice new graphics. new game concept is better. faster loading than previous versions. good amount of levels to start with. great that its free!  not liking this 25 word requirement Amazon ...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Best Angry Birds yet, very \\"3D\\" feel to it, a nice evolution to the experience with the game.  The 1-star reviews are people that either don't know how to work their phone or are feeling entitled, like the Amazon Appstore is a god-given right, regardless of the fact this is exclusive to North America for now.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Wasted 15 minutes installing the amazon app store to discover it's not available in the UK. Amazon has completely wasted my time, so I won't be using it when/if it does become available in the uk. I'll stick to the official marketplace. It really wouldn't have been hard to segment the mail to ensure that it was US registered customers that received it or just to include a notice up front before the rest of the world installed a useless app on a platform where space is often at a premium - amazon has lost a lot of goodwill with this.
B004J4WQ46|4.0|It has been nearly a decade since The Strokes' debut album hit the shelves. Originally categorized as garage rock revivalists, The Strokes' took the start of the 21st century by storm with \\"Is This It\\" and dominated the college market with two additional albums, \\"Room on Fire\\" and \\"First Impressions of Earth.\\"<br /><br />Although every member has worked on various side projects since the release of \\"First Impressions of Earth,\\" it has been five years since we have heard any new material from The Strokes. Guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. and lead singer Julian Casablancas have each had notable success with their solo endeavors, but the anticipation surrounding \\"Angles\\" far exceeds any of the buzz they've received in the past five years.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Machu Picchu,\\" \\"Angles\\" starts off sounding most similar to Julian Casablancas' solo release despite being the first Strokes album for which Casablancas has shared writing credits with the band for every song.<br /><br />With a reggae style guitar on the verses, \\"Machu Picchu\\" doesn't exactly carry that definitive Strokes sound fans were craving, but thanks to Casablancas' trademark vocals and the band's stylistic transitions between sections, there are enough key elements to verify The Strokes have, indeed, returned.<br /><br />Any fans disappointed by the initial direction of \\"Angles\\" don't have to wait long before their fears are put to rest. \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" brings everything you loved about classic tracks like \\"Last Nite\\" back without sounding like a recycled single. With a blend of clean and distorted guitars, The Strokes lay out a familiar rough around the edges framework with a tempo upbeat enough to keep fans dancing on their run of festival gigs this summer.<br /><br />While the vintage Strokes sound of \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" will delight many longtime fans, \\"Gratisfaction,\\" is the only other tune that doesn't stray much from the original formula.<br /><br />The absence of guitars on \\"Games\\" is the first glaring experiment for The Strokes on \\"Angles,\\" but sonically, The Strokes try on many new hats throughout the album. The fade in on \\"Taken for a Fool\\" and the '80s textures of \\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\" help to keep \\"Angles\\" from becoming one-dimensional, but as the songs progress, they still prove to be undeniably The Strokes.<br /><br />In songwriting, Casablancas' influence still reigns supreme, but the collective minds of the other members do add a flare the previous Strokes albums lacked.<br /><br />While the overall mood of \\"Angles\\" remains relatively positive, \\"You're So Right,\\" evokes memories of The Strokes' most successful darker track, \\"Reptilia.\\"<br /><br />In an interview with British entertainment magazine NME, Casablancas described the track as having some \\"early R.E.M. vibes.\\" \\"It counters the happy vibes on the other tracks,\\" he continued.<br /><br />Although The Strokes debut is still their best, \\"Angles\\" starts the band's second decade of existence with a bang. Will they have as much influence on the next 10 years of music as they did the past ten? Only time will tell.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Franz Ferdinand, The Hives<br />Track Suggestion: \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\"on \\"Angles,\\" but sonically, The Strokes try on many new hats throughout the album.

B003ZYU3T6|5.0|I won't go into the plot of this film.  Chaplin fans all around the world know that Modern Times is one of his best films.  However, seeing it on Blu-ray is an incredible experience.  Sharp, crystal clear, as if one could reach in and actually touch the characters on the screen.  I have always loved classic films and it never occured to me how great B&W movies could look in high definition.  It is so sharp that even the film grain can be seen.  Back during the early 80's I owned a Super 8 film print of Modern Times that had cost me over $200.00.  Without hesitation I can say my film print pales in comparison to this Blu-ray dvd.  If you love Chaplin or classic films in general, get this.
0393960188|5.0|I absolutely love Jane Austen, so I'm utterly biased but even for anyone not interested in her work the notations and explanations make it easier for the story and terms to be understood.  Really is a great book.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Will not install on stock Droid X, on Verizon network. Tried unmounting SD card and that did not work. Tried rebooting, no good. Hope they fix this soon. What a pain!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is so awesome. I love how smoothly it runs on my htc mytouch 3g. I'm also partial to Brasil since I lived there for a couple years.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Just so people know how to install this app, you have to unmount your sd card.  It takes two seconds to do. Once the app is installed you can mount your sd card and move the game to it.  This has been an ongoing issue even in Google's market.  Hopefully a fix will come soon, but just unmount the sd card before installing the game.
B001TH8UUA|3.0|i got it for my ps3 and every now and then (10 times a day) it would black out with no sound in the middle of a game for 30 seconds. then it would come back like nothing happened. then the next week i got cats and they chewed rite through it in 1 bite. get a braided one if you have pets. i just got another one (10 dollars for a 10' braided one) and its better.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|1 start votes are from att users since it doesnt install on their crappy service.   Awesome app tho, works great on,the htc evo 4g for sprint.
B0036EH3XE|4.0|Like most watchers, I held my breath for the final season; then promptly forgot about it and later, in a cleaning spree, took a request for the DVD, Season Six, from the top of my Want List.  While I am convinced, in the end, that the writers and producers of \\"LOST\\" made the story up as they went along, I would be among the last to deny that the series produced weekly, far-out and over-excited theorizing, much eager waiting, and a lot of fun.  I would not have dreamed of being anywhere on Tuesday nights, other than in front of the screen.....Or was it, indeed, Tuesday nights?  It might have aired on Friday....Nah.  There were different scenarios around the water cooler for TGIF.  Monday, maybe?
0596805888|4.0|A cool book.  I first saw an excerpt in Parade magazine explaining how to calibrate your oven with sugar.  Explains the whys of things you are simply instructed to do in traditional cookbooks.  My chicken and shrimp are no longer rubbery.  I understand the difference between instant yeast and dried yeast.  Brought this book on vacation and ended up buying a second for my mom.
B004SBULWE|1.0|shuts down necessary applications for androids to work propperly. do not install. it has made many of my androids non-repairable and had to be replaced.- samsung epic
B004SBS8LA|5.0|worked on my g tablet by force stopping amazon app store from application settings and then clicking on the Angry birds rio app. It asks you to sign in to use the app. Signed in with my amazon credentials and snap it worked fine. No unknown error is displayed
B004SBS8LA|1.0|i tried to do download this on my ipod 3rd generation but when i pressed on the email and then on the link it just said safaria cannot open this file because it does not support it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it!   Even better than the first one!   Love the new sounds and graphics. Awesome that Android users get it before iPhone users for once.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its nice to have some more levels of fun with different set ups!!!  lots of fun!!!!  its a game that is hard to beat for .99.  but free is even better!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by FAR the best Bible app available for Android and I would say it's the best app available for Android PERIOD!  With the recent edition of audio to many Bible translations, you can listen to the Bible or follow along with the audio.  It's GREAT!  So many translations of God's Word have never been available this easily!  And, it's FREE!  May God bless you as you read and listen to His Word!!!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The book was amazing to begin with but I feel that the author took the \\"Easy\\" way out (to say it without giving it away) at the second part. Instead of really examining how he (Jack) would feel after that occurred, I feel it was glossed over so it could end pretty.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Rovio does it again! I love this game. Works great on my Viewsonic G Tablet and my Samsung Vibrant. Very smooth game that provides hours of fun.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I love the graphics update. wish that there was some more levels available though. it didn't take too long to beat. overall great game. can't wait for the rest of the updates.
B004H1YH66|5.0|Yes it is not the original score and sounds different than the movie..    However I think most will feel that most of the time it does sound very similar to the movie if not better and will enjoy it just as much if not more since it is so well done.    I also enjoy the original recording but this one is very enjoyable and includes music from the movie that is not found in the other 2 releases of the soundtrack.    Very Powerful and a Must Have for any Fan of the original soundtracks.
159420229X|5.0|By far the best book I've read in the last year. You may have heard of the book and its author already; Joshua has been all over the radio and television lately talking about the unlikely series of events that led to this book's creation.    While covering the 1995 U.S. Memory Championships, Joshua befriended several of the contestants, who assured him that there was nothing inherently extraordinary about their memory feats. Nothing extraordinary about committing to memory the exact order of dozens of decks of cards? In less than an hour? Or a single deck in under a minute? Or spitting out the names that go with a hundred faces one only had minutes to look at? Or thousands of digits of pi?    Unconvinced, Joshua asks how this is possible. Surely these are mental freaks, born quite different from us. Right? Over the next year, Joshua begins exercising his memory using techniques known and discussed by Socrates. The same techniques religious leaders have long used to memorize long Bible passages, the entire Torah, even the totality of the Koran!    Less than half the book details Joshua's year of becoming a memory athlete; the rest of the book is an exploration of human memory and the long history it has in our collective culture. The works of Homer, the glorified status memory used to possess, the changes in our education system over generations, the changes that perhaps should be made today, the new world we live in with offloaded memory on electronic devices, it all goes explored.    Even better are the people Joshua meets. He spends time with Kim Peek, the real life figure who inspired the movie Rain Man. Like only a few figures in recorded history, Kim remembers every single thing he reads. He reads books at a rate of ten seconds a page, with each eye scanning its own page! He spends time with a man who cannot remember anything, who lives in a constant state of the present, one sentence at a time, and what this means for his view of the world. He also discusses several classic cases from the annals of psychology, men and women who go by initials to protect their identity.    In the end, Joshua has a message directed right at college students: normal people can do extraordinary things. His is no different from the rest of us. One year of dedicated work, just an hour a day, and he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championships. He found himself inducted into an exclusive fraternity, he even broke some records along the way. And what he learned about developing his memory extends to everything that takes practice. He goes at length on the theory of the \\"OK Plateau,\\" where people learn to coast and not put in extra effort. Joshua's story is one about how, latent in us all, there lies the ability to push beyond this plateau and do something that would amaze even us.    This is easily the most engaging book I've read this year. I liken it to BORN TO RUN in that it is part the author's story of joining a small fraternity of freak athletes and finding that anyone else could as well, and part a history of an ability with key importance to human history that is being lost in the modern age. And yet, I liked it BETTER than BORN TO RUN (which is saying a lot). For one, the subject applies to all of us who barely know a phone number anymore and would be lost without our cell phones. Plus, the personal story uses up less space, is well-documented (leaving no room for wondering about exaggerations), and it is far better written. I say all this as one of the biggest fans of BORN TO RUN. I'll be recommending this book to everyone I know (even those whose names I can never quite remember).
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Many phones warn against installing non-market apps, just enable option allow install in settings. Amazon did a great job reviewing and publishing these apps, thanks!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Who doesn't love Angry Birds? And who doesn't love the new twists they've added for Rio? When the world is falling apart, I can pull up my flinging friends on my phone and escape for a few minutes or a whole afternoon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the You Version Bible.  You can download tons of versions for offline use, and there are audio versions also.  It is very easy to keep pace during sermons at church, not to mention the reading plans and devotional plans.  Download and try it, I hope you love it as much as I do.<br /><br />If you have been wanting to get back into reading The Word, this is your chance.  It's so convenient and user-friendly.  God Bless!
0670022411|5.0|I am the ultimate LK Hamilton and Karen Marie Moning fan and I find it very dificult to find new authors to catch my attention. This book started off great and sucked me in. This is an excellent read and thought provoking on some levels. I loved it! Great buy! I was hurt to see that I paid $20+ in the store. Amazon is the better buy.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|For those people having problems installing, just enable non-market installs in your phone. The store should be available outside the US soon, this was just first step. Also dont post bad reviews to this app just to blame amazon, reviews and comments are extremelly important to developers.
B004S8NBDI|2.0|The pre-album release of the single \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" had me eagerly anticipating the release of \\"Angles.\\" However, once given the chance to listen to the whole album, it unfortunately falls short of the expectations set forth by the lead single. There's a few tuneful hooks here and there, but most just drone on - quite an accomplishment for an album that has only one song that's over 4 minutes! I'm not into lyrics that much, but if I was, I'd be disappointed there too - there are only a few words mumbled by Julian Casablancas that can be understood.    I'm still a The Strokes fan, but this does not represent their best work.
1439102813|5.0|I was sad to reach the last page of this book. It is so well written and the characters were well developed. By the end of the book I felt as though I personally knew Alice.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|downloads on mine but won't install. big bummer. I don't have anthing else to say, but it's a 25 word minimum to post a comment
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Graphics are better than previous versions. Upcoming Rio movie looks cute too. Unlocks new boards monthly. Can play the first two boards now. Just filling words in now to reach the twenty five word minimum post...
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Excellent performance on my HTC EVO, downloaded and installed smoothly. Besides it's free great job Amazon and Rovio. Free ads free version of best to date Angry Birds. What could be better?
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I'd love to give a review BUT it is not available in Android Market, therefore no AT&T users get it.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|The only reason I got through this installation and one click activation which requires PC interaction is Angry Birds. But all I get is &ldquo;Not available in your region&ldquo;... I am really disappointed about this...
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install on evo. Not sure what happens. Click install instantly says &quot;install not successful&quot; now trying to make my 25 word minimum this it
B0018SWA56|5.0|I had never read anything by Emily Giffin before, but this book got me hooked.  I bought the rest of the collection and I recommend them to everyone.  Totally a chick book - but one of my guy friend's read this particular book and thought it was a good read.
B003N5VOUO|1.0|I saw the movie and it was really painful to watch. The theme of the story is controversial. This is the story of a Muslim who is secular and has Asperger's syndrome.  The director tries all ways to portray this lead character as empathetic and intelligent individual with a syndrome, which actually makes movie silly and rather dishonest. After drenching people with hugely exaggerated emotional drama, the lead character in the movie takes up the responsibility to make America know that people with names ending with Khan are not terrorists, because he was mistreated due to his name. However, he never tries to tell the other side of story, which indirectly suggesting that Muslims condone the violence done by Islamic extremists and it's okay to do so.     This movie is purely commercial and aimed at Muslim community. There is no truth or valid argument in this movie about anything, but still this movie got great reviews by some people just because they want to be politically correct. I would still recommend this movie so that people can see how dishonest movies can be. I am from India and this movie is flop show in India.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Wow, I thought the polish on the old angry birds games was high, but this sets a whole new bar.  Same gameplay (except you have to free the birds instead of kill the pigs) but graphics, polish all turned up to 11.    Well done!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|When will you realise that this is a disrespectful way of treating the majority of your customers that don't live in the US?  You've also locked this out of the regular Android market to add salt to the wounds. I expected better from Amazon.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is a great addition to the series. I was a bit depressed that it's only on amazon, but it was easy to get
B004JN1D2I|1.0|The books are excellent and I am buying them on my kindle to reread them before A Dance With Dragons is released BUT this version is more expensive than buying the four books separately.    Granted it is only $0.03 more expensive, but it should be cheaper, not more expensive to buy the books as a \\"bundle\\".
B004SBS8LA|5.0|INSTALLED VIA: Amazon Appstore  INSTALLED ON: Verizon HTC Incredible - unrooted    THE GAME: The game rocks! Runs very smooth/fast. Sounds great. Pretty light install size. Overall a great addition to the Angry Bird titles.    THE OTHER COMMENTERS: Not so swift. The game is currently only available via Amazon's Appstore. You will need to meet the current technical specifications in order to run the Amazon Appstore in order to download Angry Birds Rio.    The Amazon Appstore restrictions are included on every app posted on this site so far. But here are the requirements MOST negative reviews have been about:    1) YOU MUST LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN ORDER TO USE THE APPSTORE!  2) AT&T PHONES ARE ACTING WONKY WITH THE AMAZON APPSTORE, THUS APPSTORE IS NOT AVAILABLE ON AT&T PHONES.    Here are some extra restrictions regarding using the Appstore (these are not on every app page):  3) SOME ROOTED PHONES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE APPSTORE.  4) OLDER PHONES & OLDER ANDROID VERSIONS MAY NOT RUN GAMES/APPS SMOOTHLY DUE TO HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS/RESTRICTIONS.  5) IN ORDER TO USE THE AMAZON APPSTORE YOU NEED AN ANDROID PHONE!    It seems that a lot of people have come on here to vote the game down, but their rating is not based on actual game play. They give Rio one star because they don't meet the requirements above (and Amazon clearly states on each app page). If you don't meet Amazon's Appstore requirements then just wait a few days or weeks to download the app from the Android Market.    Here is the Appstore help page for more information about the Appstore's current limitations and how to use the Appstore: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200551840. That page has a feedback form on it. Complain to Amazon on there, not on individual app pages.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|to your mother.  kinda seems like a jank version of the real deal, but the price was right,  fo rizzle,  my rioizzle.  25 seconds of silence, track 15!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my evo as does the new amazon app store... It's about time someone built an app store that really works. Congrats amazon.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I wasn't thrilled with the idea of this being a tie-in game to a movie, as if Rovio is \\"selling out\\", but it's got a lot more polish graphically than the other games, and I think it definitely needed to progress there. No complaints about gameplay, it is Angry Birds, after all. Add to that the gradual release of levels throughout the year, which will keep it fresh and interesting.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Its polished, fun and has a good comic book story line, Omg 25 words is there really that much more to say, download it. always a good app to have so you can pass the time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Today was day #1 trying level 1 of this product.  It has only been an hour since I tried it & I can already feel the \\"burn\\" in my thighs.  I thought the way Jillian did her circuits was great.  It let me \\"rest\\" after cardio while still working out doing strength and then abs.  I can't wait to see the results.  Since I haven't worked out in a while & out of shape (I am 33 yrs old, 5'9, 170 lbs) I did have to shorten the circuits a bit since I was totally out of breath but after time I am confident that I will be able to get through each level entirely.  I would totally recommend this product.
B004GYY714|1.0|This app is a must have. Crystal clear reception for all the radio stations you can want, local or across the country. Excellent app. -Droid X
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is far and away the best bible reading app, and they continue to support it with new features and updates.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Simply put, Amazing. Rio works great and looks great on my Droid X. Thanks Angry Birds and Rio. And we even get to know when the next levels will be available ... awesome awesome, awesome.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|graphics pop!  no ads!   nice movie tie in .  what more could you want?  oh, ya, it's free!  what are you waiting for?  go get it now!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|same basic game as the first two versions of angry birds, only now the graphics are much improved. also, the layout is different, I'm excited to play through
B004SBS8LA|1.0|That first game was brilliant but since I live  outside the US I can't play this. Why would they make the game Americans only? Let us play
B004SBS8LA|5.0|easy to install. no problems at all, whole process took 2 minutes from entering my email address to playing the game on HTC Evo 4G. i suspect the people with all the problems might need to get a better phone/ network or maybe just read the instructions for the install better.     as for the game play. its a very addicting game, if youve played angry birds before then you already know this. no bugs so far and gameplay is smooth as ever.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on Droid X and Motorola Xoom. The new UI looks great.  I also agree that ppl should stop giving bad reviews because of AT+T.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Love Angry Birds Rio on my Xoom but the lack of timely updates from Amazon is unacceptable, particularly since they had the exclusive on the release of Rio.  UI, purchasing and updates are far superior on the Android Market.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hook up your phone to your PC, find the device in windows explorer, CUT and paste the .android_secure folder (near the top of the list) onto your PC (this folder is corrupt). The folder will recreate on your phone when you unplug from the computer. Disconnect your phone and than install Rio again. After installing, go back to the .android_secure folder on your computer and copy the files in the folder back into the .android_secure folder on your phone. Worked Great for me and many others!!  Excellent Game once you get it installed!    PS- for this to work your SD card MUST be mounted or you will not see the .android_secure folder.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|I remember watching this movie while I was young and I loved it just as much now.  The plot is fantastic, the evil aliens are gruesomely awsome.  The CGI suffers, but must have been pretty good for the time it was made.  If you are a sci-fi fan, you won't want to miss this one.
0439023513|4.0|A few spoilers, possibly you have been warned     Though i felt rather sadden and frustrated by the end of the novel with its rather lethargic ending the to the series. The ending fit the story that was presented.     Kathiss is and will never be a strong independent character, if one knows this and understand this the ending served the story arc perfectly. And it is this fact that makes Mockingjay a story that goes beyond the simple happy ending.    Most young adult fiction gives that perfect, everything is right with the world ending. But the Hunger Games series turns that around on the top of its head and gives a story that fits the dark post apocalyptic world.     Even though some might argue the story arc is unfulfilled because Kathiss as a character did not grow, this has some merit since Kathiss remains the same pawn she has played for the prior two novels only for District Thirteen instead of The Capitol. However, this is not necessarily a downside at all. She indeed does not grow but she is not given an opportunity to do so. Through out the entire series she's been taught to act and play to the higher powers and that's the highest point her character can be until inevitably falling.     It is through the shock at the end that makes the series memorable and creates that disgust in your mouth that many classic books create. Though I am comparing this to the classics, I am only referencing them to put the story in perspective the the greater range of stories that are already out there.     Yes, the ending was a shock and a tragic disappointment ,but that's the book's greatest strength. And that is why the novel receives a 4 out of 5 stars. It loses a few points for not expanding and attempting to go out the comfort zone of Kathiss. Though that might be another technique that the author used to enhance the story. No matter what, Mockingjay is a must read in order to enjoy some closure to this great series that stands strong against many other young adult novels.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Oh yeah! This is cool. Its kinda annoying that you have to have a 25 word minimum. But that's not angry birds fault :-)  ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya This might prevent me from doing Morely reviews.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|just as good as any angry birds game. only change is u free birds rather than kill pigs. graphics are great. i got it for free but its worth .99 cents
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like how this app syncs with the kindle/kindle apps.  makes it easy to have reading material just about everywhere.  magazine subscriptions are nice too, I just wish it would remember what page I was reading last on my 2600 subscription.

0307472841|2.0|As a fan, one who has read all of Mankell's detective stories, I found this book far too didactic, ideologically overblown and, yes, politically pathetic.  For Mankell to intimate that Mao was just somewhat misguided when he was, in fact, personally responsible for the death of millions of people; for him to suggest that the bad guys on the global economic scene are free market capitalism and individualism rather than the persistent and extensive statism still evident throughout, including, sadly, in the U.S.A. (but much more so in China and Africa which Mankell blindly prefers despite the criminal leadership in both) is absurd and shows how ignorant he is of economic history and theory (e.g., wealth is gained via zero sum exchanges, which is ancient practice, not post-Adam Smith economics); and for him to hold out faith in the top down management of huge countries and continents by some supposedly well intentioned tyrants, all this is difficult to take even from someone whose writing is often entertaining and subtle. Mankell wants the world run according to his lights never mind that millions clearly choose not to follow his lead. When he starts condemning North Korea and Cuba and Venezuela for their vicious regimes and ambitions I will pay some attention to Mankell's political sentiments.  Until then he will be on par with Che Guevara, another talented man duped by Marx & Co. to believe that world needs to be set right by some socialist rulers.
0793518326|5.0|This is the most comprehensive compilation of the beatles music found in one place.  This book is a must for Beatles Music Afficianado's and Musicians.  If you want to know how they did it, then it is all here.  Worth the money.  Even just to have as Beatles history.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Finally... an ad free version for free!  So it's a new idea... save rio birds instead of kill pigs... i kinda miss the pigs.  The new display for the starts also makes it feel like more of an accomplishment. Good Work!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A free angry birds with no ads. Worth joining amazon market. Did I mention it's angry birds with cleaner graphics, slightly improved gameplay AND NO ADS. FOR FREE
B004SBS8LA|5.0|angry birds does it again. Love the reworking of the theme, and I'm not sad to see those evil pigs go. The new story is actually really good with the rescue of the exotic birds to the escape into the jungle. Dont forget to collect those golden fruits!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So Amazon is at fault because you guys outside of the US didn't read?    * Amazon Appstore is only available to customers located in the United States    Right in the description.  You really can't blame Amazon for overlooking that.  No need to rate the game down because of something you didn't do.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have a love, hate relation with angry birds. I don't mind playing it, but it's not something that I put on my top 5. Angry birds Rio is definitely the best in the series. Love the graphics, and the gameplay is very smooth on my Captivate. Highly recommended.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This movie was both clever and amusing, while being surprisingly \\"clean\\" considering the subject matter.  It was comfortable enough to watch with my teens, without getting that squirmy feeling that comes up when a movie has more swear-words or nudity than you'd want your kids to see you viewing.  (Or for you to admit they watch, either.)
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Sit back, turn on your stereo and relax to Mojo.  I found this album to be a very satisfying and enjoyable mellow experience. My favs are Don't Pull Me Over, and Pirate's Cove.  Very reminiscent of TP earlier work, with some reggae and blues thrown in. I think this album should get played more on the radio. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers get a thumbs up from me for this album.
0670022411|5.0|This story is truly enchanting, magical, amazing. Okay well I could go on and on. I bought this book when I actually saw it on a shelf at my local Borders, but I had known about it since the review in People magazine. Just reading the review made me crave to read this book. I have read a lot of book with Vampires, Witches, and Demons. This book has a lot of history mixed with fun, and adventures. It is a great read! It pages are oddly long, and it has taken me a long time to read. But to tell you the truth it is worth it. I've been reading about all the buzz and now that I know there will be more books, that got me even more excited about this book.
B004LP601S|5.0|I am so happy that they are back to the way they were before.  (let's just forget that Pretty. Odd. even happen, okay?)  But, this cd has less songs on it than Fever, but they are still good.  I'm not too good at describing why I like a band, but when I heard \\"Ballad of Mona Lisa\\" all I could keep thinking was, \\"Welcome back, Panic!\\"  And, they are back.  I agree with one of the other reviewers when they said that this wasn't grammy-award winning music, but there are plenty of songs that people love that never won a grammy.  If you liked their Fever cd, then you'll like this one, too.<br /><br />Once again, welcome back Panic!<br /><br />&lt;3
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is a good fun game, and you can't beat that free price tag. I look forward to seeing what additions are in store.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm not sure why this has bad reviews. It's a cute concept and it plays just as well as original angry birds with some new design ideas. I'm enjoying it as much as the regular game if not more in it's own way.
0553382179|5.0|This book will inspire you with good ideas about how to organize your home and your life.  The author is very validating and upbeat.
B000WGNLLW|5.0|I had to write something given all the bashing this album gets! No it doesn't have a rock sound and no it's not Duran's usual 'Duran' sound but it comes close in tracks like 'Tempted' & 'Box Full O Honey'. I enjoyed the change in production (and I'm a Duran fan since the very beginning!) and I enjoyed the dance edge of the project. It's a shame 'Falling Down' was the first single as it's not reflective of the sound at all! 'Skin Divers' would have made a beter choice as first single.<br />I know alot of Duran fans disagree but I have to say I found this to be an enjoyable listen. Hightlights for me are, 'The Valley,'Red Carpet Massacre','Box Full O Honey','Skin Divers,'Tempted' & 'She's Too Much'.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004L49K20 All You Need Is Now]]

B004SBS8LA|3.0|come on amazon. global market and all that. why let me install the market in the first place, wasting my time. poorly organised launch and i suggest the store needs some work yet before it's as slick as the google one
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Really upset - I get the dreaded :Free up some space on your phone and try again\\" message. A 13.1 MB free application is a cruel joke for how Android phones work. You CAN'T save the Apps to the SD card, only to internal memory. So I have to now go thru and delete everything from my phone to make room for this to work.<br /><br />Appstore will fail due to how Android phones (don't) work.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm sure the game is great for those with newer spiffy android phones but those of us with older (HTC Eris) limited phones - even with a 16GB SD card, the phone is a joke.
B004RLPWXS|5.0|Thank you Mark Ronson for bringing back Duran Duran's classic sound without sounding dated! Highlights are 'Being Followed', 'The Man Who Stole A Leopard', 'Leave A Light On', 'Blame The Machines' & 'Girl Panic'!<br /><br />If you were a fan of the bands earlier work or just want to listen to some great energetic pop/dance/rock....get this!!!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I'm on Tmobile and I still can't download. Says I need to add a payment method to my one-click settings. I checked and I do have a payment method. Thanks Amazon!
B000001GXC|5.0|I know George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra own these works but, for my money, this is the definitive recording. The performances are exquisite. Though they were recorded in 1971 and 1973, they are equal to today's recordings. I am very impressed and I highly recommend this CD.
B000FGGERC|5.0|I did not know who these guys were. I am not a huge fan of death metal singing, so I wen't to the progressive nation tour without much hope for this band. They blew me away! They were so good! Death Metal is so much better live. While he was growling his lyrics it would shake your guts. It was great! Then they played Hope Leaves and I was like WHAT THE HELL! I did not expect such a perfect song to be played in the middle of all the anger. What a voice! I was very impressed. I was hooked. It took me a while to track down the song so now I have most of their CD's but this is my fav and the only one that I felt compelled to write a review on. I hope they do another recording like this without the Death Growls. While I like the growl now I still can't sit back and listen to several hours of it and this type of music gives my brain a chance to catch up.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The game is good it is a nice addition to angry birds. Come on people your rating a game not made by amazon bad b/c of amazon. At least star it correctly and then comment. Developers are paid and get noted based upon ratings.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Good job devs. this game is perfect so far, good soundtrack, classic game play, improved graphics. Love that it's finally ad-free. Appreciate the Amazon Appstore as well, a welcome diversification from the Android Market
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This app is great for students in hard math classes - though it is certainly not limited to mathematical topics.  My one complaint is that it can sometimes be tedious to type in equations with the apps built in keys.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have an Iphone and put it on a speaker docking station to charge and to listen to my music. I also have an otter box on my Iphone. To get my Iphone to connect to my docking station I have to take the otter box off every time. This can be a real pain. With this dockstubz device I just plug it into the bottom of my Iphone, with the otter box on, and then plug into my docking station. It works great. I also have a charger in my truck that I use somtimes but have the same problem of not being able to connect directly into my phone without removing the case first. So I just take out my dockstubz and plug right in. Its a great buy and would recomend it to anyone. This item should come in your box when you buy an Iphone since there are so many times when you might need an extension to plug in.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun game to play. All new level with new friend and enemy to play. Hour of loaded fun. Best angry bird yet. fun cool fun cool.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Won't install on my TB! Great opening day amazon. Can't wait to download an application I need to pay for! Let's see a fix for the high end phones
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome new graphics. Plus no ads! Keep up the good work. Should be in bed but playing this stupid game. The word minimum needs to be shortened.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|first off why have this as a global news event if you cannot deliver it as such. I feel cheated into having to install another third party app on my phone just to get this game but then when attempting to download I am not allowed. idiots, why not make that clear in the first place. I love amazon but rovio have really punched you in the face with this one

B004MC0FO8|5.0|I've just started using this app a few minutes ago & I have to say, it's amazing! I mean you click it open, tab the Shazam icon & watch the magic happens: It listens to the music source, a few secs, it identifies & 'tags' the song for you! You get its name, lyrics (downloadable), YouTube vids, Facebook & Twitter share options (plus more), you can also buy the songs you like on Amazon MP3...Have you ever been in the situation where you're listening to a song on a radio & you like it but just can't search it 'cause you don't know its name ( & even worse sometimes) who's singing?! Well, wonder no more, just Shazam!<br /><br />Update #1: I've got over excited using this FREE version of Shazam but to my grief, I've reached the MONTHLY limit for tagging :-( I've only tagged 5 songs! Know I'm thinking of upgrading to the paid 'Full' version. A quick search: Full Version of Shazam on Android Market is $ 4.83 vs $4.99 on Amazon Appstore for Android. Well, I know it's only a few cents less or more but something to know. Plus, now I want to try another app that offers a very similar service, Soundhound. It also comes in a Free & Paid flavors. Let's dig in more music ;-)<br /><br />Update #2: I've downloaded & successfully installed the free version of Soundhound. While both apps offer very similar functionalities, Soundhound offers UNLIMITED 'Taps.' Well, that's a BIG advantage over Shazam. It also advertised as being able to identify a song as the user sing it. I've tried that but the results were far off. Maybe I'm not the best performer out there or else I would've made it to American Idol! Anyways, the mixed up results in this case are quite expected. One more thing I liked about Soundhound as oppose to Shazam, is 'Similar Artists' feature which helps you explore more music that may very well rhyme with your musical taste. As for the UI, I thought Shazam has a cleaner, more attractive, so to speak, User Interface. But that's a matter of personal preference. For now, I'm gonna stick with Soundhound as my mystery music identifier of choice. But if I'm to buy one of the two, it'll be Shazam.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Whether Shazam or Soundhound, they're both solid, stable apps with neck-to-neck functionality offerings. However, it's a question of whether or not you want to buy the premium version of either. If not, then Soundhound is your best bet since it now offers unlimited tabs vs Shazam which offers a skinny 5 a MONTH!!! Unless 5 a month is what you desire?! However, I liked Shazam UI better, so if I'm to buy one or the other, it'll be Shazam. Your life, your choice ;-)<br /><br />Update (04/28/2011):<br />____________________<br /><br />Only today, Shazam has started rolling out an update which enables UNLIMITED tagging of songs plus some other 'social' features along with the usual bug fixes. Now with this little bit of info out, both Free versions of Shazam & Soundhound offer unlimited tagging/tapping. The choice is still yours :-)<br /><br />Update (08/20/2011):<br />___________________<br /><br />After using both apps for a a few months now, I have to admit they're neck and neck! It is hard to announce a KO winner without involving a certain amount of personal preference. But, SoundHound ' has made it a little easier to show some reasonable bias. SoundHound ' managed to move their App 2 SD. That's 3.1 MB saving in memory spending! When contacting Shazam Encore to perhaps consider a similar move, they replied: \\"There are no plans to allow the transferal of the Shazam application onto an SD card. We have looked into the possibility but it causes problems with the application.\\"  Well, I really hope Shazam's team will one day figure out a way to overcome those \\"problems!\\" Until then I'm sticking with  SoundHound ' .<br /><br />Samsung Epic 4G with Android 2.2 (Froyo)nna stick with Soundhound as my mystery music identifier of choice.

B004SBS8LA|1.0|Seriously make this available world wide please, Amazon are just wasting everyone's time by making them sign up for accounts and payment details then giving nothing back.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|First, I've been shopping on Amazon.com for a long while & with the addition of this app, it only adds up more convenience & ease to my shopping experience. This app provides a reliable on-the-go access to Amazon's vast data base where you can find:  Amazon's pricing, customer's ratings, reviews, and product full description. Your searches are saved & synced with your Amazon Account. Sweet :-)<br />The Mash Up:<br />1) Clean & easy to navigate UI. Thumbs up on that.<br />2)  Versatile search options:  customers can search any given product they may come across by Name, Barcode or Photo. Of course, to get to use photo search you'd have to go to' More' drop menu, scroll down to `Amazon Remembers' &  snap your photo from there. Results, at least for me, have been really impressive. But I won't be surprised if I heard there were some mismatches or off results. My only suggestion in regard to product searchability is to unify all three search options in the Search Box. That would make it more easily accessible. One click & you're in for what you need instead of digging up menus! Make sense, right?! Plus, it won't hurt to add SKU/ UPC search & more types of barcodes lookups.<br />3) Also, I like the fact that you can check your `Wish' Lists. Odd enough, you won't see your `Shopping List' which I honestly don't see any use of this particular distinction?!! I'd suggest implementing Push notifications of price changes for items on your Wish Lists [ which I rather call Watch List] so that you never miss a chance to best spend your hard earned dimes'<br />4)  You also can view & track you orders. This section needs to be improved. My only `beef `to this segment is that it doesn't offer the same info you'd expect to find logging into your account from your computer!<br />5) I definitely would love to see Customers being able to send Price Feed on items in brick & mortar stores.  This will lit up price fights & may the best offer win!<br />6) Now as far as performance, this app is well built. It never crashed on my Epic 4G (before nor after I got my Froyo update). It is stable, never crashed on my phone, loads up fast, & works like a champ!<br />7) I'm sure to recommend this app to a friend. It's helped me make better buying choices. If you're an impulse buyer, you sure want to have this app on your smartphone to help you make `smarter' choices ;-)  I'd love to think that app developers actually read customers reviews & feedback on their app. Fingers crossed 'is well built.

0380715430|5.0|Very good read! I used this book for my college classics class. It provided good info on history of english.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Really smooth, excellent improvements from one version to the next. The best version of angry birds so far. Angry birds angry birds angry birds angry birds.
0756404738|3.0|I agree with other reviewers who have given this book mediocre reviews. It's clear from \\"The Name of the Wind\\" that there is something important in Kvothe's backstory that involves the Chandrian and the death of a king. But we barely get a whiff of these events in this book. It seems like there was just a lot of filler to get us to the third book, where all the critical events will be told.      A lot of the blame for this can be laid on the side-trip that Kvothe (and Rothfuss) take into the land of the Adem. It fills a lot of pages, but does nothing to advance the storyline. Kvothe's motive for going to this place were contrived to begin with. This section is also the silliest part of the story, by far. I really liked \\"The Name of the Wind\\" because in his treament of the details of sympathy and naming, Rothfuss was giving us something that is believable and familiar, but breaks with how a lot of (bad) fantasy treats magic. But the whole asian-martial arts analogue that Rothfuss provides with the Adem is straight-up Dungeons & Dragons nonsense. Very cheesy. The pages that were wasted on describing the meditation and unarmed combat that Kvothe learns were formulaic and dull. Also, isn't it enough that Kvothe is brilliant, cunning, has an amazing memory, the best musician in the world, an amazing lover, and can work magic? Does he have to gain quasi-mystical martial arts skills as well?    I'm writing my first review because I wanted to like this book so much, but was ultimately let down.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|too bad for foreign country users but dont downrank the app because amazon screwed up the download process. the game is great and the update in graphics is awesome! sad that this game is getting a crap review because of amazon. nothing reflects the true quality of the game.

B003WUYOQ6|4.0|I needed (still need, actually) to lose a few pounds and decided to go back to the low-carb lifestyle. It worked for me previously, but I got lazy and eventually gained back the weight I had lost.<br /><br />What I needed to give me a kick in the pants was this book. Before I started on low-carb, I would do a few Google searches and skim articles explaning it. What I really needed, however, was more...more background, more explanation, more scientific proof, etc. Why We Get Fat delivered.<br /><br />I'll admit, this book can be really, really dry at times, the first half, especially. There is a lot of background on the history of food/dieting/government,medical recommendations, and also a great deal of science. The background was interesting, as was the science, but after a while my head was swimming. If this is the cut down version of his original book, I don't think I'd make it through two chapters before giving up.<br /><br />Regardless, once Taubes gets to more of the execution portion of the book, things picked up, made sense, and encouraged me. I look at the first half as the foundation upon which the second half is based.<br /><br />I've been applying what I've learned and have dropped about 20+ lbs in two months. I learned what I needed to learn and more, and it has become the book I recommend to others looking to lose weight via reducing or eliminating carbs. It really is a lifestyle change, but not nearly as difficult to implement as I thought it would be.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|buy this album if you love good music. music with sense, feelings like music was back in the day! bruno mars should be much more popular than he is..anyway buy this album every track is great..i have no favorites..the whole album is my fav!

B004SBS8LA|1.0|so I jump through all the hoops by downloading the app. signing in then having to set up 1 click payment then i get not available in your region (uk)when I go to install the app. thanks for wasting my time.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I liked \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" enough that it's a given that I will shell out the fifty or so dollars for the DVD set when that is released.  HBO and the producers of the series deserve major credit for bringing in the series the \\"anything goes\\" era of Prohibition vividly and indelibly to light.  I also think Steven Buscemi's portrayal of gangster/crooked politician Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson is little short of brilliant.  Nucky is an even more fascinating character than Tony Soprano (and that's saying a lot).  He's a man capable of great kindness, charm, and decency but at the same time, is able to order murders, engage in law-breaking on a massive scale, make a mockery out of \\"good government,\\" and pimp a girl barely into her teens to his former mentor \\"the Commodore\\" (played by Dabney Coleman).<br /><br />The series is not perfect.  For example, Nucky's nemesis, Agent Van Alden, commits a murder in front of dozens of witnesses and somehow no one talks or even whispers about the crime.  Nucky's former girlfriend Lucy Danziger has the potential to become very annoying with her rather sing-song bimbo's voice.  But that's more the compensated for by the compelling characters that dominate the story, most notably Margaret Schroeder, Nucky's apparent soul-mate who loves the good in Nucky and turns a blind eye to the evil in a manner that Carmela Soprano of \\"the Sopranos\\" could easily recognize.<br /><br />Another thing people need to understand about \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is that it easily crosses  into R and even sometimes NC-17 territory.  We see someone cut someone else's throat and see the victim choking to death on his own blood.  There is a sex scene late in the season that is probably the most explicit thing I've ever seen on HBO.  So I wouldn't let any young kids watch it...but then, the show's not really for them.<br /><br />So if you want to learn a bit about a bygone era in which an effort to legislate morality gave birth to the mob with a vengeance, rent, buy, or watch on HBO \\"Boardwalk Empire.\\"  I won't guarantee that you'll love it as I did, but I think there's a very high probability you will.re.\\"  I won't guarantee that you'll love it as I did, but I think there's a very high probability you will.

B004AKCMD4|1.0|This movie has racial undertones. The owls are being subjugated by a \\"superior\\" group of owls that capture them and make them pellet pushers. (owl pellets being moved around and collected)The superior owls are all bowing down to a large female owl who is delighted by the other owls vying for her attention after they compete in flying abilities. The chosen owls are trying to fight the owls who are new and not quite conforming to their new subjugation.<br /><br />The subjugated owls are put into a trance before going down into the lower area to collect and organize owl pellets. The three new owls try to escape being put into the trance. Two of the three new owls manage to not be put into a trance, they realize the third owl is under the trance and they essentially write him off as one of them at that point. The two new owls try to infiltrate the large female owl's status as a ruler and therefore dictator that is subjugating the other owls.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending for you. The 3d effects are stunning, similar to Despicable Me or Coraline, however the lighting on this film is always darker than that of the other 3d movies mentioned. I thought this would be a nice movie to show off the new 3d television, however, I would have liked to have been warned that it is a downer, depressing, dark, not much like any kids movie I have ever endeavored to watch. I love kids movies, I just got Bolt 3d (Disney)and I even loved Cats and Dogs the Revenge of Kitty Galore, but a dark owl movie about owls being subjugated by other owls into a second class slave race of owl pellet pushers is not my idea of a good time kids movie.<br />This movie would be a great metaphor for explaining the Holocaust to kids that were not quite ready for the real details of the real thing.
B004GYY714|5.0|There is just so much under the hood with this app that it's hard to do it justice in a brief review like this.  It is very easy to use.  Search by location or by genre.  Find specific shows and how much time is remaining.  Set up bookmarks of your favorite stations. I could go on and on.  My only minor complaint is that the app for the Apple allows you to record content for later playback - I didn't see that as an option with the android app, but it is by no means a deal killer.  I'm one of those nerds that likes to listen to distant AM radio stations at night - with this app, you can do the same thing without the static.  For that matter, you can listen to stations on the other side of the world.  Connect your device to a decent pair of speakers, and you will be surprised at how clear the fidelity is.  Just get it, you won't be sorry!!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I'm really impress with the detail in the graphics,  also the way they refreshed the franchise with other character is so well done.  5 stars keep up the good work Rovio.

B004HF0PEU|5.0|Despite a highly successful international career that spanned nearly eight decades and included thousands of concert appearances and an extensive catalogue of recordings, Claudio Arrau (1903-1991) never seemed to achieve the kind of popularity with the American public that Artur Rubinstein (1887-1982) or Vladimir Horowitz (1903-1989) did. Rubinstein, a generation older than Arrau, was the consummate extrovert and easy for audiences to love, whereas Horowitz, Arrau's exact contemporary, was a brilliant recluse with a near-Lisztian aura that made him compellingly attractive. Arrau, a legendary virtuoso in his younger years who was trained by Martin Krause, the last student of Liszt, achieved fame in Europe playing complete cycles of Beethoven, Bach and Mozart, but didn't become established in the States until 1941, long after Rubinstein and Horowitz had settled here. His repertoire was enormous, however, his attraction to the German classics, a trait shared with Schnabel and even more so with his other contemporary, Rudolf Serkin (1903-1991), stamped him to some extent as an &#34;intellectual&#34; pianist, the very antithesis of the daredevil Horowitz and charming Rubinstein. Arrau, who by no means restricted himself to Germanic repertoire, especially early on when he played Albeniz, Ravel, and Granados along with Beethoven, Brahms and Schumann, nevertheless epitomized the &#34;serious&#34; artist who sought to share his vision with an audience, but not to entertain them per se - a fact underlined when, later in his career, he dropped Ravel and the others from his programs and even stopped playing encores. He claimed later in life to have overcome the need to please his audience, a major step in artistic maturity wherein he could execute his musical vision uncompromised by the demands of ego. His recitals were for connoisseurs who appreciated the vast resources, both musical and technical, that he brought to the stage; and for those who were tuned in, they could be intensely involving artistic experiences.<br /><br />Arrau recorded prolifically, beginning in 1927 with works uncharacteristic of his older years - Busoni's Carmen Fantasy, Dance Russe from Stravinsky's Petrushka, Balakirev's Islamey - but also Liszt, Debussy and Chopin. He began recording Bach, Beethoven and Mozart for RCA after a famous Carnegie Hall concert in 1941 that launched his career in the States. After the War came a small treasure trove of recordings for Columbia, including gorgeous Debussy Images, Estampes, and Pour le Piano; the first two books of Albeniz's Iberia; Chopin's Preludes, Schumann's Kreisleriana, and a riveting Waldstein sonata among a few other odds and ends. A landmark recording of the Liszt e-flat major concerto from 1952 was reissued by Sony along with several Hungarian Rhapsodies ([[ASIN:B0000029P6 Piano Concerto 1 / Hungarian Fantasy]]), and while that label has not re-released the aforementioned solo Columbia recordings, they're available on a four-cd  set from United Archives, &#34;Birth of a Legend&#34; (not available through amazon). Arrau left Columbia in 1952 and recorded briefly for Decca (a bristling Eroica Variations from this period is available on [[ASIN:B000G73UFE Steinway Legends: Claudio Arrau]]) before joining EMI in 1955, a relationship that was to last until 1962, and that yielded the material on this aptly named 12 disc set.<br /><br />When Arrau joined EMI he was in his early fifties and at the top of his form, with the virtuoso aspect of his artistic personality well integrated with the insightful poet-philosopher. The balance between spontaneity and thoughtfulness here is nearly ideal, and the tendency to linger and probe excessively that was to become noticeable in some of the pianist's later recordings for Philips is held in check. The Beethoven concertos are representative in this respect: the first three with Galliera have a Mozartian sparkle and rhythmic drive to them that's missing from the over-polished Philips remakes with Haitink. While the third concerto with Haitink has an appealing sumptuousness about it, the edge is worn off compared to the flintier EMI reading; and the Emperor falls into the same category, if not even more so. Only the fourth with Haitink supercedes the EMI reading, mostly because the Philips sound is superior (the EMI fourth was the first of the concertos to be recorded in 1955 and the only one done in mono). There's a generous assortment of solo Beethoven included in this set, virtually all of which is outstanding - but not all of it is necessarily superior to Arrau's 1960's recordings for Philips, one of the greatest Beethoven sonata cycles ever recorded ([[ASIN:B007CW2FCA Beethoven Complete Piano Sonatas, Collector's Edition]]). The sonatas Arrau recorded for EMI are among those that he seemed to favor; for example, he first recorded op. 10, no. 3 for German Radio in 1938, and the Waldstein and Les Adieux sonatas for Columbia in 1947 and 1949. In each of these cases, there's an aggressiveness to the EMI recordings that give them a slight edge over the Philips' remakes. Both readings of the Les Adieux, for example, begin in slow motion, but the EMI version is a bit brisker than the later Philips recording, which is nevertheless a beautiful account. Both op. 54 and op. 78 have incredible drive, but so do the Philips remakes. Over the years the EMI Appassionata has been singled out by critics for praise, and while it's a distinguished reading, I think the Philips remake, which has tremendous heft, is a more fully realized performance. The late sonatas are less rhetorical and have more snap than the Philips remakes, especially op. 101, although their footprints are essentially the same. Arrau's recording of the C minor variations on Philips is a beautifully balanced account, but the EMI reading, while organized along the same lines, has a remarkable energy about it that the pianist didn't always exhibit in the studio.<br /><br />Although Arrau often played Chopin in concert and recorded some of the etudes and other pieces as early as 1928, his name was never linked with Chopin in the way it was with Beethoven, Brahms or Liszt. He embarked on an ambitious plan to record the major works of Chopin when he signed with Decca, but somehow his way with Chopin never seemed to click the way, for example, Rubinstein's did and the project was never finished. Fortunately, among the first things Arrau recorded when he joined EMI were the etudes which for many years were reference recordings of these challenging works. (Rubinstein only recorded a few of them and rarely played any in recital because he admitted that some were simply too difficult to do justice to.) Those who are familiar with Arrau's interpretations won't be surprised to find that his approach was to underline the musical elements rather than rattling them off as technical exercises. Nevertheless, there's plenty of excitement, muscle and drama here, plus poetry without sentimentalism. Underneath everything is a sort of extravagance that I find very appealing, reflecting Arrau's connection to the great players of the 19th century. The op. 25 etudes are tremendously powerful, especially the tenth which is a statement of epic proportions. I've never heard it played with such a buildup of tension, something Arrau was a master at. The three Nouvellles Etudes are beautifully played and the Allegro de concert is a dashing display of glitter that summons up the image of Chopin at the piano in one of his salon recitals. Just wonderful stuff.<br /><br />The Chopin B minor piano sonata was recorded over four sessions between March and June of 1960, a seemingly long time for such an undertaking, which is perhaps why it doesn't come together in a completely satisfying way. It may well be that Arrau was still recovering from the death of his mother in 1959, an event that he described as &#34;the greatest shock in my life.&#34; The first and fourth movements are impressively granitic in scope, and while the second movement has plenty of zip, the long introduction to the third is very slow, perhaps reflecting his recent loss. Interestingly, Arrau never recorded the second piano sonata. There's an outstanding performance of the op. 49 Fantasy, almost matching the pianist's incredible remake for Philips which I think is one of the great Chopin recordings of all time. There's a good slug of Schubert here too, including a fine set of the Moments Musicaux, the three Klavierstucke (D946) and an athletic Wanderer Fantasy.<br /><br />The other (i.e. non-Beethoven) concerto recordings included here are, to be truthful, a mixed bag; but this is consistent with Arrau's concerto recordings in general, including his Philips remakes of all of these pieces. The earliest are the Grieg and Schumann, both of which are somewhat disappointing. The Grieg is burdened with excessive point-making whereas the Schumann, which flows more naturally, still falls short of Arrau's best (see, for example,[[ASIN:B000FI9OQI Schumann: Piano Concerto Op. 54; Brahms: Violin Concerto Op. 77]] or the outstanding EMI dvd [[ASIN:B000092T5J Schumann: Piano Concerto in A minor, Carnaval Op. 9 & Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 32 in C minor / Arrau]]). I've never been fond of Arrau's ultra-rhapsodic treatment of the Brahms D minor concerto which I think lacks youthful passion and tension. Conversely, the pianist was made for the B flat major, although neither this reading with Giulini nor the later remake with Haitink demonstrate what Arrau could really do with this concerto. For this one must turn to his live recording with Alexander Gibson ([[ASIN:B0000B1A5C Brahms: Piano Concerto No. 2; Schubert: Three Piano Pieces, D946]]) which is an absolute knockout. The Weber Konzertstuck, a glittery showpiece and a favorite of Arrau's for quite some time, is a shade cooler than the blistering recording he made for RCA in 1946. The Tchaikovsky concerto was panned by Gramophone when it was first released in 1961, an opinion that I can't say that I totally disagree with. While Arrau's expansive conception is completely unlike the stereotypical readings of thunder and lightning that have been cranked out over the years, it's too often at odds with the spirit of the music and ultimately is just too rhetorical.<br /><br />Those who are new to Arrau, or only have a passing acquaintance with his work, will find this EMI set to be a fine introduction to his distinctive art. Arrau collectors, on the other hand, will be elated. While the Chopin etudes and Sonata et al have been available in EMI's Great Recordings of the Century series, the Brahms concertos have been in the catalogue in one form or another all along and the Schumann and Grieg concertos were reissued on Testament a number of years ago, the Beethoven sonatas and concertos, which represent about half of these discs, have been out of circulation for twenty years or more. Having all of this material in one reasonably priced box was long overdue. This &#34;Icon&#34; set also includes Arrau's famous 1939 Parlophone recording of Carnaval which has been available in a number of incarnations over the years. The overall sound picture is never less than good, especially considering the dates of these sessions. Many of the mono recordings were remastered a number of years ago (e.g., the Beethoven in 1991 for an Arrau set that was never released in the U.S.), and I assume EMI felt that the results couldn't be improved upon - or they didn't want to invest the money necessary to do another update. The rambling, overblown liner notes by Andre Tubeuf are among the worst I've seen for a retrospective such as this, exceeded only by the nonsensical notes accompanying the Arrau &#34;Birth of a Legend&#34; set, also written by Tubeuf. One extract will do: &#34;And at this central moment in his destiny, when there was a fullness to his sound, an energy to his vision and his taste and a need to prove himself were intact, he still felt, having inherited a century of German music, that he had a century ahead of him to bring it to life!&#34;<br /><br />In summary, while there may be a number of duplications for collectors who already own the Arrau EMI recordings that have been available here over the years, the Beethoven and Schubert recordings, which have long been out of circulation, by themselves make this set an essential acquisition.second movement has plenty of zip, the long introduction to the third is very slow, perhaps reflecting his recent loss.

0981951244|5.0|I'm only on my 3rd disk since I received the audio version yesterday.  I am a fan of the Slight Edge by Jeff Olson, because I've seen the concept proven true in my life and in those around me over and over.  SO Far, I think this is a great expansion on the Slight Edge concept, at first seemingly the same information, but I think this book is adding some new insights and angles, and solidly reinforcing the reap what you sow and concept/principals of time, habit = results caused.  Very logical which appeals to me personally.  I get really turned off at some of the 'self-help' books that are too 'magical' for my style, this one delivers simple solid information.  I appreciate how he breaks down the mechanics of how and why it works, instead of being pie in the sky and preachy.          Great chapter: Ripple Effect    I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes direct and logical.
0670022411|2.0|The only reason I didn't give this one star is (embarrassed to say) I actually finished the book.  The idea is clever but the writing is terrible, the character development nil and hardly anything happens.  I had to wince at some of the phrasing it was so superficial.  My thought as I read was, \\"she wrote this to fund her retirement\\".  We all should (and at this level could) do the same.  Stick with \\"The Passage\\" if you want to read a good novel about vampires.  Even the Twilight series is literature compared to this.

0345477618|5.0|This \\"Making Of\\" book is physically massive.  And it has the information to back it up.  Written with access to the Lucasfilm archives, including interviews conducted during the time when Star Wars was being filmed, this book gives a blow-by-blow account of all aspects of the filming.  Liberally sprinkled throughout are photos, diagrams, and photoreproductions of the original memos and scripts - so many that there are several on each and every page of the book.  The description of 324 pages belies the fact that they are big pages (this is a coffee table-sized book), and the font is quite small (i.e. lots of information is crammed into these pages).  Clearly this is a definitive work based on the contemporary information, and is worthy of notice for that fact alone.    However, that is not enough to earn it 5 stars.  No, this book belongs in every Star Wars fan's library because it's great fun to read and endlessly interesting.  Every Star Wars fan has seen many of these pictures and heard many of these stories - Lucas resisted casting Harrison Ford, how Ralph McQuarrie's pictures influenced the costume and ship designs, Lucas's unhappiness with the cantina scene, etc.  Certainly these facts are well-known, at least by those (like me), who bought every Star Wars-related magazine when it came out in 1977, who watched the \\"Making Of\\" show on TV, and who even has a pirated VHS copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special.  But I defy any Star Wars fan to claim they knew all the information that appears in this book.  Many new things that I had no idea about are presented, like the fact that Brian DePalma (yes, THAT Brian DePalma) heavily influenced/wrote the final wording for the opening credits crawl.  I also was not aware of the amount of work Lucas put into developing Apocalypse Now before Coppola took it over, the degree to which Alan Ladd kept the Fox board of directors at bay when the costs started to increase, and how many external (to ILM) effects houses were used to create the various special effects.    One of the fun aspects of the reading of the book is that it's all written from the point of view of the principles as they lived through the film's making.  No one in the book is aware of how successful the film would eventually be (Spielberg comes closest when he says, following an otherwise disasterous screening for Lucas's director friends, that he thought the film would \\"make a hundred million dollars\\").  The author also resists the temptation to wink at the reader.  For example, no special acknowledgement is made about the McQuarrie painting for the Alderaan Prison (the original location for the prison-break scene later moved into the Death Star) - even though it was clearly imported wholesale into the Empire Strikes Back as Cloud City.    The sheer volume of pictures and original artwork is staggering, and welcome for any cinephile.  It uses a lot of personal photos from the collections of the crewmembers working on the film, in addition to the \\"official\\" pictures from Lucasfilm and Fox.  Just flipping through the book to any random page will give the reader a few minutes of fun examining the photo and reading the captions, without even reading the main text.  Thus, this is a great book for any Star Wars fan, and the price is very reasonable for this very high quality and highly entertaining book.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This app is tons of fun and very very useful. I tested it on numerous different sound and music outlets including my cable TV music stations, several different genres of radio stations, soundtracks straight off of movies, etc... and it has been 100% accurate so far. The best part of the app is the option to immediately purchase a particular track of music straight from Amazon MP3 to your phone usually for only 99 cents. You can purchase the entire album if you wish. It has many other options such as watching an instant video of the song, going to the artists Facebook site and lots more. It is impressive how accurate (and fun) this app is.    A.A.

B004SDSSFY|3.0|(Updated from 1 star to 3 stars). After finally getting a response from these people they refunded my money. They even contacted me on several different occasions to make sure I was reimbursed.      I purchased the full version of this yesterday and spent the entire day and 5 hours of today trying to make it work on my Evo. A lot of frustration and no success.     I can't get a refund because I purchased it on Android Market and did not uninstall within the allotted 15 minute time frame. The developers website will not allow you to call, post on the forum or any other type of support requests. Basically they have ZERO support options. Very unfair to those of us who spent the $14.99 for the app. They are laughing all the way to the bank with users money. I guess Research In Motion purchased this portion of DataViz.    This is why I am EXTREMELY happy to find out that Amazon now has an app store for mobile. Amazon rocks. Everything I buy online I buy through Amazon. I deleted Android Market from my phone. Too bad Google, you will lose business now.    A.A.
0765322889|3.0|This is probably the most polarizing fantasy novel I've ever read.     ON THE ONE HAND . . .    Unlike most epic fantasy novels that take you by the hand and explain everything in lowest terms, Steven Erikson drops you in the middle of a huge war and gambles on the hope that the reader will be sharp enough to catch on.   The obvious advantage to this is that the book immediately feels like it is going SOMEWHERE instead of characters hanging around a town for 200 pages.   Indeed, with this book one always gets the sense that SOMETHING big is happening.    As for characters, there is a huge, long list of them, but to Erickson's credit, he writes enough into them to make them quickly recognizable. And although any one character never really rises above the rest, there are some that are slightly more likable, such as the eccentric Kruppe and the powerful Anomander Rake--who has my vote for one of the coolest names in fantasy.     Adding to the unconventional feel of this epic are the many different races that populate his world and the unique way in which magic is employed by the use of Warrens.    ON THE OTHER HAND . . .    While the \\"let's start in the middle\\" mentality may please some fantasy readers, some may find it a bit of struggle. Especially when the cast of \\"Dramatis Personae\\" number in the dozens, where a generous third or half of them play vital roles.     Reading this book, I always got the impression that Erikson wasn't just one step ahead of me, but two or three.  In regards to the plot, observant as I tried to be, I never could quite figure out what the main plot was or  what the MOTIVE was for the Malazan attack on Genabackis. Something to do with an Empress and a [dead] Emperor, but that's about as far as I understood it.  The further I read, the further I came to the following conclusions:  1)There's not so much of a main plot, but a handful of SUBPLOTS that converge towards the end.  2)Likewise, there is no main character, but a handful of charactersthat are of equal importance.    WILL I BE READING THE NEXT BOOK?    That's a toughie! On the one hand, I like the scope and depth of his work, and I see that pretty much all of his books have 4/5 stars. I'm also intrigued by the rave reviews for the second book in the series.  But on the other hand, this book here was 4/5 stars and although I finished it, I didn't find it truly amazing or something I would want to re-read (although I'm sure one would pick up on a lot of things the second time around).   I've also noticed that while some 300 or so people have read this first volume, only a handful have reviewed the tenth book in the series.    So for me it basically boils down to this: Somewhere between books 1 and 10 there is a huge fallout in readership. I can deal with the hordes of characters (and their frequent deaths) but I'm not sure I want to invest so much time reading a series where I will probably find myself hopelessly lost in the complexity of a world where the author is leaps and bounds ahead of the reader.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Angry users ! This will be your next app, if you do not make this app available worldwide on the Android Market.

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|What a fantastic title for this album.  I can't say that I actually \\"got\\" it until after listening through the album and realizing that this actually IS an album - an artistic statement that is tied together beautifully.  We go on a journey of discovery through life and end at \\"Blue\\" with a brilliant spoken word poem by Stipe backed by Mills and Buck in full-on R.E.M. fashion.  The past does have meaning, but you can't dwell on it.  The future is unknown.  Take all those experiences, take those hopes and dreams and collapse into now - put it all into this moment.      \\"This is my time and I am thrilled to be alive.  Living.  Blessed.  I understand.  20th Century, collapse into now.\\"    The reprise of Discoverer brings it all into focus and also proves that R.E.M. lived up to the title of the album.  They took their past, all their experiences, all their hopes, and they put them here.  If you want an album that represents R.E.M. from pretty much every phase of their long and incredible career then this is it.  And it just comes off as effortless.    It seems to me that Stipe, Mills, and Buck all tried for a decade to not be R.E.M., thinking that they couldn't be what they were with Bill Berry.  They captured some of their former glory on Accelerate, but here they brought in the experiences of Green, Out of Time, Automatic, Monster, and New Adventures.  This is R.E.M. waking up and discovering that they are still R.E.M. and that they don't have to run from their past.    And the end result is a really joyous album.  Not everything here is uplifting just as life is not always, but those darker edges can make us better.  There's reflection throughout and it makes for a mature and compelling work.    Accelerate was a great album, a fantastic followup to the mediocre and overproduced Around The Sun (though that album does have some good cuts on it).  R.E.M. has put together two consistent albums after a decade of hit or miss.  Up and Reveal were mostly good, but could have used some trimming.  Around The Sun could have used a lot of trimming.      Is this album up there with Automatic, Out of Time, Document, etc?  At this point it couldn't be.  The problem with any established band is that the memories weigh heavy with each new release.  It's been 20 years since Out Of Time and I know that I have a lot of memories attached to that album.  R.E.M.'s Out of Time, Automatic for the People, Monster, and New Adventures in Hi-Fi were all released during my teenage years - I grew up with them and so much of the feelings of those times are attached to them.  It's hard to live up to that and unfair to expect a new album to do so.  There will be new memories here, but you have to allow them to grow and not become too enamored with the past because it will prevent you from enjoying the present.      And that is ultimately the lesson of this album.  I will not allow R.E.M.'s past to prevent me from enjoying this present just as I will not allow my own past to prevent me from living and loving the present.  Collapse Into Now.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I love this CD.  I will admit I am not totally into the ballads, but the rocking dance tunes are great.  I LOVE the first, second, and third track, not to mention the Only Girl tune and the Raining Men track...awesome!  If you love Rihanna, you should buy this.  It is what I listen to before I go to a big sales call.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Not sure why all the anger about this product.  Received it in the mail and within 2 minutes was importing photos into my iPad.  Tried this as a memory card reader using three different size and brands of memory card: all worked.  Tried this as a usb connector for three cameras: two point and shoot (one canon, one samsung and one DSLR (Nikon).  All worked.  Obviously, you can't use the memory card adapter if your camera uses a different memory card.  Obviously, the iPad does not have the power  that a laptop or desktop has.  Expecting it to be able to support powerful usb attachments?  Think the usb connector will support all of your usb devices?  You're probably out of luck.  But for the generic consumer looking for a fast way to import most of their pics, this will do the trick.  It's pricey but works.  My iPad is using the just released days ago update so I am not using the old operating system that some seem to prefer for importing pics.<br /><br />Update: After months and months of use, this product continues to perform.  Have used it on iPad 1 and iPad 2 and with all iOS updates since purchase.  It is well worth its price just so that I can leave my laptop @ home and still have a way to view photos.  All the negative reviews because it won't work with the iPhone (yes, it does say this is an iPad adapter) and because this $25 dollar device doesn't turn an iPad into a laptop should be ignored.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I keep getting an error message on my HTC incredible saying &quot;not installed&quot;. it won't even give me a reason why. first time using amazon app store, not happy.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|It's strange that Amazon appear to be discounting the price here for a limited time when it's free in the Android Market.
B000XR4OC0|2.0|After my daughter begged for them for weeks, I got on the bandwagon and got her a pair of black wovens. She was thrilled and they were very cute.  However, after just a couple of weeks the uppers developed some holes near the toe that became tears and now they actually look shredded on that shoe. She did not wear them every day, maybe 2-3 times per week. I am going to write to the company to see if they will do anything.<br /><br />I would not recommend these shoes for normal daily wear. Noble cause, but bad product.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i had to download the apk files and install them all with the sdk and adp tools but i did get it working . it is a grear app and looks amazing on the galaxy tab and my wifes atrix phone
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Pros:  -Great time killer  -Lots and lots of levels  -Pretty stable    Cons:  -Can be very frustrating  -Repetitive levels  -Lots of random chance    Angry birds is one of the best games on Android.  It's a classic throwing game.  You pull back on a slingshot with an angry bird on it, release it, and try to kill all the pigs by breaking a castle-like structure.  It's that simple.  There are a variety of different birds; red (normal), yellow (speeds up), black (bomb), etc.  It's a wonderful way to kill a half hour (or more).  Killing all the pigs never seems to get old.    The big knock I have on this game is the lack of finesse.  The slingshot has basically one power - max.  It can make lobbing a bird up in the air (over a wall or the like) really tough.  That may be a function of my screen being small, but it is pretty annoying. Some levels are really, really frustrating as well.  One level was bad enough I stopped playing the game for a long time.  With levels like that, you basically need to get lucky and hit things exactly the right way.  Some of the birds are pretty frustrating as well.  The toucan (a boomerang) is a waste.  The white bird that drops egg bombs is even worse.    Overall, the game is a great buy for $.99.  Out of all the games I have on my phone, this one gets the most playtime by far.  I've had this game for a long time and still haven't finished all of the levels.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|So amazon gets an exclusive. Fine. But what happens if you live outside of the US? Tough! No way to play the game unless you find an 'alternative' source
B004SBULWE|2.0|Pros:  Makes it easier to shut down apps and clear out memory    Cons:  It isn't really necessary to close apps anymore  Can close apps through the menu  Doesn't work with all apps    When Android first came out applications never really shut down.  Without a program like this, you would end up with 100 applications running and your phone's battery would empty out in an hour.  With OS updates, most apps now close by themselves.  Android also lets you close applications through the menu.  Advanced task killer isn't really useful anymore.  I used to use this app all the time to clean out my memory, but it hasn't been necessary to do this at all with Android 2.2.    If your phone hasn't been updated, this would be a useful app, but otherwise, it's just a waste of space.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Couldn't wait to receive it.  Arrived in perfect condition.  It is a part of history that has always interested me.  I'll be viewing it again and again!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Pros:  Pretty fun in brief stretches    Cons:  You slice fruit.  Pretty much it.    This game revolves around cutting fruit in half with your sword (finger).  Watermelons, bananas, oranges, etc. are thrown from the bottom of the screen and need to be cut before they fall off screen.  Fruit ninja has three game modes, but they're all pretty similar.  There's the normal mode where you have three lives (cutting a bomb or missing a fruit removes one), arcade mode (no lives,timed - just try to get the highest score, lots of powerups, bombs that lower your score), and zen mode (arcade mode without bombs and powerups). There are also some unlockables, but as far as I'm aware, they're limited to new \\"swords\\" (different colors) and backgrounds.    I find fruit ninja pretty boring.  I play every once in a while and it just doesn't hold my attention.  There are better games out there.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Looks great on the gtab with Gojimi Gingerbread. I think this is probably the best looking game so far, guess its true, amazon is focusing on tablets and i love it.
1439102724|1.0|In brief, this story has been done before many times...a wonderful gay couple trying to save her eggs from a nasty evangelical ex husband and his cohorts.  the ending was clear all along...I feel like I deserve my money back or a reward for finishing this book.  I expected much better writing, plotting and characterization.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is by far the best angry birds yet. the graphics are improved and the tie in to the movie isnt overdone. the only thing  miss (and that much honestly)  is tue inclusion of the green pigs
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game! Freeing the other birds is a nice touch - looks and plays great on galaxy tab... No problems with app store -nice job amazon!<br /><br />Get gameloft in here!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|free app, no ads, improved graphics. what's not to like about this new version of angry birds? get before the free period runs out. love it!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|yea im giving 1 star for that.  its  free app. that os a poor system and cheap way to make someone sign up for amazon.
B001TKD4ZI|2.0|I purchased this book when it was free because I have enjoyed other vampire series.  I wanted to like the book, but I found it far too predictable to enjoy.  The romantic misunderstandings were not only predictable but far too numerous.  The book didn't have a proper ending but rather a rushed attempt to conclude the story and put everyone away neatly.<br /><br />Things that really bothered me:<br />- Roman's continued use of the phrase \\"God's blood\\" was so ridiculous it stopped me in my tracks every single time.  I kept trying to replace it in my head with a more modern phrase but couldn't.<br />- The vampire mind sex.<br />- Not a single character had a normal name or background.<br /><br />Things I actually liked:<br />- Unlike some who have posted reviews, I actually enjoyed the Irish accents that were written into the book.<br /><br />I felt like the main characters had potential, but sadly their potential was not explored to the fullest extent.  Perhaps if the book spanned more than three days (and those days were less eventful than two separate bombings and a vampire war...) it would have been much more believable that the two characters fell in love and got engaged.  I won't be recommending this one to my friends.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Makes it super easy for me to read the Bible anywhere I've got my phone. I saved a few translations to the phone so I don't need a network connection to read either. Highly recommended.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Very disapointed, I installed the App Store app, signed in and when I clicked to download the game it says it's not available in my region. Now I'm sure I don't need another app store!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Absolutely stunning look and feel. It's polished and yet it's still angry birds! Good job Rovio! I do feel bad for the Angry Bird fans that have a locked down phone that won't allow the Amazon App Store to install. - G2
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a new version of the already very popular game and amazon is giving it away for free. Thank you, fellas!<br />I am very glad there finally is an alternative to the android market.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|What a pain.......I didn't think anything could keep me from Angry Birds but I do NOT like Amazon ap store at all. (love Amazon but ap store sucks). I DON'T want one click purchasing yet it makes me.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Comon this is pathetic, setting up a new store with the resources of Amazon and you make it US-only? Fix it, or this store will be DOA.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movie is definitely one to add to your collection. It is watchable over and over and endlessly entertaining!! Great cast!!! I hope they do a sequel! brillant!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|The optimus v is an entry level android phone.  While this app still can be sluggish for big levels, the ads caused it to slow down to a halt making it unplayable.  Now that the ads are gone it runs much better!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|c'mon, amazon. you just could've saved my time by not sending an email regarding awareness of your long-waited appstore. Now that you have the finnish game Angry Birds available for free, it's not possible to download it in Finland! Thanks for giving us hope, and taking it immediately away.. :(
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It looks like hundreds of people are giving THIS GAME a bad rating because of the Amazon Appstore itself and haven't even played the game. Ignore them, the game is awesome. It's a great refresh for Angry Birds with fantastic new graphics and fun game play. Get it while it's still free!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|There are a lot of bad reviews for a game that is so great. More of the angry birds goodness that people know and love.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I love this unit. It plays beautifully, can use USB or flash drives, and will broadcast on any FM channel. My only complaint is that the Shuffle mode seems to always play the same songs. They may be in a different order, but it picks the same songs over and over again. Other than that, its almost perfect.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The movies/ mini series is great.  The fact that my grandfather served in WWII as a Marine mortor man, really help me understand how tough they had it.  I reviewed actual history to how this was produced and it gave me realistic view of what the Marines survived.  I would recomend this to anyone older than 16.    The packaging that it came from Amazon was in a jiffy bag and the tin can was bent, with the plastic case cracked.  The DVD's made it safely but not the case.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This isn't just the best smartphone Bible app, it's one of the best apps on the market.  It is well designed, well supported, and the Youversion team are constantly adding features.  There are by far too many unique features to list here, but I have found that the recent addition of the widget that shows my reading plan progress has really helped to keep me on track.  The diversity of reading plans makes the Bible approachable for everyone.      The fact that the app now includes audio for many versions is a really cool recent addition as well.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|since im 1 of the 1st to get it i gotta say its epic and it gonna do big things worth the long wait thank u rovio
B000UFAURI|4.0|There's little to say that hasn't already been said, but here goes nothing anyway:    I like the Foo Fighters.  I like their early stuff. I like their later stuff. And while this is not the band's best record, it does show how a silly, playful band from the 90s can grow up, mature, and still remain silly and playful.    The Pretender was a solid lead single, but my favorite songs on this record are the ones that don't sound like traditional Foo.  I like Statues, Home and Stranger Things Have Happened.  This record seems like the logical next step from In Your Honor, a record split right down the middle with rock tunes and acoustic rock tunes.      If I was in the mood for Foo, I'd probably go for One By One or The Colour And The Shape first, but still, there's something different and worth listening to on Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace.
B00000DWHH|1.0|Beware!!! This is not the Canadian pressing that used the tapes mastered by sound engineer Steve Hoffman. They have the wrong picture posted (the sticker on the CD is in English and French leading you to believe it is the Canadian version) and some of the other reviewers also lead you to believe you are getting the import that has supposedly better sound even than the remastered Deluxe Edition. I ordered it and got the US version. While I got a full refund, it's still a hassle thinking you're getting one thing, then you actually receive another. Then I e-mailed two other sellers listing on this page and they both have the US edition for sale.<br />Still this is a great CD. Not only just one of the Who's best but one of the all time best albums ever in rock n roll. I'd rank it in the Top Ten of albums released in the 1970s. My gripe is not with the music but with Amazon and how they list some items that have multiple versions. All apologies to Forrest Gump and his mother, but sometimes it isn't always nice to not know what you're getting.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another great Angry Birds Game! I was surprised at how well it is running because the Original Angry Birds lagged a little. And I got this for free with No Ads as well!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Will download, but not install. Tells me that I do not have enough memory and to delete something from my phone. Amazon says it requires 12.5MB and I have significantly more than that on my phone and my SD card. Oh well.
B003TZ9EGO|1.0|The Remix is poorly made and after listening to it I think I will toss it in the trash.  I am actually a Gaga fan.  It's just really BAD!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|cant install on stock droid 2.  way to fail, guys.  downloads fine, but almost immediately pops up saying not installed.  glad i caught it on free day instead of paying for it.  why the hell do we even need amazon app store?  whats wrong with the android one?
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Works perfect on rooted epic 4g.  Great graphics and no glitches! Back grounds and color contrast adds visually pleasing play. Don't know why so many other people are having trouble down loading.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is slick and much improved over the original Angry Birds. It did a force close on my Droid X the first time I ran it, but I left the phone several minutes and tried again and now it's working fine. Unsure of what happened that first time.
B0010HA68I|4.0|I bought the straps hoping to carry my heavy camera and lens by attaching the straps to the backpack, thus taking the weight off my neck.  Since I always carry my backpack when I'm out taking pictures, this solution would be ideal.<br /><br />There are two major problems with what I want to do.<br /><br />Number 1 is that the D-rings part that snaps on to the backpack strap does not look to be all that sturdy and it didn't take much force to unlatch it if you apply force at the right place.  I don't want my expensive camera and lens to fall down and get destroyed on the account of a $10 gadget.  Granted that both has to fail before your camera falls down but from what I can tell, it is certainly possible if you accidentally bump into someone or something.  I simply do not trust its strength.  I thought about permanently superglue the snaps but I still think the rings are too flimsy they might break.<br /><br />Number 2 is that the straps are simply too short.  If you just want to transport it without taking pictures, that will be fine but if you want to raise the camera up to your eyes to take pictures while attached, the straps are too short for me to do it and I'm only 5'3''.<br /><br />I must admit that carrying the camera this way is the right way. I didn't feel the camera weight at all.  If only I can assure myself of my camera safety and that I can raise it up to shoot...<br /><br />UPDATE 10/2/12<br />I've got a couple of comments on this review. They brought up great counter-arguments. I must say, the straps haven't accidentally come off or become broken yet. I'm changing my rating from 3 to 4.<br /><br />By the way, I've found a better carry solution for my camera. I'm using a Peak Design Capture system.  It works really well. I'm using one of this strap as a safety backup.  Look for my review on the Peak Design Capture on amazon.com.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|didn't think game could get better but it does. awesome. very responsive an a little more challenging. must have recommend to all great graphics an plays very well.

B000MG1ZG0|5.0|Dry spell? Cocktail music? whatever!  I enjoy all of their music, even when Jim is riprourin drunk! lol  Paul Rothchild IMHO sucked the joy & life out of the music for Jim with his millions of retakes.  (Funny thing on this CD every-time Rothchild calls for a do-over Jims says \\"Money beats soul every-time!\\")  Perfectionist are control freaks as we all know, & one thing Jim did not like was being controlled.  This I think is proven by how long it took Rothchild to produce & how fast the next album was recorded after he walked out.

0670022411|5.0|I'm in love with the characters in the book.  I am a true fan of anything written about vampires.  I read \\"An Interview with a Vampire\\" way before it became a movie.  I was in my first or second year in college.  I'm a big fan of Anne Rice.  But Deborah Harkness has truly made me fall in love again with her vampire Matthew Clairmont.  It's a beautiful and complicated love story between Dr. Bishop, the witch, and vampire Clairmont, which makes the story even more compelling.  Ms. Harkness has everything is this novel.  There's tragedy, intrigue, violence, love, mystery, history, and much, much more.  I'm a lover of history much like the main character Dr. Bishop.  I would be just as excited as she is perusing first editions written hundreds of years ago.  It is the most well-written and convincing piece of fiction I've read.  If I didn't know better I'd almost think most of it were true.  The author does use actual events to make her novel close to being real.  I can hardly put it down.  I LOVE IT!  I hope she writes more about Dr. Bishop and Matthew Clairmont.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game, very similar to the original angry birds = win. Gotta love all the amazon comments complaining about US only, that is not the apps fault! Send amazon those complaints!

1421527618|5.0|This book is very dark, very violent, very intense at points. This is part of what makes me love it. It is a far cry from Slum Online in terms of content, but the writing and themes are still great. Like his other book, it's got a bit of cliche subject matter, but still does it somewhat uniquely. Be aware, this is a gritty book though. Dark, and at times humorous in unexpected ways.    This book has some great contributors as well, that in my opinion should of been used to sell the book. Yoshitoshi aBe who created Serial Experiments Lain, Haibane Renmei, and others, contributed the cover art. I guess he also might of contributed some art that didn't make it to the English edition. The author of Yukikaze, one of my favorite books, contributed ideas as well. Both are amply thanked in the authors note. You can really tell though, once you've read through and think about it.    It's a great, dark, but still hopeful book. The characters suffer and fight every day, but it just strengthens the main characters resolve. If you like violence, grit, action, well done plot and writing, then I really think you should try it. It is now one of my favorite books as well.     As an additional note for those who don't know, aBe is responsible for what is considered some of the smartest anime. This book doesn't reflect the kind of stuff you see in Lain, but it's not dumb scifi like you tend to see, filled with pure sex, hot aliens, and no plot. At the same time, it avoids being overly technical.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I have an HTC Evo on the Sprint network and I live in California.     I have been waiting all month for the Angry Birds Rio (whether that be sad or not is not really up for debate here!).    I just wondered if anyone else is getting this message?

B004P9FAL6|5.0|I don't understand what everyone's beef about these editions are. All of the Harry Potter ultimate editions so far have been fantastic. Who cares whether or not there are extended editions? Those were never the appeal fo the ultimate editions; besides, they put nearly everything they filmed into the movie, so an extended version would be utterly pointless. The appeal has obviously been the new special features which have always been top-notch. I don't have a clue why everybody's rating this so low because it is worth it, a hundred per cent.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am very happy with this game and I think that ROIVO offering it for free for a day is awesome! If you liked angry birds you will love this game. It has a lot of the same features as the original but with a lot of new features as well. Definitely a recommended game and a must try for everyone. I will be buying it tomorrow. More than worth a dollar.
B004KA9MQO|4.0|Jennifer Hudson is \\"feeling good\\" on the follow up to her Best R&B Album (Grammy) Award winning debut. Dropping songs like \\"Spotlight\\" and \\"I'm His Only Woman,\\" this American Idol alum and Oscar winning singer has found happiness, success, and love and isn't afraid to share the good news throughout the twelve track effort.     Declaring \\"Ain't no one gone love you like I'm gonna love you\\" on the Rich Harrison produced \\"No One Gonna Love You,\\" Hudson opens the album singing about the fact that her love is second to none in case you forgot. One of several stand outs on \\"I Remember Me,\\" \\"No One Gonna Love You\\" is a solid production heavy on the piano and soul.    Reconnecting with Stargate, Hudson sounds beautiful on \\"I Got This\\" (the second track). An empowering song, \\"I Got This\\" seems to capture exactly where Hudson is now -- not forgetting where she comes from all the while taking \\"another step\\" towards the \\"top\\" (this after earning top honors with Grammy and Academy Awards). Despite those accomplishments, R. Kelly and Harvey Mason Jr. aid J-Hud in crafting a song about a man that failed to deliver on his promises leaving her to say \\"Where You At?\\". The lead single for this album, \\"Where You At?\\" is yet another stand out and one of few ballads. The ending, no ill will intended , is the best part however as Hudson showcases the vocals that make her a powerhouse and undeniable talent.    Perhaps unsurprising, sharing the studio with Alicia Keys proved to be a good bet for  Jennifer Hudson on \\"I Remember Me\\" -- leading to three songs. The first of the trio, \\"Angel,\\" finds Hudson singing \\"I'll be your angel...we can touch the sky\\". Chanting, \\"Angel\\" is an upbeat production just as much as the Keys and Swizz Beatz (Dean) produced \\"Everybody Needs Love\\". A throwback to the 70/80s, \\"Everybody Needs Love\\" is a feel good record that will make you `scream out' \\"if you want it, you can get it... just trust and believe love.\\" Even Hudson attests \\"I know it's a lot of ya'll outthere who think you can't find love. But I'm here to tell you, if you want it you can have it -- just believe that\\". With Salaam Remi, Alicia Keys rounds out the trio giving Hudson another feel good record with \\"Don't Look Down\\". \\"Broken hearts and broken dreams. Baby nothing's broken as it seems,\\" Hudson belts before singing \\"there is no limit to how high we can go if you don't look down\\". No doubt, \\"Don't Look Down\\" is definitely a song for those falling in love and not out of love.    While you have to love Jennifer Hudson's upbeat nature throughout \\"I Remember Me,\\" despite telling the absent man in her life \\"you painted a picture for me but there was no frame\\" on \\"Where You At ?\\" and examining the \\"pain\\" and \\"hurt\\" on \\"I Remember Me\\" (Tedder), you're probably wondering where the signature J-Hud ballad(s) are. Following songs like \\"You Pulled Me Through\\" and \\"If This Isn't Love,\\" Jennifer Hudson delivers on \\"Still Here\\".  A Diane Warren track, \\"Still Here\\" is a strong retrospective ballad featuring Hudson singing \\"I still see you. I still feel you and we'll never be apart\\". If nothing else, \\"Still Here\\" IS the song you'll want to hear Hudson perform Live!    Speaking of Live!, Jennifer Hudson may draw comparisons to Whitney Houston, affectionately dubbed `The Voice' by many, and she lives up to that on \\"Why Is It So Hard\\" (Chuck Harmony, Ne-Yo).  Upbeat in comparison to Houston's \\"Why Does It Hurt So Bad\\" (Waiting To Exhale, Soundtrack), \\"Why Is It So Hard\\" may also remind you of \\"Blame It On Me\\" (Chrisette Michele). Nonetheless, it is another emotional and stirring standout on the album with Hudson singing \\"I guess it's the one time I don't care about the easy way\\". Alas, nothing is easy considering it would be an understatement to say Jennifer Hudson's life in recent years has not been \\"easy\\" but she's truly \\"Feeling Good\\" (Newley, Weight Watchers)  on \\"I Remember Me\\". Declaring \\"it's a new day\\" and \\"freedom is mine,\\" while closing out the album with an inspirational song titled \\"Believe,\\" it is clear Hudson may just be on track for another visit with Grammy thanks to this album. If you must download, take a listen at \\"Still Here,\\" \\"Why Is It So Hard,\\" \\"Everybody Needs Love,\\" \\"No One Gonna Love You\\" and \\"Don't Look Down\\". \\"Where You At?\\" and \\"Feeling Good,\\" while previously released, are worth a good listen as well.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|More Angry Birds for a cheap price (Free as of this writing, $.99 soon after). You can't beat the fun and addictiving nature of this series.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great on my EVO and it is FREE!!!! If you like the other versions of Angry Birds,  you would love this too! HTC EVO is the BEST!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|read the title? good now stfu! Rio is a great game. can't buy it in your country? stop crying if u maybe read the description it says US only. idiots. .. with that said can't wait for AB on consoles :D
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I currently use this cooler, with a gentle typhoon setup for the push portion of a push/pull fan assembly.  I can run by SB 2600k  at 5.0ghz with no heating problems! Well worth the money and will perform with much higher end stuff!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is addiction, &amp; Rio is better than the previous versions on all levels. The graphics are better. The music is better. The gameplay is better.
B003UESJHY|4.0|Picture the film Rocky with a dysfunctional family and you have the story line of The Fighter.  (OK, Paulie had issues, too, but not like this.)  The plot is hardly original, but, unlike Rocky, it is based on real people and true events.  There are some excellent acting performances here.  Bale's portrayal of the whacked-out, washed-up, punch-drunk, crack addict Dickie Ecklund is classic, and his facial expressions are priceless.  Wahlberg played half brother Mickey Ward low key, even timidly, and probably accurately based on the videos of Ward on the Internet.  More to the point, he looked like a fighter.  He had the proper physique and obviously is a fine athlete as the scenes of him working the bag and jumping rope illustrate.  The choreographed fight scenes were well done although not quite as good as Russell Crowe's mostly ad libbed scenes in Cinderella Man.  Melissa Leo's portrayal of a strong-willed, hands-on mother was so good that I wanted to throttle her character.  But sweet Amy Adams turns garbage mouth here, and I could never quite buy her in the part, lovely to look at as she is.  No problem with her acting.  I just didn't like her in the role.    The blu-ray video was top-notch, and surround effects were excellent via DTS 5.1 during the boxing scenes.  It's only a shame that it wasn't 7.1 TrueHD.    But the language.  Hollywood just has to toss in those F bombs.  Can't have a \\"gritty\\" drama without it, and the more the merrier.  This fine movie could have reached a far wider audience without the continued use of that accursed word, one the film industry needs to use for . . . what reason?  Realism?  Most likely the Eklund/Ward family uses it freely.  But how realistic is it to portray an aging mother of nine looking mighty fine in a tight mini-skirt?  If realism is your excuse to curse, then go the whole nine realistic yards.
0307463745|1.0|I was quite excited when I ordered Rework as 37signals are close to becoming a legend in the IT world. Unfortunately the books was so boring that I just abandoned reading it after some 20-30 pages. The authors try very hard to present their success as a business model for others to follow, but it's just not one.     If I'd seen even the first few pages before the purchase I guess I'd already know not to order it, so my advice is - don't order blindly after seeing Jason Fried talking about how people at his company don't work Fridays
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I also thought this would be a minor upgrade, instead it is an entire new game. I just love it.
B0043ISH6O|5.0|This hooks you from the start,yet gets even more hypnotic and evocative with time. You can't really get sick of it, it's perfect while writing or cooking. It's not really social music (which is kind of the point of the 'social network,' isn't it?) to listen to with others while you are speaking to them. Maybe with others while simultaneously typing or drawing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Wow this great game is even better than the original it's more real birds  Ok so did i complete the 25 words yet cause I dont have anything else to say
B004RJMUJO|5.0|One of the great things is that they give you plenty of incentive to keep trying, and that includes the Feint leaderboards, as well as new blades and backgrounds. The app updates at a nice pace, too. If you think of it as just \\"slicing fruit\\" then go ahead and go in the kitchen, throw all of your food in the air, grab a sword and see how it works out. (Don't really.) Gotta be a ninja to do it, and that's what the game gives you!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Amazing upgrade from the original. Beautiful graphics. Working fine on htc incredible running cm7 nightly build. Twenty five word minimum so yeah why so serious
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Don't rate the app 1 star because of restrictions!  Amazon is not the only company to have to abide by any copyright or contract restrictions!  Rate the app and developer.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|did not think there was much room for<br /> improvement over the original angry birds, as the seasons updates kind of dissapointed.  but the colors and graphics really pop in rio and gameplay is seamless!
B001EN71DG|3.0|Well, if you are looking for all three movies in their original theatrical form, they're here.  And you get the enhanced versions as well.  And I'm not totally against the enhanced versions, even though at times A New Hope looks like a cluttered mess.  But if you are expecting to see the original versions in anything better than a less-than-crystal clear, non-anamorphic form, you will be disappointed.  The fact that the films are merely considered an \\"extra\\" on the Bonus disks tells you about all you need to know.  And setting my TV to \\"zoom in\\" to try and cut down on the top and bottom black bars only makes the flaws in the transfer more obvious.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the long-time fans aren't really asking for much -- clean versions of the movies they saw in the theaters -- and that George Lucas refuses to give them that one simple thing.<br /><br />But, as I said in my title, I suppose it's better than nothing.  And for the price, I'll gladly take this and pass on the Blu Rays.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Why is a credit card required to download a free app?????????<br /><br />I have a balance in my Amazon gift card account, why will they not let me apply that to my Amazon App store account?<br /><br />Rovio, please just put this in the regular app store.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|said I needed to turn on 1 click ordering which I did, but is still did not let me download for free. very bad first day.
B004J4WQ46|5.0|To start my review, I'd like to warn to older fans that this is not exactly like  an usual Strokes cd. After 5 years, the band changed their directions a bit, but it's still the same quality. The cd starts with Machu Picchu, a nice track for the intro, happy and fun. Then we have Under Cover of Darkness which is a different, and Lower East Side kind of anthem... The next 3 tracks reminds us of old Strokes songs, Games is a 80s 70s type of rock song which is very eccentric. Call Me Back is the slowest song, almost indie-ish...Gratisfactions is a bright song which makes you happy and nice. Metabolism is my least favorite of them it sounds like a Muse rip-off. And the final track summarizes this whole album, and closes spectacularly. As i mentioned before, Angles is a different cd. However in my opinion, I strongly believe that you will love it.
0439023521|5.0|I am very happy I finally read The Hunger Games. And yes, I'm happy to say that it lived up to the hype and Suzanne Collins can add another fan to her already popular work.     It combines the bad-ass protagonist, Katniss Everdeen (which I keep thinking is a typo, and keep thinking katpiss lol), no vampire or werewolves involved (enough already with their species), archery (love this kick-ass chick!), and the uber-lovable Peeta Mellark, which reminds me so much of someone.     The excitement, the buildup, the very believable characters and very relatable situations. Haymitch, though, reminds me of Jiraya a little bit. And I loved how the author is building up a love triangle most likely to be looked upon more closely on the second book, between Katniss, Gale and Peeta.     I love Katniss' character, can relate with the whole desperation to live, hunger, and the lovable innocent little sister. I'm a big sister too. :)    Love Peeta's dad. \\"See that girl over there? I wanted to marry her mother.\\"    I love how smart yet dense this girl is when it comes to Peeta. But I know how it feels, I'm part of the club. Hahaha.     I love how it is fairly-paced and it didn't make me feel like the author just have to make sure that something happens in every turn. That's how I felt with The Lightning Thief. Anyway, very well written!    Also, the language was simple and age-appropriate. The theme and characters are very well developed. Even though I just met Rue, I felt like I already knew enough to feel empathetic.     Loved Cato's ending. I could just imagine what Peeta and Katniss were hearing during those moments.     All in all, if you guys who haven't read this, are not yet convinced by the raving reviews, better check it again, coz you're missing out on a wonderful reading experience. :)    Happy reading!
B004IJZFP4|4.0|I love Tommy Bolin, and I love this new \\"version\\" of the long out of print \\"Teaser\\" solo LP, which I alreaady own. My problem is that these \\"versions\\" are not explained or discussed anywhere. These are not the  original \\"Teaser\\" recordings. Are they alternate takes ? Remixes ? Both ? I expected a booklet shedding   some light on where these tracks originated and how they were treated. There is not a word inside the   disc package about what's going on here, and thus a four star rating for what would otherwise be  a five star disc.
B0041H9N4W|5.0|Yes, I'm reviewing an extras-loaded blu ray edition of a film barely anyone has ever seen, especially if you were born after the 80's horror heydays!  I am so pleased to have found this gem at AmazonUK.com on blu ray, with brand new special features, cheap, and on a region free disc courtesy of Arrow Video.<br /><br />Firstly, the film itself is pure fun horror-comedy.  It never takes itself too seriously, but doesn't skimp on the villains ability to kill, bite, and tear the hero's limb from limb.  This is basically the same premise of Martin Scorsese's great black comedy After Hours mixed with EC style vampirism, and John Hughes-like teen comedy.  And it totally works.  Hell even a star of John Hughes' Sixteen Candles(Gedde Wantanabbe) plays one of the main characters.  The big draw of this film at the time, at least for the low budget studio behind the film, was getting Grace Jones to play the main vampire Goddess Katrina.  She was showcased in all the tv adds and most of the poster artwork.  Was it worth it?  HELL YEAH!  While she has little-to-no dialogue in the film she is quite striking while she is on screen.  Even without her Nosferatu-inspired vampire make up on she's still strange and menacing.  Plus, she has one of the most interesting and weird strip-teases ever committed on film.  This film has a similar tone to the equally great Fright Night.  If you dug that one, you may just be seduced by Vamp.<br /><br />Now onto the new Blu ray.  It is really good with only minor complaints.  The transfer is probably as great as it's ever going to be.  Even better than the already very good Anchor Bay release.  There's some grain scattered about, the film takes place mostly at night.  But the very EC/early Dario Argento-inspired light schemes that dominate the second and third acts of the film are even more striking in Hi-Definition.  It's worth the upgrade for sure.<br /><br />The brand new special features are great as well.  We get a new audio commentary featuring co-star Robert Rusler(Weird Science, A Nightmare on Elm. Street 2) and film critic Calum Waddell(he's written pieces for Fangoria magazine).  They seem like old pals and laugh it up as they talk about what's on screen.  We also get some scandalous details regarding Rusler's night life while working on the film accompanied by Grace Jones, and a great story about how Dolph Lundgren wanted to kick his butt.  \\"Vamp it up-Dedee Pfeiffer Remembers the After Dark Club\\" is a talking heads interview with the actress with footage, behind the scenes and other, cut into her conversation(which is the case for all the special features).  It's fun and she comes off very personable and cute.  Makes one wish that she showed up in more stuff.  The last time I saw her in anything outside of her Playboy pics(which if you haven't already, check them out immediately) is that horrible sitcom Cybil.  Next we get \\"Vamp Stripped Bare-an interview with Richard Wenk\\" a great piece talking to the director about his inspirations and the wranglings it took to make the film and keep Grace Jones on set.  This feature does repeat some of the next features material, \\"Back to the 80'S-Producing a Campy Cult Classic that interviews producer Peter Borscher.  This is the best of the interview section of special features in my opinion.  It goes over all the details of how the film got off the ground, the actual production, and the release and eventual cult status of the film.  Most interestinly is Borscher's story about how he was approached in the 90's by Robert Kurtzman(the K in KNB Effects) and then unknown Quentin Tarantino about a script they wanted him to produce called From Dusk 'Til Dawn.  They wanted him to produce the film just so they could avoid legal problems with the fact that both films had very similar premises, but really are nothing alike in the long run.  He did produce Dusk.  Never knew that.  Borscher isn't dry and talks straight to the point.  \\"Scrapbook of Scares\\" is a fun featurette with director Wenk showing off some of the memorabilia he kept from the Vamp shoot.  It's neat and worth a look.  We also get rehearsal footage, bloopers, original theatrical trailer, and Richard Wenk's student film Dracula Bites the Big Apple-all of which were ported over from the original Anchor Bay DVD release.<br /><br />You also get a double sided poster featuring brand artwork for the film.  The Blu Ray sleeve itself is really fun.  You can flip it to appear as any poster design you prefer.  There's the two new artworks, which is what the double-sided poster consists of, or two original posters.  Very neat.  Finally, you get a 7 page booklet featuring an essay by critic Jay Slater that is fun and nostalgia fueled recollection of a film he obviously loves.<br /><br />Now the only downside of this package that I can muster is the abscence of the Anchor Bay DVD's audio commentary featuring stars Mark Makepeace, Dedee Pfeiffer and director Richard Wenk.  I'm assuming it was a rights issue and the commentary strictly belongs to Anchor Bay, otherwise I can't think of a good reason not to include it.  If you can pick up a copy of the American DVD release, it's worth a listen.  But that's it.  I'm a very happy customer with a film that I've loved since gradeschool.<br /><br />The mid to late 80's birthed a lot of suped up and alternative vampire flicks.  Vamp, The Lost Boys, Near Dark and my personal favorite Fright Night(which now that it's being remade the chances of that classic getting a special edition blu ray are very good-YAY) all had one thing in common beyond the time period that they were made, they involved teenagers as their main characters.  How else in the 80's would dusty old and totally been-done-to-death horror characters such as vampires be relevant and more importantly profitable.  This films I mentioned were all good films to boot.  So enjoy....this movie doesn't SUCK.k showing off some of the memorabilia he kept from the Vamp shoot.  It's neat and worth a look.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|The book starts off heavily in history references as our heroine is a historian. The science aspect comes in as we meet Matthew. To some the references may be lost, but the detail is great if you have a clue what it's referring to. Personally, I enjoyed the theory behind the science. Although we lose sight of the enchanted alchemical manuscript for a good portion of the book, I found the development of the relationship between Diana & Matthew a welcome reprieve from reality without turning this book into soft porn. Although the book lost a little stream in the end, I would be interested in how the story will continue.
B004LP601S|5.0|Oh be quiet. This band has lost it's main lyricist and you expect them to produce some grammy winning album (not that A Fever You Can't Sweat Out or Pretty.Odd. are). Panic! fans are delusional. This album is great. Catchy choruses, dancable beats, fast and slow tempo. The lyrics are straight forward, as Brendon intended them to be. What fan would want a repeat of either album when you have a genious mix of both. You have fans that never liked this band love Vices & Virtues. I reccommend everyone have a listen.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i can not get this app to install on my non-rooted droid x. it will download but when i click install it flat out refuses to do so.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have gotten a Galaxy Nexus and a Transformer Infinity and this app installed fine on both. Now I have all 4 angry birds games and can't be happier.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|First of all, the 1 start review does not reflect Angry Birds: Rio's quality, as it is undoubtedly an excellent game. That's precisely the problem though, i have no way of testing it so i can give it a better review. In my place are also millions of AT&T customers and people outside the US.    Rovio made a huge mistake in choosing Amazon as the only place to launch this game. Not only do they not offer this promotion to people outside the US, but even people inside, who are unfortunate enough to be on AT&T, are locked out with no way to even buy it.    I've loved Amazon for many years, but they seriously dropped the ball on this one. They should be embarrassed to put out such an incomplete and defective product.
0321356683|5.0|What can I say? James Gosling says it's a mandatory book, there's really not much I can add on top of this! The book is excellent, you enjoy reading it. It's a mandatory reading for anyone looking forward to distinguish itself.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is the first prenatal workout I've purchased so far where I have actually broken a sweat. I was an active runner pre-pregnancy but had to stop at 5 months due to discomforts. I've been searching for a good workout that was challenging enough and this one works for me!  The first time you do it, you will find yourself dashing around your living room trying to find an appropriate spot to do some of the moves, but by the 3rd time, I had the routine down, and I could just focus on the intensity. The workout goes by fast - only 40 minutes start to finish. Plus I love Erin's sense of humor.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Title pretty much says it all.  Cant downlaod this app unless you enter all your account info again.  Why would I sign in with my amazon account only to have to enter all the info again including CC info.  Not worth it.  App Store already removed from phone.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great game so far didnt have any probs downloading amazon app store or the actual app and cant beat the price and its still not available on the andriod market so plus plus plus!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Install worked great, no issues.  Have played a ton already and will continue to support Angry Birds, even if they start charging!
0756404738|5.0|I'm not a great fan of the multi-volume fantasy epic. Mostly, I blame Stephen Donaldson for this plague. Tolkein pretty much had the market to himself until the over-vocabularied SD came out with the whole Thomas Covenant thing. I see 'Book One of the Blah Trilogy' on the cover of a book and I tend to walk past, wondering why it takes 1800 pages or more to put forward an idea, develop a character, tell a story ...     On very rare occasions when I know it might be worth the wait I'll buy part one and not read it - or part two - until the whole damn thing is out.    But there is putting forward an idea, developing a character, telling a story ... and there is bona fide worldbuilding: developing not just a character but a whole questing pack of them, with towns, cities, cultures, religions, history and geography to give them context and depth. Lois McMaster Bujold's Challion novels are a good example of this, notably because of the coherent religious and theological background she developed in The Curse of Challion and used in the subsequent, largely stand-alone books (not a trilogy per se).    Patrick Rothfuss has pulled off a similar coup with the Kingkiller Chronicles. I ignored The Name of the Wind when it was released, for all the reasons laid out above ... but I kept running in to the damn thing everywhere. When I gave in and read it ... oh wow. Great story, complex, absorbing, well-written (a too-rare quality) and very original (ditto). I had my reservations (spare me the made-up faerie languages) but mostly I loved it. Raved about it, told friends about it, the whole deal.    Then I had to wait for the next one. And believe me, The Wise Man's Fear was worth the wait. Rothfuss gives us more of the arcanist-musician-adventurer Kvothe and his carefully (self-)constructed legend, with a backdrop of war (for which Kvothe seems to be responsible) and supernatural threat. And it's another damn good story, that's just as absorbing as the first and leaves you wanting more. Which might be a problem: Rothfuss has set so many things in motion, left so many questions to be answered, and clearly has so much of Kvothe's story to tell, that I'm starting to wonder if he can do it in one book and do it justice.    Or is there more than one book to come? The series is called the Kingkiller Chronicles, after all - nothing to limit the number of volumes there. It's described as a trilogy in some places, and the way Rothfuss has set up Kvothe's tale, with him dictating it to the Chronicler over a stipulated three days and the books sub-sub-titled as Day One and Day Two (so far) certainly feeds in to this. But I have been wondering: three days to tell the tale to Chronicler; one book per day, yes; but then what happens after Kvothe has finished his tale. Is he just waiting to die, as Rothfuss tells us at the beginning and end of each book so far?    I can see the potential for a What Kvothe Did Next - and I wouldn't mind.    Get it. Read it. Read The Name of the Wind first if you have to, or give the man his due and re-read it before you embark on The Wise Man's Fear. The tell all your friends to read it.    [...]
B004SBS8LA|5.0|It isn't fair that people that live outside of the USA are taking their frustrations out on Amazon by leaving one star reviews of this game. This version of Angry Birds is full of vibrant colors and super smooth gameplay. This game really was worth the wait, and is more of a complete overhaul than a simple addition of more levels. Chances are you have played some angry birds in the past, prepare to be amazed!  I did have to download the game twice to get it to install, just be patient.   If you are running a custom ROM, know that I am running RUBIX 2.0 and it works just fine!  Droid X.  I also think that people need to relax on amazon.com. Yeah, I am sure if you are outside of the USA, you are annoyed that you can't get this game right now. C'mon though, they are launching this appstore with all sorts of legal issues already and you want to make the launch infinitely more complicated by going worldwide?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game play and tons of levels.  I love that the free version doesn't have annoying ads, it does have ads but the ads are hardly noticeable...very nice.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Not available in my region? US only? You gotta be kidding. It's free for God's sake. I've made purchases so many times from Amazon, why can't I get a free item, now?
B004SBS8LA|4.0|\\"This product will not install on my EVO 4G. It downloads fine but fails installation.\\"   FIX: I connected my phone to a computer and cut and pasted the android.secure folder from phone to another location on my computer. Then tried to install and it installed very quickly.  The game Rocks!! Great animation. Try my FIX. It works.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|This is the first time an Angry Birds game for Android has been released with geographical restrictions. I hope this will be solved soon...

And whay you  fail to inform this form the start!!???
B004SBS8LA|1.0|After reinstalling the amazon market three times i finally got it to download. game is great like the others, better graphics. But not five star due to hassle of downloading. It should have been available in the regular market. Nice that even free it has no ads.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I just played the first few levels, and all I can say is wow!  On my Droid X, the graphics are crisp and colorful and the gameplay is smooth.  The 3-star finish on the few levels I played was a little more challenging than the original, but that didn't take away from the play.  This is going to be a real (and fun) time waster.
B004LP601S|5.0|The type of Panic! fan that I am: LOVED Fever but was very disappointed with Pretty.Odd.    What songs work?: All of them are good, but my favorites: Nearly Witches, Hurricanes, Memories, Trade Mistakes, The Calendar.    Final Thoughts: I really like this album. In my eyes this is the rightful follow-up to \\"Fever\\". For those Panic! fans that loved the first album but were disappointed by the yawn inducing Pretty.Odd - this album is for you.

Is it this hard to check this before sending me through all these steps?    This game is not for free, it is plainly not available :(
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can't imagine going back to life without Evernote.    I run a small company and use Evernote to save ideas and articles I read while on the go, it's a huge force multiplier combined with some good RSS feed and I recommend pairing it with some RSS feeds relevant to your business or interests and use of the Android built in \\"Send To\\" function, where Evernote will show up as an option. Then any article can be sent to Evernote as a categorized note.    When you get back to your desk everything syncs with the Evernote desktop app and you can turn your notes into emails and actions!

B00479SVBU|2.0|Good device BUT  does not work with iTunes music files.  I did not know this when bought.  To use it I have to now reload cd's into my computer in mp3 format.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is one of THE Bond movies you will never forget. Daniel Craig is great as Bond, as well as the rest of the cast. They portray, as I think, Ian Fleming's Bond, and not a terrible Bond that makes the movie an Epic Fail. (this is a review that WILL spoil the movie) Le Chiffre' is a evil man who funds terroists with money they invest in him. He bets against the Stock Market, but when his plan to make the Stocks crumble fails, his only chance is too set up a high staks poker game in Montenegro. Bond stops his plot for the stock market, and he has to stop the plot in the poker game too. He is assisted by Felix Leiter and makes Le Chiffre loose. He is tourtured, but is left unconcious and saw Le Chiffre die. he is about ot give the money to the bank, when Vesper(Watch da dang movie to find out who she is!)takes the money to an orginazation, much like the terroists Le Chiffre was funding. She commits suicide, but leaves Bond a clue for the orginazation. Mr. Whits phone number. He is part of that orginazation, and he the money. To find out what happens next, buy, rent or read my review to Quantum of Solace.( Review isn't on during March 2011- April 2011). THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE! BUY! RENT! I DON'T CARE HOW(I don't mean steal it!)YOU GET IT, BUT WATCH IT! I hope you thank me when you watch it. This is fart87, and Im going dark. MI6 out.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The birds! They so angry!  They just need some    beer to calm down. Or maybe even a xanax, they to Angry!!  But damn good game?
1595141715|3.0|Let me start by saying I did not hate this book as much as it might seem like I did (I did give it 3 stars). I realize that's a horrible way to start a review, but hopefully once you read this you'll know why I said that.    First of all, the format of the book is actually interesting. From that, however, came the feeling that you had to choose which character you were more interested in, Hannah or Clay. Because right from the beginning you know their lives didn't intersect often, and that for some reason, he made it on the list of reasons she killed herself. It's easy from Clay's narration to see that his a good person and only wanted to help Hannah, but every character in the book, including him, was cowardly in some way. He didn't help her as much as he wanted to, because he was afraid of what people would think of him for associating with the girl whose undeserved reputation had made its way across the whole town. Hannah was cowardly in that she literally went looking for reasons to end her life rather than put in the effort to fix it (you may argue this if you've read it, but she did in fact say that she was looking for an out). Granted, it was not her fault her life needed to be fixed, but she was simply not strong enough to make herself believe that. It's hard to like a character who cares so little about herself, in spite of her obvious pain.  Personally, I was more interested in what Hannah had to say, but I liked Clay better as a character. In a way this kind of made me feel disconnected from the book... but maybe that's just me.    My biggest problem with the book is that it can only appeal to a small, specific demographic. I am only 20 years old and I feel that I've already outgrown this book [which I anticipated going into it, but I wanted to read it anyway]. Anyone younger than 15 is probably too young to read it, for there are some very serious issues discussed, such as rape, sexual content, depression and, obviously, suicide. But anyone who's out ofhigh school might read it, as I did, and constantly be thinking, \\"what is the big deal?\\" Hannah was supposed to be 17 years old, mature enough to see that life goes beyond high school, but all of these small things affected her so deeply?  Don't get me wrong, many of the things I thought would make me just as angry as they made Hannah, but I think most people are a bit more introspective [in a positive way, not in a \\"Why does the world hate me so much?\\" kind of way] and could force themselves to get past it. In that way, I didn't think the book was realistic. That leaves about a three-year age range for people who could relate to this book and take it seriously.    That said, I do think the book brings up good points, about how society views suicide and people who talk about suicide. One of my favorite parts of the book was in that class when Hannah anonymously brought up suicide and the whole class brushed it off as a means of getting attention. But how can the person expect to get attention if they only mentioned it anonymously? Obviously this person needs help! I think people do need to spend less time judging those who commit, attempt or discuss suicide, and more time trying to help them. The book also places a focus on how teenagers view themselves, and how they act based on how they want others to view them. This places way too much pressure on young people, and Jay Asher does an excellent job of shedding light on this.    I'm looking forward to the movie, just so I can see how they might have changed it to appeal to a wider audience.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|Got my Beatles CD in great time. It was exactly as they described it to be. I'm happy with it and glad I ordered it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game! Runs well on the droid x. I like how Rovio gave a timeline for future updates. Amazon app store was very easy to use.
0870703781|5.0|This book is a very good reason never to ditch books. It's a picture book and a Kindle or IPad or ereader could never replace it. I put it on my coffee table and every time I pick it up, I learn something new about composition or color or subject matter. It's a master work.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app has app a beautiful, dedicated UI, making it simple to use and the settings are great. Few more settings and this'll be perfect!!
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I have this app purchased through Android Marketplace on all my Android devices. This has all the functionality you need to read pdf files and then some. This works fantastic on my NOOKcolor (rooted of course!). Buy only If you have too many pdf files to read else try out the ezPDF reader which provides basic feature set and is priced comfortably at $0.99.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|This came in new condition, in plastic wrap and so far its been working great! Its awesome i was able to buy this and catch up on a show i used to love!
B004EI2NM2|5.0|A movie about a lesbian and a curious scared female who join together one night to talk about the secrets and open up to a stranger.  Early in the morning it becomes more difficult to part and yet both know it is the way it has to be.  Awonderful movie with great acting, wonderful ambiance and a great direction.  Highly recommend.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Nice graphics added to a great game, but am I the only one who is missing the pigs? Overall a nice addition to the current angry birds line up.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love it! Graphics are great. Still very fun. :) :) :) works great on my phone. I dont like this 25 word minimum on the review.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|HTC EVO 4G for Sprint.... jumped through hoops to load appstore and the effing game wouldn't even start.... FML. looks like there are many errors with HTC and Sprint with this app.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|looking good .  I love the no adds . really nice  new characters and lastly, it runs like butter ....... hopefully  this app helps to push if appstore to places where the market can't . hood luck guys
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Even better then the original and seasons, which is saying alot!! I didn't think it could get any better, I can't wait for the updates!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I really like the new concept and the gameplay style. The game is faster and smoother than original angry birds because it's AD FREE! I didn't see ANY ADS during the gameplay. I guess that's what makes the game faster. FREE for a limited time too. So just BUY NOW!! Deserves 5 stars for my opinion.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This is a great CD. Have always loved Gregg Allman's voice, and he does not disappoint. Song selection is good, and I loved hearing something new from one of my favorites of all time.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Odd I can download the appstore app then register with no issues, it's only when I try and download the app, I find out it's not available in the UK. However for IOS devices it's available worldwide. Very poor really.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|First off, this is a fantastic game.  I see a number of AT&T customers are having issues with it but that isn't hard to get around.    I have a Samsung Captivate, which I rooted and am running Superuser, Busybox Installer and Marketaccess.  I had no issues installing the Amazon App Store or Angry Birds Rio.  If you do these things (my Marketaccess identifies me as a T-Mobile customer on market) you shouldn't have any problems.  If you are truly rooted and tried these things post a comment here and I will try to get back to you.    I <3 this game!  Don't let ATT ruin it for you!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Will not install on Droid Incredible.  Looked forward to this launch for nothing.  Please fix the issue while the app is still free.  Waiting not so patiently...
0061537934|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It is a beautiful story that is full of laughter and emotion.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Today is my 28th day with the 30 Day Shred.  Coupled with diet and some (light) additional cardio I have lost about 10 pounds and about 3 inches in my waist.  I'm only 5'2, so this is pretty substantial.    For most people this will be a kick butt workout at first.  It's still a challenge now, but I can't remember the last time I felt this strong... maybe never.    I have had some knee problems in the past and, unlike some, I found this workout comfortable.    Highly recommended.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|It's fun for what it is, big explosions, loud noises, and general fun in special-effects land. No need to have seen or remembered the original Tron movie (though it's now available again in a nice package, [[ASIN:B004KPLVV8 Tron: The Original Classic (Special Edition)]]) just go with the flow here. The movie is probably better than it has any right to be, start with the \\"hey, let's take a barely remembered movie from more than twenty years ago and sort of make a sequel or a re-imagining of it, maybe some of the same stars, and big special effects and lots of merchandising.\\" That the resulting movie is quite good, fun, and watchable is a rather nice surprise.
