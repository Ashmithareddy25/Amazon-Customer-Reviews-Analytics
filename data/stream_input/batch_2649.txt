B000BKHL1K|5.0|We love this wine rack.  It's unique and looks great on our wall.  We've received a ton of compliments on it and have even bought it for gifts several times too!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was excited to read this when it finally downloaded after several postponed release dates just to be disappointed at the lack of the growth of characters and their story. Then at the end to find there are to be 2 more books to this saga just seems like the author is dragging out what should be no more than a trilogy at best.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|Not the best and not the worst doesn't have that realistic feel. Love having t he real players. How do you think I may have been the best part is me.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Daft Punk consistently puts out great songs.  This one really makes me want to get up and dance (despite hating dancing).  I added it to my running playlist to help keep me motivated.

B0043RSK3K|5.0|First a review note. I recently watched a YouTube video of a room of people that a man was marching back and forth on the stage pointing to a display of the Kindle Amazon site and telling people their \\"Duty\\" was to go to Amazon Kindle and find all the books from the \\"liberals\\" and \\"progressives\\" and give them a \\"1 STAR smear\\" and then search for the RW and give them all a \\"5 STAR.\\" This reflects the sickness perhaps that taints our legitimate interest in seeing things from other perspectives. There are thousands of these people whom seem determined to \\"Shoot the Messenger\\" will no regard at all for an intellectual pursuit. Having made this important note--<br /><br />This is a book that does, as all books of history filling libraries do, cherry picks many things. It has too because books like this dig right to the truths, as perceived, of things that may have been known to us, but we did not want to see or hear it. We are all, all of us, seeking a comfort zone to be sure and when someone like Oliver Stone comes along and sort of puts it in front of us, not down our throats, but in front of us with his incredible skill then we have to face these things.<br /><br />I was an Army officer for nearly 30-years and a multi-year veteran of over 500 combat flying missions in SE Asia and in the CIA's Secret War. As the years went by I worked all over the world, with more books coming about working with the FBI and CIA (in a surprising manner) it became apparent to me that what Oliver Stone points to has always been in front of us, just that most of us either never looked, or the 99.99% that never was in a position to look--much less care.<br /><br />We have an ugly history to be sure, perhaps every bit as bad as the Brits and French (maybe?) of colonialism, even as we wish we could ignore or deny it. But it is there.<br /><br />The real issue as I have seen in my decades all over the world, including years with the CIA in covert work, is who is really running things? Is it global bankers? Jewish conspiracies? Corrupted businessmen (and women sometimes), RW conservatives that would do anything to deny people the rights to vote or other human dignities? Who?<br /><br />The real thing this book does is sort of give you an electric shock to sit up, look around, be aware. No one can put their finger on just who is doing what. But, overall and maybe Oliver Stone is like this, overall it is the totality of the human existence and the stuggles just to survive that we have stripped from so many hundreds of millions--even as the \\"we\\" is unclear. That may be the message you get from this incredible book and the Showtime series that goes with it.<br /><br />We all die. But so many suffer all over the world for nothing, nothing at all. Is it greed and if so, by whom? The headless, leaderless, borderless corruption flows like a river of dirty mud that engulfs so many, at all levels, in so many governments. Few if any are untainted if not by actual deeds as by looking the other way--the convenient way out.<br /><br />Oliver Stone gently moves you out of your comfort zone, gets you to recognize that maybe the global human rights is more important than a few dollars on a barrel of oil, or the timber, the mines or whatever else industry wants to steal rather than buy.<br /><br />The light of day, and more so now in the Internet world, will help us and this great book is like a road map to see where it is coming from.<br /><br />Some of my own books put us into the shadow world, a world that maybe we do not actually want to know exists. It is is more comforting to, liberal or conservative, religious or not, to simply, carefully, without malice, to look the other way as if a distraction beyond our immediate view is more immediately important than what is before is.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BE73942 WAR STORIES - From an Army Pilot Flying in the CIA's Secret War in Laos (myTroubledSkies)]]obal bankers?

B004SPSXM0|5.0|I did not get a chance to use the book for what I intended to use it for but it did arive quickly. Thanks
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love the Kindle app, but it does not retain the books that I have purchased.  If I shut down my tablet completely, the book disappears and I have to resend them.  A problem if internet is not readily available.
145210655X|5.0|The kids saw this in the library and adored it. They are big Star Wars fans, so I had to get this for our own library. Very cute book!
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I bought this to play games on my Kindle, like Ruzzle, and for a couple of drawing and painting apps. Altthough I'm back to using my fingers for games, this stylus is perfect for the more &#34;artsy&#34; apps. The multiple size tips(3) give you a wide range of capabilities. I've used mine quite a bit and it shows no signs of wearing out. I can see where it may actually wear out at some point as the tips feel hollow underneath. It is pretty easy to lose though because there is nowhere to clip it on my Kindle cover without interfering with the cover closing. I suggest a small piece of Velcro attached to the stylus and to your Kindle cover. Or you can go the route  the banks use to keep you from stealing their pens and attatch a beaded chain to it.(I am in no way suggesting you steal the chains from the bank) I'm only giving this stylus 4 stars as I haven't tried any others so I have nothing to compare it to. I can only say that for what I use it for, it works great. No complaints.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i played this with my second grader and it was a good puzzle for both of us. looking forward to future rooms!

B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Wasn't nearly as good as live free die hard. The plot was more &#34;realistic&#34;, but it seems the production value in this movie went to big helicopters and the sets, and quite honestly it wasn't enough. It was definitely action packed, but it wasn't a thrill ride. There just seemed to be action for the sake of action. It was patterned no real flow was established talk, action, talk, action, talk, action, and the transitions sometimes were just so stupid it was insulting. That being said, if you want to have a beer and play this movie in the background while you are at a party, then it works for that purpose and only that purpose. But it does not hold a candle to the original 3 or even the last die hard.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|come ova and read this! its like real life! I wish I was a princess in real life!!! I just wish you didn't have to buy the whole version. but or else... best game ever.

B006QPX7UI|5.0|Long, somewhat ponderous, and Martin Sheen nearly wrecks it, but the story, the realism and the emotion carry the day.  Well worth the time/
0470474874|5.0|Use Excel everyday but not for complicated things and this helps out with those situations with something else is needed.
B00C4QPYJU|5.0|AND THIS MOVIE HAS ITTTTT!!!!!! Excitement, drama, arm wrastling, backwards hats, forward hats, I just don't know what else you want. So shutup and watch it.
B0053O89RY|5.0|If you own season 1 and 2 then you don't need an explanation for season 3. If you don't own Modern Family? Buy it, it's worth it.

B008602KQI|2.0|Started out OK. But the end was so unsatisfying. It looks like the makers were saving themselves for a sequel!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's 1 of the best apps in the world of apps. Amazing controls and great blocks. When I bought this I thought it wasn't going to be very good. I was very wrong about that.
B0023P1D8S|5.0|I am of course talking of the 2009 Deluxe Edition with Bonus Cd. I love this album (it's my favorite) for a lot of reasons, Sweet Leaf is amazing. The riffs on Sweet Leaf are just awesome. After Forever is a mystery for me, I like everything about it but what makes it go in my top 5 favorite Sabbath songs, I don't know. Children of the Grave is awesome because of the heavy and deep riffs, it kinda reminds me of Paranoid.<br /><br />Lord of this world is another one of those great 70's metal songs. The name might make you have doubt but it is truly a great song. Solitude, every metal album needs a ballad in order to be complete! Into the Void, another true 70's metal masterpiece with the deep riffs and the vocals from Ozzy.<br /><br />DISC 2. Weevil Women 71' is great. Ozzy kinda sounded like he was just thinking of lyrics while he was singing. Sweet Leaf Demo, absolutely amazing. I love demos and all but this is not a demo, this could have been an actual song but just like Weevil Women, Ozzy is just coming up the lyrics as he goes. After Forever is a great song, but having an instrumental version is even better!<br /><br />I do like Ozzy's vocals but the most amazing part of the song is Tony Iommi grinding the guitar. Amazing. Children of the Grave with alternate lyrics, it's cool. Children (Instrumental), same with After Forever, the riffs are amazing. Lord of this world with Piano with Slide Guitar, even cooler!<br /><br />It's awesome. Solitude with no flute sounds the same, to me at least. Last one, Spanish Sid (Early version of Into of the Void), kinda the same as of Into the Void. But with little bit of different lyrics.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a must see because it is fantastic!  I really enjoyed this movie! It is appropriate for children and adults!
B004UAKAE2|5.0|I am so glad I persevered through Season 1 Eps 1-4, for years I have heard of the greatness of Upstairs Downstairs so I had high expectations, I found Episodes 1-4 not very interesting don't let these episodes deter you, starting with Episode 5 the series picks up steam and just keeps going. I just finished Season Five and totally enjoyed the journey. Excellent characters: Mr Hudson, Mrs Bridges (my favorite), Rose, Edward, Ruby, Sir Bellamy and more interesting characters to come in future seasons. I give the series in its entirety five stars. I enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs just as much as I enjoy Downton Abbey.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointing. I was not happy to learn that what was originally supposed to be a trilogy is now more. Just end it. The characters are not THAT interesting.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I am a lifetime fan of the Queens, or anything Josh Homme releases to the world. This album, as with all QOTSA albums, is unlike any others that they have done. Also, like every other album, it is amazing. Hope they hit the bay area on their tour at some point, and can't wait for what comes next
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addicting. Once you reach level 10 you have to rate the game to get more updated levels.

B00A6CT012|5.0|Everyone should read this book as we can all learn to live with less and do right by the planet.  Well worth reading.  It offers a variety of suggestions allowing you to make changes at the level you are comfortable with.  Order it as an ebook and save a tree.
B006M4F67A|4.0|Like the game very much. Easy to use. Lots of fun. Nice graphics and the sound is okay. I would recommend. This game for those who enjoy matching games.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Great cd - every song is good.  Bruno is a true artist!  I have listened to this cd over and over and never tire of it.
1572814748|5.0|This is a very nicely colored deck. I needed this size to fit into a wooden box that I had wood burned especially for Tarot cards.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read it in one day. Could not put it down. Katniss and Peeta kept you guessing the entire time, but you just knew they had to end up together.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This product works. I like the different modes that can be monitored. Knowing just how much battery time is available for the different task is very helpful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this is the best because I used to play temple run and it was not even close to be as fun as this game
0307749495|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher series: and this one is my favorite! Action packed, filled with twists and turns and never predictable. Nice to fill in the blanks in the hero's background.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I honestly cannot stop crying. This book is so unbelievably beautiful and I just cannot get enough of it. I will probably re-read this book over and over again. John Green has really done something beautiful..
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a slight bit confusing. But confusing is good. I was hooked on this game and played until i was finished with it . It has 4 chapters and each has multiple riddles you must solve to get to the big picture. It is just plain genius. My only complaint is that you need to wait to buy the next installment. But other than waiting it is definitely my new favorite game and i will definitely play it multiple times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Realistic amazing features to make it look realistic feels like I am in the game when I play. Just amazing
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game. it is so much fun to play. you want to try and beat your previous score and time each game you play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fascinating story line -- one of the best there is!  Can't wait for season 4 to begin!  Want to visit all the spots in England.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|I really appreciated the ease of renting this movie from Amazon after seeing just a few scenes at a friend's home.  Great version of what happens after death and suicide and the possibilities of redemption through love and a soul-mate--and the scenes of hell are amazing ! As usual Robin Williams rocks as a brilliant, funny guy -- this time with a take on the afterlife with just enough humor in it to keep the subject matter not-too- heavy.  Special effects star in this movie, from a world in which all surfaces are paint to the deep grey of a suicide's hell. This is the kind of movie I could watch again and again and still find more interesting details in all the artistry.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Part science, part cultural history, part philosophy, part cookbook, and part personal experience -- this is an enjoyable and informative read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest allows you to create a virtual pinboards of all sorts. It is easy to use, maintain, and share your interest with a cummunity that will appreciate it.
B009X011UQ|4.0|I wish the stand was a little easier to use, to be it doesn't go into the slot easily enough.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A wonderful read after the less intriguing fourth book. Martin returns to his cliffhangers and twists that make you unable to put the book down.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|I'll admit that I chose this movie more for my wife than myself. While I enjoy the occasional drama/comedy of manners, this movie's plot of the reunion of four aging opera singers in a home is not what I usually buy or rent for myself.<br /><br />This movie greatly exceeded my expectations. It was warm, humorous, and even romantic. Even my mother-in-law, who doesn't like opera, really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Adapted from a stage play there are few alterations to the movie format leaving some puzzles: time seems to move with varying degrees, there are no apparent elevators in the retirement home as the residents seem to use the stairs.  The staff is small and relatives of the residents are not seen.  Beecham House is in danger of going under, but this point is quickly forgotten with more attention given to the characters than the plot. You will want to keep your finger on the volume control of your remote while watching this, as parts are hard to hear/understand--or turn on the subtitles.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of opera, you can still overlook it for an enjoyable movie.  The terrific cast and first-time direction by Dustin Hoffman(at age 75) are worth seeing. In sum, this is a great for the adult members of your family. The movie is funny and well done.  (There is nothing objectionable for kids outside of a little strong language, but they'd be bored.) Four stars.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Hidden objects hidden well. Decent storyline to follow, and the Bonus level / scene was a nice surprise ! Overall a great time-killer for the money. Will buy other games from this maker.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|... for this film and for others of the &#34;quick cut&#34; fashion. I have a bad habit of thinking while I watch; with these 6-second segments, by the time I've thought of what possible narrative element or suggestive symbolism might be intended, I've blinked/blanked through the next segment. It's a kind of Eurotropic &#34;manga;&#34; if you think you're following the story, you're probably making it up for yourself. Yes, I can indeed sympathize with the many one-star reviewers ...<br /><br />... but it's not THAT bad. It's &#34;impressionism&#34; applied to world affairs. It's a simple three-strand braid of narration by implication, in which there's 1) a bad guy whose heroic impulses are all too late, 2) there are fervent idealists with hopelessly bad ideals, and there are 3) corrupt despicable murderous cynical ugly-spirited baaaad guys, who of course will get their way up to a point. I'll let you, dear reader, identify those three plot figures for yourself.<br /><br />WARNING: Don't take sides! You'll lose one way or the other.

B002VPE1WK|2.0|I guess you get what you pay for.  I was excited to find this bag at such a great price and with such stellar reviews.  Indeed, there are many pockets and the main compartment is customizable, which is nice.  But the exterior stitching is of extremely poor quality.  The side straps that are supposed to hold a tripod started coming loose almost immediately and are at this point (6 months after purchase) unusable.  Last week I discovered that one of the straps holding the adjustable elastic band on the back has come loose all on its own (I have never even used that elastic band!).<br /><br />So far the backpack as a whole is still usable (sans tripod), but it looks like I'll be having to replace it in the near future.  Maybe I'll use this bag as storage.  Sigh.<br /><br />My advice: Pay a little more to get a bag that will last.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun brain challenge! I enjoy this game a lot! I thought this was going to be another stupid game but surprisingly it was!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|ok so if u like car games or racing type games get this. there's a ton of new levels and new cars. and the grafics are really good to. so if u like cars, fun mapsnlike the moon, or just the time where u have to get the gas and I don't lie it gets intence not like guns but your can start racing. that's why u should get it :) have a nice day! bye
B00124PXW8|5.0|I was more weirded out than scared but this was a fantastic movie. If your Catholic as well like I am, your faith will increase because this shit is real. The devil and demons are real in this world. Not here to debate however. If your bored and want a good horror or thriller film watch this and the effects are so good that you won't believe it was made in 1972
B00AALX5SI|5.0|Katy is a genuine inspiration to everyone.  I appreciated the movie for showing that success is not just dumb luck but a result of handwork, sacrifice, and perseverance.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the entire series! Hooked from the very first one and they seem to get better every time! This is my new all time series!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love how this show depicts life's transitions as well as the good and bad of tradition, progression and culture overall.
B000009HF2|5.0|Great CD. Did not take long to arrive, and sounds great. Lots of songs bring back memories, and this CD is full of them
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A chilling story told with compassion. Read in one sitting and transported to the complex world of mental illness, bullying and chilling crimes. If you like Criminal Minds, this is a story for you.
B00005M989|5.0|Great CD. Lots of great familiar songs I grew up with. The CD is also in good condition. Plays the songs as well as I expect it to.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I find that this app is worth its cost because it is ridiculously addicting. Not only do they take the classic build and upgrade towers, but they have actually added in TWO leveling systems for the game. One is for YOU, the higher your level, the more towers you get and the more upgrades you can purchase. The second is for the towers, you actually need to USE towers you may not like much, in order to be able to build those towers into something that is worth purchasing. This system, and the classic gameplay make this 5 stars all the way.<br />The only problem I ran into was that the gattling monkeys would turn to your clicking on another tower to upgrade it. So you would be taking a risk upgrading towers in the middle of a level when you have an essential gattling gun monkey around.
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|Great movie, funny, love Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, great movie to buy on Blu ray, a + amigos fo sho!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|game is fun but I would get the full version it is a great way to spend time and I would get the game
B000UR9QGW|5.0|The perfect mix of horror and comedy, evil dead II is the best!  Would recommend to everyone who like a bit of funny mixed in with their dead!
B001OMJGD0|4.0|Brandon Routh was clearly channeling Christopher Reeves' version of Superman and for the most part it works. He did a fine job as Superman and Kevin Spacey was great as Lex Luthor. I wouldn't pay to own it but definitely worth a rental.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Great set of 5 discs, a classic movie, love it on blu-ray!  Definitely would recommend this for all my friends
1607066017|5.0|I am only sad that I started this so early on in the series. Now I have to wait what seems like forever for each new issue!
B000H5TVKI|5.0|Action, guns, death, fighting for what's right!  Can't be beat, one of Sylvester Stallone's best movies, the beginning of the series
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it! sometimes there are pop ups and the game gets a bit glitchy but other than that it is a great game
0307346617|5.0|I thought it was fantastic.  I have not seen the movie as of yet, but, will take the movie as it is, another zombie movie that has nothing to do with the book.  Great read for any zombie fans!
147674355X|5.0|Hopeless is an incredible book that creates such an impact, it will stay with you for quite some time. Colleen Hoover has done an amazing job in creating an emotional and captivating page turner with a plot and characters that are sure to quickly become embedded in your soul.<br /><br />Hopeless is very unique and extremely well written. The plot has so many twists and turns that you are constantly left breathless and taken aback. Words that come to mind to describe this story without giving anything away would be, mysterious, dark, heart wrenching, devastatingly sad and extremely beautiful. The first mind blowing chapter had me thinking of all sorts of scenarios and situations that could lead to this point but let me tell whatever direction you \\"think\\" this book is heading, it will be nothing like you expected!<br /><br />I felt a real emotional connection with these characters; they were all so complex and damaged, burdening themselves with so many secrets and lies. Sky's character has so much strength to be able to love and trust after the hurdles she endures. She also shows maturity in the way she handles her devastating past and by making such vital decisions about her future. Holder's character was intense and I would love to know what he was thinking a lot of the time when Sky caught him just staring intensely at her. I really felt for him with the way his grief and guilt consumed him.  But hands down the highlight of this book was the passion these two characters had for each other.  The emotional exchanges, both physical and verbal, between them throughout the book evoked so many different emotions inside me.<br /><br />So even though this story was devastatingly sad, when you take away all the ugly you are left with a truly beautiful love story about two characters that are destined to be soul mates. It is simply poetic the way Colleen Hoover orchestrates destiny to allow their paths to intertwine, so their souls, unbeknownst to them, are drawn to each other in ways they cannot comprehend and once they discover who they really are, they never want to let go of each other again.<br /><br />So if I haven't made myself clear, I LOVED THIS BOOK! This book has truly touched me and I would proudly recommend it - It's a MUST read, for this book will emotionally connect with anyone who has a heart beat!<br /><br />I also look forward to reading \\"Losing Hope\\" the story but from Holders point of view, he was so mysterious and such a thinker I am dying to know what was going on inside his head!
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|As a Trekkie from the very beginning, this was a fairy good movie.  For me, Star Trek movies are more about the plot with action being secondary; Into the Darkness turned this around in a big way.<br />I realize action moves are &#34;the thing&#34; right now, but with Star Trek, the story line had taken precedence.<br />I think part of the lacking / wanting was the 2009 movie set a 'brave new course' for the franchise, but this movie just hacked ideas from the old series where it could've gone off on completely new tangents.<br />After all, isn't Star Trek about 'boldly going where no one has gone before'?
B000AM2L1O|5.0|We LOVE this little doll. My 2 and 4 year olds each have one, and it is by far their favorite baby.  This doll withstands the love of being carried, dragged and squished, and is still in good shape.  The size is perfect for little hands and arms to carry.  My only complaint is the cost of doll clothes for her, but we found some stores on etsy to get clothes for her that are a reasonable price. She is a great first dolly!
B00846WWVM|4.0|My boys really enjoy this game because they pretend they are firemen spraying a fire out.  They don't usually play it for very long, which I also like.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have read all three, and enjoyed the first two. I read the first two in the less then 2 day. It took me two weeks to get this one read. I wish I would not have wasted my money. I will not be read anymore of these books. Day did not know when to stop, this book should have been the end.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|My 2 boys, ages 3 & 6, enjoy playing this game from time to time.  They like creating different ways to use the bridge & construct it.
0812550706|3.0|Ender's Game is a quick read. I am guessing when it first came out it was a big hit. Reading it in the 21st century, especially in 2013, you can tell that it is getting a little outdated. The Warsaw pact for example is something that may be confusing for new generation of readers, especially those born after the 1980s. I would have enjoyed the book much more if the Earth scenes, and Ender's siblings were entirely left out of the novel. The battleroom idea was cool, and the emotions of the protagonist as he dealt with bullies still applies to what many children still go through today. I do not know why some in the military suggest this be required reading? I did not find anything that could help with strategy or help one prepare and train in the armed forces. However, the novel does move along nicely, and this would be an excellent travel book to take with you on a road trip to pass the time. Also, the book will be a movie at the end of this year, so there is another reason to read it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Feels cheap,  but it works flawlessly in sharpening dull knives.  I have recently found an old w w 2 Kbar, dull and well in a really horrible condition, and this little sharpener fixed this blades edge back to paper shaving condition in about 5 minutes........so far 10 blades resharpened, and this product holds up perfectly.  The diamond rod is a little different to use but works well after some practice.  I will be buying another for my father's dull fish cleaning blade...how does he use that chainsaw...
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|Ian Gillan`s vocals are just as good as the first Deep Purple album he ever did, Steve Morse`s guitar work is great as usual, Don Airey is an excellent keyboard player and he has played with a lot of great bands as a studio musician too. These guys at their age are putting out amazing new music. Pace sounds great on drums and Glover is great bass. The whole cd is really good and my Favorites are Weirdestan, Above And Beyond, Vincent Price and A Simple Song.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|For a while I had the free version with a lot less on it.  I decided to get Pro and it's worth the money.  You can have several layers (up to around 17, depending on what size you choose).  There are too many brushes/pencils to choose from, and sidebars that make things easier to find.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|i love love love this movie very much,so funny .better than every movie i had seen in the pass ,
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the BEST books I've ever read.  Emotionally exhausting because I couldn't put it down!  I cried with them, rejoiced, laughed, got angry...and when it was over wanted more!!<br />Will definitely be on my read again list as well as a top recommendation to all my reader friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has great features. You can do a lot. It's just awesome. I recommend that you get this app.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I've read Khaled Hosseni's other two books which I loved.  He's done it again with this new book.  It's one I can't put down.  The characters are so well defined.  This book takes these characters through the years and across the globe and although I haven't finished it yet, I know that I've experienced a broad range of emotions in reading it.  So much so that there are times I've had to stop reading for a few moments just to recover from the impact.<br /><br />If you've read his other two books (or if you haven't) this one is another winner that I would recommend to anyone.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has proves again why she is the queen of suspense. She skillfully develops the plot and characters to keep you guessing who the perpetrator is. I couldn't wait to find out \\"who done it\\".
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Excellent combination of story and characters...casting is legendary and after my fourth viewing, the genius of it became clearer still.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It only takes two words to describe this game:<br />Freaking. Amazing.<br />The version on Armorgames was AWESOME.<br />And then they made it mobile.<br />Potential buyers, this game is worth it. It is basically the same as the PC version, but a little behind because they had to format it for tablets, phones, etc.<br />Worth the $2.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|While the risque factor was very high, the story itself got boring and lacked substance. Not sure if I'll worry about any further sequels.
B005LAII1C|1.0|Wow...what a disappointment.  Every funny moment that is in this movie is in the trailer.  The rest of the movie is the teddy bear and Mark Wahlberg smoking marijuana and acting like immature teenagers- and not in a funny way in an annoying way.  This movie could have been hilarious, but with the excessive profanity and slapstick stupidity the movie fails to entertain in almost any way.  We have a lot of movies and enjoy having a large collection, but this movie will be PURGED from our collection.  I would recommend borrowing or renting before you buy.  Save your money for something worthwhile.
1883217040|5.0|Very clear, informative, and with lots of example. All your questions answered. Must have book for all Jazz lover and practitioner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Been playing all night. I ride horses in real life and dig the game. Wish it didn't take so long to collect energy but Meh...
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|I've seen all the Star Treks.  This is a good film, but confusing at first as to when it takes place - after Captain Kirk or before Captain Kirk.  Once you figure that out, you are okay.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was disappointed by the ending, very anti-climatic. Bedroom scenes very juicy but overall a dull story. I hope the next book is more exciting.
B00005JKCH|4.0|All good when it came thorough the mail. I was then pleased with the movie I might get more movers.
B005K17RU0|5.0|They must have fixed the issues with the Fire app.  Works great on my FireHD. I use it everyday and don`t have any problems.  I love it.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Love this.  The puzzles are beautiful and the sound effects are way cool.  I have to recharge my Kindle more often because I keep picking it up to play every time I have a spare moment.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Allows me to read on my phone and take my books anywhere.<br /><br />It doesn't always sync to the &#34;furthest page&#34; read, but that's a minor thing.
0375812024|5.0|My 2 year-old son is now very interested in modes of transportation -- trucks, cars and airplanes.<br />He loves all of the Richard Scarry books and will ask us to read them over and over...and over.<br />&#34;Cars and Trucks and Things That Go&#34; is his all-time fave (he loves finding that Gold Bug!), but airport and Busy Busy Town and close runners up. Other books cycle through, but he always goes back to these.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is an awesome written and very realistic show. I watched body seasons in a couple of days, thats how good it is. I can't wait for season 3. It starts July 16!!
B009GI8J1O|1.0|This was not my style.  I thought it sounded interesting but to me it was just boring.  I got the audio book and listened to an hour of it without much joy.  I jumped ahead a few chapters to see if some of the other time periods my read different.  None of it sounded up my alley.  I just returned the audio book.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I wait until the prices drop before I watch a movie.  I heard some talk about this one so I was expecting something different and it is.  I'm glad I finally saw it but I don't think I'll be sharing with the grandkids anytime soon.
0743289412|4.0|The specific item had a torn dust jacket.  The other two books in the same package were in perfect condition.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Older movie, but excellent plot with lots of suspense!  Loved it!  Have been wanting to see it for a while since I've heard so much about it.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This is a true classic.  Acting was superb.  As time goes by, you can watch ths one over and over.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Yeeezus? whats that supposed to mean? Is that what you said after you listened to it? but couldnt pronounce 'Jesus' b/c you were so messed up? Probably.<br />It doesnt get any worse than this. I know this is experimental new wave stuff but man that was hard to listen to.<br />It sounds like someone is pounding piano cat from behind while he lays down the tracks.<br /><br />See ya Kanye, thanks for a couple of great albums at least. you suck now
B004XZR63M|5.0|This is a great book that I will refer to those around me. I am glad that it was referred to me. Financial intelligence will go a long way in becoming wealthy. Thanks for such a great book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Hard to put down. Keeps you guessing. Not predicable the way 50 was. Just as graphic but more realistic! I think the majority of people can actual relate to this story. It focuses on a lot of real feelings that readers and understand.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I like how it turns every video that isn't  HD  , into HD  for my kindle fire<br />Now  what I don't like , I don't like how after the 3rd video I watch , it stops and I have to shut down my kindle to watch any other  videos . Same goes for searching , after the 3rd videos , same thing , I gotta shut down the whole thing or it does nothing . These things have to be fixed it is enough for me to just use youtube mobile on the internet instead
B0000DEO90|5.0|Wings over America by Paul McCartney & Wings was fantastic . I have watched it severa times and will watch it again soon.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I caught the tail end of this on tv and laughed so much I had to buy it.  I already saw it twice!! I loved it and so did my high school age daughter.  Great fun for any age!!!  Can't wait for the next movie!
B00847KFDS|5.0|I bought 2 CDs, one for my brother and 1 for me.  We are longtime fans of his.  This CD changes up his songs a little, but he couldn't have chose better musicians for the duets.  I especially like the duets with Bob Seger, Brad Paisley and Dawes.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Great song, I need to buy the rest of the album.  Its got that right feeling of retro, yet the right amount of modern.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Found Imagine Dragons on Spotify and fell in love with their deeper, emotional and uplifting lyrics, along with their beautiful and moving melodies. From 'Radioactive' to 'Demons' they keep opening to their pain while seeing the transformation that happens in our darkest moments. Great stuff.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Extraordinary account of life in perhaps the most secretive nation in the world. Some of the tales are so shocking it's hard to believe it can be true. Johnson tells it in a way that is at the same time humorous and astonishing
B008N9AASC|5.0|Originally saw this in the theater. Was excited to see this on DVD. The incredible detail of the images makes this a joy to watch. It hits on social issues without words, using powerful visuals to tell the story. Definitely recommended! If you enjoy this, check out his other work \\"Baraka.\\"
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I could not get through this book, it was hard to read and the subject was not interesting to me.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It made me actually laugh out loud. I give 4 stars, and not 5, because the love story is predictable.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I was very pleased with this book.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a break from the norm.  Better than the tipping point.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|The Blind Side is a great movie for the whole family,which you don't find much any more. It is funny,heartfelt,uplifting,and has a good message. Sandra Bullock. Delivered a great performance,as always! I would totally recommend this movie...5  star cast :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A great, addictive game with unbelievable number of free levels.  I showed it to my wife, who doesn't like games and she is hooked. You must try this game!
B00BMQDM10|4.0|was a very good read and was never sure what was coming.<br />had a good twist to it and also made you sit back and think about how life really is
B005HSG3TC|5.0|My son got a Kindle Fire for Christmas and did not keep the box or any of the paperwork. His aunt cold not remember if it was HD or not. When you turn it on it does not say. So we order the case for the regular Kindle and it did not fit. I returned it and got this one for the HD and it fits great. He always uses it to sit it up to watch it. It was a very good purchase for the price.
B006H4DBA4|4.0|a very good read gave me a few laughs and enjoyed the book would recommend to anyone.<br />it lets you escape and have a good read
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I cannot put this game down!!! if you like to build then this app is for you!! very relaxing but fun! !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses!I have 2 at a ranch.This really entertains me all the time!:D but...<br />The gems are hard to get...they should have tasks that gives u gems!anyway ITS A AWESOME GAME FOR ALL AGES!!!!!!;D I love it.great for kindle fire!it is so awesome.<br />U can even have friends!well...see u on the game.p.s. kids and even Grandmas Will have fun with The awesome game.....MY HORSE
B00633W614|3.0|I didn't think there was much suspense. Some twists and turns but the over all story was predictable. Leaving us at the end with what was going to happen next was my cup of tea.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|Great family movie. My kid loved it. He watches it over and over again. I recommend this movie to everyone
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Purchased this for one song.  What a wonderful surprise to find that every song is a winner! What a voice.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app the graphics are amazing and its so easy to run I recommend this to horse lovers
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Purchased for one song and thrilled to find that every single song on the album is a hit! This is a great collection of wonderful songs!
0440423228|5.0|I am extremely addicted to the whole spectrum of Game of Thrones versions. While GOT fundamentalists may moan about how the HBO series and graphic novels differ from the book, I rejoice in the variations. Especially since it appears the series and graphic novel creators have made the changes specifically to leverage the strong points of their media, and have the cooperation of George RR Martin in making them.<br /><br />And with the long indeterminate gaps between the books, and year long gaps between HBO series, it is nice to have the graphic novel episodes to help dull the withdrawal.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|Sometimes CGI cannot save a movie.  I rented this movie when my neice and nephew came over for the weekend, because I figured even if I didn't get into it, they would.  When a plot is so lame that even two kids won't overlook it to marvel over the CGI, you know the movie is bad...
0800141806|5.0|I was at a HIV conference recently where this film was referenced.  I had never heard of it before and  I found it very interesting and insightful as to how people with HIV/AIDS were treated early on and all the misconceptions surrounding the disease.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked this novel especially for its unusual perspective. I would recommend it (especially) for parents and other adult readers.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Much more than a children's book, a short, intense period of a young boy's life (or dream?) in which he consorts with the neighbors who just happen to be the old gods of creation. Gaiman easily speaks the language of children, and still knows why they do what they do. A quick and enjoyable read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy taking care of my horse.<br />It is a great app when you are bored &amp; I catch myself thinking, &quot; I need to go take care of my horse!&quot;
B0050R0XEG|5.0|We got this for our son in law (birthday) and grandson (7).  They are enjoying it as a joint project that is complex enough to keep both of them entertained.  A good change from the more common Lego sets of fictional characters.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|Very creative and entertaining book.  A little bit hard to understand at some points, but a very creative idea.  Makes me want to read the sequel.
0517591812|4.0|I like to read in bed - this volume can crush your chest!<br /><br />I am a busy person.  therefore a couple days may interupt the story line and I lose the connections between families.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My family thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to anyone. Watching it through Amazon was easy and cheap.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|Of course, I had to read the final book in the series to see how it all ended. I found this one to be the least interesting of them all because it was so drawn out. Really, the whole book is about the last battle and some of the scenes just go on and on and on ...It all got a little boring. I wasn't about to buy the hardcopy and had to pay the exorbitant price for the Kindle version or wait untold months for the paperback to finally arrive. I wanted to finish the series, having just finished the previous book, so I paid the price, reluctantly.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was a great read and I was snatching every moment I could to finish it.  The story was not at all predictable and it definitely makes you think about how you survive when you don't know who to trust and sometimes can't trust yourself or your own mind.  Would recommend this book to others and you won't be disappointed. The mystery builds slow but is worth it.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|i kept reading and reading in the hope that something might actually happen. There was no story, it was just plain boring!  Very very dissappointing, a waste of good reading time :(
B00BHJ0MY2|4.0|I first saw this artist perform on Jools Holland &#34;Later&#34; and it prompted me to buy her cd.  There are some lovely songs .
B004EK926K|3.0|Amazon HD streaming was fantastic quality on PS3/projector.  The movie is a faithful rendition of the original story, but overall seems to lack a soul.  Many of the scenes looked simply made to wow the 3d-version viewers (can't watch 3d on Amazon streaming) and many of the more tender book moments felt plastic.  Some scenes would be quite frightening for young viewers, no doubt a strange experience for kids.  Not horrible, but far from stellar.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Very happy with this caddy! Fits my bj city mini perfectly and is big enough to hold my needs. It also has drink compartment to keep drinks cold for my little one and I. It even folds down with the pram so i dont need to take it off each time. Exactly like the sunshine kids one but cheaper. Glad I went with this over the baby jogger one :)
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Arrived as described and pictured. Nothing too elaborate or fancy. Works like you would expect. Not much else to say really.... For the price its a decent buy. There are tons of other ways to sharpen, many will do a better job but cost more. This is easy and compact to drop in bag, tackle-box, or drawer.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I don't know if it has a few bugs to fix or there is just a learning curve but sometimes I can't play instantaneously when I would like.  Otherwise this is a great game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The series of Percy Jackson was very well told, and Riordan takes Greek and Roman mythology too the next level. Told with a lot of humor.
B009GI8J1O|2.0|I will dispense with the book description as there are many already written.  When I read a book, I read it for entertainment.  What entertains one, does not necessarily entertain another.  For a book to be entertaining to me it should be a combination of great character development, well crafted writing, and a cogent plot.<br /><br />Character development was pretty good, enough so I had a decent feel for the main characters, although very few of the characters in this novel are very likable.  I don't need to like characters in order to enjoy a novel, but it's unlikely I'm going to love a book where I don't love at least one of the characters.<br /><br />The writing...well, the author certainly has a vast vocabulary, and he definitely used it.  I like big words, truly I do, I'm a lawyer, but if I need to go to a dictionary more than a couple of times for a book, well then it's just starting to feel like work.  This writer clearly takes his craft seriously, but in my opinion, he takes it a bit too seriously and simply gets carried away trying to write something so clever that it seems tantamount to literary masturbation.<br /><br />In addition to the authors need to prove his literary prowess, he has an annoying habit of writing entire paragraphs in another language without translation (usually french), and although you can get a gist of what he's saying through context I often feel like I do when people are whispering in another language next to me.  It's annoying.  I actually took french in grammar and high school, but it was not enough for me to translate what I was reading (granted I do not have much memory of french left).  In addition to paragraphs  in foreign languages, he actually makes up his own advanced dialects and vernacular that took me most of a character chapter to decipher.  Again, this seemed like someone who was challenged to do a PhD level writing experiment that made me feel like I was back in school again, and I simply don't want to work that hard when I'm reading.  I like a little challenge, but not one that leaves me wondering if I even understand what I'm reading at all.<br /><br />I didn't give it one star because the author has some talent, and I like reading something written in a unique way with some profound ideas...but I think the author overreached quite a bit and missed his mark by a long shot.  I would have gone so far as to give it three stars if there was a great ending that brought together the six separate plots into a cogent and surprising or interesting end.  That did not happen.<br /><br />If you are truly bored and want something that challenges you, then go for it...for me it was too much like work for too little result.ard when I'm reading.

B009HNDCC4|5.0|This show never disappoints! I haven't seen a single episode yet that hasn't cracked me up. I recommend it to everyone!
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|(Contains spoilers. If you haven't seen season 3, DO NOT read.) I can't say I'm as obsessed as the rest of the country with Downton Abbey, but  have still enjoyed the series very much. A story that starts in 1912 (right after the sinking of the Titanic) set in the \\"upstairs/downstairs\\" world of Downton, the home of the Earl of Grantham, his family and his servants, might not seem relatable to a contemporary American audience, but this is really a show about people. Wonderfully drawn characters keep you interested, led by Lady Violet, interpreted by the wonderful Maggie Smith, who's never been better (and that's really saying something.)<br /><br />(Remember what I said about spoilers:) The shocking death at the end of season 3 gives me pause, though. I look forward to seeing what happens after Matthew's death, but I fear Downton will be lesser without him. It's too bad Dan Stevens decided to leave the show. He will be missed.
B00000K2UX|5.0|if you loved the movie like I do than you have to have the soundtrack! cheep trick has a song on it that I just love called mighty wings,all the other songs are wonderful also.buy it,sing with it ,relive the excitement and thrill plus all the cute guys of this sound track of top gun!
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Damn you, Harlan Coben! I stayed up until 3am reading and had to get up at 5am. Need I say more?
0374214913|5.0|First, let me say that I struggled for a while on how to rate this book. I don't hand out five star ratings very easily. Usually, I only reserve those ratings for those books that make me feel like I was profoundly moved by once I finish the last page. So, when I closed Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, I didn't find myself swept to tears or reflecting on how the words of the book were life-changing for me. Instead, I finished it almost laughing to myself. To put this book under those restrictions would not be fair, because it can't live up to that. It's like blaming an orange for not tasting like chicken. Yes, oranges are great. Yes, chicken is fantastic. But they're not going to tasting the same (unless you hold a culinary degree in food wizarding or something), and you can't hold that against them. You have to expect different outcomes. The same goes with this book. So five stars for you, my book-friend!<br /><br />As you may have noticed already, the book is an extremely light read. My mind didn't have to jump through hoops to grasp what Robin Sloan was saying. It wasn't hard to make a image in my head of all the characters. (Side note: Please don't tell me I was the only one to think Penumbra was Asian! It really just fits, even though Sloan described a very clear elderly caucasian man.) The plot wasn't anything profound, and it didn't keep me up at night trying to figure out what happened next. So, for me, it's strange that I liked it so much.<br /><br />Despite it's lightness, Sloan writes with such ease that keeps you going from page to page. Before you know, you look at the page numbers, and you've already ready 59 more pages! All that comes because of great characters that are realistic. I sincerely liked every character that you're supposed to like in this book: Clay, Penumbra, Neel, Mat, Kat, etc. They were all so current, which is something Sloan can get immense credit for. This book almost seems futuristic, but no, it is all about today and the wonderful advancements we've made in technology. For the older generations, this book might be hard for them to understand, but as a 21 year old, I grasped everything because it's exactly what I use and do in every day life.<br /><br />I was like, Say what?! A printed book can mention Kindles without a hint of hostility?! And, Say what?! They can mention things that sounded in favor of e-book piracy and still get published?! You say what now? There wasn't any sex or much profane language?! I'll admit that it doesn't bother me that much when there are those elements in a book, but this was clean read. The most risque we get is people in their underwear in the same room as each other. It was nice not to have that be added in, although I think it would've been humorous to hear Sloan describe a sex scene. Who knows what kind of technology he would have brought into that!<br /><br />So, go. Read this book. It is one of the geekiest books you'll ever read. You'll feel so much cooler when you do anything on your Macbook or try to google something. It's hysterical, too. Oh, and if that isn't enough for you, the cover even glows in the dark. I mean, c'mon! Does it get any cooler than that?!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  Though I dont care for Cruise, this is still good.<br />Never heard of these books but I will look for one now.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Just pure fun for kids and adults. If they have made a better super hero movie, I haven't seen it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|One of the best games out there for phones and tablets when the servers are working well...latest revisions fixed all my problems, but at a cost to my previous efforts, like Fleetwood Mac put it, &quot;Oh Well&quot;...
B000MQPKVG|5.0|A sprawling tale of quick tempers, lust, and deception in the 18th century, Barry Lyndon is a truly magnificent film.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is a great addition to the magic community. It is fun and like most of the WoTC games plays smooth and full of knowledge!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|If it wasn't for Evernote, I would lose loads of important data.  I cannot emphasize enough how hugely valuable Evernote has been to me... and could be for you!
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|I first viewed this movie with my 6 children, then with my 10 grandchildren and now I like to share  E.T. with my4 great grand children and then I'll watch it for myself, by myself.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|No good guy vs bad guy. All characters are intriguing and keep suspense till the end. I also found myself rooting for either side at different times.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly TV series episodes are as good as the movie. Do not understand why it was not picked up for more seasons. You will enjoy this DVD set.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game pass your time with. One complaint. I got a score of 499 thousand and it somehow forgot I did it just a few seconds later. Total bs because I have the proof on my facebook wall.<br />Still a fun game though. Plus it's free'
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|This is another great album by Joe. He's been making hits for the past 19 years. This is a must have if you like good R&B.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love having this app. I use it at home and at the grocery store.  A must have for all Kindle users.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Tedious read.  Wasnt able to develop any true intrest in the characters.  Story ending kind of weak as was the entire 2nd half of the book.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is amazing. The. Puzzles are beautiful and very colorful. There are many different pictures to pick from and the animals were so cute and adorable. I recommend this for all ages.
0151003084|5.0|This vicious little book is simply fun. I read it for its graphic quality, and now hope one day to read it to my (theoretical) kids.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book for the first time 7 years ago. Its one of the few books ive read over and over and over and never get sick of it. There isn't anything about it I don't love. If Charlie was real I'd be in love with him. I like e-books and their accessability but I made sure I bought this book in its original form(I also bought it 7years ago before e-books) so I could hold it in my hands and feel the pages and smell the paper because I feel that's what Charlie would want. He appreciates things like that I think. Its a great book with a great movie based off it.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I ended up watching the shows first and then I started reading the books again.  The books are much easier to understand once you have a sense of who the characters are.
B000PMG16U|4.0|What more can I say??<br />It's the same stories, except in better pictures.<br />I took away one star for not having much special features.
1607066017|5.0|I loved this story and art in this comic that I pre ordered the second book.  Highly recommend it!  Please it is however a &#34;mature audience&#34; type of comic.
B009UWYFFK|3.0|it's a movie that I'm sure a lot of kids will enjoy, but not much for adults.  Kids may want to see it many times, but for adults, once would be enough I think.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I only gave it four stars because some of the stories felt a little pointless to me and I felt some parts were hard to follow.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|The really bad guys that need to die, die, and boy, do they get killed good.  Not that I'm always looking for happy ending, and of course, I'm not gonna expect stuff like that from Tarantino, I wouldv'e loved it if Dr. Schultz didn't end up the way he did.  That was a really cool character,<br /><br />As always, Tarantino always writes a good revenge themed story, and this is no exception.  I took away one star because I simply wanted something a little bit better for Dr. Schultz!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Nice game. too hard to get diamonds, because I am not paying to play.  but overall the game stays interesting.  Can be addictive.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|What more can I say??<br />It's the same stories, except in better pictures.<br />I took away one star for not having much special features.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Wow, how did I miss this movie??  I wish I saw this in the 80's when it came out...better late then never!!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Graphics, audio and true-black contrast very good. Quality of special effects was exceptionally integrated into the live action sceens. A welcome addition to my SciFi collection.
B0086213XW|3.0|So the main female character Margot, gets exuberant over a new found male. Since we all go thru the motions after years of marriage, when the newness wears off, she feels vibrant again. Seems like this movie is a tale of you may get what you want, but was it really worth it? Definitely a slow paced movie, but watchable.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Graphics, audio and true-black contrast refreshing. Special effects quite seamless. Widescreen version equal if not better than the original seen at theater. Overall very nice addition to my SciFi collection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game, just need more chips & lesser time between collecting them. The  Voices are wired for the different rooms.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Graphics, audio and true-black contrast very nice. Special effects quite seemless. Overall a nice addition to my ever expanding SciFi collection. Delivery was convenient and timely.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|Although action packed, this offering is not all that everyone is saying it is. Essentially what it is, is a pandemic movie that takes away all the human elements of the zombie horror genre into such an unlikely scenario and taken away the humanity, the gore or any likely \\"scaryness\\" from the movie at all. It's like Pearl Harbor, or Armageddon with none of the scares. It is so far away from the realm of zombie survival horror, it's not even funny. While entertaining I was in no way impressed with the superhuman abilities of the computer generated zombies? There is no evidence as to if they are alive or dead and they also have the ability to detect weather of not you have a terminal illness! Laughable. I have been watching this genre since it's invention and World War Z is no pinnacle to it. It's more like a footnote. Why is no one noticing this?
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Graphics, audio and true-black contrast very good. Widescreen allows me to see it as it should be seen. Equal if not better than when first viewed in theater.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game its kind of cartoonish but has realistic qualities twisted into it. I really loved it overall though.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Adds closure to my collection of MIB. Graphics, audio and true-black contrast are welcome surprise. Equal if not better format than that in theater where I first screened this episode.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is one of the best novels I've read recently...my book club chose it as a read and all of us loved it...the movie was great btw...I saw it before reading the book and both are well worth the time.
1577311523|5.0|Great read that will definitely open up your &#34;mind&#34; and help you have control in your life. Recommended for everyone to read!!
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is my album of the last year...saw her live a few months ago and she is so real, so normal, so talented and beautiful.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|Site is rather hard to search on.  When you type in your search, it doesn't give you a &#34;go&#34; on the keyboard to start the search and you are stuck.  Needs further tweaking.
B00633W614|4.0|I have read 3 of the books in this series and really enjoyed the story. The writing is well done and I really cared about the characters and what happened to them. I enjoy multiple generation stories about families and how issues in one generation carry over to the next if they are not acknowledged and change is not fought for. I recommend this series and hope there are more.

0375842209|3.0|Markus Zusak's main protagonists in \\"The Book Thief\\" are a 9-year old girl, Liesel Meminger, her young accomplice, Rudy, and a Jewish refugee, Max that her parents hide in the basement of the house where she lives in Nazi Germany during WWII.  The secondary characters are also interesting and include Liesel's adoptive family, her tart-tongued foster mother, Rosa, the mayor's depressed wife, who allows Liesel to \\"steal\\" her books, etc.<br /><br />I didn't warm to the story-telling style: I found the constant asides referring to future happenings and synopsis to each chapter halted the plot momentum and interest in the story.<br /><br />I loved Markus Zusak's \\"I am the Messenger,\\" and while this is a more popular book, I didn't fall in love with the concept and execution.  I liked that Liesel befriended Max, the humanity shown in sundry characters such as the Mayor's wife, the narration by Death, among others. But the setting of Nazi Germay is one that I feel forces tears and emotions so that the author does not have to do too much of his own work.  It has been done over and over, and I am not in the throngs (I accept I am in the minority) that like to read about it in fiction.  I have and do read the non-fiction accounts of this and other atrocities of this last century and of the horrific world and localised wars - they are dreadful in terms of their cost on human life, health and emotion.  Reading about them is like reading about one's own death over and over again, or sailing on the Titanic.  I accept that many others will not share my view; that is what it is - just my view.  I look forward to Markus Zusak's next book with great anticipation.
0062059963|5.0|[Full disclosure: I received a free print ARC from HaperCollins Publishing in exchange for an honest review.]<br /><br />I know there are some fans out there who are pretty irate at Maxon for what he did (or didn't do) throughout the book, but I'm more annoyed at America than Maxon.  Of course she has reasons for everything she does and they make sense at the time, but if I'm mad at anyone it's her for her occasional stupidity.  Well, I wouldn't say mad so much as slightly disappointed.<br /><br />At the end of The Selection it looked like America had finally decided to choose Prince Maxon, but in The Elite Kiera Cass turns things up a notch and throws and wrench into their easy going relationship.  The funny thing is, it didn't feel contrived because the catalyst was events pretty much outside their control.  Mainly, the rebels and the king.  Part of the reason why I loved The Elite was that we get to see a lot more of how Maxon deals with affairs of the state and how he gets along with his father, the king.  It gives his character a little more depth and the explanation for some of his out-of-character behavior at the end of the book makes sense.  There were little clues all throughout the two books, but Kiera Cass' big reveal connects all those hints together perfectly.<br /><br />Compared to The Selection, I actually enjoyed The Elite more because of the focus on the characters themselves rather than the excitement of the competition.  Since it's down to only six contestants, we actually get to know the finalists a lot more.  America has also matured and is really starting to consider how her feelings for Maxon may trump the terrifying prospect of being queen.  She does some idiotic things at the end of the book and although they're annoying at the time, upon reflection I can think of times when I did similar things.  People don't think everything through, so why should characters in books?<br /><br />I knew we'd be able to see more of these mysterious rebels but I didn't know they'd play such a significant role in the book.  They're always in the background, a sort of omnipresent threat hanging over the heads of everyone in the palace.  Although I can't say much without spoiling the book, let me say that because of their actions at the end of The Elite I think they'll play an even greater part in the final book in the trilogy, The One.<br /><br />I give this book 4.5/5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars for Amazon rating purposes.t I didn't know they'd play such a significant role in the book.

0525478817|5.0|John Green has a way with people. Incredible characters, heart-wrenching plot, speckled with intermittent giggles, and totally unforgettable. I'm in love with this book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A good way to spend some time exercising your brain. Overall enjoyable for all ages can be challenging. ,A fun game to play.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Amazing! I love this game so much, I can't get enough of it. Keep up the good work and I hope to see new things in store for me and all other players.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|This is always a great movie and I was so glad to get in in HD.  I was worried that there wouldn't be a noticeable difference between what I remember and the BluRay version.  This is NOT the case. Video and Sound are surprisingly better.  My only complaint is that my older model surround system cannot correctly decode the native audio; the sound was a little funny until I forced the BluRay player to reconvert the sound to a stream that my system could understand.  Looks like it might be time to upgrade!!!
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I ran out of lives and then it said a free gift of 5 lives but then it took my gold I'm never playing this game again. There always trying to get you to but something and I'm tired of it!!!!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|This is one of the occasions that I am very happy to purchase these items and services that help make my life and my family a very pleasant and comfortable, thanks for your soprte.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was a good book.It is filled with action and adventure. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.<br />The characters are so real! It's just that the main character, Thomas, is REALLY annoying and whiny... other than that I absolutely love this book.
B005LJITS0|5.0|This is one of the occasions that I am very happy to purchase these items and services that help make my life and my family a very pleasant and comfortable, thanks for your support .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app! but i dont like how you run out of gems so fast and a lot of things such as accessories you need to pay for with gems. but grooming, competitions, and being able to earn a foal is pretty fun.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It has been said that you can travel the world and never leave your chair when you read a book.  If a book is the passport to another world, then The Orphan Master's Son is your voyage into to North Korea.  But, because North Korea is a dark place, a reader should be prepared for that kind of journey before they settle in with this book.  If you are up for it, The Orphan Master's Son is a brave and unblinking examination of life in North Korea that will leave you with so many things to think about.<br /><br />I actually loved the first half of this book and would have given the first half five stars. The second half was a bit too much for me--too much torture, too much pain, too much of too much.  But the book was masterfully-plotted and I can honestly say that the story is as powerful as it is painful.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl does a superb job of telling this story ... a wonderful piece of rock & roll history.  Great story, great vibe!
B002RGYGU0|3.0|This felt like a very cookie cutter book for Dan Brown, like many other reviewers have stated. It was a good book for a weekend away from home though- plenty of twists and turns and cliffhangers to keep a reader entertained during a long car trip, and I love that it was set in Washington DC- it's where I grew up, and it gave me the \\"warm fuzzies\\" to see the names of familiar places pop up.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|Both sound and video quality are better than the previous DVD which also had a negative of being on two discs.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|The jerky head movement of the driver reminds me too much that race drivers need to wear a neck brace, insult to NASCAR that the driver isn't wearing one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game. It is very fun to play. The only thing I hats is the coin prices on the game. The characters are very expensive to me. And you should be able to pick your setting. Other than that I love it. My brother downloaded two weekends ago. I have a lot of coins on it. Thank you for the great game!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Could have been more creative with the puzzles, either they were too easy or only could be solved with the help of one of those clue websites.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I would not pay real money for this, but the &#34;lost&#34; hours playing this engrossing game more than pays for it. Fun!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Well, its amazing! 1 pound of indestructible material!!! I can't bealive the sharpness! If you are thinking to buy a really good survival knife , this is the one! Im very happy with it! Very nice handle and a great fabrication! I recommend it with my eyes closed!
B006YC74E8|4.0|I take only fun, for my own enjoyment photos with my Kindle FireHD, so this is perfect, especially for the price--free! If one is more serious, perhaps you spend more money.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It takes forever to download!! It's not worth it, it also makes your tablet slower. Really, take my advice on it
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I'm new to the magic universe but so far so good! After downloading and playing this game I'm thinking about building my own deck.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|good quality and great service I recommend it as good product. everything come complete and I have no complaints... good price
B00499QUK2|5.0|I loved this series the acting is outstanding and the portrayal of the character is not your usual Sherlock Holms.  I can't wait till the next season is out.  This is a great series with none of the foul language and gratuitis sex and voilence that is on TV today
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|The game is fun,addictive,and also helps ease your mind when you have too much going on. The only problem I'm having is sometimes I'll have 5 lives,and as soon as I start to play,the game takes all of them away...... Other than that it's a blast!!!!!
B002BJGYUS|5.0|I had another copy of this season of the Gilmore Girls but some of the disks were damaged and could not be viewed. This set works beautifully and the case is in great shape.  I was pleased with how short of a wait I had for shipping. This was one of my best purchases from Amazon.
B0073PPXLG|4.0|Realistic depiction of the Battle of the Crater and the state of the Southern states during the war. Renee Zellweger won a very-deserved Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Jude Law was okay, Nicole Kidman was too old for the role but did okay.
B00AWE9TCE|1.0|Thanks to a reviewer for a different Lego set, I was motivated to shop around. Target has a better price ($40).
B0043URV5U|5.0|Love his music, and I will never tire of it.  Nice selection of all time favorites.  Great memories!  Sounds great!
B001LM1456|3.0|This movie was not a huge hit in my house. The younger boys loved it, but mom and Grandma were not impressed.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|What a pure pleasure listening to Joe play &#34;unplugged&#34;.  He is amazing.  10 out of 10 on this one Joe!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I did not enjoy this book. I finished it simply because I'm not a quitter. I found the style of writing boring. Its almost as if the writer is trying too hard. In addition to the writing style I also disliked the story line. I found it so overwhelmingly annoying.  Yes people get married in Vegas on a drunken whim, however the long over analysis by the female character (forgot her name) of their current situation made her seem somewhat immature and for lack of a better word 'stupid'. Added to that I found the male character almost controlling....huge turn off. His idea of marraige without love like its some kind of contract?! Not my fave book.
B001IA46D8|5.0|Take That will never be &#34;hip&#34; like other pop artists (at least in the States), but the music is just as good (if not better) than many of the recently reunited bands of the 80s and 90s. Some great tracks on this album. Mind you, it may not be as good as Progress or Progressed, where I really think the team has come into their own, but still very good. Worth the purchase.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Great show but what can I say they have all been great I could watch them over and over and will
B003VYAVGA|5.0|not sure why this was never released in the states. great album. songs never get tiresome...even after a few listens. if you like pop music, this album is a must-have.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A film for all ages. Must see with your girlfriends. Although the setting or location was a little dismal but it didn't detract from the story.
B0051O8Z66|5.0|I've been on a real pop kick lately, so you could take this review with a grain of salt.<br /><br />The album (with its eight additional tracks to the original release) is pure pop confection. Many of the songs rank right up there with those you currently hear on the radio...<br /><br />And here's the thing, I was never a Take That fan, so I'm completely unbiased. I was surprised to hear that Take That isn't the same band they were in the 90s. Much more mature sound--not mature as in \\"adult contemporary,\\" but more fully realized as artists or as a band or whatever. I now proudly call myself a 'Thatter,' or at least that's what I think you call their fans.<br /><br />Pick it up. You won't be sorry.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The music was exhilarating, the lyrics were moving, at times funny ( Master of the House). Definitely should share with friends who like music.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Love the CD and her voice. All the tracks are very nice, and my only regret is not buying it sooner.
0152465073|5.0|I own the book and have given it to my grandson. It is a very simple book but is a fantastic teaching tool about people.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and pretty easy to figure out.  It would be nice if you could save your progress in a level if you can't complete it while part way through it.
B00975L81Y|5.0|A true return to form for Cradle of Filth, razor sharp riffs, intense vocals and theatrical presence bar none.  Check out the track Huge Onyx Wings Behind Despair.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game! The graphics are pretty good for a fps on a tablet and the story is pretty cool. Not to mention that the guns are even better! 5 *s for this game!
B003XRZZFM|5.0|Dimmu Borgir's best yet, awesome symphonic presentation, alongside some of the tightest metal riffs you ever dared to listen to.  Epic and boisterous, I can't stop listening to this and it has found a permanent home in my cd changer
B000NDIAWY|4.0|Brandi Carlile has an incredible voice.  I think 'The Story' might very well be one of the best songs ever, in any genre.  And the vocal on that song just puts it over the top.  Beyond that there are a few songs that are truly wonderful.  However, I would've loved to have seen a few other songwriters contribute, or brought in as writing partners to add a little more depth to the finished product.  Maybe Lucinda williams or a Steve Earle....then it would've been Classic.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|very fun I love the make-up and the dresses<br /> it makes you feel like your really getting ready for something speacial!Best game I ever played.
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|This is my favorite app.  My French comprehension has improved so much since I got this app.  And they are constantly adding more stations.  They always responded quickly to the questions I asked.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a very fun game and is my favorite so far.  I think you will love it if you love temple run.
B00BWTJ2WU|5.0|This is the first band from today's era that I really think sounds like a good classic rock band.  You can find lots of people saying some other bands are obviously influenced by Zeppelin, but until I listened to these guys, I never heard it.  And not that these guys sound like any other band in particular.  They have their own sound, but there's an energy there that I experienced that was similar to being a kid and hearing Zep, Hendrix, Sabbath and all the great bands for the first time.<br /><br />I'm really happy I finally heard of this band and I hope they stick around for awhile.
B006LG7GIQ|5.0|I watched this movie after reading &#34;Anne Perry: The Murder of the Century&#34;. I was fascinated by the true story and the movie presented the events in a way that brought it all to life. The casting, acting, directing was well done.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was a great book that I would highly recommend everyone should try reading! It was a great way to round off the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series!
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Wasnt sure where they were going with this story.<br />But once they got going it was kinda neat the way they<br />stuck to story. I remenber the book from when I was<br />little (40yrs ago) and the book showed beanstalk falling<br />on small farm house just like the movie
B007PS0DTI|5.0|Kate B. is as good as it gets in this movie and looks great in her outfit and the daughter introduced is very good and next one should be good!
B0039TD7PY|2.0|I love the first CD, however, the second does not play at all.  I would send it back, but I did not save any of the packaging, etc.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|Great monster movie, great special effects and Naomi Watts is as good as Fay Wray, was in the original movie!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Love Carole King.  Saw her being honored on PBS and was reminded of how much a I love her music.
B0051OZ28K|5.0|Nothing better than watching lovely ladies engaged in fight scenes, along with music, very haunting, but goes with the movie!
1451695187|3.0|The author's experience was believable, but not enough to be convincing.  There are many accounts of similar out of body incidents and his is enhanced by his credentials, which he spends quite a bit of time on.  If you believed in an afterlife before you read his book, you will be reinforced in your belief.  If you are skeptical, I believe the jury is still out.<br />A worthwhile read.
B000NPM50A|5.0|Great concert at Mandalay Bay great music, very exciting to hear all the different type of instruments and great music!
B000JIN3J8|4.0|I love Jane Austin books. I really enjoy period pieces like this movie. Would like to see more Jane Austin movies.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|I really like this app on my Kindle Fire.  It gives me a trash fix when I need one.  I like it better than the regular site.
0307271080|5.0|When a novel is recommended by Essence magazine and the author is interviewed on NPR , it is worth a look. I'm glad I picked this up. Not your typical love story but thoroughly enjoyable. If the beginning seems similar, it's because it was initially presented as a short story in an anthology of American short storiesa few years ago.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|When I first saw its trailer in the theatre, I thought it's interesting. Well, the movie was much better.<br /><br />The suspense was very intense from the beginning till the last 15 minutes. It vividly illustrated the term \\"breath-taking\\". Many times, I found myself briefly holding my breath because things happened so suddenly, quickly and terrifyingly.<br /><br />It also skillfully portrayed the word \\"chaos\\".<br /><br />The special effects looked so real that they made the film more chaotic and horrifying. They were done on a large scale. I had never seen anything like this before. For example, there were scenes from a chopper looking down on to the ground. I could see thousands of people being attacked by zombies. People were fleeing in panic in every direction. It happened to many countries. In another scene, I saw thousands of zombies piling on each other while scaling the border walls.<br /><br />Interestingly, there was no bloody scene. The horror was not built on blood. This made it's more distinguishing.<br /><br />Besides Brad Pitt, the acting of others was engaging too. For instance, in the last scene the actions of the people in the last building were believable.<br /><br />It also depicted family love. It's touching even though it's briefly done.<br /><br />Of course, it had many logical holes but they did not affect its entertaining value.<br /><br />The best thing about this picture was the theme. I thought it's \\"UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL\\". It subtly and yet effectively proved that nobody or no country could solve a global problem by himself or itself.

B00005JKGK|5.0|I bought this movie for myself and a friend, The cheapest prices ive seen for this dvd. Clean and perfect.
1442359919|3.0|I enjoyed, but it was not one of my favorites...I was a little disappointed, but I did enjoy - it's just not as good as say, 11/22/63 or Duma Key - those were great!  I hope they keep coming.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|The singing voices made an otherwise 4 star movie into a two-star movie and maybe even a one-star movie. Maybe I should have pressed the mute button before starting the movie.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I got it as FAOTD and it's really fun to create flowy pictures and send it to friends! Anyone can use it and creations are limitless!
B00B2166BS|5.0|I needed to recharge my Nexus 10 at a motel and this device performed very well.  It does work faster than other devices and the price is very reasonable.  Thanks.
0765348780|5.0|I'm a big fan of epic fantasy, and this fits the bill in every way. I have read the entire series, and it is wonderful. Erikson is by far my favorite author. This introduction to the series is slow to start, and you are guaranteed to be confused for the first 150 pages. Erikson drops you in a fully developed world and makes no apologies, but if you stay sharp and ask questions, you will be rewarded by non-formulaic writing and plot twists that, while not unforeseeable, can honestly surprise you because they take the form of real human development. This book is a humanist piece, where even the gods are not above skepticism, and of the friends that I have introduced to the series, more than half now rate it as their favorite.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the first mine craft game I got it is so awesome but I wish<br />Hero brine was in this game he is in the real mine craft but he is not in<br />This mine craft and on YouTube I saw a mine craft video it is<br />Called I saw hero brine in mine craft pocket edition and there is one.way<br />To change your skin in mine craft pocket edition
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Sorry, but I cannot rate this.  It has been a while since I downloaded it, but I remembered I did not like it.  I cannot remember why.  Sorry.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss does an incredible job imagining particularities of different cultures in this universe he has created. Additionally, this second installment in his Kingkiller Chronicle goes above and beyond his already exceptional standard of writing, which was showcased in the first book in the series. Amazing read
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I have always liked this movie.  When I first watched it as teenager it scared me.  As a 64 year old and after seeing sooo many times, it doesn't scare me.  I just like it.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Love this series.  Waiting for the next book!!  Definitely a page turner.  All three of the books in this series!! So good.
B00BHU261S|1.0|I watched this movie all the way through, hoping that it would be more enjoyable...it never did.  The movie itself was very slow and it was not at all what I thought it might be.  I thought it would be a story of Hitchcock's life, not the part he lived during the filming of Psycho.  The acting was terrible, even though I like the actors.  I would not recommend this one to anyone.
B001BWQWKS|5.0|This is a breath of fresh air, regardless of how many prior recordings you have heard. The world is filled with madness, and this CD is the antidote.
B00CEJ2H6K|3.0|Amon Amarth is the Call of Duty of metal: They found a formula that works, have refused to make big innovations in their formula because their formula makes them money (so they best not shake things up too drastically), and if you like listening to basically the same thing with each new album, you will enjoy a competent, if not slightly shallow and all-to-familiar, product. This time around though, the memorable and melodic layered guitar melodies, Amon Amarth's trademark, are generic and unremarkable on most tracks. The album is just missing that epic feel that infused older releases such as Fate of Norns and With Oden on our Side. I also did not like the mixing of the guitars and drums on this album. I'm not a sound engineer so I can't get technical with my phrasing other than it just doesn't sound as polished as their last few releases. I'm sure this change was intentional, I just don't like it.<br /><br />I expect a lot of people will have negative things to say about this review because I'm not stumbling over myself to orally please this album, but it's just how I feel about this release. And how I felt about the release before it (Surtur Rising). And the one before that (Twilight of the Thunder God). So put your pitchforks and torches down, internet. It's just one man's opinion. Who am I fooling? This is the internet.<br /><br />Thankfully the extra four tracks of the deluxe edition help to at least make something about this album memorable. The tracks are basically Amon Amarth emulating one song each from four bands who inspired them: Judas Priest, Motorhead, AC/DC and Black Sabbath. Each song is titled, played and lyrically themed exactly how each respective band would've done it. These are not cover tracks, they are completely original. Furthermore the fold-out artwork of the extra disc features the Amon Amarth logo written in the font of the aforementioned bands, which is clever. Why are these songs so good? Well they rock for starters. But mostly becauseit's AMON AMARTH ACTUALLY TRYING SOMETHING NEW.
B007RP4D5Y|3.0|This is performed and recorded very well, but it is also very self-indulgent. They are better live. The CD is for hard-core fans.
B00338QENI|5.0|I loved this book. It made me laugh and cry. It got me looking into the history of other people whom have been used and abused in the name of science!  Kristy D
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I'm not sure exactly why I like this show so much.  I am a big sister with BBBS, and I started watching it b/c it's my little's favorite show.  It's so far fetched, and THAT is part of what makes it so fun.  I find myself watching episodes on my lunch break.  On to season two...
8866137065|2.0|I love vertical planners. I've been happily using the Moleskine weekly vertical planner, but sometimes I would like to have paper I can tear off without carrying an extra notebook. I bought this planner mainly because of that feature. What I couldn't tell from the photos is that the daily pages only have appointment times on the top half of the page. The bottom half is just for notes/ to do list. Because the appointment section is so small, every line is an hour (rather than 30 minutes) and only every other line is labeled. So if you have an appointment at, say, 11:30, you have to write it all in yourself. This doesn't work for me. I wish planner manufacturers in general would provide bigger, more detailed images of their pages.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The Battery HD works well with my Kindle HD Fire. The look is mesmerizing and the information it provides is important and generally appears to be accurate.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|THE STORY LINE IS GETTING BORING. I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE ENDING OF THIS SOTRY... WILL SEE WHAT IS NEXT..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like subway surfers. And  my friends have this and say it's like temple run it's not even close you bit**es but I have to give this thing 5 stars.<br /><br />But these  Are stuff that I like...<br /><br />I like that u have to swipe to control<br /><br />And it's Free<br /><br />And there's MINIONS DESPICABLE ME MINIONS<br /><br />And 1 more thing There's other DESPICABLE ME MINIONS... Referee,<br /><br />Baby, Construction Worker, Dad, Mom, Ninja, Fireman, Maid and regular
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|**Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />While I'm excited to continue following the lives of Gideon & Eva, this book left way too much open ended and unexplored. I was disappointed considering how much I enjoyed the other two.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|It was okay. I expected more since the two main characters are amazing in everything else....and the story kinda sucked...
B00C8985DU|5.0|I will say up front that I am a huge fan of Wings. I was nearly 13 when this album came out but I remember all the hit songs I heard on the radio from McCartney and Laine in the early to mid 1970's. The first song that had a huge impact on me was the Band on the Run single, I heard over and over in the summer of 1974. With this said this new release of the Wings Over America album is a very good welcome! The packaging and notes even include Denny Laine. The music is so great.<br /><br />So far this is the best of McCartney's remaster releases. Showcasing other individuals who played instruments and sang songs with him is always more appreciated by me - Wings is not just Linda and Paul. Like any other band whether the main song writer and singer was key for selling albums, the success ultimately is dependent on all the pieces for each record release. So let the other remasters and songs never released come out and show what Denny Laine, Henry McCullough, Steve Holley and Laurence Juber also did with a band called Wings.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|But it was amazing.  Gripping story.  Writing is simple, straightforward, good descriptions but nothing on the Lord of the Rings level.  I cannot wait for the next book.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|Still did not resolve the issue with my kindle. My Ipad and Galaxy S@ tab work just fine....Amazon needs to rethink the electrical connection.
0385349947|5.0|This should be required reading for men and women. It made me want to go back to school and get an MBA. There were plenty of facts and statistics, but not too much.
B00005J6T0|5.0|The cd has more songs on it that I like besides the one I was buying the cd for!  I just like alot of her songs!
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|This was heavy. Very difficult to even try to comprehend the world so many innocent people, especially children are living in. I thought this was such a great book because not only did it bring awareness to the prison camps but the struggles that continue even if someone manages to escape.  Escape is only the beginning...
B0006AAS5G|3.0|Beautiful watch I had to return because I am 5'11 230 weight lifter and it looked very small on my wrist
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I'm so glad a bought this CD its amazing. I got my fiancée into it also and we both cant stop listening to it. All I had to hear was one song \\"sleepwalking\\" and that was it. I went out and bought it asap.i highly recommend this album. Happy listening =)
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app would not load. After attempting twice, I gave up. I like You Tube--it's this app that I don't like.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|It says that you need update to log in but it said that heros of order &amp;chaos will update by itself but it don't
B0008KLVG4|5.0|fast shipping original item excellent movie ,great purchase<br />thank you so much<br />what a movie from the 80's watched it many times
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I've been playing other Mahjong games on the PC for years.  I got this on my Kindle Fire .  It's by far the best I've ever seen.  Only complaint is that it won't give me more trophys for 5games won.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Received fast. It was well packed. I bought it as a birthday present so I didn't open it or paly it.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|Worst app in the word so lame I don't like voyage apps don't buy it it's not worth the money
B0060YIBLK|1.0|I was expecting some genuine insights from an expert in the field - what I got were a few mildly interesting ideas mixed with long winded, self-centered, and ultimately not very insightful anecdotes. The author mentions Dale Carnegie's How to win friends and influence people many times, as he should, since many of his insights and observations have been more eloquently argued there. If you find yourself completely unable to interact with people, this book may give you some helpful hints to get started (smile! listen to them!), but for anyone even vaguely familiar with the topic, or with a modest amount of social skills, this book is a waste of time. The author does not strengthen his case by repeatedly citing evolutionary biology as an explanation for his strategies without providing any relevant links to actual research that supports his case.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|An Xbox 360 controller comes in handy for a lot of PC games that don't require a lot of key assignments, but for the bulk of them, it's so convenient to have a gamepad like this. It's a sturdy design, using your left thumb to control analog movement. I have small hands (VERY small lol) so pressing some of the keys are awkward, but I guess I can't expect it to be contoured to exactly how I'd like it. I bought it mainly for preparation for FF14 ARR, but for all of my steam games, it's worked well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a highly innovative and addictive game. One can sit for hours and play that game without realising how the time flies.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This show isn't art, but it makes for a nice diversion at the end of a busy day. The characters are engaging.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Real time killer and makes you think. When it's quiet time and I'm out of books to read, this is perfect.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Nice diversion. Not as much as gore as other crime shows. The crimes are interesting and occasionally very clever. The relationships between the characters have deepened.
B004G6TD3O|5.0|I went to the concert, and I always wanted it for my own!!!! THE PRICE WAS PERFECT! I AM A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is a great example of what app based games can aspire to be.  Well worth the price even if the game is not very repeatable.  I look forward to the sequels in the future.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|MY GROUP, AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT IN MY RANGE FOR THE CD FOR MY COLLECTION THANK YOU AND BYE!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is a very clean version of an all time favorite.  Make sure your kids see it, but warn them that &#34;spit-spat&#34; will not work in their rooms first!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|From the second Katniss volunteered for prim in the hunger games to the minute Katniss  exploded the arena in the75th Hunger games I just was dying to find out the ending to the series. You would never guess that prim would die in the capitol, or that Katniss and Peeta would get married and have two children. I would totally recommend reading this book!
B000AP04OM|5.0|This is a clean copy of an all-time favorite.  Many of today's kids have not seen this movie.  Have a sing-along party too with the extra features.
0061950726|5.0|I work in an office that records birth records and we see a lot  of  genealogy  researchers looking for records of orphan train riders.  The book gave a human side to a tragic time in American history.  Both good and sad things came to those who were on the trains.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|when I first got this app I had no clue what to think but now I can not put it down.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Someone sent one of these to me and I was blown away by the subject and the presentation. The logic presented was beyond reproff. Surf the available videos and get ready to learn
B00475AYJQ|2.0|Rothfuss' editor needs to be fired and go back to his regular job as a Wendy's cashier, or whatever.<br /><br />This book is a disaster. The good parts of it only make it more obvious how much of a disaster it is.<br /><br />Rothfuss suffers from the common new writer dilemma of not knowing how to properly pace, develop, and maintain an interesting story. He skips of entire events, but then proceeds to repeat the same boring minutia over and over again (see: all interactions with Will and Sim, all time spent in the musician's club, all time spent drinking and pining over his lost love).<br /><br />This book feels like some guy's fantasy about what college should have been.<br /><br />Nothing really happens that couldn't have happened much, much, much more briefly. The plot never really advances or develops in any significant way.<br /><br />And, last, but not least - at this pace this will be a 5 book series. Five books of droning on about the \\"Archives,\\" \\"Denna,\\" \\"Drinking! Lets get wasted!,\\" \\"Teachers suck!,\\" etc.<br /><br />Oh, and the main character is so full of inconsistencies and editing errors that is strangles him (i.e. ... he has the \\"ultimate self control no matter what!,\\" but can't keep his mouth shut to the rice guy who will fix everything .. even though he keeps his mouth shut at other times)<br /><br />Stay away from this book (and the first one), until Rothfuss has a new editor and a few more books under his belt. He will be very good - eventually.
B00CHRBA7G|1.0|For a classic album anniversary reissue Universal cheaped out on the vinyl pressing.  It's thin vinyl, dirty and sloppily pressed resulting in surface noise and poor trim work. Especially at a $27 price tag.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|Generally an OK book. There is way too much buildup to let down events, and way too much time spent on uninteresting characters and chit-chat. There is also too much philosophizing and moralizing. When did Fantasy writers become the arbiters of moral integrity? Just hack some people up, fight grand battles, and blow up stuff.<br /><br />The good parts ARE good, and so I trudged through all three books and some of the satellite books. However, I found myself skimming much of the 2nd and 3rd book, and large portions of the satellite books.<br /><br />Modern fantasy writing is starting to remind me of modern music in terms of only parts of the book being good. Maybe one day we can buy chapters a-la-carte the same way we can now buy songs a-la-carte?<br /><br />Anyways.... worth a read because they are \\"OK\\" books, and have some funny parts.
B004BEMC6G|3.0|I have seen this movie before and liked it, so during some downtime I thought I would watch it again via Amazon streaming.  Something is wrong with the sound, the low end was extremely distorted making it sound like my computer speakers were blown.  I had to stop the movie and watch something else (speakers are fine).
B00594XOZU|3.0|This is a great app BUT... the find friends you might know does bot work for me.  It keeps claimingbtheres an error.  Which keeps annoying me. I've grateful many different times and places. It won't work.  Fix it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book offers a clear view of events and life as the major countries clash in World War II.  Told on a very personal level from the viewpoints of 5 families, spread over several countries and circumstances.  Very well written and an engaging story of lives interwoven by love, life events and the world swirling toward war.  After classes in history which deal basically with dates and events, I finally have a much clearer understanding of the whats , whys and unfolding of events of WWII.  I have definitely recommended this to my book club and friends.
B00BD6RFFS|4.0|This book has used infogrpahics very well and explains the business model so well that you will start thinking to start the same exercise for your company.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The well written trilogy begins with the personal and fascinating stories of several people.  Wealthy, poor, educated or street wise... these families seem to have little or no relationship one to another, living in several locations around Europe, and the US.  They have interesting lives that soon begin to relate as the world around them plunges into conflict and finally World War I.  A great book that makes history meaningful and actually come alive, much in the way Follett did with Pillars of the Earth. (even think Downton Abbey)  A great story, and the delicious promise of books 2 and 3 that will continue the history lessons delivered with intriguing stories.  An enjoyable reading experience.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app - I have installed it on all the computers I use, plus my iPhone and Kindle.  I use it all the time for notes, to-do lists and rough drafts, as well as other things.  I'm still getting used to everything  it  does in the paid version.  Lots of handy stuff.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My son started playing it and insisted that my husband check it out. So he did and we ended up buying the game because it's kinda neat. Not as 3D as you would expect for 3.99, but it's still got some neat functions.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Book 3 does a good job of continuing all the storylines. Be prepared for more tragedy for some of your favorite characters. My only concern was the continuing tragedy. Do the good guys get to win, ever?
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I can't believe this is a new York Times best seller. The author is unimaginative with his writing style. It felt as though he was telling a story instead of showing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the size of this calculator.  It fits the entire screen of my kindle.  I feel like I'm holding a real calculator in my hand.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addictive, I didn't know if I would like it at first now I can't leave it alone.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album is beyond great. It has many electronic beats, and a small display of dubstep in &#34;Freakshow&#34;. Buy this album, it is awesome.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Gave it to my Father as a gift.  He watched a couple of times and gave them to my sister so her kid's could watch them.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|This is a breathtaking documentary to reflect on, to renew our way of carrying out in life on a daily basis. It helps us realise that we are not alone, but rather on the company of many beings here on Earth. All of them deserve our mercy and respect as we share the same land, water and air.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game. never would of thought I would be playing a game where I raise a virtual horse lol.  but I do; its a fun game
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I have heard horror stories about copying slides and had decided to send my out and have it done for about $400.  I kept thinking and thinking about it and just could not bring myself to spend that kind of money especially not knowing what was on the slides.  I found this at Best Buy for $149 and then on Amazon for half that.  I thought to myself, &#34;How can I go wrong?&#34;.  I bought it, it arrived very quickly and went to work.  I completed all of my slides in a minimal amount of time and then scanned all of my Dad's in very little time as well.  It is very easy to use:  insert the slide, wait a second, push the scan button, then the enter button to transfer to your memory card.  On and on.  I saved myself a lot of money and invested little time.  The only negative is the instruction book could use a little work.  Other than that, I'm extremely pleased and would recommend this to anyone who has a little time and wants to save a lot of money.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I liked the movie much better than I thought I would. The creators did an excellent job creating a prequel that answered many questions of the original Wizard of Oz. The movie was fun, had excellent special effects, and had an excellent story; which is not that common for movies in 2013. This should go down as a classic. Nice job Disney, hopefully another installment is in the works.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Well it is AWESOME but I do not  know how to work it my friend  told me about this app<br />His name is Joey he loves  this app
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Predictable? Yes, but that doesn't mean it's not terrific.  Plenty of smart, subtle humor that make it worth joining your kids for a second viewing.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I could not put this book down! Page by page was led by anticipation. An incredible read for all ages!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I've watched this movie over and over, I can't get enough! I've watched it at least 10 times since I downloaded it. Love it!
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Does exactly what it suggests! I first had a compatibility problem with my own EXCEL files, but I merely copied the info down into an Excel file from the program, sent to my e-mail, and loaded there. :) It's pretty amazing. I'm still hoping this is the Pro version?
B007N8RULO|5.0|One of my favorite games. I would recommend to everyone I know. Hope to play against others. Told my son the game is great.
147674355X|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. Lots of angst and a good love story as well. Never saw that coming!! It surprised me. I Stayed up all night reading this one! This one is the best book I have read of the year maybe ever! Colleen Hoover ROCKS!!! It is a definate recommendation. 5++++++ Stars
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Love playing very addictive. Could play forever. Would recommend to everyone I know. Would like to see a newer version.
0425263924|5.0|You should know ahead of time that there is more books to come. At least it wasn't a cliffhanger. Great romance
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so super awesome i love this game it's so much random clothes you should get this game it's so awesome
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great bingo game, highly addictive! Just wish I could get more daily credits.slots are fun too!  The different cities makes the game even better.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|My daughter and I rented this movie from our local library. She is 6. Both of us enjoyed Nanny McPhee &#34;Big P, Little c&#34;. Such a cute movie! I immediately ordered the first and second one on Amazon. Can't beat the price and 2-day shipping (which these came the next day!) if you're a prime member!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Makes you think. It's a challenge every time. Me and my daughter have contests to see who can finish first. Highly recommend!!!!
1490313370|5.0|It is a great book.  James is honest, giving, and uplifting.  Upon the inspiration of his book on publishing your own book, I will find time to write and publish my very first book even though I did not come to the U.S. until I finished my college, and English is not my native language.  It will be a challenge, but it will worth it.  Daily Practices are good recommendations.  I have been practicing eating two meals a day for about a year.  I have improved my health, and lost weights by eating two meals a day.  I highly recommend his book.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game. It keeps me busy for hours at a time. The only problem I think is that there should be more opportunities to get free credits without having to buy them.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|Each performance in this sensitive, moving film is superb. There is not a spare word or scene. It will remain with the viewer long after it is watched.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so cute and has amazing sound effects. The boss battles are entertaining and there's so many things wrapped up In one game. Definitely has more potential than Subway Surfers or any of the Temple  Run games. The only thing that could be a con is that since there's so much action going on at a time, the screen, especially for phones, will be crowded and hard to navigate. But if you have clever eyes and quick fingers, this shouldn't prove to be a problem. I highly recommend you to download this game. I have had no issues with it so far. A platform running treasure XD
B009949RKC|4.0|We recently watched Carrie for the first time.  Although it seems somewhat dated, it is still a worthwhile movie.  Sissy Spacek gives a fine performance as Carrie, a sheltered girl who grows up and tries to deal with classmates who bully her.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|You can get this game for free so there is really no use in spending your money when you can get it for free
B002BY625A|1.0|I saw the movie (multiple times) before reading the book, so I went in thinking this was going to be a wonderful journey - BIG MISTAKE!  I don't know how such an awesome movie came from such an awful book.  The book is so different from the movie and reading it was a pure exercise in patience and stick-with-itness.  This effort has soured me on trying to read more of the Bourne series.  The movie easily trumps the book.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|Wouldn't recommend it for younger than high school, but it raises an important conversation about what teenagers are going through and how our actions, positive and negative, can make a profound impact on others.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author is one of the most talented writers and like his other books this is a highly captivating page turner.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I avoid reading books about Nazi Germany time period because its so heavy and sad and difficult for me to comprehend and absorb, but this book captured me from the very being and really gave me an insight into the lives of people who endured that horrific leader.  It was written so well. Highly recommend for junior high and up.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Disturbing, but very entertaining!!!  I would watch it again! Plenty of action, romance and a disturbing look at a possible future!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I love the game but there are way way to many pop up ads so unless you really like pop up ads do not get the game.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|This is the best box set collection ever (; I highly recommend it if you love superman or comic book movie
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Half a book. With half the characters. Will read Dance and see if Martin makes it worth my while.  More to come...
B009NY43NY|3.0|Didn't like the war it ended. But now I'm glad the series I'd over. I feel the author was in a hurry to end it all. But I am ok with Sook and Sam getting together, that was cool.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The EBAY APP was easy to download, free and easy to maneuver through. It is also safe and a secure site.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app as I said in the title its the best app so far you don't need ne other photo editing app
B009AMANBA|5.0|I wanted to see this movie because I love history and that is just what it is history. This movie may not be for everyone because I found although very interesting to me my son thought it boring and lost track during the movie and really cannot remember. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is a history buff or is curious more about Lincoln.
0399162097|2.0|I wasn't quite sure what to expect, it was not this, that is for sure. Weird, strange, plot and characters. I am obviously missing something considering the rave reviews, but I had to finally just read the last couple of chapters. I am a little angry I wasted so much time reading this. It is not a quick read. Will not read anything by this author again.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I really like the Google CSE it's fast, easy & convenient & it was free to download to my Kindle. I love searching the internet & this makes it that more simple!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time! What a page turner.<br />Thank you William Landay
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|The Last Song is a romantic, funny, heart warming and touching movie all in one. You will definitely need the tissue box for this one and its a great family movie!
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I bought this in September of last year.  Long story short, the plastic housing is cheap and easy to break, a full charge lasts less than about 10 hours of continual use, it doesn't completely fit within the battery compartment and can sometimes rub your mousepad or desktop surface, and the crap positive (+) connector causes the dreaded random disconnects of which most not-so-Magic Mouse owners are all too well aware.  Save yourself the fraustration and just buy the Apple charger.  It's less money (surprising as it's an actual Apple product) and includes 6 rebranded Enerloop rechargeable batteries.  I bought the Apple charger 2 weeks ago.  The first set of fully charged batteries lasted 12 days and the Magic Mouse actually reports 100% battery life when a freshly charged set is installed.  The best you'll get with a freshly charged Mobee is 92%, and when that gets down to about 30%, if you need to continue using the mouse more than the next hour, you better have a set of AAs handy or you'll be SOL.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Looks nice - almost like an accessory that came with my iMac<br />Easy to charge - that is, as long as you charge it inside the Magic Mouse<br /><br />Cons:<br />Pathetic battery life - must keep a set of AAs handy for when this thing inevitably dies during crucial moments<br />Cheap plastic housing vulnerable to breaking near the latch<br />Junky + connector causes frequent mouse disconnects<br />Doesn't completely fit within the battery compartment and will rub mousepad or desk surface<br /><br />If overpaying for cheap Chinese crap is your thing, buy this.  If you are not interested in finding out what happens when your $70 not-so-Magic Mouse plows into a plaster wall at 85MPH, stay far away from this.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This book talks about the power of our mind and the role it has in shaping out lives, after you read it, the way you approach life would have been changed for the better!
B00BOX0K0M|2.0|I have always tried to use a filter for two purposes.  As a filter, and also as a &#34;sacrificial lens&#34; if my camera falls on some hard times.  First, as a filter, it worked just fine. But, when I added the &#34;action&#34; of an action camera to the soft plastic face and all I had left was a  scratched grey &#34;lens cap&#34;.  Very Poor Design!  I should have gone with glass in the first place.
B004E0Z4XK|1.0|not very good at all - almost sounds as if they had put something out to see if fans would buy it.
B000FA6720|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago and really loved it, so I figured that the book would, of course, be even better than the movie.  It was!  Very enjoyable, romantic and touching book.  A fast and easy read.
B005PK553C|5.0|I normally don't just sit around watching anything that cones on tv, but by far this show has kept me coming back for more! It's so suspenseful and mysterious! I love it!
B000SW2F6M|5.0|I thought this movie was a great depiction of what I would have imagined the Crusades were like.<br />All of the blood and gore in the name of my Lord and Savior- a great story indeed.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I have not had the chance to watch it yet. Probably tomorrow but my brother watched it and said it was real good. Love Bruce Willis.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I purchased this app previously and it did what it was supposed to do and then all of a sudden it stopped downloading videos, I deleted it and re-bought it and it still does not work.  Sad thing you just cant email amazon about the problem and re-buying it.  I would suggest you do not buy a kindle or this app.  Half the apps do not work any more on the 1st generation.  Go buy an I Pad or another tablet.  P.s.  Amazon is hard to deal with when it comes to the apps you buy and do not work.
0785168109|3.0|Everything is as good as other Marvel Art Books (I have all of them)!<br />The only thing they missed is the lack of the photos for each armors and description. If they can only show more prototype designs and different angles for each armor suits with explanation would make this book the perfect art book to buy...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like this game very much! It's fun and challenging! It's like hidden pictures but better! Can you escape is very addicting!
B005974CNA|5.0|I missed Mike Portnoy But Mike Magini makes the job really good,a drummer who hasnt been credited under the bands he play with,now he is the spotlight,good technical drummer,great album.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I really like this game. I am always playing it almost all day long. I have it on my  phone laptop and my tablet.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush is known to deliver a great album everytime,this is no exception to there legacy and how big they are,so glad they mad it to the hall of fame,this is a masterpiece of an album,i would say there concept record.
B00A83075M|5.0|BEST DISNEY MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!! ENOUGH SAID THERE! :)<br />The characters are absolutely adorable and really brings the audience into the video game itself!
B008Q08580|4.0|I wasn't expecting the movie to be on the dark side. I was a pleasant surprise.  I always like Ryan Gosling.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Generally I buy these types of albums and only like a selection of the songs.  There isn't a misstep anywhere on any of the music.  It's all equally fantastic.
B006LSZECO|3.0|As last year's leading novel, I figured I better read it. Wrong--it was okay but hardly anthing to go out of your way to look for.it has a miserable heroine--a jerk for her husband and ends up screwy. Wrong call on this one.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|The game handles well albeit a little battery hungry. Fun to play and looks good just need to update to allow android multiplayer and you get the five stars.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|lots of action and a great story line other than that I don't know what else to write about it.
B009R659L8|4.0|Once again she's written a book that I had a very hard time putting down.  I spent more time reading than doing work around the house.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This music typically isn't my cup of tea.  I listened to one of the songs, crystallize, on a whim and liked it.  I actually purchased the single, but then I started listening to some of the songs on the rest of her album and was completely blown away so I went bought the album also...<br /><br />My Dad passed away two weeks ago and I found this album played to all of my emotions.  Happiness, sadness, love, etc.  Best $9 album out there IMHO.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Kept me thinking throughout but it was a great book and definitely touched my heart. A must read Sparks book!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This story is more difficult to believe than John Grisham's other novels, but a good read. Would make a good movie!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Cool effects, but boring.  Didn't think the writing was all that great, but hey, I finished it so it wasn't that bad.
B008BM9L72|5.0|What an awesome trilogy, would have liked a book 4 because we want more. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've found this game to be extremely fun and enjoyable. It is challenging while not to complicated to play. I can't wait to play some more.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Very captivating. Great story line. Inspiring.<br />We know so little and we have much to cover. Not much time for an individual but not much time for mankind either ... to fathom his true potential.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I agree with Mr. Chapman, each person has their own language of love that speaks to them. Recommend this book for all relationships, friends, family and the significant other.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|wonderful movie with a fantastic ending. Totally enjoyed with serious messages that needs to be embraced in a day like today.
1619491486|5.0|Once again I was very pleased with the delivery, it is a new book which I am looking forward to reading when I have finished reading Sons @ Lovers
B00008IAMD|2.0|The music on this CD is outstanding but I was very unhappy to find flaws and skips in the CD.  The CD is cheap enough to replace if the flaws become too irritating and it's not worth the time or effort to return, but I definitely didn't expect flaws in a brand new CD.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|After such a successful string of albums it was fitting that Morrison wanted to take a break, go to France, regroup and maybe find his muse there. I guess he found more than that. Maybe he went on being creative on &#34;the other side.&#34;
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I enjoyed reading this from beginning to end. The author held closely enough to Jane Austen's style to make it feel somewhat like a continuation of Pride and Prejudice. She did a good job of keeping the mystery a secret throughout the story.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Its an amazing game..no doubt five stars but.....the wait for the update is killing me!!!!!<br />Plzzzz let the update come soon...im dying here.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is incredibly fun.. I have been playing nonstop since I downloaded it. definitely a good time killer and there are many levels and things to unlock.. I'm so happy I got it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the game. It was fun but it needs more levels. It isn't too easy but not to hard either!
6302787068|5.0|I was a little skeptical because of the low price, but I got it and works just great! I am so happy that I could get a Disney classic for this low price!
B00BAOVFZY|4.0|I'd give this 5 stars, but cannot because the narrator / audio speaker's voice is hillbilly and not enjoyable, in fact he is horrible.  i will never buy another audio book that he speaks in again.  but the story is good to great, depending on your interest in SEALs.  listening to this is worth the pain of putting up with the narrator's drab voice and inflections.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't read a book this good in really long time. I really have nothing negative to say about it. Without a doubt Suzanne Collins is master at writing. I can't wait to read what else she's written.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Starts out easy then gets more complicated. Needs higher levels. But it's a fun game. It's simply drawn and the puzzles so far are easy.
B0040HO01Y|3.0|I like movies of this period of time and location.  The characters were interesting but predictable.  The story line  was too slow and the caliber of actors was too varied.  I have only seen episode one so my opinion may change after I view a few more.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great Sigma adventure with bits of history, physics, philosophy, and religion intertwined in a moving story. Thank you for another great adventure.
B00007KWHN|5.0|For me, probably the best Yes release of all time. A great transaction including a good price, fast shipping and a safe, secure place to purchase all the items that I want-Amazon. A no worry site to feel comfortable to buy the things I want without worrying about having to go through an tedious process of possible having to return items since I am disabled and mostly bed-ridden, Thank you again Amazon
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Would recommend this to anyone. If you enjoy reading, regardless of the genre of book you normally read, you'll really love this one!
B000001F62|5.0|As I've written before, as a Moody Blues fanatic, It was so satisfying to be able to buy this online without the potential worries of having to send something back because of any defects-Thanks
B0094K1MH2|2.0|I made it through the whole movie, but it was pretty pointless.Some of the chase sequences were interesting to watch, but that is about it.
B000005RQT|4.0|Gillan, Blackmore, Lord, Glover & Paice really found their direction on this disc. If your Deep Purple collection consists only of Machine Head, this is another recommended addition.
B004TN7QPG|5.0|The options and the flexibility make this a great program for avid readers. I really like the options it provides for so many of the features that are built into the program. And the main reason I decided to go with Pro was the many formats it can read.
B009AMALLM|1.0|When films become a success, Hollywood always drags it down with sequels. Asking for ones or going another route and making a reboot out of it, that's how they work. Paranormal Activity is that, the first film was a huge success and then...3 sequels later, here we are!<br /><br />This one is bad, not scary nor is it believable. The acting is lame and even awful at times. Overall...2/10, 2 is pushing it!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. I can not stop playing it. Always sad when I don't have any bingos left to play!
B003Q6D282|1.0|Costas Mandylor really killed it for me since he was inserted into the series. He has nothing but a stupid face, he sucks acting and he is neither happy nor sad. I know what I'm talking about since I have seen him in the 90's series with Ice-T (Players).<br /><br />He isn't good and this film took a notch out of stupidity. Since #5 I have been lost and now adding Elwes back and killing the woman, Chester Bennington acting!<br /><br />This series although was rather neat at the beginning got to repetitive and uneven after the first 3. Hopefully though, Hollywood doesn't tinker with it.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|There have been several films over the years that have dealt with the actual attack that brought America into WWII.  I'm not talking about such seminal movies as \\"Here to Eternity\\" which used December 7th just as a backdrop for a story about people and relationships in and around U.S. Army life at Pearl at that point in time.  This story is about the event itself; U.S. Military intelligence and its then limitations & naiveté; Japanese planning and thinking, as short-sighted as it was!  It is an intelligent and somewhat thorough attempt to show, explain, and portray the why & how of what happened whereby the event itself is the central theme and not a parade of fictional side plots.  In its attempt it presently is arguably the best representation of that brief period of time up to and the attack - a chronological telling, of how it came to pass.  I believe it a fair assessment to laud it as good a visual presentation as \\"At Dawn We Slept\\" is a written account.<br /><br />The acting is for the most part superbly understated as was the maker's choice to avoid BIG-Name stars - unlike Midway, which by economic necessity unfortunately there caused the producers to detract from the consequential events.  In this the late E.G. Marshall and Marty Balsam, and in a lesser role James Whitmore deserve recognition as personages central to the actual flow of events, as well as several others including Joseph Cotton and the like in more-or-less cameo roles, and a host of fine Japanese & Asian-American actors.  Jason Robards, an otherwise stellar actor, interprets his role as Lt.Gen. Short somewhat flat, simply as a martinet rather than that of a career officer late in his career whom gets caught in the ultimate trap for military professionals: \\"Generals always try to fight the next war on the basis of the last one\\"- here with little or no appreciation of change,- technology & capabilities, impact on methodology, etc., especially that of airpower.  The \\"Peter-Principle\\" shortcomingof having probably risen beyond his summit of capability through no fault of his own.  (Where Admiral Kimmel (Balsam) was relying heavily on being told in near step-by-step detail precisely what to do, General Short became inexplicably fixated upon sabotage & subversion when there wasn't a single instance of evidence to support such!)<br /><br />Sidebar: What is curious is that the screenplay misses the (an) opportunity to explore - even superficially, the fact that in the course of the `Billy Mitchell Court Marshal' then Col. Mitchell laid-out in somewhat stunning detail how the \\"Japanese\\" would attack \\"Hawaii\\" at \\"Pearl Harbor\\" from the air at \\"dawn\\" with \\"no warning\\" and succeed at \\"sinking a fleet\\" using \\"airpower alone!\\"<br /><br />Tiger, Tiger, Tiger (\\"Tora, Tora, Tora) is the finest motion picture about the actual attack on Pearl Harbor yet made, well transferred to DVD - especially the audio, and well worth having - especially at the now-a-days bargain price.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am on level ten in this game and, for me who is not good at puzzle games, it has been a challenge to get this far. It has been fun but can be addictive, especially if you get stuck you may find yourself trying to solve the puzzle while you are sleeping. Try it. I think you'll like it....
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great way to pass time. Love all the free puzzles. Just wish there was a way to save puzzles mid way through
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love my horse CC and this game is awesome!!! it shows you how to take care of a horse and brings a child some responsability. its AWESOME
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is so fun. It makes me forget all my worries while I 'm playing. I like the colors and the layouts.
075669812X|5.0|Best book ever. Read this book and fall in love with this book. Buy this now. (Best book ever) I love it!
1781162646|5.0|Riveting, emotional, suspense and tear jerking. Couldn't put it down. Read in two nights. Tender, surprise ending. One of Kings best books by far.
B001EC3JME|5.0|This is my second purchase. The first case lasted two years. I have a Streamlight Strion LED flashlight and the case holds the light perfectly. Easy to remove and replace the flashlight. Top quality product.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Although I'm retired, I was able to relate to having the task of a career and family.  Not everyone can relate to this book because they had not reached the income or level the author has.  I too was called bossy as a child and was discouraged from being a leader.  In fact, I had to send myself through college and grad school without help from my able body family.  This book showed me the mistakes I made in my career as a manager.  I wish I had the knowledge this book gave early in my career!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I am enjoying the game, has continuous tasks to keep you busy. Easy to understand and play. Hoping it will continue to give points to expand.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This product does exactly what is designed to do, and I got it on sale for 8 or 9 dollars. I couldn't be happier with it. Plus an 18th month warranty seems great.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This is a great, funny, smart movie.  I love animated films that are suitable for kids, but keep adults engaged and delighted as well.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love this game! Worked perfectly, no glitches. Great wind down game with soothing background music. I've played all there quell games and love all of them! Not too hard or easy. Just right to make me stop and think and plan ahead.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|These veteran actors, along with an amazing supporting cast of musicians, artists, and the like, bring this sweet love story to life.  The music is lovely, and the scenery is beautiful.  I loved every second of it!
B00942X8PY|4.0|if you love to challenge yourself huebrix can help.From easy to difficult your mind will be throbbing from this spectacular game.<br />-Game reveiwer and lover
B007C7UZIG|2.0|I  don't know if the server is collapsed or something else but the confirmation email arrived 25 minutes later...it was a real pain activate the app in my phone, a Samsung galaxy s3.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|It seems this movie didn't do so well in theaters but I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  Without doubt, Arnold is past his prime but I still like to see him do his thing!  This was still better then End of Days.  Worth a watch with a buddy or just chilling along on a Sunday afternoon.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was one of my top 5 Romance books. It was very entertaining. I love the main character, she's very strong and gives Travis all he can handle. I also like this book because it's constantly up and down, and exciting. They argue, and they are a very realistic pair of characters. I was very impressed by this book, and want to read the other version that came out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game for the eye to mind. Thanks again and again and again and again and again. The only one of your life.
1781162646|4.0|Not your typical Stephen King book, but I really enjoyed reading it.......plus it's about an amusement park, the 70's and in NC, what more can you want?
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King does it again. Great story. Jake the main character takes you back to the 60's and plans to change history.<br />This story is one I will never forget.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I enjoy this.  I thought the soundtrack for this movie added a lot to it. If you enjoyed the series you will enjoy this.
1878424319|5.0|I love this book. I actually listened to it on audiobook and bought this paper copy for my sister-in-law for a graduation present. This book, while so simple, is so effective. It's just a beautiful book and life changing.
1603425381|5.0|This is just what I needed. I've look around and this fills the bill. It sits right next to my chair. I keep it very handy.
B006M4F67A|3.0|I enjoy the game but it doesn't reorient so I can charge my Kindle & play at the same time.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|We received our blu-ray on time and watched it.  The Spanish dub was well done and the picture quality was better than I expected.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Loved the characters and the writing was fun. To bad it ended so soon. I want more, will watch the movie next
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love every Sookie Stackhouse novel I've read and I've read them all.  I watch from Netflix the True Blood series from HBO and it's too bad HBO has to be as raunchy as it is.  The books are better because you can use your imagination to get the  results and not have to get so graphically visualized as the HBO series. Of course, I don't have to watch it either, but I do.
B000002H33|5.0|This was a blast from the past that my groomsmen and I used to play back in the day and was a hit as a gift for him. Thank You!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I'm 63 and I love Harry Potter, It's not just for kids.  I've read the series three times and I might read it again in a couple years.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 7 1/2 year old loves this, teaching her hand eye coordination.. So when she's aloud to play games this is one she always picks.
B006LSZECO|4.0|My former boss recommended this as a quick summer read.  It is full of twists and turns and leaves you wondering at the end....whaaat???
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This cover has no strap to hold it closed.  It cannot be propped up to view a video.  Not at all what I expected.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|Another warm Eliane Elias recording. You can always be sure you are going to listen to good music, fantastic piano and a velvet voice. I am never tired of listening to it again and again.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I had no expectations of anything except a great movie. However, I was NOT expecting the amount of cleavage and boob shots then back to kiddy themed movie. It didn't make sense.
B00C1CO0XS|5.0|I have just received my CD today and have already listened to it twice. It's not Nat King Cole's voice, but it's more jazzy! Niiice!
B00003CX8V|5.0|Years ago, this movie was recommended to me by a close friend. I was dumb enough to put off watching it for too long.  It's a gem. Shirley Maclaine is so fresh and gives a really poignant performance.  Plus, it's hilarious.
B001PB3RU8|3.0|As the stars show, it&#34;s all right. Nothing to write home about, a bit too noisy. But my daughter loved it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Unless you want to spend money this game will be slow but the graphics are cool and story is decent.
B001228124|2.0|A very mellow and laidback Madonna album. With mainly midtempo and fluffy love songs that have the ability put one right to sleep, hence the title; Bedtime Stories. None of the singles from this album represent it's true sound. The songs don't match, flow or align with one another; the entire production is inconsistent, not to mention the poor sequencing.<br /><br />An rnb song with mild hiphop flavor and unapologetic lyrics open's the album 'i'll never be an Angel, I'll never be a Saint, Im too busy surviving'. A song anyone expects to hear after a smash like 'Human Nature'. Then sadly we run into endless, lengthy, basic and/or dull winded-down songs about love. This is where I become agitated and resentful by what's clouding my speakers. The ultimate fail of the album would be 'Don't Stop'; a cutesy and basic pop tune that does nothing for anything else present on the album. It's basic, simple, amateur and bubblegum considering where her career was at this time; karaoke at it's best.<br /><br />Then there are songs like 'Inside of Me' 'I'd Rather be your Lover' and several others that overlap in sound; fragile and mushy songs about love, and suddenly you're smacked in the face with the cutting-edge kickdrum of 'Human Nature', an inyourface track that glamorizes the \\"b\\" word, it doesn't add up. The bigger question is: How does such a song come about in a recording session drenched in love ballads? Why would you even want these songs to co-exist together on one album? It's not making sense; which could be why this record highlighted no tours.<br /><br /> 'Inside of Me' and 'Take a Bow' would hit the mark as first singles .'Secret' is another out of place track omn the album. 'Survival' and singles like 'Secret' and 'Human Nature' are misleading and strange compared to the dominating sound of all the others. I expected Erotica with a groovier, modern hiphop/rnb twist and her usual pop elements, certainly not this...certainly not this...let the Platinum blonde hair and Hot red lips fool you, this album is not what you might think and Im mors than sure (because most Madonna fans are sheep) they will say its a fantastic album because its her..... Have your own mind.... Just saying
B008AK8FHM|1.0|According to Esquire magazine, this guy is a flat out liar.  Be warned, investigate before giving your hard earned cash to this guy.  $15 million in book sales, there's motive for ya.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is wonderful. It is excellent and one we can watch over and over again. This movie is super funny.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Thrilled to be able to download the 7th season from Amazon.  Netflix doesn't have it and i will not pay for Showtime anylonger.
0375869026|5.0|As an 'Auggie' myself, I was interested to see how Palacio would tell the story of a child growing up with a disfiguration, likely having no firsthand knowledge herself (based on the portrait on the back cover). Overall, I think she did a very good job. Auggie's life is greatly impacted by his appearance, and it affects the decisions he makes, who he meets, and the places he goes. Auggie just wants to fit in, have friends, and be known for something other then being the 'funny looking kid'. I think Palaco does a good job of explaining how that can be difficult in childhood, and how children are capable of great cruelty as a result of the need for popularity, as well as every person's ability to show compassion and acceptance for those who are different. Although some state that the telling of the story though the perspectives of secondary characters was unnecessary, I would have to disagree. I thought it was interesting to see how knowing Auggie impacted the lives of other people. Overall, I really loved this book.
B0054YH8DY|5.0|All the songs are those you will know and remember and love hearing again. Excellent harmony, of course and &#34;Bookends&#34; itself is a beautifully lyricized song.

B00B1E6FF8|2.0|From UNCLE RAY'S GUIDE TO TOP-RATED MOVIES,<br />by Uncle Ray Birney (\\"The critics LOVE it! -- should you BUY it?\\")<br /><br />OK movie fans, you've heard about ZeroDT's blasé attitude about TORTURE, blah, blah, all true, but so what? Enough already, with the depressing bull-preaching -- let's talk about ... What do you GET if you buy your Blu-ray and a bag of popcorn???<br /><br />Well, first of all, you get OSAMA. The Bin Man! 20,000 watts of the old BIN LADEN Star Power! This guy doesn't even have to SHOW UP, and you already got the premise for the so-called \\"Greatest Manhunt in History.\\" Forget The Joker in Batman! Forget Doctor Octopus in Spider Man AND the evil Emperor in Star Wars!! Osama's the Mama of All Super Villains.<br /><br />Watching the Binster read the Kor'an gave you chills, right?  The dude could read the Manhattan White Pages and make you mess your pants. Somebody tell Freddy Kruger to put his slasher-fingers in his pockets and slink on outta here -- America's \\"MISTER Nightmare on CANAL Street\\" just became the Star of his own picture.<br /><br />OK, so how're you going to tell the final chapter of the Osama story?<br /><br />Well, right off the bat, you play a few selected 9/11 Emergency calls to the Nine-One-One operators, from the poor victims in those towering infernos. You open your picture by playing those frantic calls -- over What? Over a freakin BLACK SCREEN!<br /><br />The screen is black so you can HEAR them better! (And, plus, it looks way more Arty.) And when you hear these tapes, whoa!! It takes you back. Back, back, eleven years back, to THAT DAY. Your guts start squirming around in your stomach and your blood starts pumping in your neck and your head. People are screamin for their lives, burnin up.<br /><br />This is the REAL reality show stuff. Then, the phones go dead....  911 operator says, \\"Is anybody there?\\" ... No answer! Silence.<br /><br />The Horror of that day!  Talk about your PTSD.  OK, suck it up!  Move on.  We're gonna get the Monster that did this, and we're gonna blow his butt all the way to the Muslim Kingdom Come!<br /><br />If we can only FIND the Bastard.<br /><br />So, OK, black screen, over. Next off the bat, we see an Arab-looking dude strung up with ropes tied around his wrists, and he's got blood and lumps on his face. Good. The dude probably knows where the blinking Arab Potentate, Godfather \\"Binny\\" is hiding out! Go, C-I-A! Kick his butt, make him squeal!<br /><br />We'd all have to agree: This movie is off to a flying start, and it's only, like, minute three!<br /><br />So, OK, Spoiler Alert! Now, some boring stuff happens. They torture the guy, he doesn't talk; they torture the guy some MORE; again, he doesn't talk. It gets a little repetitious, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />BUT, never fear, the picture has ANOTHER thing going for it -- Jessica Bleepin CHASTAIN.  Hottest Babe, 2012, hands down.  SO hot, she made the top \\"Professional Film Critics,\\" of the male gender, drool all over their keyboards.<br /><br />So, so far, the picture has two pre-dominating advantages -- JESSICA and OSAMA.  Beauty and the Beast.<br /><br />Is that ENOUGH to keep you sitting on the couch and eating your popcorn???  Let's find out.  After Maya and her teacher Dan torture the Arab guy, they go to The Office -- the dark, dusty CIA office in Wherever-abad.  Now the picture starts to bog down again.  You get a lot of bulldooky office politics, uptight CIA bureaucrats, who don't give Chastain the time of day.  They don't even seem to notice that she is the hottest freakin White Woman in all of Kissmybuttistan.  How did they even get their CIA credentials if they can't sniff out such an obvious thing as this?<br /><br />So here you got male-pig office politics dragging down the pace.  Then Chastain starts playing DVDs of torture -- very fuzzy.  So: Office politics, fuzzy torture videos; then, more office politics, and more torture videos. Then, a terrorist attack they didn't see coming! and more office politics.  The only thing worth watching here is Chastain, watching videos.<br /><br />Finally, they catch a Big Fish, named Faraj.  Now Chastain gets to torture a guy all by herself.  And THIS is where you begin to wonder if this All-American Beauty has any heavy-duty acting chops.  She has Faraj beaten up; she has Faraj water-boarded; she even has her torture-flunkies pour this thick brown stuff into a funnel they stick down his throat.  Yuck.  Even I was grossed out!<br /><br />But Faraj is tough; he doesn't squeal.  She tells her mentor Dan, \\"Faraj is still withholding, and that's using every measure we have.\\"  Finally she tortures him so bad, and so non-stop, that he dies of it -- offscreen, thank god.  We know this because one of the women in the office says, casually, like she's giving giving Chastain fashion tips, \\"So Faraj WENT SOUTH on you.  It happens.\\"<br /><br />And this is where, in spite of all that creamy beauty, Chastain is in WAY over her head.<br /><br />It takes a certain kind of woman -- a certain kind of person -- to do what Chastain does.  We're talkin about cold-blooded murder of the most hideous kind -- murder by torture.  The kind of person we're talking about here is vicious, tough, cold, fanatical, ruthless and merciless.  Crazy with ambition.  Charlise Theron could go that deep, Halle Berry; but not Jessica Chastain.<br /><br />After Chastain commits these heinous crimes, nothing changes.  You don't see it in her face, her attitude, the way she carries herself -- nowhere.  She just keeps truckin along, on that trail of clues leading to the Big Trophy -- Bin Laden in a body bag.  Chastain's idea of playing this demented CIA ghoul is to act like a college girl pulling all-nighters at final exam time.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  Chastain is still beautiful -- too beautiful, if you wanna know the truth -- something's off here.<br /><br />You people never saw \\"Picture of Dorian Grey,\\" am I right?  It's this old movieabout a handsome young dude who does a lot of sick you-know-what -- gets down with depravity; messes people up, so they wanna kill themselves; drinks, does drugs and generally wastes himself -- and still comes across as a handsome young dude!  Meanwhile, up in his attic, he keeps a painting of himself that gets uglier and creepier and more disgusting with every evil deed he does.<br /><br />Well, where is the \\"Picture of Jessica Chastain\\" that should be getting uglier and creepier, with every evil, torturing deed she does?  Why don't we see the Chastain whose soul is crawling with maggots???  Liked her in \\"The Help.\\"  But she doesn't have the chops to do maggots.<br /><br />OK, moving on.  Only \\"moving on\\" doesn't move so fast.  More desk-top gumshoe \\"detective\\" work.  Bull-hockey, bull-hockey, they find a picture of Osama's trusted errand boy.  Bullpuck, bullpuck, they get the errand boy's cell phone number and BORINGLY follow him until he leads them to the Holy Grail, Osama Bin-Bama's home-away-from-home!!!<br /><br />Send in the SEALs and wrap it up, right?<br /><br />Oh, we're sorry, you can't punch out until we give you another blood-pounding hour of bureaucratic bull-wash.  \\"Are you SURE Osama is there?  Are you REALLY sure?\\"  \\"Well, we can't torture anybody anymore, so we can't REALLY be sure, but the Redhead says SHE's sure.\\"  Blasé, blasé, yak, yak, yak, around & around the CIA conference table.<br /><br />FINALLY, the CIA Director tells the President -- it LOOKS like Bin Laden is REALLY there, so ...<br /><br />Unleash the SEALs!  Oh wait a minute!  Takes about another half hour for the SEALs to get warmed up and THEN ...<br /><br />Uh-oh.  Remember when this raid ACTUALLY went down, REALLY went down on CBS and CNN and MSNBC?  The real deal was two choppers full of the most pumped-up, most weaponized, adrenaline-heads, with night-vision apps up their butts VERSUS WHAT? A tiny fraction of Osama's Extended Family!<br /><br />The real deal was kinda like this: A pumped-up L.A. SWAT Team bravely blasts their way into a candy store in East L.A., to whack a sick, old, alleged Mexican Mafia capo, who's hiding in the back room.<br /><br />That's the blinkin CLIMAX of \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\"!<br /><br />So how does the director make you NOT feel like all your sitting & waiting was in vain?  Well, first of all, she shoots everything all GREEN and very fuzzy.  Like you're seeing everything through the SEALs' night vision goggles.  Sometimes she even makes the screen go black, so \\"realistic,\\" like the goggles fritz out and the poor SEAL is as blind as all the unsuspecting people living there in the big house.  Black screen -- SEALs whispering to each other -- scary stuff, very SUSPENSEFUL, so YOU won't remember this was the EASIEST job any SEAL Team ever pulled since they first crawled up on shore, what? fifty years ago.<br /><br />So.  One hundred and fifty-seven minutes of your time.  And what would this picture be, without OSAMA, without the high-wattage charisma of THE MAN in \\"The Greatest Manhunt in History\\"?  Without Bin Laden, you got one endless episode of \\"Cold Case\\"!  I'm telling you, the Emperor is struttin around without a stitch on his carcass -- ZERO!<br /><br />And you blew $15, maybe more.  Know who gets the Last Laff?  You guessed it -- ol' Ozzy Bin Lozzy.  That wily ol' Nut Job CHANGED THE U.S. of A. like no politician and no CEO could EVER have done -- turned this country into a humungous Chicken Shack, ruled over by Giant Mutant Foxes.  I swear he's cacklin away, down there, in his watery grave.

B007CKNX28|5.0|The quick review?  An outstanding album which you should RUSH out to buy.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Jack White's music and other projects, you will like this.  If you are not a fan, you *still* may find this an amazing experience.<br /><br />White covers several genres here (Rock, Motown, Retro, etc), but weaves them pretty darn seamlessly.  He still sounds fresh and has a musical voice that is rather unique.<br /><br />A must buy!
B008MM9630|5.0|Having fun playing this game. Just got started with it fun so far. Do run out of energy to fast.

B005544V6A|5.0|This is just one of those series that you can't help but be drawn into it. It has the people you can't help but love and the ones<br />you love to hate. I have to watch at least 2 or 3 episodes at a time. I am now in season two. It is so convenient to have Amazon<br />Prime and to have so many selections to choose from.

B00D2ZF24O|1.0|This movie BOMBED at the theater and they want $27.99 for it?<br />Smith and his kid must be thinking they can make up the money that was lost with this price.<br />Even $1.50 at RedBox will be too much for it!

0312427999|5.0|This is an excellent work of synthesis, drawing together many apparently disparate examples from the real world, and making a strong case for identifying the Neo-Liberals (as personified in Milton Friedman) as being a movement dedicated to oportunistic re-modelling of nations in the interest of the international rich.<br /><br />A lot of dubious nonsense has been written in the negative reviews of this book so perhaps it is necessary to clarify some issues that those reviewers have brought up in order to discredit this book.  The connection between torture and Neo-Liberal shock doctrine is in part a analogy though in some instances, especially in Latin America, the two have went hand in hand.  It is an analogy in so far that during torture a person is isolated, disorientated, de-humanised and subjected to cruel practices up to and including death.  A country that has suffered a natural calamity, or a political coup or war is in an similar position, disorientated, cut off from the wider world, and in the literal sense those members of that country such as left political figures, community leaders and trade unionists are isolated, tortured and on occasion killed.  I dont think this is too difficult to grasp, and I do think that the evidence Klein has collected in The Shock Doctrine backs up this assertion in a clear and powerful manner.<br /><br />One reviewer, who claims to have an interest in social justice, likens the book to \\"The Elders of the Protocol of Zion\\" on the basis that Milton Friedman and the Chicago School are being identified as a sinister and all powerful \\"cabal\\" that runs the world.  This is a grotesque distortion of Kleins well documented case which is that Friedmans ideas and his disciples Neo-Liberal dogma have been taken up by powerful interests, promoted by the think tanks of the wealthy right wing, have demonstrably became recieved wisdom in important international bodies (IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organisation).  That these organisations use disasters whether in politics and economics, after warfare or natural disasters as leverage to implement a set of policies, championed by the likes of Friedman and his ilk, which in normal times would be more or less regarded in the not to be touched with a barge pole category.  Klein convincingly proves that amongst the politicians who implement these policies, and the economic advisors who design them, there is a wide spread belief that these policies can only be implemented in times of shock when normal restraints are seriously curtailed and any real prospect of Democratic processes intervening is at a minimal level.  This isn't a conspiracy theory, unfortunately its a description of reality.<br /><br />Klein takes her examples from a wide variety of countries, from Latin America in the 70's through to the 90's (Argentina, Chile, Brazil & Bolivia primarily), to Russia and Poland, China and Sri Lanka.  The opportunism of the Neo-Liberals in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina, and the catastrophe that the U.S. visited on post-Saddam Iraq are also covered in detail.  The re-curring theme is a destruction of democratic institutions, the public sector and welfare spending in favour of a State thats function appears to be that of a trough for large private sector corporations to get their ample snouts into.  when natural disasters such as the Southern Asian Tsunami of 2004 and Hurricane Katrina occur, the Neo-Liberals have viewed them as a god sent opportunity for policies including the demolition of public housing, privatising public education, removing people from their homes and places of work and handing over the land to rich developers.  The actual people of the states in which these policies are implemented are swept to the margins while technocrats and their political collaborators run the show at their expense.<br /><br />Its not all doom and gloom, the final chapter gives some idea of how people and nations are resisting and in some cases have started to turn back the Neo-Liberal agenda and discredit the policies of the Chicago School, as exemplified by Milton Friedman and others, and take real democratic control of their lives at the local and national levels.<br /><br />This review gives only a very general idea of the merits of this exceptional book which I would strongly recommend to anyone with a real sense of the importance of Social Justice and ordinary people having a say in how their societies are run.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This application works well and I don't really have any complaints about it. I would recommend it to someone who wants a basic alarm clock
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Lots of things blowing up with Karl Urban, Morgan Freedman, John Malkovich, and Bruce Willis. What's not to like? John Malkovich was a hoot!  Loved Helen Mirren's character and was pleasantly surprised to see Ernest Borgnine pop in.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This is a good brief history of a great man, but the beginning and end delve too much into unlocking personal potential instead of going deeper into Tesla`s life
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Just too much of the 1980's Madison Avenue use of blood and violence in an effort to shock the viewer. It's an implausible story to begin with, but could have been interesting w/o having to hold your breath every 3 minutes while Django was blowing someone to the sky.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so awesome and adictive I can play it all day and night.this game could not be more fun.
B0064O927I|4.0|The detail of the watch is very cool, very different, to programme the hour is the most difficult task ever, but in result I´m very happy about the watch, very good investment made.
0439321603|5.0|Couldn't be any happier with this product. It contains added information on beasts mentioned/encountered in HP as well as new beasts.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I love this  book. One night I was up till midnight reading it. It is the best book ever. I love how it makes you think Katniss loves Peeta but then you think not.<br />This book would be suitable for people who are aged between 13 and 30 who like action adventure books and a bit of romance.
0545128285|5.0|Great little book to help supplement the HP series and bring added life to the story. Couldn't be any happier with this product.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was filled with unexpected turns.  No subject is off-limits nor is any character.  Can't wait for season 4.

B003Y5H54W|5.0|What a spin on the actual story.  I love it,  Such a great ending.  I knew that the wolf wasn't all bad.  situations could make a wolf out of the best of us.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for kids. Allows them to care for a horse and have fun. Educational in regards to how much work a horse takes.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|A thrilling movie from beginning to end.  The action was amazing and the plot was well written, easy to follow and believe.
1936608898|5.0|This book is easy to read and understand the concepts.  I have started the program and can already tell a difference in how I feel. I would recommend this book to anyone!
1451695195|1.0|i did not find the story convincing. it lacks substance and smacks of wishful thinking. the author could simply be taking people for a ride with his unprovable fantastical claims.<br />the reason why people return from a coma or whatever and then claim to know something about the afterlife make a mockery of god, and such issues are for detailed discussion with a psychoanalyst
B005K17RU0|5.0|Greatest weather app I have found.  Prefer Weather Underground on my PC, but this better for my Kindle HD.  Very cool.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Love this CD and all the tracks and I love Morton too and I love Morton and all his songs and did I say I love Morton?

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was actually better than the movie as expected and was an easy read for my college course assignment.
B004L49K20|5.0|I am pleased with how well this was packaged for delivery.  it's a good album, I just miss Andy Taylor being on there!  Simon's voice is wonderful, but Andy is needed for it to truly sound finished.  The quality of the album as far the conditioned described is great!<br /><br />Thanks a bunch, Suzette
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Totally could not put this down.  Gripping and super inspirational to know how this man lived all out in every way.
B006A9XRWI|5.0|i love when things come days before its expected to! and i love chet! its such good quality! gahh! this album! gonna buy many more vinyls from here with my next check
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I overall enjoyed &#34;Warm Bodies,&#34; and you will not be disappointed as long as you go into it understanding it's supposed to be a goofy romantic comedy and not a horror gem.
0345525558|4.0|Prepare yourself to enjoy this multi-faceted debut novel.  Read it for the joy of learning about the Victorian language of flowers.  Read it for the heartbreak of a flawed girl who yearns for lasting love.  Read it for the sadness of our broken foster care system.  The characters are emotionally raw.  Renalta sums up the theme of the book with these questions to Victoria, \\"Do you really think you're the only human being alive who is unforgivably flawed?  Who's been hurt to the point of breaking?\\"  This book will make an excellent book group selection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for more rooms. Keeps you thinking and your brain working! I will definitely keep playing as more come out
B007SGM084|2.0|I read this book because of all the hype surrounding it. I wasn't impressed with the writing or the storyline.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Storyline was fine, lots of crazy sex like the first two books. The characters tees are crazy passionate about one another and I guess I'm happy that Eva and Gideon appear to be together but let's see how long that lasts. The only annoying thing is how abrupt the story end.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It was fun at first but then I full in love with it :) I hope you like it as much as I do.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I could not put this one down. A must for Reacher fans.  One of Child's most suspenseful endeavors.  I have recommended this to all my friends.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game needs more levels, but it is fun and makes you think. I finished in about an hour, now I want more!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Not much of story here. And the computer generated scenes are not real enough. I think it is really overrated.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|If there's one thing I learned about Jojo Moyes after this and \\"The Last Letter From Your Lover,\\" it is that her storylines are powerfully beautiful and deliciously unpredictable.<br /><br />This book broke my heart all the way through.<br /><br />The characters are real, the storyline fresh and interesting, and the weighty subject matter given an honorable place in all of it. I wanted this book to go on and on! I could have followed these characters along for ages. Poignant and funny, it has skyrocketed to be one my absolute favorites. I literally held this in one hand while I did everything else -- cooked, fed the dog, etc. It was that good. I will eagerly await more from this author.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|This is one of those movies with a depressed person, where you go- do it! Just end the movie already.  Yes it had fun twists, but they were way in the end.  Painful, boring, torture.  Not recommended.
B003477DVK|5.0|Movie was very touching.  All actors were right for the parts they were given.  Skip was so funny at times.  What a tear jerker it became for me when Skip passed away.  You just grew to love him.  Would recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it yet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a real mental work out! LOVED every level! Problem solving at its best! CAN`T Put it down. Can`t wait for more levels.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Very fun movie with a very fun cast. It has turned me back toward watching super hero movies again. Well worth it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Everytime I play this game, I end up w/a headache, which is great 'cause it shows my brain is hard @ work! More levels, HURRY!
0385368267|5.0|I might be a little biased; I absolutely adore this book in novel form and knew that going into the audiobook.  But not my husband.  He had no prior knowledge of anything of the book and we listened to it on a trip in the car and he was in love.  The story is wonderful but in this case, the voices of narrators are what stick out.  They are perfect.  Absolutely perfect.
B000002KXV|5.0|Whenever I want to recapture my ill-spent youth in the eighties, I put this on and it all comes back.  Lovely, lovely tunes with with just that right twist of self-loathing.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|This is the most inventively twisted series I've seen in a long time. Michael C. Hall is perfectly cast in the lead role. I avoided this because I thought it would be too terrifying to watch. And it is. But I'm hooked nonetheless.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Queensryche was one of my favorite bands in the late 80s and early 90s but the last 10 years or so have been hugely disappointing.  I happy to say that this was a big surprise.  I might even go as far as saying this is their best album since the original Mindcrime.  Every song is great.  I was surprised when the split with Tate and thought that the band was done but this shows that they knew something I didn't.  Based on the other version of Queensryche that came out I can say they made the right decision.
1419705849|5.0|I purchased this for my Grandson, who is 11 yrs old.  He has the complete set of Wimpy Kid Books now.  He really enjoys them so very much.  I highly recommend this series of Books for young boys 9-12 yrs of age.

B008220AVW|5.0|Close-up view of Katie...great music.  Saw it at the theatre...wanted copy for home.  Kid does a great job juggling career, music and the wrong male companions.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Not a knock off and works seamlessly with both my PS3 and my Galaxy S3, can't ask for more than that for the price.
B0091REZMW|3.0|fairly entertaining game. if you have some time to waste. my main problem is the size of the scene being searched is so small that the items can be irritatingly difficult to discern.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS FILM. THE ACTION SEQUENCES WERE OUTSTANDING. BEST SO FAR.<br /><br />NEED MORE OF THESE TYPES OF SCI FI MOVIES
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!<br />Even if you are a girl like me you can enjoy this game :D
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Really fun game if you like war games.<br />This game is super fun in my opinion. I say you should definately get it for a free game
B008YRVW0I|3.0|This is like the exact Fishdom on computer but after a certain level it tells you you have to buy the full version to unlock 4 different aquariums and more decorations and stuff. I don't like buying apps that aren't free because if they aren't good then what's the point in wasting money? It's a great game, I recommend it but only for those who like to risk their money on games...otherwise you people could just play to that level and then delete the game...
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|I did not see Before Midnight but could follow this sequel easily. The movie is just the 2 characters talking while meandering through Paris.  For those who enjoy a good story and conversation I recommend Before Sunset.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Yet again, another fabulous book by Nicholas Sparks!!!  I have yet to read a book by him that I don't LOVE!!!!!
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|It froze while I was undoing something and it was frozen for like ten minutes!But super fun!I made some awesome creations with this app!I got it free though so it might be a better experience for you if you pay!I love it though!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The BeeGees have such a unique sound and I thoroughly love this 2 disc collection.  It is quality sound and makes my long drives much easier.  Such pleasant memories are conjured up when I listen to these discs.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love playing league of Legends, this is like league only on mobile devices love to play it when I'm in bed... League name I hope u like me...add me.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|I saw a slide presentation about this book on SlideShare and really liked the premise, and bought the book. I read the first few chapters but felt like the author was trying a little too hard to imitate the informal and irreverent tone of other authors, such as Tim Ferriss. He comes across as arrogant and a little bombastic, harping on his many failures and addictions over and over again. I feel like what he really wanted to write was an autobiography.<br /><br />I also thought the book's advice was very simplistic. It's basically New Age ideas mixed with self-help, and doesn't provide a lot of new ideas or tangible tools.
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|I have loved this group for a very long time! I think they are one of the best bands ever! I grew up with them and they are still going strong!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|the game is great.controls are great.but.. something weird happened to my kindle fire.I went online and the game exited the game????
B003WE9TU8|1.0|I was told by a friend that this was a great read. I personally could not get into it.  I found it too &#34;jumpy&#34; and really not flowing so I cannot say this is good.  Each to their own but I need a story to grab me from the beginning and hold me enthralled so much that i do not want to put it down, whereas i could happily walk away from this book
B00ACHXHII|5.0|Not much to add here as I echo most of the other reviews. I've been collecting recordings since the mid-80s and it's amazing the value that can be found in many of the recently released CD box sets. This one is no exception. Regardless of how you view what's contained in this collection, you are getting 15 CDs for the price of what you would have paid for 2 CDs 10 years ago. Of course value doesn't matter if the contents are poor. However, this is far from the case.<br />Although I have a large collection, other than the Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis, this release is the first time that I have encountered Silvestri's recordings. As other have pointed out, many of the recordings are from the 50s and some are in mono. Nevertheless, the sound is fine. And many of the performances are amazing. Highlights include Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique; Dvorak 7 & 8; Rimsky Korsakov's Scheherazade; Tchaikovsky's 4 & 5; Elgar's In the South and Vaughan William's Fantasia. Many of the shorter works-overtures, etc. are great as well. The Dvorak symphonies, in particular, are some of the best I've heard.<br />Highly recommended even if you already have multiple recordings of these works. I would also not hesitate to recommend this box to a beginning collector.

B00BS7HNTK|1.0|Saw  Zeros on a special with Old Crow and Mumfords. I love these guys. I purchase for a road trip. It is one of the worst albums ever heard. Quality,song selection and performances; Pathetic!! I tried to listen down and back. \\"tried\\"<br />I paid $9 bucks for one good song performed badly.<br /> Skip This one and go for Mumfords . It's terrific.<br /> Sorry Zeros, you are better than this album.<br />Also note there was a TWIN album  on site with EXACT same songs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I recommend everyone to read it. It literally brought me to tears
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I can't get the game to work on my Fire. It installs fine, the opening sequence plays, and then a screen that says \\"Loading . . . \\" with a game tip comes up, and that's it - things never progress any further, and I have to restart my Kindle because I can't access any controls to back out. Very frustrating.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It gets a little confusing but it's kinda cool how you actually take care of the horse. And you can get more.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|All of the Dr. Panda apps are great! My 2.5 year old loves all the Dr. Panda games. I think this is one of the cutest Dr. Panda games. My son plays it quite often, though he does have a bit of trouble with the escalator. It requires a circular finger motion that he doesn't quite have down yet. He usually asks me to do that part for him. Try out the free version and upgrade to the full version when you see how much your child loves it. Definitely worth the money!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|The game is a demo unless u buy the full version which is what I was  going to do until I learned it was 10 bucks, come on.  It's a kindle game come on this isn't blue ray or something.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a good basic alarm clock. My husband likes the bell chimes I have set as the alarm sound. I do wish there were more choices though. I do like that I can set it once and it will repeat on the days I specify without having to set it each night. I've been using it as my alarm clock Mon - Fri and so far it has went off every morning. I do leave my Kindle Fire plugged in each night so I'm not sure  how much it drains the battery. Overall, a good basic alarm clock without the bells and whistles.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|Lets face it, the main selling point for the movie was to have Jessica Alba (then in her early to mid 20's) swimming around in a bikini. That is basically the first third of the movie. Showing off her, the incredibly hot herself Ashley Scott swimming around, with lots of T&A shots. The story picks up as they discover concurrently a ship-wreak and a plane filled with cocaine. Of course the owners of said cocaine discover that the \\"heroes\\" know the location of the drugs, and the predictable hijinks ensue.<br /><br />There is not a lot of character development or great acting in the movie. I think Walker is better in this movie than he has been in any of the Fast & Furious films. Alba is pretty standard to what she was in Dark Angel and the handful of films she has been in. Ashley Scott and Scott Caan's characters are actually pretty unlikable, and pretty much the reason for all the trouble that ensues. Josh Brolin (pre No Country For Old Men fame) does a good job as the ultimate bad guy in the film. All in all, it is pretty standard fare for a sunken treasure movie.<br /><br />This is totally a movie that you know what you are getting going in. It is not an academy award winner by any means. There are great visuals (both of the landscape and flesh variety), and the plot is pretty easy to follow. It is a little long (clocking in just under two hours), but the pace moves fairly well. The features (if you get the DVD or blu ray) are pretty standard for this kind of movie. All in all, it is an ok way to kill a couple hours.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My  2 year old has every Dr. Panda app. They are all great for younger kids. Try out the free version and once you see how much your child loves Dr. Panda's Veggie Garden, upgrade to the full version and know it is well worth the money!
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Nothing memorable about it except that it was very colorful. You don't really connect with the characters which is unfortunate. Does provide something of an interesting back story for the original Kansas/Dorothy story though. There really wasn't anything too great about it.
B00CE379IM|3.0|It seems some people take offense at negative reviews so I will just say that I wasn't very happy with some of the changes they made from the book to movie. I was especially surprised considering the authors helped with the movie production. Changing hair color is not a big deal, but combining characters?
B00C1GBOU6|4.0|The rhythm section owns this album, and that's a very good thing.  It's Sigur Ros but with more muscle.  Yay!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Waited to see the movie until I read the book. Really good book and love the story. Had a lot of twist and turns so made it hard to put down.
B00BQ1D7X4|2.0|I'm a fan of Dirt.  I think the guys this time tried to cram too many ideas into each song.  I'm sure that's satisfying to a songwriter, but for me the listener, it comes off muddy.  I'm not sure I'm into the production on this record, either.  They're all fine musicians, including the new singer, who is no slouch.  I'm optimistic for the next record.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I love the movie. The DVD's come packaged in a booklet style holder.  You cannot remove the DVD's without pulling on the DVD itself thus leaving fingerprints.  Very poor designed DVD sleeve/holder.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is my first time reading this book and was surprised that it not only broadened my understanding of cetain biblical concepts,but wassurprised Icould even understand most of it.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|My son loved this movie. He watched this movie like 5 times in a row. He got up dancing to the ending credits. Great movie!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is a subject  I Idid not know much about so I am glad I had a chance to read it.
B004X75RK4|5.0|This is one of those movies that you don't really get tired of watching ever! I mean granted you know what's going to happen (just like with every other romantic comedy) but whenever your in the mood to laugh, this would be a great choice!
0670026603|5.0|I LOVED everything about this book and can't stop thinking of the characters--miss them already.  This book is on my top ten list for sure.  Enjoy~
B000ID37KO|1.0|the movie stopped and loaded over and over and over again.... not worth my money... couldn't finish watching, it was too painful to watch a 2 hour movie in 4 hours....
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was an enjoyable story; not quite what I had expected. I found the main characterter & the friend very interesting.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I always enjoy David Baldacci's books. This one was different but still excellent. Sorry that Sam Cole had to die. John Puller should have some more rewards for his effforts.

B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Better than the last one to me my family love the movie. love the willis he is great in every movie he does
B00133KHCY|4.0|The Amazon product details said that this would only play in region A/1 i.e. North America but the disc is open region so it played fine and I enjoyed it very much.  Good music, Dolby surround sound worth paying extra for. Passes a wet Sunday afternoon just fine.
B008220BP2|5.0|I like it a lot, This was funny and sweet got to love the dead. Worth the money that I paid for the movie
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|This is a good movie, but not a great movie!  If you love music and competition than you will enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love this game its not to hard and it is addicting i love it so much i suggest to get the app!
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Loved the cinematography.  Loved Martin Freeman as a young Bilbo.  I can't wait to see the next installment of Smaug.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Since the focus of Piper Kerman's prison memoir, Orange is the New Black, is well known, I will avoid repeating that here and talk more about the substance of the book. The novel is a humane look at the prison system wrapped in the experience of one middle-class non-violent drug offender. Kerman focuses on the fact that although people did bad things to get into prison, that the inmates are not all inherently bad people -- that there is a common thread of humanity that connects them together. She also is forced to confront the effects of her crime as a drug mule, not only her responsibility for her own incarceration, but also how her actions contributed to the terrible things that happened to addicts like the women she is incarcerated with.<br /><br />Anyone accusing the narrator of whining, narcissism, or self-involvement really doesn't understand the narrative that Kerman is trying to establish -- how she honestly felt when she first arrived (in which she IS less than introspective and feels like a victim), and then how she grew as a result of her experience as an inmate. The Piper Kerman of the earlier chapters is not the Piper Kerman who walks out of prison at the end.  This is an excellent memoir that helps to humanize people incarcerated in the U.S. prison system.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great script-well directed cast.  Perfect Summer Blockbuster: humor, action, chemistry, and great special effects.  If you like the work of Joss Whedon, Robert Downey, Jr or Sam Jackson, you will love it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Awesome game worth the free price of admission.Great for all ages give it a try. Five stars review all the way
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good app, entertaining, works well, not too hard to use. No complaints about it would definitely recommend it to people.
B009QU9X44|4.0|Americans will be fascinated by an outsider's view of American racism. The comparison with being a Nigerian in Nigeria makes this more stark.

B003L77G8I|5.0|I haven't watched this yet because I got this dvd to add to my collection of shows that we watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great and absorbing game worth the five star rating. Really tests the lateral thinking and gets the brain going. Recommended to all
B003FSTN5C|5.0|I haven't watched this yet because I got this dvd to add to my collection of shows that we watch.
B00BHMF578|4.0|After all of the buzz, I expected this movie to blow me away.  I definitely enjoyed it, but it won't end up in my favorite movies of all time.  That being said, my wife was on the edge of her seat the entire movie, so maybe I am an anomaly.
B000067FP8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie growing up. This was a great buy and it was fun to share this movie with my nieces.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I liked the book because I seen the movie and the book was like the movie!!<br />I picked the training because it shows how good th  book is..... an  it was good!!!!!

B00729GQ0A|4.0|I liked the book really well. The pacing of the story was pretty even. I like the character development. It kept my interest throughout.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|This book will change your mind about all you think you know about modern technology and the computer age.  Would recommend it to a friend.
1466311649|1.0|This volume has obviously been scanned from the original Dover printing and poorly.  The drawings are mere ghosts. No good as a reference as one cannot see the drawings. A complete waste as the drawings analysis are the prime purpose of the work and are missing!!!!!
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Arnold was not all muck and muscle in this one but he was still a bad a**.  I would not rate this as high as some of his films but it was not the worst by far.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Must read. Just get it. No disappointments. One of the best reads you will find at any price. Long and satisfying.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This game is so fun. Better than fun. I can't explain it.<br />  I text my friends, kik and my dad<br />Get this app or you will regret it
030758836X|4.0|I really, really wanted to give this book five stars. I love Gillian Flynn and enjoyed \\"Dark Places\\" very much. This book was truly good until the ending, which fizzled quickly. Other reviewers have stated the same. I think I \\"get\\" what the author was trying to state overall, but it would have been a five star high five with a better ending. Still...I'm looking forward to her next book.
B005LJITS0|4.0|I gave a 4 rating due to awesome special effects and the story plot well written and awesome acting from  Ryan Reynolds.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Most apps like this are much less functional then the website.  This app is better. Easy, quick, intuitive.  Just great, well done!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie and theatrical performance. I can see it 100 times and it still seems new. Love it.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|In typical Gladwell fashion, this book has the power to transform the way you think. His evidence is truly compelling and for the most part it's engaging. The one problem I had with this book was how many stories there were. He would start every chapter with a story--often a slow one, building up different characters and setting the stage, and then he would start another story, and another one. You would realize the points of the stories, but he wouldn't really spell it out for you until the chapter's end.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|Read the book, but the characters come alive in the movie. This is a classic and was mentioned in the movie - The Lake House with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|I watch it regularly and it never fails to provide a wonderful experience.  They are 2 extraordinary actors and the &#34;supporting&#34; cast is outstanding
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I think giving movies a &#34;star&#34; rating is enough.  If people want to write a revirw that's fine, bt most of us have better things to do that write a review.  This will be the last time I take the time to do this!!!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|You get what you pay for. I wish it had a deeper well for contact with the edge to hold it up. Otherwise its great.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I was looking for a quality wireless headset and I read a lot of sterling reviews here for this one. I should have gone to the forums before purchasing though because they are full of bad reviews. This headset drops signal CONSTANTLY! I actually timed it and for every two seconds of sound I get 5 more seconds of clicking as the headset drops and regains signal several times. This goes for music, games, voice chat, basically ANY sound received or transmitted. I would try it with my PS3 or Xbox but it's not compatible with those platforms.<br /><br />I bought the headset to use for Ventrilo and it did not work at all at first. I then found on the forums that there was a known issue with this headset and Ventrilo. They released an update specifically for this model which I installed and then the headset worked with the software but the sound still cut out constantly.<br /><br />Forums suggested turning off anything else with a wireless signal nearby including blue tooth devices, remotes, any wireless routers, even microwaves. I tried everything and the signal was still dropping at the same rate. Connecting the usb cable provided for charging does not change anything so it won't even work connected directly to the pc. Also the battery life is not as stated in the description. Fully charged this headset only lasts about an hour but maybe that's because it's constantly attempting to regain signal.<br /><br />I tried to return the product but my wife had already thrown the box away and Amazon will not take the return. If you do buy this, KEEP ALL PACKAGING MATERIAL as you will most likely want to return it.

1863514260|5.0|Dear Amazon,<br />Trish Burr has done an exceedingly good job of showing and explaining every<br />aspect of her craft. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who may be<br />interested in the fine art of embroidery, for the lessons or just to enjoy and<br />appreciate.
B00006FDCD|1.0|I bought the dvd...sat down with a bowl of popcorn ready to watch...come to find out...IT IS ONLY THE FIRST HALF OF THE MOVIE...i can not locate the second half anywhere...come on really...who does that?....so disappointing....
B00CF34B2I|5.0|No other games that I have played can top this amazing game. Has the best graphics and details :) this is a mus have game.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This is a cartoon adventure similar to Indiana Jones; nonstop action. Story is cute and light. I've heard of Tintin before this movie (in French class as a young kid), but it wasn't necessary to enjoy this movie.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It plays better on my kindle than it does on my ps3. Ive been waiting for a portable magic and thisbis the real deal. Not a watered down mobile version either.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I always like John Grisham books and this is no exception.  It did remind me of some of his earlier works and at times a little too much to believe, but overall, a very good read.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|I had heard about this game since it came out on ios,years ago it seemed. Was so happy to see it on amazon. A running game where you punch stuff along the way.....sounds weird, but it works perfectly together. Great work!!
159463176X|2.0|The first half of the book was very good and then it went down hill from there.  I was expecting a stronger link between the last characters and it wasn't there.  Plus there was too much detail about the doctor that didn't make sense to me as how it related to Pari.
B008MM9630|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Also I like that you can play online or offline. That makes it more convience for me at times. thank you for the games that ya'll create for Md and my children. Also they need to make every game either on or off line.

B008B68IUY|4.0|Like most young girls age 7-10, my daughter is crazy about Monster High.  She wants all the things that go along with the dolls, the beds, the clothes, the coloring books...well, the list goes on and on.  When I saw this Convertible, I had to get it for her.  We have some of the \\"Scaris\\" dolls, and this is the perfect accompaniment for them.  The dolls fit easily into the car, and it seems that like most other items in the Monster High collection, they will last as long as the children have interest in the dolls themselves.<br /><br />Monster High dolls are the latest hot trend for girls and having accessories is important to the kids, so for holidays and birthdays, it's Monster High all the way at our house.  Trying to fit a Monster High doll in a Barbie car doesn't work.  They are built differently than a Barbie and it doesn't end well.  (legs or arms get stuck and come off and the tears flow)  Don't hesitate with this item.  The response from the kids on how cool it is was a resounding \\"AWESOME!\\"

B00AO2P3GA|3.0|the game is a thrill it will take you to different parts of the world. The only problem is the amount of space it takes up. the best part to me about the game is the online multiplayer where you can face people from around the world.

0345803507|5.0|Rarely do I read books, and more rarely do I ever find a book to read that interests me and keeps me interested throughout. Well... this trilogy had me hooked from the first book of the trilogy!<br /><br />Obviously, you'd have to start with book 1 to understand the storyline thus far in the trilogy. But, I actually think the third book was almost the best of all 3. The plot is great- a total page turner you won't want to put down. And if you've read either of the other two books in this series, you'd know that it is an 'erotic' novel. There are some graphic sexual scenes... but boy does that make it all the better! Ana is still a bit repetitive with her thoughts, as she was in the first two books, but it seemed to be a bit less repetitive in this one. Her whole 'inner goddess' thing is still an issue, which did get a little annoying throughout all 3 books, but it doesn't kill the read if you get past it and move on to the better parts.<br /><br />Personally, I love how erotic and 'naughty' all 3 of these books are. There is plenty that can be left to the imagination, but the author does a very good job at really painting a picture in your head as you read. I really didn't want to put the book down and was really bummed when I read through all 3 of them in less than a month- they are THAT good!!<br /><br />I am REALLY hoping E L James will come out with a new series, similar in writing to Fifty Shades, with just a different plot. If you like romance, drama, thrills, some erotica, a little bit of BDSM & a good story line- this trilogy IS for you! I think this book, the third, was the best of the books in the trilogy. So if you have already read book 1 and aren't sure if you want to continue on- get book 2 and give it a chance... and if you've already read book 2 and are still unsure if you want to continue on... READ THIS LAST ONE! Book 3 made the trilogy, in my opinion. It put all the pieces into place and finished off with a very unpredictable but great ending. I really am hoping there will be more books to follow this!!!
0515123447|5.0|Well written & very descriptive. This was one book I could not put down. Cant wait to get the next one

1608871827|5.0|I have always enjoyed a good movie companion art book associated with summer blockbusters.  I liked the ones that Marvel put out in the past few years (I would give most of those 5 stars for the amount of art contained in them and the associated MSRP) as well as the ones Disney has put out for their recent animated films.  I find it interesting to be able to see the progress a certain design goes through from what it looked like in the first stages of concept to the final product.<br />I must admit, I was a bit hesitant about purchasing the Pacific Rim book, because even though this combines two of my favorite things (You got your Monsters in my Giant Robot movie!  No, you got your Giant Robots in my Monster movie!), the company that put this out apparently also published the one for Man of Steel (which I was also thinking of purchasing, till I saw all of the abysmal reviews).  I'm glad that I decided to take the leap and stick with my pre-order, because WOW!<br />It may not be as big as some of the other art books, but it is packed to the brim with giant robot and monster goodness!  There is a reason why this particular book is plastic wrapped, because if it wasn't, all of the extras would come falling out!  OK, slight exaggeration there, since the extras are secured on the pages by some sort of rubber cement.  Along with all of the beautiful color pages of the jaegers, kaiju, and sets (both concept pics and actual set pieces), you get all sorts of extras attached to the pages relevant to the extras.<br />I can only imagine the amount of additional effort it took in order to not just print a beautiful art book (which in and of itself would have gotten 5 stars from me), but to have inserts made of different material than the pages themselves.  Going that one little extra step just made those extras such a nice additional bonus.  Among the added goodies, you get what looks like trading cards of the two main characters, blue prints of the jaegers, detailed drawings ofthe kaiju, and notes that look like something an observer of the kaiju would jot down.  Oh, and I can't forget the full sized propaganda posters!<br />The only thing that I can think of that could have made this book even better would have been a cardboard slipcase to fit it in (just to make sure that the extras do not accidentally fall out), but that is just being nitpicky, as it already deserves 5 stars.<br />If the movie ends up being half as good as the art book, I will be a very happy camper this summer!<br />A very strong 5 stars (+ if I could make it go to 11).
B00946ZOT8|3.0|the hair was all messed up when it came...and it did not look like it does in the pictures.<br />I'm a bit dissapointed.
0425263924|5.0|By far one of my all time favourite series.<br /><br />I cannot get enough of Gideon and Eva. Each time I pick up the next Crossfire novel, its like re-acquainting with old friends. Sylvia draws you right in to the book. I was literally sweating through one specific chapter. This woman seriously has a way with words. As if like magic, I can feel the heat between the lovers as if Im right there in the moment with them.<br /><br />Fantastic author and amazing series so far. I CANT wait for the next book<br /><br />If your one of the few who may not have read it yet, then wht the hell are you waiting for . . . Enter Gideon and Eva's world now :)
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I adore this film. It's a monument to the power of great writing, casting choices, and directing. It's witty and sharp, but also has a deeply humanistic edge.
B007712XAU|3.0|This a great series - but, why is the &#34;background &#34; music so LOUD??  Especially when the dialog is so quiet? This spoils the pleasure of watching it. Otherwise I would have rated it with 5 stars.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Enlightened look at the truth about our diets and maladies caused. Exceptional and factual info on Celiac disease and it's many hidden complications . The real truth about so-called healthy diets and misconceptions of government agencies and many health professionals. Grains are not meant for human consumption as produced today. Just as cow's milk is not healthy for humans the facts and referenced data, case studies and results from Dr. Davis's work are a solid conclusion as applied to wheat. ( or what the agro-genetic Frankenstein's have created)
B006LSZECO|4.0|A bit drawn out, I guessed some of the next out-comes. However, it had very interesting characters and plot. I like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and that's awesome, plus tons of seeds, plus up to 10 players! If you get this app and blocklauncher pro and skin created and pocket inv. Editor pro work together like best friends. Trust me, I know!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie has something for everyone.  It is not just for the young adults.  It was quite amusing and worth the rental price.
0316056898|5.0|Tina Fey is hilarious, entertaining, and even insightful. It's a book you can't put down. Highly recommend reading this book!
B009NY43NY|3.0|I know that many people are upset with the ending of the series.  I will not spoil it for anyone here. I know everyone has their thoughts and opinions on how to end the series and who Sookie should end up with.  It is hard to please everyone.  However, I think Charlaine Harris did well and stayed true to Sookie.  It has been a good series and it was time to let it go.  Keep an open mind and say goodbye to all your favorite characters.
B00CNEVHMG|4.0|I got the HDtrax version a month or so ago and I own the Japan SHM CD and I think this version sounds the best.  I have had issues with Audio Fidelity versions in the past including Steve Hoffman's work but this is the best I have heard this.  It is not going to make you forget your audiophile recordings but I doubt you will find a better GF TO.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|First off, my tripod broke a little bit like a week after I got it, not necessarily because of a manufacture issue, but because when you put your phone in on the tripod the top part is attached to a spring, that spring can only move so far before it will snap off. I put a Galaxy in this tripod and that spring broke off. Luckily my phone is smaller than that Galaxy, so I just taped that top clip piece back on to the measurements of my phone and it works good as new!<br /><br />Using a tripod helps the focus of your pictures soooooo much, plus having the ability to set your phone or ipod down to take a picture is really nice.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|The start of the best show! One cannot start in the middle of this series. Have to watch from the very beginning to fully grasp the storyline. This season and every one after is a must have. Impeccable writing!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|A very heartwarming story about a truly tragic event that shows that Love never gives up.  Although very graphic, I thought that it was a wonderful movie for our family.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|Pretty much dead on arrival. Can not turn on the device without it being directly connected to the USB cable.<br /><br />Went to the manufacturer's website and they have the issue identified as if it was normal:<br /><br />Models E6/ E06/ FUJIYAMA--Can neither be switched on nor get recharged(or doesn't work without connecting to power supply).<br />[...]<br /><br />In my case it reads as: \\"In case the red light doesn't stay stable, it would be the problem of E6's  battery.\\"<br /><br />What a piece of junk. I was very excited for the product and I actually tested the device with the USB cable plugged in and it does the job but what does it matter if the it won't turn on by itself.<br /><br />Would not be surprised if there is a high chance of getting a faulty product again and again.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Suspense, good plot and easy read. Recomend for the mystery reader.  Baldacci was at his best when writing this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some floors are confusing but overall good. Keeps getting harder and harder. Ive had to really think on some floors.  Looking forward to new levels.
0553582038|2.0|In book 1, we are introduced to the characters and their conflicts. In book 2, the plot thickens. The first half of book three continues to thicken and then boom! Finally some meat is thrown to the reader.<br /><br />In book 4, a sad pattern emerges. Alas we have a return to book 1. We are introduced to new characters and locales and new plot-lines emerge. I predict book 5 will be nothing more than a long-winded bridge between slow roasted tension and the resolution that will inevitably come in the latter half of book 6.<br /><br />In short, not a lot happens in book 4.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think it was cool when you have to get the challenges ; but you should be able to three left or right and put more keys on the map!
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan so no big surprise that I have it 5 stars.<br /><br />I did like the new story design.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I am a huge fan of this, show, and the second season is recommended to anyone that like the show, even if you were skeptical after watching the first season, buy this one, because it does get better, and it is a lot longer than the first
B005VPRDAY|4.0|High quantum product.<br />Nivel packaging and vera reasonble prive.<br />Highly recomendable.<br />It is a vera good product firmo a vera good brand
0425263924|5.0|Way to go, Sylvia Day!!!  I can't wait till the 4th book comes out!!!  I love Gideon and Eva.  The storyline was very interesting!!!  Please hurry up and finish the 4th book.  I actually liked the books better then the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|We watched this in the theater, but our boys, age 21, hadn't seen it and we thought it would be good for them to see. They both liked the movie and helped them better understand the mindset in the time period it was in and where we have come from then.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I anxiously await the sixth issue of this series. I hope it is in the near future. It has been one of the best stories I have ever read.
B003L77G8I|5.0|The series continues to be very engaging and entertaining together with becoming deeper in the lives of all the characters.
B0002DXEPI|1.0|I can't even watch this DVD--not sure why I paid for it! I can't play this DVD on my computer without changing the time zone (something your computer only allows you to do a couple of times before it won't let you any more--never mind the inconvenience). And the DVD won't play at all in my DVD player, so there's no watching it on the TV. Not sure what to do with it now.....useless!!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Great series. Glad the network has kept the series going. Very entertaining and engaging to watch and find out the answers to the crimes.
B006TLFPKO|4.0|This also took a little long to get started but ended up being okay. I liked how kept you guessing if she lived or not at the end of the movie.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The marvel films have been consistently good and this one joins the forces together for a very entertaining view. We all enjoyed watching it.
0743270754|5.0|My husband loved the book, he doesn't normally read long books but he didn't put this one down. Great gift!
B005PK56TA|5.0|A well done keep you glued and guessing series! I have watched it a few times now and have enjoyed it each and every time.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|My husband absolutely loves this movie, he has watched it several times. The battle scenes are action packed and a good story line and great ending.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Who thought the end of the world could be this entertaining?  I am a fan!  What a great time I had!
B004SGWYW4|4.0|Have you ever watched a zombie movie and said, &#34;NO! You IDIOT, don't do that.&#34; Well, High school of the dead is basically that zombie movie, but the characters are a bit more competent. Throw in some teeny-bopper romance and there you have it. It is a pretty good zombie flick stretched into several episodes with more believable characters (which is not asking much considering the poor quality of most zombie movies).
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci does it again with a superb read!!  I look forward to many more books , than the two currently out.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love having weather report when you need it especially when traveling in unfamiliar areas. Feel safer knowing what is in the forecast and how to avoid it when possible.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I so hope for more John Puller stories , Baldacci has the most interesting characters.  Each book is a delight to read!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this because everything is a bit more stable.  Regardless of what the other reviews state, additional books are not stretching the story too thin.  I think focusing on the other characters will benefit the story because that is were it seems to be going.  The relationships between Cary and Troy and her parents will be interesting as well as seeing what happens with Evan and Gideon's mother and the red-headed psychologist.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm not much of a game player, but our young-uns love this game.... they like me to watch them play .... unreal how difficult it looks to me, but seems so easy for them.... so glad I gave them the okay to get this one
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|I love Tom Hanks and enjoy the past performances of several of the other actors, but I definitely did not enjoy this one. Not a clear story line, jumping around in time, I honestly couldn't keep up or figure out what was going on. I've had trouble reviewing this because I only made it halfway through the movie and what I did watch was totally forgettable
B000AP04OM|5.0|I looked a long time to find this DVD.  It is a very touching story and a must for ones DVD library.
B006PTL1QM|4.0|I loved this movie - the acting by all three actors is superb!  Very interesting story and in fact, a lot of it is factual.
1616550414|5.0|The book is hard cover and just over an inch in thickness.  It is a complete compilation of all the legend of zelda games.  The book covers everything from story plot to reasoning behind sketched and chosen characters.  I would recommend this to anyone whom is a fan of the Zelda universe.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the first time ever to buy a series to watch.  I hated it when purchased but would do it again.  My wife sits on pins and needles the whole time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Fun game! No glitches on the Kindle fire.  Kids can wash cut and style hair then take a photo. Thanks Toca Boca
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I'm not a big time reader but a friend recommended this book and I must say that I was wrapped in the story from the first chapter.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I enjoy the game and find  the challenge interesting.  I find that the game has replaced my day-by-day Sudoku calendar.  I would like to have the option of an answer available.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The author drags out the story so much, that I was bored and had to force myself to keep reading.  Just when I felt we were getting to the plot, it ended.  I'm beyond annoyed and probably won't buy the next book which will probably be the same dragged out boring read until the final book.<br /><br />Disappointing
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Call it chemistry. Call it kismet. Joe Bonamassa and Beth Hart were born for this. I have both of their collaborative efforts and although they're distinctly different albums, they are equally crafted and hopefully a mere taste of whats to come. I can't get enough of either of them.
1451696191|4.0|My neighbor girl was actually fortunate enough to have a couple parts in this movie which i have yet to see so i figured I would read this book first.  Not really knowing too much about the story line i picked it up and read in about 3 days while on vacation.  It's an interesting view of letters from Charlie and his struggles in school to fit in or understand what life is throwing at him.  It's definatelty more relatable to the younger generation..if it werent for its tie to Pittsburgh I probably would'nt of picked up this novel.
B00AGKH6D8|5.0|There isn't a genre on the planet that couldn't benefit from a healthy dose of &#34;Vitamin JB&#34;. Admittedly, I 'm a tad biased. I own his entire catalog, including all of his concert DVD's and would probably buy his album of children's music if it existed. What can I say? I love the guy.
B009X00E18|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It is very attractive and made well.  I would definitely recommend this protective case.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you have heard the hype about these books I am not sure they add up to all of it BUT I love any book that I can't put down and finish in no time at all.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|All of the weapons are replicated with excellent detail. The sound quality is amazing, although at times a little out of sync. I love the pinging sound when you eject the clip from the M1.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was very interesting. I could not put it down. It was written beautifully in a way that was easy to understand. What I found most intriguing was how the author was able to somehow put in to words his extraordinary experience. It was so detailed that I could practically imagine myself there too! Beautiful story that I am going to recommend to everyone that I know.
1583334386|5.0|If you want to learn why people fail to do things they know they should, or how you can increase your motivation and willpower, this book is a must. The author does a great job of explaining the material, the book is interesting and engaging. I originally listened to the audio book from the public library, which was so interesting that I just couldn't drop it; however, some lists of exercises, etc. probably work better in paper format.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the BEST GAME EVER!!!!:)<br />I would really recommend this game, 'cause it teaches you how to take care of a horse.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|great game .but I wish you didn't have to pay for more levels. and more avatars but it's still a great game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very entertaining. Very hard to put down. Enjoyed very much<br />Nothing more exciting then a girl kicking butt especially with a bow
0385340540|5.0|This turned out to be one of my favorite Grisham books.  I enjoyed his experiences in Italy and the long chase.  A very good read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have a really hard time waking up in the morning without multiple alarms. This app lets me set many alarms with many different options. I like that I can set it to math so I have to think. There's no snooze for me after that! My brain is awake, so I might as well be too. So glad I found this one.
B005EHNEDO|2.0|This isn't Wilco. I'm not sure what this is, but it isn't in the same Universe as A.M., Being There, Summerteeth, or Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. IMO Wilco ended in 2001 when Jay was dismissed and any record after the fact doesn't deserve to be labeled as such. I had some hope for this one, but alas, it's just more of the same mediocrity that began with Ghost. Jeff was the heart of this band (and still is) and Jay was the soul. And without both of those elements, it just doesn't work. It's terribly sad to see the downfall Wilco has undergone, but nothing lasts forever I suppose and they gave us some amazing records. I just wish they would find another name for this nonsense, because to call it Wilco is an insult to the brilliant albums that came before it.
B004JK61K0|5.0|This program is amazing. I purchased the Kindle even before it was released. I've owned it for over a year. My biggest complaint with the original mail program is that the text is too small. If you increase the size of the text then you have to scroll left and right as you read the email.<br />This application handles it completely different. First the text is slightly larger which is very nice. Second when you magnify the screen, the text is reformatted so you don't have to scroll left and right.
B000000WFZ|5.0|I appreciate Ennio Morricone´s music. Gabriel´s Oboe, the second music is wonderful and remarkable for me. Those who loves<br />good music also will appreciate this CD.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is about old people, all musicians, who live in a retirement home, somewhere in Europe. The setting is beautiful.  The story revolves around four opera singers who once performed as a quartet, who reconnect in the retirement home and are asked to perform again after many years in the annual gala, which is presented to raise money to help keep the home open.  There is a lot of comedy in this movie, but also a lot of sadness.  I recommended this movie to anyone who loves a funny (and sad) movie about music, love and second chances.  For me, this one is a keeper and I know I will be watching it more than once.
B009ANP48G|3.0|The 3d effects are good... Other then that not much to rave about. It's pretty predictable and a bit boring at times.
B001XUPF2O|5.0|What else can I say - I am a big fan of this trilogy, but IMHO, it has to have Christian Bale as Batman!
B006H5120E|5.0|Everything I thought it would be and better. Great quality and great 3d effects. Highly recommend this movie. Awesome movie!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very touching tale. Brilliantly written and hard to put down.  The author makes you feel like you know the characters in the book which makes the story that much more emotional.
B004529NLG|4.0|I would recommend this movie because of it's 3d pop outs! Other then that the movie is just okay. The story line is predictable.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|There are not that many shows that captivate me as Dexter has. Episode after riviting episode leaves you shell shocked. Simply love the cast. I am hooked!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I always love the Percy Jacksons series is packed with adventure and lots of action. I can submerge in the story and feel as if im actually there
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|As a Prime member this was supposed to be free. We stopped the download but were still charged. No way to cancel.<br />No way to watch Prime on our TV<br />Cannot review Lincoln -- never watched it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses. In fact horses are my favorite animals. This game helps my know how it is to take care of animals and pets. This game helps me know what it feels like to have a pet horse. I recomend this game to everyone who love animals.
B00BOXZAJ8|4.0|The visuals are incredibly stunning, as is the concept of twin planets with double gravity.  There is also an obvious parallel between our haves/have nots and the people in the film who live Up Top or Down Below.  When one falls in love with another, conflicts ensue.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Good game,  the right amount of difficulty, graphics are good, can't wait for the next one, hopefully it will be soon.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|For a lady in her early sixties, she still sings beautifully. This new album of solo numbers is excellent and shows that she is still very much a true entertainer and singer. My favourite??  &#34;When you really love someone&#34;.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Excellent game, graphics are superb, the difficulty is the right level even for my 13 yr old.  Can't wait to play again.  Looking forward to the next installment.
B00BWDJILG|5.0|Stardust, what a beautiful rendition. It has so much emotional information. I usually hate remakes of great songs. Loved this one.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|When Google decided that it didn't like Reader enough to continue (despite their protestations, I believe that decision was the fallout of internal politics), I tried out several alternatives, including this one. Of all the alternatives I tried, I liked Feedly best.<br /><br />Even though I would only give Feedly 3 stars at this point. I'm hoping the general landscape of RSS feeders improves a bunch over the next few months (and Feedly has improved a bit already).<br /><br />Depending on your own tastes, you might like this better than Feedly. It does have a similar look and feel.
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|so I don't get why this app is in the top FREE when its 1.99. also I wanted to try it put but cant.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I say &#34;well-written&#34; but &#34;compelling might be a better term. I originally got this book in response to a promise by the author to reimburse me, but I never bothered to apply for the reimbursement.<br /><br />A lot of the book is common sense, but there are a few counter-intuitive ideas there, some of which I view with some skepticism, but I might try anyway just to see if they have the desired effect.<br /><br />One of the things that I liked about the author is that he presented the difficulties of his past without whining or dwelling on them excessively (unlike the typical spiel of an internet make-money-fast marketer). And he doesn't claim to have all the answers -- just ideas. And he has *lots* of ideas.<br /><br />I would classify this book as &#34;motivational&#34; although I think it's a bit more than that. A lot of the &#34;motivational&#34; stuff out there lacks any actionable advice, and that is not a failing of this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book.  It was entertaining from the first page to the last.  I will recommend it to all my friends. The whole series is a good read with the first book \\"Bared to You\\" being the weakest.
B00DGXGUSY|4.0|Amon Amarth is the AC/DC of Swedish melodic death metal. Their sound is distinctive, their album quality is universally excellent, and they don't stray far from their winning formula from album to album. &#34;Deceiver of the Gods&#34; continues the band's decades-long exploration of Nordic myths and tales of Viking glory.<br /><br />If you know and love Amon Amarth, this album is a compulsory purchase. All of the expected elements are in full force: the tight song structures, the strong melodic/harmonic guitar lines, the blast-beat percussion, and Johan Hegg's surprisingly articulate bellow. You already know what you are getting, which is very good heavy metal that reveres its subject matter while remaining accessible to a general audience.<br /><br />For the non-fan, this is as good an introduction as any to Amon Amarth's sound and approach. While the words &#34;death metal&#34; may conjure visions of comically dour men droning endlessly about death and decay (or alternately, of comically dramatic men screeching histrionically about blood and gore), AA has a decidedly more realized -- and less gimmicky -- formula.<br /><br />I compared them to AC/DC for their consistency and dogged devotion to a sound. Another band that merits comparison is Iron Maiden. Although Iron Maiden played heavy music and had a penchant for dark subject matter, their strength was in their songs, which remained tuneful and subjectively coherent. While Johan Hegg's voice is the opposite of Bruce Dickenson's (a deep growl versus an operatic howl), the lyrical sentiments seem similarly grounded. (A listen to the song &#34;Hel&#34; of this album will make this apparent, as the guest vocalist sounds remarkably like Dickenson and meshes well with Hegg.)<br /><br />While an AA lyric may concern a &#34;romantic&#34; concept like hand-to-hand combat or a story borrowed from the Nordic sagas; however,  there always seems to be a message beneath it. Instead of &#34;Ooh! Battles are awesome, look at theguts! I just want to bathe in blood! Nom nom!&#34; or &#34;See how scary the gods are? Aren't you scared of the gods? Boy, gods sure are scary!&#34;, AA's approach is much more respectful. They seem intent on expressing the perspective of the medieval Nordic person, including the warrior values and the mythical/religious framework that would have defined his (or her, but mainly just his) understanding of the then-known world.<br /><br />This is a very narrow vein to mine, and a tricky one to pursue convincingly, but AA do it well. I'm not suggesting that their music is historically accurate (although it very well may be ... my guess is Hegg reads a lot of Viking lore and history and then embellishes, like any good artist), but it does convey a perspective that feels authentic. Vikings sought glory in battle, sure, but they also got wet, cold, hungry, lonely and nostalgic. They had families they cared about. They actually believed in the divinities of Odin and Thor and the apocalypse predicted at Ragnarok. They really thought they could dine in Valhalla if they lived their lives well.<br /><br />AA understands this is fantastic material for songwriting, and it does not require an additional contrivances (make-up, posing, obviousness) to be effective to an audience.<br /><br />Anyway, come for the guitar riffs, stay for the narrative. &#34;Deceiver of the Gods&#34; is yet another solid album from a band that has earned an honored place in the heavy metal pantheon.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|While I have read several books on &#34;out-of-body,&#34; experiences, this book added additional insights not covered in other books. I recommend it to anyone looking for answers. Skeptics will always be skeptics, until they, themselves go through the process. For me, I'm a believer.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app because all the sounds are so soothing. I've also found that their alarm is the best way to wake up. You don't find yourself wanting to hurl the alarm across the room. I definitely recommend it
B000YJ6736|4.0|Almost a short story, McEwan captures this love story with evocative prose. We are swept into the wedding night of two sympathetic characters who because of the time and culture in which they live, cannot overcome their differences. Compelling and thoughtful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What I like most is the way the book just picks right up from where you left from the first book.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|This movie is very well done.  The acting is superb, especially Ann Bancroft.  It is an adult subject matter to say the least.  I knew what I was getting into and watched it anyway.  It's like the car accident on the side of the road - you want to look away but you can't.  The unfolding of the individual character's stories at the end is heart wrenching.
6305428050|4.0|Pretty good movie for the family.  Does contain a few bad words, and a scene with two gangs and a knife, so it really isn't appropriate for youngsters.  Cute movie, nonetheless.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Our family has been reading Enders Game each evening.  It's the first book in months both my 9 year old boy and 12 year old girl have really enjoyed.  I would suggest parents be ready for a few deeper conversations, as this is a well written, complex story.  Not a light read for a 9 year old.
159463176X|1.0|I could not find where else to post this comment.<br /><br />I want to buy this book, but I found myself confronted by a strange reality: the Kindle version, which does not cost a cent to print or distribute, is $5 more expensive than a hardcover, with all the costs involved?! This really does not sit right.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Mahjong on the kindle is a lot of fun. A great game to spend time on. The tile designs are especially colorful.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Really suspenseful book however so disappointed in the ending. Overall I suppose I could say I'm satisfied with it. Thumbs up.
0385344333|5.0|Fast moving, great dialogue and a very clever ending.  Lee Child continues to improve in his writing and his plotting.
0425263924|5.0|This book was worth the wait! Now I just have to impatiently wait now for the next book to come out! :-)
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|game is fun! I downloaded for 4 yr old he cant read so I am playing. it does take too long to earn pearls and too many parts of game are dependant on them.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and very challenging, but it was over way too soon. I am hoping they come out with a sequel.
B009MYARIK|5.0|As usual Sophie Kinsella has written a fabulous read! Loved all of it! Great for the pool or a lazy afternoon!
B005544V6A|5.0|It's an intelligent TV drama/comedy series and I'm learning about law.<br />What did I learn, make sure you get a good lawyer.<br />Don't try to defend yourself.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was a page-turner. I enjoyed the character of Harry Bosch, and was rooting for him as he wound his way through the labyrinth of seemingly dead-end clues.
B006XOBFB0|5.0|What a treat - It is amazing to hear Mozart's musical talents flower of the period of these 27 concerti. I cannot speak for the recording values or the performance nuances, but the music is wonderful.<br />Very highly recommended
0425263924|5.0|This is the third in the Crossfire Series by Sylvia Day.  The story of Gedion and Eva continues,  I fell in love with their story from the very first book, with so many twists and turns, it keeps you wanting/needing more.  This book brought me to tears on more than one occasion. .
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Excellent reading.  Love the character. Never a dull moment. Recommend this book to all who enjoy intense intrigue. Perfect for summer reading.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book was vulgar.  I could not believe this was written buy someone that was over 15 with a knowledge of story telling.  I will never read another one of her books.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I e read this book 4 times and it just never gets old! An absolute must read for anyone who questions everything!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|It was a entertaining movie that my family enjoyed.  Liked the effects and story line.  Would recommend it for others to see.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is very fast paced, action packed..... it's a very enjoyable game to play... have fun playing!!! You will love it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game so much fun it keeps you wanting more just when you think you have a hill beat you don't and here's a tip to get coins faster play the Moon Level and just blast through you will get coins like no other level but yes a great game
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I stumbled across this album on youtube probably a year or more ago, and finally decided to get it in earnest.  I don't know how the band is received in Britain, but 'Grounds For Divorce', and 'An Audience With the Pope' are just great songs.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is very addictive. I highly recommend it. Be ready to spend a lot of time playing this game.
0486278077|5.0|i just cant describe how much i loved this book. There was so much to sink in, and with all the scandal behind the author and the time period- i really loved the book
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|I was expecting it to be cheesy, but its scary, creepy, action packed, with a love story. Extremely well done.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|Seriously..these are such a fad, and yea, I too think they are super comfortable and feel like I am wearing next to nothing on my feet. They are cute and light and they are something that, in theory, is the ideal shoe.<br /><br />Here come the negatives:<br /><br />- NO GRIP! I fell today (but to be fair, I should have seen that coming because I have slipped in them c. 8 times before), after it rained the steps to my building were wet and sure enough, down I fell, tore my wrist along with my favorite pair of jeans..because these shoes have NO GRIP!<br /><br />-NO DURABILITY! For how much they cost, they should not stain and rip as easily. Seriously, I walked around in them to work and back from the subway maybe 4 times before I realized that there was a gaping hole in one of my heels. I figured it was unlucky and then the next day, sure enough..the other heel was torn - because these shoes have NO DURABILITY!<br /><br />- THEY ARE EXPENSIVE! Face it, this is canvas on a rubber sole and for what they are, THEY ARE EXPENSIVE!<br /><br />These shoes are well suited for someone who owns a lawn and a car and never has to walk more than a half a mile per day on roads. (And just to clarify - malls do not count as real roads).
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Don't download this if you don't have the time.  This game is addictive and you will never put it down.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|This is the best USB-3 HUB that I have seen on the market.  First, I use this on my new Windows Surface Pro.  They only give you one USB slot so this is perfect.  Second, believe it or not, I love the short cord because I am just using this to add additional USB slots to the Surface Pro and I don't need an additional 2-3 feet of cord to clutter up my desktop or case when I travel.  It also goes without saying that the USB-3 is much faster than the USB 2 technology and the price is right on this device.  It seems to be constructed on quality material and so far so good!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like many other solitare games.  Nice thing about it is you just tap the card you want to move and it does it for you.  Nice option is the help feature to let you know of any moves you may have missed.
B000V86OKG|5.0|In a warped way this is a cool show.  Not sure if this is the lesson we want our youth to learn, but is a great show for adults.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|it was a gift for a friend who dedicates many hours to photoshop and he considered the precison of this mouse excellent and expressed it  has made a true difference in his work
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Fun, for what it is, but not nearly as transcendent as the Lord of the Rings films. Overly reliant on CGI effects and broad humor (Bilbo gets used as a troll-hankie, har har har), but with moments of great effectiveness (the 'riddle game' scene with Gollum singlehandedly redeems the entire film). Worthy, in the final analysis,largely because of high hopes for the next two movies.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this show. There is great backstory on the characters. My family is totally hooked and don't miss an episode!
1781162646|5.0|I love Steve King's shorter stories. He's got so many good ones up there in the cobwebs, ready to come out. I happen to know a little bit about rural western Maine and all those sleazy fairs, and I think the subject matter is distilled from them, but Mr. King makes a good picture, with a good reputation. You don't see the garbage and smell the nasties.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OK.  While this is not my typical type of book I caved to all the hype.  Yes Yes I admit it.  I caved to media pressure and bought the book.  I was immediately sucked into this whole innocent woman/child's story.  Let's face it we have all fallen for bad boy type with emotional baggage up the wahzoo.  Maybe not so much like Mr. Grey's baggage but I have only finished the first book.  And all I can say is Oh my!  I live in NYC and go to and from work on the subway and I missed my stop because I was so engrossed in what was happening on the page.<br />I admit that I was a little afraid of this book because of the subject matter but I took thew plunge and boy I can honestly say it is not what I thought.  I am pleasantly surprised.  I just purchased the second one and am fully ready to miss my subway stop yet again.
B0007PALZ2|3.0|This movie was crazy.  I don't know what else to say. Pitt was did a good job in his insane role and everyone else did too. Weird script and I could not stop watching it. lol
B004SVM7BW|5.0|The best PDF app! I can download almost any file in .pdf form and edit it to my heart's content. Great for knitting patterns. Every Ravelry user should check this one out!
0061743526|5.0|This is a beautiful edition of Harper Lee's masterpiece.  I purchased it for friends who attended the Monroeville (home town of Harper Lee) production of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD with me.  I was very pleased with the quality of this edition and my friends were thrilled to receive a copy of this timeless novel.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|You can make many lists with different colors and keep track of everything you need a list for. Simple and straightforward.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and intriguing brain teasers! The design and layout is beautiful and creative.  Only downside is not enough levels.  Makes you think...need more levels!!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I was looking for a simple alarm clock for my Kindle, and this one fits the bill. Not only can you have multiple alarms (one-time or repeatable), but you can also add your music to it. I can wake up to any music on my Kindle and customize playlists for each alarm. Best free app I have downloaded yet.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just joined Amazon Prime so we can watch the entire series!  We had just heard about it and started watching it on Netflicks, but enjoy Amazon even more!
B00957T6X6|5.0|You know when a worl of literature art is a masterpiece when you can't put the book down, when you start studying the book(s) and maps rather than just reading them, when you follow the epic tale on your kindle, your PC, your laptop, through cable episodes and HBO reruns, AND when you notice that besides yourself, much of our planets' population is hooked.<br />It doesn't matter if it's sometimes labeled a fantasy. This fantasy is so close to historic, even contemporary reality that it's scary. That's how good it is. It transcends time, culture, and space and speaks to us from the depths of our human beginnings. The Song of Ice and Fire tells us about how much we've changed, but also about how much we've remained a species still struggling towards civilization. And even though the theme of collective and individual conquest - often by well-named swords - is prevalent, to me it's the sheer outburst of human creative potential by Maester Writer George Martin that puts this work well up in the 5-star category!
B0063IH60K|5.0|When there's spare time and you want to use your mind, it's worth your time. Captivating. I truly have enjoyed it.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|Nice to be able to see an old favorite on a large screen HD TV. 1960's special effects not so hot but still fun to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This App Looked Cool &amp; Cute &amp; All but .. it took forever to load . I was really excited to play this game but then it wouldn't let me . very disappointing .
B005NFWCSK|5.0|All the X-Men movies were great...but loved this one especially! It was fantastic and I would definitely watch it again. Here's hoping for a part 2!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|I'm a huge film lover, having grown up watching movies and have seen hundreds of movies, but I am a critical person. I enjoy just about every film I've seen, but even some fun ones aren't great. But this movie, Departures, speaks to me in a way no film ever has. I was born and raised in Japan, so the scenery alone brings back memories, and feelings. The directing is phenomenal, with nothing ever feeling like it was rehearsed or planned out, but as if it's just life. The acting was superb, being superb by going from goofy, fun characters to serious individuals who go about their lives in a very strict manner. But while all of this may be great and award-worthy, it was the musical score that was the highlight. The main character, who wanted to be a cellist, doesn't have enough money to continue playing, so he moves to his old town and works with \\"departures,\\" those who have passed on. But this does not keep him from playing his music, and when moments of peace arise within the film, or a time of serenity for the character, the beautiful score kicks into full gear, and it will grip you tight.<br /><br />Departures is one of the best dramas ever made, one of the best films of 2009, and one of the best films of the decade. I would have to say, this, Remember Me and Pursuit of Happyness are the best dramas I've ever seen. A must-see for anyone who watches movies, but not for kids. Let them grow up first, so they can understand the maturity of life and death, and the happiness and sadness that accompanies departure.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is a good quality disc, and I was happy to get it as quickly as I did. I had no playback problems, so there was nothing I dislike about this disc.
B005T87QCI|2.0|I spend 99 Amazon coins on this game thought it would be fun but it was so dumb that I want my 99 Amazon coins BACK!!!!!!
B0043D2LAC|5.0|Awesome product for the S&F utility belt. Multipurpose bag that is made very well. Highly recommended... Just wished it had side pockets instead of loops.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Awesome for school papers and games of scrabble. I love having this book around to use all the time. Thanks
0525952926|5.0|I despair of the day when Ken Follett isn't writing...  I'm learning more about 20th century history and world culture from Ken Follett than I ever learned in college and graduate school.  Pathetic, isn't it, when Follett's well-researched books sell for less than 1% of any college course?  A well-thought-out and compelling story line, combined with learning about a time that was key to my grandparents and parents, what more could you possibly ask for in a book?  Thank you, again, Mr. Follett.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The Language of Flowers is a book of Romance the old fashioned way, with letting it be said with the meaning of a particular flower . The gifting of different flowers throughout the story express the emotions of the young girl who is finally out on her own after years as a foster child.  Fun facts for flowers and believable plot, a fun read.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is very interesting keeps my mind working.  A little confusing at times but it always works out. I love the story with it also it makes you want to keep going.
B000FC1K66|5.0|The Reader is a book that makes you feel an ache inside for innocence. The war is over but he guilt of knowing what was  being done to the Jewish neighbors is not. Hanna`s secrets are not fully exposed , but she is still undone by them. Beautiful language and first person narration make a seamless recounting of a young boy`s first love.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved this game. Need more levels....now ) I played it all in one day:( so please hurry up with more levels.  Let me know asap! Awesome! Don't cheat though that's not fun.
B00ABO609A|5.0|First of all, the HD quality on Amazon streaming is excellent, and can be used in a lot of countries other than US.  Netflix is not available everywhere...<br /><br />This film, although will most likely only appeal to a niche audience, is very well done.  The characters are well developed, and the story line although jolting, is tangible, believable and in my opinion depicts the culture realistically.
0425263924|4.0|I really liked this book in the Crossfire series! Sylvia did a great job setting the scene for the next installment. This book really focused on Eva moving forward with a lot of her issues. I imagine in the next book, it will be Gideon's turn!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is the kind of story that is inspiring to all women, but especially younger women. A journey like this will build confidence that lasts a lifetime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game LOVE IT. I can play all day. Love the power jets. The robot is cool nd fast. Try it
B006BDHAX0|5.0|We enjoy this game very much - we play it on our Kindles - you have to think fast...keeps the brain working. Easy to play, worth the price. FUN!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|this app is amazing I am so happy I got it on sale for free because then I would never would have gotten it.  today I played it for hours and hours. I say you have to get this. There is so many colors and things. I think its just so wonderful to use. I also have a tip. it looks the best when you hold your finger on the screeen it makes it have more color .
1454701250|5.0|This book is the best and so is her blog! Her tips and projects are easy to follow and the pictures in the book are beautiful. She makes it easy to learn and addictive!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Contact is one of my favorites with Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaghy?  It is one of my favorite movies.  I gave my daughter this movie, and I also brought her a used copy of &#34;Lincoln.&#34;
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I am a huge fan of the movie but am disappointed with the  Blu-Ray disc set.  Had I known what I was going to get I never would've bothered purchasing it.<br /><br />The introductory sequence has letterbox black bars above and below but then it quickly zooms in and goes to a pan&scan mode (albeit in 1080p format).<br /><br />If I were watching this on any small screen I might be grateful but since I've invested the time and money in a home theater it pretty much defeats the purpose.  I would prefer to see the movie as it was meant to be seen and do not appreciate the producers deciding that home viewers do not like letterboxing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|healthy addictions will occur. truly amazing and inspiring. I use this app daily and miss it when I am not
B00DPUB59W|4.0|Just watched this on pay-per-view and I will be purchasing it on Bluray. There is a strong woman/mother and woman/daughter aspect to this story. Claire will do anything to survive, without morals, but her daughter operates on only morals. This, to me, is one of the essences of being a mother..or at least as much as I can observe without being a mother...to do anything to assure the survival of your child. (Of course, others watching this may find Eleanor's manner of feeding to be morally reprehensible.) Man ...the brotherhood... does not understand this instinct, or at least we are lead to believe this during the story. Outstanding performances from all the actors, especially the two main actresses playing Claire and Eleanor. (I was not bogged down by their real lives, thank goodness. )  Overall, an interesting take on the vampire mythology, akin to Twilight in that the creation of a vampire is not the usual old tale of drinking blood; in this story, one must eat one's soul to transform. Unique, and worth a watch.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|Brings back memories.  Buble has a very good voice and style. CD is very well done with a great band.
0307719774|5.0|Do you collect journals and find them empty on your shelves because really you're less interesting than you thought you were? That's me. I never have anything to write. This journal is FANTASTIC because it prompts you to think about your day or your life and answer a question that can be answered in one word or a whole page. I often find myself writing in the margins. And it's great when the years start to overlap and you can see how much you've changed and grown in such a short time. I love it. I got one for my mom, sister, sister in law and three of my friends. They all adore their's as well!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The BEST book I've read in along time!!!! LOVE IT!!!! EVERY kid should HAVE to read this book, it's AMAZING!!!!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|It was a great book<br />There were romantic and actions parts, but in parts it was kind of tedious and so
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I hope I can get through the levels without having to review every step. So far it has been fun. I hope I can restart the game where I left off.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Will not finish loading on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 , my grandsons Kindle Fire or a Toshiba tablet. Definitely something wrong with the app!!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|It isn't deep.  It isn't going to change your life.  It probably isn't going to lead you to enlightenment.<br /><br />It is, however, very entertaining.
1603425381|5.0|So many fun and easy or fun and complicated borders! You think you've finished an afghan and then you add a border and it just makes the whole thing 200 times better. This book is great for beginners or the life long crochet junkie.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|this wasna good game until it crashed 3 TIMES!!!! Then the next time I tried opening it IT SAID &quot;A PART OF THIS GAME HAS BEEN ILLEGALLY OBTAINED&quot;. I HAD NOT EVER PAID FOR ANYTHING ON THIS GAME AT ALL!!!!
1781162646|5.0|Excellent !! I really liked this book. Somewhat different from King's other  books but still had a touch of horror.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Now that Freely has a web version, it is actually better than Google Reader (RIP).  Good UI and easy to use.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This album is...AMAZING. I'm kind of mind-boggled by the fact that it didn't do as well as it should have. I have to admit, that when I first heard some of the songs, I was a little turned off. The songs were really different from her stellar Breakaway album. So, I wasn't into the album as much then, so it took a year or two for me to finally give the album another chance, and I'm truly glad I did. I just love Kelly Clarkson's music. I wasn't going to buy this album because, again, I didn't like it at first. But, I finally gave in and bought the album. I was going to listen to it with a more open mind this time. It took a while for me to get into, but when I did I fell IN LOVE with all the songs on here! Oh my god, they are all sooooooo goood! I truly think this is one of her better albums! I truly believe this. Please, people, give it a chance. Listen to the songs more than once. They are so great! The best song on the album to me is Can I Have A Kiss, however, other highlights include One Minute, Hole, Don't Waste Your Time, Judas, Be Still, and Irvine. The other songs not mentioned are great as well. Just...uhhh...I'm so in love with this album.<br />Give it a chance and buy it. You won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Now, that she has five albums out, I've rated them all from favorite to my least favorite, even though all her albums are great.<br />Here's my opinion : 1. Breakaway 2. My December 3. Thankful 4. Stronger 5. All I Ever Wanted (not to say that it's bad, but out of the five, it just happened to be my least favorite, even though all the songs are really good)<br /><br />Great album, 10 out of 10 out of 10 out of 10! Wooh! Go Kelly Clarkson, the BEST AMERICAN IDOL EVER!
076115728X|5.0|So human and so fun!<br />Great for people who want to create but fear an &#34;oops&#34; moment.<br />There's a great message here for art and life.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|A bit of escapism which a movie is suppose to be<br />,a liberal take on a old fairy tale<br />but small children should have a  parent watch with them as some scenes may scare a young one.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|OK app. prety ez to play. i flow throw the levels. but if you are needing something to kill time this is the app for you
0399159347|4.0|The Husband's Secret is a novel about many secrets, although the main one affects most of the book's characters in one way or another.  The book revolves around 3 women and their families: Cecelia, a perfect wife and mother, who finds a letter to open in the event of her husband's death, a letter that changes everything; Tess, a woman who thought her marriage was fine until she found out it wasn't; and Rachel, a widow whose 17 year-old daughter was murdered over 20 years ago.  The author intertwines these stories, weaving a story that keeps you turning the pages and reading late into the night when you know you should put the book down and go to sleep. It's not great literature but it's well written and interesting and worth reading.
B001VM0LAK|5.0|lots of suspense and drama. excellent acting.  The ending has some good surprises.  I would recommend this film to a friend
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Masterpiece always does a bang-up job, and this is one of the best!  We bought these because we couldn't watch the first few years on wifi.  We are caught up now and can't wait for next season!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A very moving story, I am so glad I got to read it!  I would definitely recommend it.  I laughed and cried and had a hard time putting it down.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|No way near as good as the first books, but some very interesting developments! Onwards to the next and answers!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I love this movie!  It makes me feel like there is life after retirement that is still exciting. Great for couples to watch.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|The band keeps getting better.  Highly recommended, every song is good and I will be playing this for a long time.
B005R4KUZE|5.0|I'm about an average unrated chess player--no longer a mere wood pusher but far from a dangerous club player. I make these comments so you can better evaluate these next remarks. I found many of the problems very easy and many that only cracked after considerable analysis and many that I couldn't solve at all. This is an excellent program for all desiring a stimulating chess workout--it will raise a sweat, no doubt about it. The program will also keep score for you and let you know how you're doing. Greatly enjoyable and you can't beat the price.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I love this game, what can I say, it's Mahjong!  Challenging and fun.  Like the photos on the tiles, very summery, puts you in the mood.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the fact that Amazon Prime gave me the option to see the remaining episodes in an accelerated fashion after a certain point. I can't wait for season 4 and am crossing my fingers about getting to it early .
B004SBX112|5.0|My favorite so far.<br /><br />Abra-Co-Bacon is really cool and challenging.  The graphics in Haunted Hogs is great.  Piglantis is fun with its underwater feature and figuring out how to get things to explode.  But I really like Year of the Dragon when the fireworks start to go off.  The other games are fun too!!!
B003B02O7I|3.0|It's not dull but I think the subject, though compelling for all of us, is handled badly.  If his kids were such failures and even his loyal butler, it must have been his fault.  He punishes them for what he made them.  YMMV but reviews said it ended badly.
B006RXQ3T6|1.0|We made it through about 40 minutes of the movie and then it froze. We have never had this experience with Amazon downloads before. We tried and tried to revive it but the movie is just frozen and won't move. Very disappointed!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Have loved mark twain since the first time I read some of short stories many years ago.  I still read  the adventures Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn every so often along with many of his other stories.
B000J4QWM2|1.0|I was extremely disappointed to receive and incomplete movie. The soundtrack alone makes the whole movie, this too was incomplete.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was incredible! I wish I would have read it when I was young. I will be reading the series and may even read this one again. I couldn't put the book down once I started and I was sad to see it end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this app... though the feeding bucket doesn't move right for me. Its all glitchy and stuff. Other than at it works just fine!
B000K4WLX0|3.0|Pros: shocking, great story, crazy ending, twists, sticks in your head..<br /><br />Cons: Relies too much on gore?  Kind of excessive sex scenes very early in the movie<br /><br />This movie grabbed my interest so much and kept me on the edge of my seat.. It was genuinely scary in some parts but overall more intense feeling.  A truly terrifying experience..
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|This movie was pure trash.  Another terrible effort by Sam Raimi.  He shouldn't be allowed to make movies anymore. capiche?
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|to play on a kindle fire you have to do a download. that takes for ever. its a waste of time.
B00932A66Y|5.0|It is a lot of fun and quite exciting to watch this action, mystery film.  Well done.  It is fun to keep up with the next possibility.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|When I first saw this I thought it was just a kid game. NOT! I Love it. It makes you work at, very challenging (but not too hard that you want to give up). It's not just a 'hidden object'game. You have to find clues & solve puzzles to get to the items you need to escape.<br />Can't wait for more rooms. Highly Recommended!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|For once a story of characters that don't have tragic pasts.  This guy is so believable and funny.  I was laughing out loud!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game<br /><br />fun solving puzzles and great graphics. addictive game that you cant put down. perfect level of challenge. love it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I admit to looking on YouTube for cheats, but on the ones I can get on my own, I feel so smart!!!
B0031KE9C6|5.0|This is one that you just want to gobble down all at once! It's a thriller, well acted, and fun.
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|Good to add to your collection iam glad they got rid of the red shorts to me they finally done superman right
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway sufers it is absolutely amazing!!!! I would love for the creators to come out with a second I would be in love I love your games make more!!!!!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|After reading some of the other bad reveiews I was not sure,  I am glad I bought this package besides Amazons amazing fast delivery, when you download the digital copy you can buy the 3D disk for $5.99 and I also got a free movie ticket to the Lone Ranger a Movie I was going to see any way out here in Los Angeles that a $12.00 value
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is terrible. it glitches all the the time some weird dude pranks you all the time. don't buy this game. I wouldn't give this game any stars if I didn't have to give the game at least one star.
0739366408|5.0|This was my first audiobook experience and cannot say enough good things. Each voice truly drove the emotion and terror home. Highly recommend it!
1451695195|5.0|It was a gift and was a very exciting read. Highly recommended by myself and the receiptent of the gift.
B000VIK8D0|4.0|One of my fav's love the cast and love The Earps.  It is a must see Western modern classsic. Young Guns is also a fav
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love to see how much time I have in each category!! Would tell others about it! It is super cool!
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I've played a few Sudoko games. This one seems to be good. I haven't had any issues with it so far. I like playing it on my tablet with the big grids, etc. Decent game and a no brainer as the free app of the day from Amazon.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn's books captivate and keep the reader totally engrossed until the last page.  Her female characters are extremely  complex!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works as I would have anticipated.<br />There is something wrong with my kindle though.<br />It is not taking charge.<br />Not sure what do to about that!?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the game. once I got started I couldn't stop. now I'm to the end and have to wait for the update. I hope it's soon.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the time period when things were changing from 'tradition' yet the security of tradition still shows its benefits. Just great entertainment with great characters - and how family is always important even when the world is changing and everyone doesn't agree.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I really liked the way the book is crafted by Steven Pressfield and I didn't realized when I finished reading the whole book since the chapters in the book kept me engaged. I would recommend the book to anyone who is feeling resistance to do something out of their comfort zone.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|The gameplay is very original and fun. It starts simple and then gets very challenging. The graphics are beautiful and cute. Overall a great game
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Make sure that you plug in your iphone into the clearly marked iphone slot and all other phones in the \\"Android\\" marked slot.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I am not usually a movie-watcher.<br />But this is stinking cute!<br />My girls love it.<br />I do HATE that there is a WITCH in all the fairy tales.<br />However, it's true to the course of life.<br />There are spiritual oppositions, believe it or not!<br />But the kids don’t need to think that all villains are hideous beasts. They are often the more beautiful of the creatures walking around.<br />Just my take.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is not just a romance story but provides great insight into the lifestyles of different people in 19th century England, how they interacted and their prejudices.<br /><br />Wonderful background music as well.<br /><br />This is truly a masterpiece. Hats off to BBC. I recommend this to everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love!!!<br /><br />Such a wonderful read... read it in only three days. Now just trying to meet the word requirements yo submit
B00847KFDS|5.0|I've been listening to John Fogerty for most of my adult life (and his).  Only one song match-up didn't work for me, but the concept was great, the music is great, and still love Fogerty, even though we look a BIT older!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Until the advent of CGI Hollywood always had a difficult time making Superheroes believable, in particular, the Superman franchise. It wasn't in my opinion until the Batman and Terminator franchises that Hollywood started to make us believe that the impossible was possible and Marvel's The Avengers makes us believe that Marvel Superheroes are possible and could in fact exist in the real world or in someone's mind and be brought to the Big Screen and entertain us for two and a half hours.
B005544V6A|5.0|This is a great show! I can not wait to finish the first season so I can watch the second season!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I will keep this short, first these books are a spoiler to the HBO series since HBO has not caught up yet, but that said a lot of questions are left unanswered so it makes both quite exciting.  Good read, good pace, intricate detail. If you read LOTR and the Hobbit and wanted more so you read the The Silmarillion then this book series might really be up your alley.
0783114893|5.0|When this was released in 1986,a slasher film(which this is not), automatically received one star, no matter how good it was. It was politically correct. This is a simple tale of good vs evil, much like No Country for Old Men. The acting was first rate. In fact C. Thomas Howell was never better. And Rutger Hauer is the epitome of illogical, unexpected terror. If it makes no sense, it's because the WHYS don't matter. This is the model from which all subsequent imitations come. A classic. Oh, and don't pay $20 for it. I picked it up for $3 new at a discount dollar store yesterday. There must be more of them out there somewhere.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this series. Book three was my favorite, so far. The author chose to split the last installment into two books ,taking certain characters to a particular point in book four and the remaining characters to the same point and then a little further in book five. Consequently there was an overlap in book five where the storyline included events that we had already experienced in book four. I felt it was a detriment to the story line, but it eventually worked out and despite that I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. The characters are incredible and no one is safe!! I can't wait til book six arrives. I hope Mr. Martin is working diligently.
0316056863|5.0|Sent this book to a friend who is recuperating from surgery.  She reported that it lifted her spirits --which lifted mine!
8478886567|5.0|Bought this for my girlfriend who is a big Harry Potter fan and learning Spanish. She read the whole thing and loved it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I had fun and loved using this app! If you like horses I suggest this app for you and your friends.
B00005JLEU|5.0|We enjoy watching Miyazaki's movies again and again. &#34;Spirited Away&#34; is no different. Younger children may be a little scared so watch it with them or wait till you think your kid can handle it.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|Avoid ordering anything from Best Price Mirror. As for the Batteries, I'm not sure, I never recieved them. I would not recommend.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It is not a bad movie. The previews made it look funnier than what it actually was. It was not bad, but not great either.
B003HC8I5M|4.0|I had watched the making of the album on the TV episode and the work Phil and all the others put into it was fantastic.<br />Its an enjoyable album :-)
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This is the second book of the Walt Longmire Mystery Series I have read.  The stories have caused me to make an addition to my bucket list.  A side trip to NW Wyoming on the way to Yellowstone National Park. Again, the books remind me of the Tony Hillerman books.<br /><br />One note as to the book's characters. You care about them. You wish them well.  After all, they had made you laugh and maybe cry a little.<br /><br />What a great story teller.  Getting ready to start book three.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very good game liked it alot. Just disappointed it only had 10 levels need to add more to the game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|They have to be observant and think a little outside the box. This is a fun puzzle. My kids like solving the problems.
034580404X|4.0|I enjoyed the books and so did several of my friends.  I have no other comments to add. Not a one.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This is not a movie where you are going to be at the edge of your seat for the whole thing. It is about a man who makes some bad decisions and then having to deal with the consequences.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I wondered why I wasn't hearing about Danaerys, or why Arya's story ended the way it did, nothing on the Wall. Now I have to read through another book and collate the story against what I read already. Ok, sounds like fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this for my two kids with Nabi 2's.  Works great (they only like to use &#34;creative&#34; mode)!  Keeps them off of my iphone!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Low cost and so much fun. I have been searching for a game that actually makes me stop and think. I found it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|i didn't want it to end!  nicely done!  i also had no idea that there were orphan trains..  thank you for a wonderful book!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|After seeing the movie, I just wished that I would've read the book. It is just that how it ends doesn't seem like there can be a part two. So it will be interesting to see how they pick up from where they left off. The movie is nice and you will enjoy it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Its a great movie and a well done film, excellent script.<br />superb acting by the whole casting, very good lightning
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Since we've seen the Eagles in concert three times in Las Vegas over the last 18 months, it was really interesting to learn about their history.  We didn't really know all that much about them and it was fun to see how their careers developed.  Highly recommended for Eagles fans.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not frustrating. I enjoyed it. It does involve some brain power and logic. I look forwatd to playing more levels.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Fun movie. My family enjoyed it very much. The trailer does not do it justice. Better than the ratings would less you to believe.
B0090EJ99A|4.0|This movie was pretty hilarious! Although a little bit immature and offensive, still a must see for all comedy lovers!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Cute and funny. I think that it ended too soon. I guess that just meas that I really liked it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|A great version of the Jane Austen classic.  I really really liked it and have watched it more than once!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Great brain stimulation. Hard to put down. Interesting enough to keep interest without being too complicated.  Looking forward to more like it.
B0002O06NA|5.0|If you are into the Black Keys, make sure you check his album out. It's outstanding and will always be a favorite.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Usually series or movies don't do the book they are based on justice. HBO has handled Game of Thrones very well, the flavor and story is kept in tact. I believe this is one of the best series of its type ever produced. Now if George R.R. Martin would finish this series everyone involved with Game of Thrones would be VERY happy! Great series to watch, great series to read. Both can be enjoyed equally!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|ok for me... would have liked more game. I think it has replay value. get this game for thegreat atmosphere and tone.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It was a strong outlook of a person who feels alone and she thought that one thing would fix the problem because of the tapes she made the people on the list remembered why they got the tapes and now she is died and they can't take it back
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season is great.  It makes me very excited for the final season.  Dexter is one of the best shows on TV.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie rocked, I loved seeing it in theaters! Mark Ruffalo probably did the best version of The Hulk in the past 2 decades!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|We have this app on all our Kindle Fires. It's not just pretty, which it is, but extremely functional and a breeze to use. When my daughter got her Kindle Fire this was the first app we downloaded.I really get a kick out of it when it gives the power alert by speaking it out loud.It's not a one trick pony either. The built in settings are easy to personalize. You don't have to guess whether you have enough battery left to do something. With this you'll know.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Holds over four lens, space for additional items (cd's, lens caps' etc...) very spacious...I even have a 400 mm lens in there - got to say with that additional 3lbs in there - the weight distribution has not affected my back at all....Great produce
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Really well done. Just wish I could make my fave old decks like squirrels or Millstone/mind twist. Great for what it is!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|no problems with this app. installed easily, easy to use when you need to make a quick calculation. good free calculator.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I haven't watched it yet, but my daughter says my granddaughter who is 3 enjoys watching it.  She said the story is entertaining and the scenery on the dvd is very pretty.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I found this book repetitive and lead to nothing really. It feels like the book just ends and leaves you feeling a little disapointed
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|First off, BUY THIS GAME.  If you are an angry birds fan, either download the free version or pay for the add free, but buy it.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the Angry Birds series; and while I'm not exactly a Star Wars aficionado, I really do enjoy the series, so I was pretty excited to see this. So straight to the pros/cons of the game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Great new bird mechanics.  I was disappointed by the new bird types in Rio, but not in this version, each bird has something very new to offer.<br />Plenty long to justify getting the paid version (though the free will suit just fine)<br />Lots of solid unlock-able content if you want to spend the time.  But, as per usual, the unlock-able content can be purchased if you aren't in the mood to three star the entire game just to get to Dagobah.<br /><br />Cons:<br />This isn't really a con, but in my opinion you should just buy the add free version. for a buck, it's worth it.<br />To me, it seemed very very obvious that I would be PURCHASING Dagobah if I hadn't 3 starred all the levels, but I could see how a kid could get confused and accidentally buy it, so pay attention to the little guys if they are using your phone.<br />Bonus levels with R2D2 and C3-PO were sort of . . meh.  They were fun, but I didn't really like the 3PO mechanic, it was a bit clumsy, but that is a very very small criticism and something that anyone could easily disagree with me on.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great series, Can't wait until new season comes out. Exciting and engaging. Will be loaning this to my daughter to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is for the genius mind.  I can easily figure these out.  Caution this is not for those who head hurts when challenged.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|Kind of fun, engaging characters, fine acting. Story shifts midway and moves from a romantic romp to a melodrama...but attractive actors helped me forgive this shift.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game. Graphics are great. Very realistic pictures. Had a lot of fun playing it. Next best thing to owning your own horse.
B000WQWPKA|2.0|Having been used to the DVD Special Edition version for so many years now, watching the Blu-Ray version just leaves me wanting the extra 9 minutes put back in the film.  The missing bits are just glaring and detracting from enjoying the film.  Yes, the blu-ray experience is much improved in the picture quality, but the cost versus space wasted on the disk is just sad.  It really makes me wish I had read more reviews before purchasing.  It has caused me to read more reviews before purchasing, any more like this will just stay on the shelf, unbought.  It is such a good film that it is too bad.  In owning this version of it, I feel soiled.  Too much money for such a sorry and lacking version of the film.  Nothing new, and sadly, not enough old.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I should note that I got this game for free during the &#34;App of the day&#34; giveaway thing, though I really do think it is worth paying for especially if you played the original.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Scary gameplay (amazing that an android game pulled this off, but try playing this with headphones on somewhere dark and quiet, it is very creepily immersive.<br />Clean graphics/good looking game<br />big enough game to justify the .99 cents<br />Unlike some other versions of this, the pages spawn semi randomly among a variety of locations, so you can't just map out the quickest route between them to have an auto-win<br /><br />Cons:<br />Would be nice if the game was a little bigger, maybe 2 or 3 more courses.<br />Tutorial would be nice (pretty obvious gameplay, but I'm a big believer in at least a mini-tutorial)<br />A little &#34;lore&#34; wouldn't hurt, but in a weird way, the lack of knowledge of the situation can actually add to the creepy factor, so the game designers may have been smart leaving this out.<br /><br />All and all, if the concept of this game sounds fun to you, you are probably going to really enjoy it. MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GET IT
B00679T1EO|5.0|Great continuation of the first season. Much drama and excitement. Love the series, but would like it better if they kept from killing off the characters.
B000002INJ|5.0|This band will blow your Ears off they are the loudest in the world of Metal and it's a great CD got some really Awesome songs on it well worth buying !!
B007L6VR12|3.0|It is quaint and precious....yet not really engaging. Seemed like everyone was trying too hard to be clever....it became tedious to watch....oh well, I appreciate what they were going for.
B00139W3NE|5.0|I like Nicole Kidman, and fantasy movie are some of my favorite movies to watch.  I wish I could get a whole lot more to watch.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|love the story and the song,  can't stop listing to the song. Jamie Fox was an excellent actor A+ great
B00AESN8XY|5.0|There isn't a ton to be said about this game that hasn't already been put out there.  The gameplay is fun, the interface is easy to work with, the appearance and graphics are solid, and it's do-able but challenging as far as difficulty is concerned.<br /><br />Before I get to the pros/cons list, I want to be very clear GET THIS GAME!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Engaging<br />Lots of different game types makes it interesting over time.<br />Nice display/graphics<br />solid interface works well on a touch screen<br />Everything in the package can be had for free assuming you are willing to put in the time, or you can purchase the additional cheats for a reasonable price.<br />Great sense of humor in the \\"news items\\" scrolling within the game<br />Tutorial and tips are actually useful and don't treat you like you are a child.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I really can't think of any, I'm dying to see what disease they are going to come out with next
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my wife likes this game very much. on a recent trip it helped her pass the time while i was driveing
0399255370|4.0|It is  clever story and very timely. Everyone wants to go on strike and demonstrate today.  The layout of the book is also very nice.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Great fun, tough subject managed authentically with compassion and humor. I enjoyed every scene. Great cast! De Nero is great at playing obsessive yet charming oddballs....fun
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is original and definitely fun to solve being just difficult  enough without becoming frustrating.  Will watch for more like this.
B00AVIQPJQ|5.0|Even after watching the movie years later it has held the test of time as one of my favorite Hit man movies.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book.  I started reading after watching the series on hbo.  I loved the book even more than the show.  I feel it is very well written and I love how the chapters are broken down.  My tip is for readers to look at the map and in the back at the descriptions of the houses whenever New places and people are brought up.  It definitely helped me.  Enjoy!!
0375851569|5.0|My son loves these books. We read them every night for bed time. His favorite book is The Cat in the Hat.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This mounting arm is made of very strong and solid steel. I was worried most about how it will secure my monitor vertically and whether or not it will start sagging down after using it for a while, the solution, they made the joint between the two halves with a lock, so if you want to adjust the height you have to press on the joint (a big circle button if you look at the photos) so you can move it vertically, then release the button to lock it in place!<br /><br />What added to the value of this arm, they included with it a smaller tightening knob (the knob located at the bottom that you use it to push up the base into the table bottom) the smaller knob is smaller in matter of diameter in case your table does not have enough clearance from the edge of the table to the support piece that goes from side to side under the table between the table legs, this smaller knob will help giving more space to push the base further into the table. Also they included a smaller arm base and a smaller securing piece of steel (the piece that moves up and push into the table to secure the base).<br /><br />I can assure you that the manufacturer did their homework to make sure this mounting arm will fit almost any table! Well done...<br /><br />EDIT 27 JULY 2013<br />I just discovered that this arm can also be mounted on desks that have a hole for wires (the small circle holes at the corner you find on some office desks). Now I am thinking to order another one for my work because my cubical have partitions forbidding me to \\"slide\\" the arm at the edge of the desk, but the desk have two of those holes for wires I can use to mount the arm :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i've become completely hooked on this show!  can't wait for the new season to begin - it's the only good reason for cold weather season that i can come up with!!
B008HJGPVO|2.0|i bought this to go with my Kindle Fire HD, but really found no use for it as it didn't really work well for me with the Kindle. I found using my finger much easier. Not sure if iI'm using the Stylus correctly, but then again, I don't see how you could use it wrong. Just didn't suit my purpose.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|Even all these years later this is a great movie.  Not a chick flick by any means.  The story of the friendships is amazing.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|A terrific album -- if you don't like something on here, you don't like music.  Smart, retro and forward-looking at the same time.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great book, I am gonna download the second book now. If you liked fifty shades of gray you will like this book.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Like most, it was better than the movie.  I already have the next book. Going to start it tomorrow.
B008RJFRTK|4.0|I chose this rating because nothing is perfect, but MapsWithMe Pro was great for our recent  trip to the Netherlands and Belgium.  I particularly liked that I could zoom in and out to get the big picture as well as a more detailed view.  I also liked being able to plot our route(s).  I had purchased a Benelux Michelin map and found that I didn't use it at all after I got MWM Pro.  I put this on my Kindle Fire.  I'd recommend it for anyone who prefers maps to a disembodied voice telling them what to do.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very addictive, and entertaining. I could barely put it down, one of the best book  I've ever read. I would recommend this book to ages 12+
B005K17RU0|2.0|I liked this app better before the upgrade.  The screen print is smaller and more cluttered looking.  I really don't want to see all the videos, I just want a fast, simple way to check the weather in the morning; just radar, temp, and forecast.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|This movie was a big disappointment. Nowhere near the excitement of the other three.  Very little paranormal activity at all.  It did stay in line with the story of the other three but did not keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000S81MHY|3.0|This is a nicely manufactured piece of equipment.  I bought it for the Proxxon drill press, as recommended by a friend. However, for the drill press I think it's overkill.  I thought I could use the drill press, a very nice unit, for a little light wood milling. As it is not possible to lock the drill at a certain hight, without resetting the whole head hight, it will not be useful.  I was also encouraged to buy the 27100 because the much less expensive vice had such a poor review.  I should have bought the vice for my work.
B00ABO573A|5.0|The movie was very interesting.  I enjoyed seeing the relationship unfold.  In many cases this is what happens.  Loss of respect for someone that you love IS devastating!  Loved it!  Keep a box of tissues close by!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a neat game and isn't to hard but not to easy either. Good way to pass the time :)
B0015AARJI|5.0|Nice!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Found it repeating stuff from the other books but can not for next book. Hope it does not take too long to come out!!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I loved Little Women. A great classic tale of morals and joy plus trials. I really enjoyed the details, love, losses and always a learning adventure.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Though it was a little slow to get into the story, my husband and I both ended up enjoying watching it.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|One of the goodestest 80s films. Always a classic. Watch it again and again and again and again and even again.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the graphics and use of touch screen controls.  Really enjoyed the challenges of finding clues and putting together meaning for next step toward completion of puzzle mazes.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This is just typical Tarrantino.  Excellent acting, superb writing and an all-star cast.  I loved every single minute of it!
1439152802|4.0|I read The Forgotten Garden a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it well enough that I thought I would like to read something else by Kate Morton. I didn't love it to the point that I had to read something else by her immediately, however.  I am so glad I finally picked up The Secret Keeper, I think it is a far better book.<br /><br />I liked Jimmy so much and badly wanted for him to be happy.  My feelings towards both Dorothy and Vivian changed a great deal, and several times, throughout the book (towards Vivian especially) in ways I never would have expected at the outset. My thoughts about them changed slowly and meandered off course and back again a couple of times, and I of course found this intriguing, wanted to know just what I SHOULD be thinking and feeling about them. What was the truth? This aspect of the book kept me happily turning the pages, just as much as wanting to know why mum did what she did.<br /><br />The story was pleasantly and perfectly slow to evolve. Just as we are gradually learning more tidbits and realize that initial assessments and judgements can be very flawed the characters in the book are also slowly learning the complexity of their situations. They come to understand that the need people have to make things fit, for life to make sense, is not always based in reality. That as humans we sometimes have a need to make up our own reality.<br /><br />The description of London and the inhabitants during the incessant nightly bombing by the Luftwaffe seemed picture perfect. Truly picture perfect, as I could fully imagine and see in my mind's eye the moments captured in Jimmy's photographs that were described in such an evocative and poignant way.<br /><br />As many have stated there were aspects of the ending that were a real surprise. Love when there is a true twist of the plot in a book that I had not been able to anticipate.  The ending left me feeling a little emotional, both happy and sad.
098478280X|5.0|I worked with the data science association on their new standards for \\"Data Scientist\\" interviews (entry salary of $125,000), and both real questions and after interview polls were included for the biggest names in data today, from the web to corporate and government IT. \\"Data Scientist\\" is one of the hottest new jobs out there today, and some companies are even forming CDSO jobs--Chief Data Science Officer!<br /><br />To begin, ALL FOUR of the books in this review are 5 star \\"superstars\\" for IT interviews. The two problems are, my library customers want to know the top two, and our Amazon shoppers want to know if they can get away with one, two, three, or if they have to buy all four! Of course the answer depends both on the focus of your resume, and the overlap/focus in the four books.<br /><br />First, the summary, by author, title/Amazon link, year published/edition, number of pages, trim and cost, problems included, main language(s) foci. These four are the most frequently purchased by the over 100,000 libraries (including corporate technical libraries and schools as well as private and public) in our database. (Note: page counts are via visual inspection at the time of this writing, not Amazon stats. Pages can vary with on-demand books.).<br /><br />Aziz, [[ASIN:B00C7F0V3W Elements of Programming Interviews: 300 Questions and Solutions by Aziz, Adnan, Prakash, Amit, Lee, Tsung-Hsien 1st (first) Edition (10/11/2012)]], 2012, 481 pages, 6 x 9, $25, 300 problems (mostly C++, concurrency in Java, discrete math in formulas and English)<br />McDowell, [[ASIN:098478280X Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions]],  2011 (5th edition), 500 pages, 6 x 9, $23, 150 problems, (mostly all Java except of course the C, C++ question sections!)<br />Guiness, [[ASIN:111851856X Ace the Programming Interview: 160 Questions and Answers for Success]], 2013,  419 pages, 6 x 9, $20, 160 problems, (mostly Java and C# but some unusual JavaScript, SQL, Ruby and Perl examples too)<br />Mongan, [[ASIN:1118261364 Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job]], 2013 (ed. 3), 301 pages, 7.4 x 9, $18, 150+ problems (C, C++, C#, Java)<br /><br />All four of these fine prep texts cover the usual suspects in Algorithms and Data structures, including a focus on \\"scalable\\" problems of most concern to the Amazons, Googles, Facebooks, etc. of the world. These include recursion, arrays, lists, hash tables, binary searches and trees, and other foundation coding subjects.<br />All also cover the usual tricks, brain teasers, presentation problems, prep, process, etc. issues, and in the case of Cracking, specifics on many different company processes.<br /><br />The divergence is in the \\"extras.\\" Aziz jumps into parallel computing and covers discrete math (in grad school joke terms, all the computer oriented math that has been taken out of high school courses). McDowell has an unusually well written probability section. Guiness is very up to date with cross platform apps and concurrent programming nightmares, and goes into both more depth and detail on individual topics like big O notation. Mongan is published by wrox, and has not only technical editors, but outstanding web resources. His database section is the most robust of the group.<br /><br />Aziz and McDowell are print on demand, which usually means there are many more errors in early going, but much faster correction of them via almost weekly files to the printer. Guiness is Wiley and bulletproof. We've tested the code extensively in all four (my payroy sister programmers, not me!) and ALL of them are outstanding, with very few errors at this writing, which can only get better fast in the two PODs, and wasn't a problem to begin with via the technically edited wrox and wiley teams.<br /><br />Surprisingly, there is NOT a lot of overlap in solutions in these four texts, just as there IS a lot of overlap in the questions (strings, arrays, binaries, hashes... structures are structures and algos are algos). The difference in ALL these books (as opposed to a Cormen) is that the algorithm examples are not academic--they give you many options to \\"cheat\\" - and most of the cheats are more real world than techniques given in the 1,300 page algo function texts.<br /><br />McDowell is the industry standard, but she teaches very much to Google, as does Aziz, meaning web focus, and even a little forgiveness on php, but NO forgiveness on memory or scalability. If you're a library client and have to pick two, we advise one from the McDowell/ Aziz dyad and one from the Guiness/ Mongan dyad. If you're applying for a job with a specific language requirement, these self sort, although of course all are object oriented today.<br /><br />For shoppers preparing for a real interview: buy all four. I mean, come on. This is your future! You can get all four for the price you'd pay for a larger (way less useful) algo + data structure or individual language text, and maybe less. Some points about interview technique are common, but all four offer different and important examples in approaches to solutions, even though they share common algorithmic and data structure challenges.<br /><br />IRONY: The only programming area growing faster than data scientist today is at the other end of the big scale spectrum: embedded systems. I kid you not, specialize in embedded, and you're GUARANTEED a dream job, both due to the explosion of these systems, and the rarity of programmers here (but yes, you have to get into circuits!). Our sister Payroy group shows job stats, demand and salaries that are to die for if you go there-- way better than Google. NONE of these books cover it (because other than mobile and server embeds, embedded was traditionally automotive and industrial, but even \\"Google and Microsoft TV\\" type ventures are now hungering for it).<br /><br />There is NO good interview book out on embedded yet, but these two are the best of breed in the field itself: 1. Samek ([[ASIN:0750687061 Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded Systems]]) and 2. White ([[ASIN:1449302149 Making Embedded Systems: Design Patterns for Great Software]]). Why C and C++? Because that's where the majority of electronics still reside, and \\"object\\" programmers in the field often just use the C subset of ++ and don't really get into sexy classes/methods/parents/kids, etc.! 6 months brushing up on this, specializing, and going for an embedded job will be worth years of competing with the interviews in these texts!!!<br /><br />Now, a simple tip. I was part of a team that interviewed for a high level, very high paying digital art programming position at shader joes dot com. One candidate stood out as really technically challenged--she even confused a call with a register in one of her answers! She called herself an \\"autodidact\\" - meaning, unlike Yahoo, we can't be recruiting only from the 18 top schools.<br /><br />At the end of her interview, she asked us to check out a disc she'd brought. She had programmed her own video game with movie-real characters, explosions, storyline, etc. using Unity, Maya, blastcode, Python, Lua and C#, with web distributions in Java, HTML 5 and php. She proceeded to explain her entire process, from idea to distribution. She was hired before she could reach the elevator. In olden-days, old timer parlance, don't forget your \\"portfolio\\" if you have one! It can trump a LOT of the bureaucratic hurdles!<br /><br />EMAILERS ANSWER: IF you are a manager, rusty at coding, a data scientist, etc. and are in an interview where you have to \\"understand\\" coding basics, but not necessarily code, see our review of Karumanchi ([[ASIN:1475293534 Coding Interview Questions]]).<br /><br />Library Picks reviews only for the benefit of Amazon shoppers and has nothing to do with Amazon, the authors, manufacturers or publishers of the items we review.

B000127LW2|3.0|I'm not gonna return it but the first and second disc's has alot of skips and freeze frame on it so it must have been abused alot so I bought the second season at walmart brand new so I won't be seeing any skips or freeze frames on it.I don't need any of the other seasons as I already have them all.I now have all seven seasons of star trek voyager.
B00000JMOF|2.0|Hadn't seen this since I was VERY young, so I remembered little. Though I love most \\"classics\\" - Wizard of OZ, Gone With the Wind, Creature From the Black Lagoon - to name only a few, I thought this thing was a mess. Watch the juxtaposition of the doctor's body to the monster when the doc is supposed fending off his creation with a torch. On several occasions, the doctor's body is BETWEEN the torch and the monster. Karloff's body language suggests that he isn't certain what to do, as it looks silly for him to be doing anything other than strangling the doc! So they just clumsily do a two-step. Glad this guy didn't choreograph Rocky!!!<br /><br />The scene where his fiance and 2 men arrive at Frankenstein's \\"lab\\" is beyond illogical. I mean, if you look at a shot of the place from afar, you see a lighthouse on top of a high hill. That they would venture out into that horrible storm when they had not done so in broad daylight (and perfect weather) is laughable. The script might have at least called for something urgent, as in could not wait another moment!, to force them to go. Then, the good doctor converses with the the group of 3 thru his closed window at the top of the edifice, amid constant thunder. And what does he say? Leave!<br /><br />Ultimately, he lets them in. When he discloses to the other doctor that he intends to give life to a human, I assume they are isolated from the fiancee and mutual friend. But, when they do a wide shot, there they sit, a few feet away, as calm as if they had just heard a nursery rhyme.<br /><br />Look, I know the transition to talkies was in it's infancy, so I can accept the sometimes exaggerated facial expressions and movements. But, I think Mr. Whale did far less than a \\"whale of a job\\" job with this.<br /><br />Karloff's monster is the one thing that probably kept this thing from falling into the realm of forgotten mediocrity. Well, that and the fact that this was one of, if not the very the first, entry in the talkie genre ofclassic horror tales.
B00946ZOT8|5.0|Out of all the Twilight Series dolls done by Mattel, I feel that the Emmett and Rosalie dolls are the closest representations to the actual characters.  These dolls are more for collectors and girls who are careful with their dolls than for younger kids to play with, though.  I wouldn't recommend giving them to small children or for kids who are rough with their toys.  Very high quality doll!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Longish. I love this app. I found it one day and immediately started creating!!! And my autistic son loves to watch the drawing. Thank you so much for a great app!!! Well worth the money
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This is an all-time favorite. Children love this book, and so do I. I can plainly hear Grover's voice as I read.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I highly recommend this for anyone who wants a cold hard look at our servicemen and women have gone thru for our freedom.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Not a bad read. Lots of stories about combat and training. If you are looking for in depth accounts of sniping then this book isn't it. Regardless it was entertaining. I wasn't a huge fan of his wife's excerpts through out the book. She is portrayed as a bit of a whiner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have heard a lot of good things regarding this program.  Once I saw the 1st episode I was hooked on this program.  I absolutely love it and cant wait for Season 4!
0345479092|5.0|This book has a lot of great information that I don't think comes naturally to new parents.  I would recommend this book to any new parent.  She is very much about respecting the child and seeing things from a baby's perspective.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I wish that the creators would let you get all of the characters for free! they should also make the items free because it gets really boring after a while
B001E25MBK|5.0|The Godfather cleaned up, brighter and clearer, in Blue Ray, for an excellent price. If you're the least bit of a Godfather fan you should have this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love it. Quick reading on a daily basis and easily accessible. Can't beat it for free. Give it a try.
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Normally G5 games are fun, entertaining, and mentally challenging.  This  game is dull, no point, and very basic.  I am so very glad it was on sale.  Definitely not recommended.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|The case was cracked but that is fine because the CD was sonderful!  Im glad I ordered it will go great in my collection
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|The negative reviews on this site demonstrate the substantial risk of releasing experimental music to a mainstream market: not everyone is ready or accustomed to anything slightly out of the box. Don't let the one-star reviews fool you. This is a mesmerizing, hypnotic album of duality, extremity and persecution.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did.  Non-stop action, and Jeremy Renner is very good.  Worth it.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It is fun to play and upgrade your vehicle. I like the choices of controls and the different cars available.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Definite a different twist on the traditional zombie genre. While the plot was a little drawn out the cast did a good job of keeping us engaged. Great date movie!
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie does a really good job of following the storyline from the book without adding or taking away too much. The actors seem to fit the part really well, and the sets are great and realistic. It wasn't, however, the type of movie that leaves you in awe at the end and wanting a whole lot more.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Amazing game for the vita a must have put in 90 hours of pure fun into this game, lovable characters great story that keeps you on your toes. Fusing personas is a lot of fun multiple endings this is my first persona game and I love it.
B0081336FO|5.0|If you like Sherlock, this is one of the better redo's of the classic.  The characters/actors flow together to create an enjoyable and intriguing show.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This was a lot of fun.  Bruce Willis never seems to get to old for action, and Gordon-Leavitt is excellent in this--even with all the makeup.
0756407915|3.0|i devoured the first book. Mr. Rothfuss has an excellent writing style which makes reading the books very enjoyable. having said that book 2 was more fluff than actual substance. the story was fast paced in book 1. In book 2 the storyline sags. i knew just as much about the chandrian as i knew at the end of book 1. I think this series will have 4 books and not 3. There is no way so many loose ends can be tied in 1 book.<br />The story barely moved in book 2. Editing should have been tighter.<br />Took me a little longer to get through this book as my interest level dipped at times. Would still read it as the series itself is very interesting and i would assume that there book 3 is going to be action-packed.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|I love this movie saw it first at a drive in and still enjoy watching it!  Great music and beautiful scenery and Jack Nicholson!!!  Nip nip nip...yeah!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I saw this performance on TV, and just had to have it.  If you like Pink Floyd and David Gilmore, this is awesome!
B005H8DEMG|5.0|Helen Mirren is amazing as Prospera. Shakespeare for modern times -- WS's work never gets outdated when inspired directors and actors take it on.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|It's disco but I still love it. Daft Punk totally manages to do that every time. DAMN YOU DAFT PUNK!!!!!!
B0030IIYWA|5.0|This is a good value as it is barely more than the regular DVD version but contains both the DVD and BR. We keep the BR here at our house and the DVD version in a one of those zip up DVD cases at Grandma's house making this an excellent value.
1433503794|5.0|It's been a few years and this Bible is still going strong. My wife loves it, it has a lot of information, maps, etc. Definitely do your research when choosing a study Bible, you want to get the right one.
159463176X|3.0|This book was all right. It wasn't bad; it wasn't good. The premise was a good one, but he developed way too many characters, instead of focusing on the main story line. I loved Hosseini's first two books, and was expecting this one to be at least as good. Although well written, it would have been better had he drawn us more emotionally into the lives of the main characters, as opposed to continually introducing us to new ones, and leaving them only shallowly known. Some of their stories simply had nothing to do with the main theme. It wasn't that I didn't like this book; it's just that I didn't love it, either, and for the money, it simply wasn't worth reading in hardback. Save it for the Kindle.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Needs more boards, simple fun game good graphics no bad, think a 3 to 4 yo and up may like this
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Don't believe the negative reviews RE: costs - you can use the app without the $4.99 font package, they DO NOT charge for updates, and this app is better than most for Office functionality.  My favorite feature is the native Skydrive access.  This app is the only Office app for Android that has native two-way Skydrive sync as of this review date.  In the absence of a Microsoft-brand app, this one takes the cake hands down!
6304698798|5.0|I had a hard time finding this movie in stores tried at almost all to find. I needed it for a gift to my dad then I did something I never do I went on line and looked for it and found it on the first try I would highly  recommend to anyone.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|This is a good value as it is barely more than the regular DVD version but contains both the DVD and BR. We keep the BR here at our house and the DVD version in a one of those zip up DVD cases at Grandma's house making this an excellent value.
B00B935SUY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much! Dave Grohl is the man! Very interesting, brings back many memories of thte 80s
B0090SI460|5.0|Simply endearing to the hearts of those who would watch it.<br />Magnificent visually and the 3D is a compliment to the artistry of the creators.<br />The last word of dialogue is a real testament to the people who created this epic because it will always bring back loving memories when heard in the future.
