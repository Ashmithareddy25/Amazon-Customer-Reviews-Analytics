B00HG1JFXY|5|This serum is a great follow up with the shampoo. Smells nice and helps my hair feel thicker for longer periods of time. I can't wait to see what it does long term.
B00I3VRV82|3|I absolutely love this eyeliner. It glides on and stays all day. So why 3 stars? Sharpening it is a real chore. I really wish it was a twist up. When I need to sharpen it, I put it in the freezer for at least 1/2 hour or longer. Then I use the best sharpener I can find. Then  I refrigerate it so I can smooth the tip a bit before using it again otherwise it tends to crumble on the tip after sharpening. So even though this is the best liner I've ever had, unfortunately I am still looking, and will only consider twist ups (which I'm sure will have their own set of problems.)
B00113HNB4|5|My daughter's Pediatrician  recommenced this product to me when she got eczema, it worked really well, thanks a lot!!
B00IAA6QS2|5|I sooo love this gel, I am african american and I would use this gel when i would do up dos on my hair and others. It doesn't flake much. It is very soft but still hold your hair in place nicely. I was so happy when i found this on Amazon because our local beauty supplies stores no longer sells this particular gel. I am definately ordering more.
B001DYM5J6|5|EVEN my hair stylists like my hair cut. LOL  Yes the shears are great. I love being able to cut my hair again, between hair cuts. If you buy these shears you won't be disappointed.
B00GJW40MW|4|I just received my product. I like the feel of the liquid it is not greasy or sticky. Too soon to give a complete review, but time will tell.    As of 10/12/2014 I have been trying to respond to an e-mail sent by Xfacio, but the e-mail has a broken link. No way to respond.
B000RL0OYE|5|been using it for yrs
B0055O64VU|5|Just bought Sheer White Whitening  Strips from my dentist. I plan to start using them tonight at bedtime. After reading a majority of the reviews, I'm anxious to get started. Thank you all for taking time from your busy life to write a review. Your feedback on the White Strips gives consumers the heads up on this product as well as other products before buying them and running the risk of throwing money away on something that just doesn't work. After I use the whitening strips, I'll write my own review.  Thank you all again.<br />Dottie from Pennsylvania :)
B00PUYEQLA|5|I like the smell - so far so good.
B000EPHRNO|5|Works great and the best is it's cordless. I shaved my head with it and it's easy to clean. Comes with all the attachments and a nice bag to hold everything.
B0013TMFV4|5|Jury still out on durability but so far nice and sharp.
B006838YSI|5|smells wonderful
B00CNOUZE2|4|Let me preface by saying the mirror itself works exactly as advertised - adheres *extremely* well to shower tile and barely fogs even with 20+ minutes of steam.<br /><br />That being said, the idiom &#34;measure twice, cut once&#34; is very important with this product! The mirror is slightly smaller than your head and the mounting unit can't be removed without destroying the adhesive, so take care with placing it exactly where you'll see it best. I accidentally adhered mine ~3 inches below eye level and realized too late that it can`t be removed or repositioned without buying a new mount. Ideally it would use a suction cup, but that would be much less secure so I can't really blame the manufacturer for my own poor planning!<br /><br />If there was a solution for repositioning the mirror without buying an entire new unit, I would gladly raise this review to 5 stars :)
B000AAAVSQ|1|I find it very difficult to apply
B007307O54|1|I am a Bobbi Brown eye and lip color user.  I ordered this color based on the name, Miami Coral 30, expecting it to be at least a medium coral if night a bright coral.  It is a yellow beige color and not remotely as described or pictured.<br />Skip it.
B004D00ZZS|1|I use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Compact Makeup SPF 55 for one year already and I loved it! But when I ordered 2 from here I was very disappointed. One box was already opened and the make-up was started!!! And the texture was strange in the other box, not like the product I usually use. So be careful!!
B006GQEWEC|5|This is my favorite lip butter color so far. It's a really lush, bright color that can be rocked so many ways. I love its versatility - I can wear this color anywhere. Your best bet for lip butters, if you're not a fan of the slightly sticky, lip glossy consistency, is to apply Chapstick underneath, and then stain your lips with the butter for a long lasting and more finished look. It won't be as glossy, but it won't be sticky either. Really a great product.
B003V249L0|5|most favourite for me!
B001VH6F9G|5|works great on my old braun...  I haven't used any other shavers and/or replacement foil/cutter so I can't compare, but this works well for me.
B00H7P41H4|3|Good for placing units on but not for styling purposes.  Easy to assemble.
B00SOVD6EE|2|The item says 24 count in the description but the shipping weight is 5 ounces. Is this one bottle or 24 bottles??
B000FQ73O0|4|Ive used Kirkland minoxidil and since switched to Equate brand. The equate brand seems to be less sticky and seems to dry faster. I would suggest using Equate instead.
B00PWANIGG|1|I was expecting to get more of a purple/fuscha color but what I got is pink. I have tons of pink polish didn't need any more.
B001EM1BBK|5|EcoTools seems to make awesome brushes.. They are soft and last a long time even after you wash them. Highly recommended.
B009WS6MUS|5|Exactly what was wanted.  They work great.
B00JJV2XL0|5|I gave it a week to do something, but in just four days, I was able to see spots lighten around my eyes! I dab a drop or two on my fingers and massage it around my eyes and voila! The spots got lighter!
B007P29354|5|I have recently begun wearing silk scarves, gathered and tied as wide headbands.  But the finer the quality of the scarf, the more likely it is to slip away.  I thought perhaps I could secure them in place by picking up hair from beneath the scarf and closing the barrette over the scarf.  These are absolutely perfect!  Not just functional, but beautiful.  And I love that they are open filigree, so that the scarf [or your hair] shows inside the clip, adding a touch of elegance with the silver wire design.
B001MA0QY2|4|I wish I didn't have to get it as hot as I do to straighten my hair but that's probably a personal problem.Good straightener, especially for the price. My girlfriend has the same one and after I used hers - I bought it! Very happy with it.
B00150LT40|5|They're not kidding when they say &#34;Fast Dry&#34;. Not only does it dry in no time,it also keeps my mani in great shape for two weeks or more!! Love this product!!!!<br />I was also impressed by how fast my order got to me..3 days!
B002T71IL2|5|Just used this product for the first time. Easy to apply. Colored my light brown lashes to black and hopefully will keep the color for the 28 days as advertised. Great for summer if you don't want to use mascara every day in the heat.
B000GRD2TS|5|I love this product!  It's fabulous!  Very silky, not grainy at all like some shea butters.  It's unrefined so it retains all it's healthful properties.  It has just the right hint of lavender.  I used it through my entire pregnancy and it kept the stretchmark monster away!  I'm a fairly slender woman and was ALL baby.  By rights I should have had a roadmap on my stomach!  Not one.  Not even a hint of a stretchmark!  I love it!
B00NSGDRAI|5|Good
B0106RBT10|5|I love it thank u so much
B003ZX32ZO|3|I just wish I had the opportunity to use these brushes more.
B00FQF0Y1Y|3|Its cheap but I like it and you obviously knew it was cheap when you bought it for such little money.
B008AIXTKC|5|This is the second bottle of this shampoo I've ordered.  I love what it does to my naturally gray hair.  So soft and shiny.  I don't even use conditioner anymore.  I ran out of this product and bought some other quality shampoo for gray hair from the local drug store (Jhirmack to be exact) and was very disappointed.  I promptly gave it to one of my blond nieces.  This giant bottle bottle last me almost a year.  You don't need to use much.  I hope they never change the formula because this stuff is perfect!
B00589O022|5|These are great! I use them to wipe my nails off and they leave nothing behind like cotton does. Love them!
B0000C88FZ|4|A good interum shaver.
B008CEDX8M|4|I really liked the product,however,the product does not last long at all. From what I was able to use it worked nicely. I would order again if the product came in a larger bottle.
B003Y3D2N2|5|As other users said, this fit perfectly in my Conair make-up mirror.  And, as other reviewers claim, I used a little nail polish remover to quickly and easily remove the blue &#34;paint&#34; on the bulb.  Works like a charm!
B000FZ4TGQ|5|Awesome creme & smell. No sticky residue, just smooth feet. Yes the jar is tiny however, requires small quantity based upon it's potency. Nonetheless, wouldn't mind a larger jar. 5 plus stars on smell & making my heels smooth!!!
B001UOMK76|5|I love Obagi products. They've always been good on my skin. The day cream is at a good price on Amazon, but the night cream is overly expensive on this site.
B0009V1YRS|5|I bought this item about 3 years ago. It is the perfect straightener. The price is a little high but it does what i says it will do, except in the description where it says it curls. It heats up very quickly and it really durable. I use it almost every day and it works perfectly. It doesn't damage my hair like most straighteners do. I don't know what people are talking about. The item doesn't break easily. They must have been throwing it around or not taking good care of it. I've had it for a long time and it still looks and works perfectly.
B0009RF8G0|3|I used boudreaux's butt paste from the first day I saw any sign of diaper rash until I started noticing these weird bumps that would form in the folds of my baby's fat. A friend of mine said it might be yeast. I don't know what it was, all I know is that it went away once I switched to Desitin. Having used both products here's what my opinion is:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Slides on smoothly and stays on<br />- Prevents and cures diaper rash<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Messy (messier than desitin too)<br />- Gets all over your hands and is hard to wash off (part of why it works so well keeping the skin protected I assume)<br />- leaves weird bumps on my baby's sensitive skin (looked almost like pimples or clogged pores)<br />- must wipe it off every time you change the diaper<br /><br />I liked desitin better because you don't have to wipe it off every time, it is easier to put on, it's not quite as messy, and it doesn't give my baby weird bumps. Either way I do think this product is good and I use it when I run out of the other stuff, but I can't use it too often or those stupid bumps come back.
B00BZWUSQI|5|I ADORE this product! It's basically got that lovely gardenia hawaiian smell and is SO moisturizing! Feels amazing on my skin! I mix it with a bit of coconut oil so it doesn't seize up and a few drops of gardenia oil and I'd swear I was wearing a $75 moisturizer. You'll love it.
B0007M3ZKI|5|Great for my skin and smells great.  A little expensive.
B000C231DY|5|this is my favorite. its very romantic. i usually wear this when im going out w my husband. he loves this on me. alittle goes a long way.
B00FUMKTJ0|5|This was a Christmas gift and she loved it. Thank you.
B00FLVGDXQ|5|I love it! ;0)
B007IVRASY|3|Great daily moisturizer. However I was very disappointed that the jar was half empty.  I don't mind paying for quality but if the jar is supposed to hold 8oz then i should get all 8oz.
B00HG1JFXY|5|Using this Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Thickening Treatment Formula Serum puts the “treat” in treatment when it comes to applying this gel like substance to your hair. Using this extremely easy and convenient product while improving the thickness and overall health of your hair is what makes this a real treat. I love the feeling of having thicker hair again and being able to feel the difference after using this product, when I run my hands through my hair. With this product, you can take it wherever you go and apply it either wet or dry, it's that simple! When you can thicken your hair and improve its overall fullness, it makes it hard to refuse this travel sized serum. Using Ultrax Labs Hair Lush Thickening Serum as recommended improves overall health, thickness of thin hair, hair loss, and gives you the confidence you once had before. l would recommend this thickening treatment to anyone having similar problems with thin hair or hair loss!
B00CQKWTP6|5|I love it!
B0000A10MZ|4|love it for its portability but I wish there were more pressure and more water capacity.
B000052YOX|5|My skin is really dry sometimes and extremely sensitive. This product left my skin feeling moisturized as moisturizers normally do and does not break me out more than i usually do. This doesn't have spf but i don't mind because i use another sunscreen in the morning and whenever i'm going out. I always try to take this with me to reapply because i love it so much! I also like that it doesn't have any irritating fragrances!
B0019CFKSK|5|Highly sought  after, discontinued blush/ highlighter duo from still. Such a perfect blush. I have fair skin with a slight yellow undertone and this looks great
B00ACF24BG|5|SO silky and soft.
B00E7HJZ8A|5|After having my hair dyed my hair became pretty dry and weak. I tried a TON of different products (including other argan oil-based ones), but nothing really worked. This shampoo is literally magic. After using The Argan Tree products, my hair has never been dry, and has started growing back thicker and healthier. I was having to trim every couple of months because of split ends, and it's been 4 months now and there is still no need for a trim. It is easier to style, looks visibly healthier, and feels great. Even though the dyed portion of my hair has grown out, I continue to use it - my hair is healthier and grows faster than it did even before the coloring. Don't be fooled by other and even cheaper argan oil products - they're usually not 100% pure argan oil and diluted with other substances. I definitely recommend this product!!
B000XE6336|1|Not very nice
B005G7QJRK|5|This was a gift for my daughter she loves it, and couldn't beat the price at amazon... I paid alot more for her first one at a store...
B000FBNYRU|4|It's a good highlighter. But I have really dry skin and have to blend it well if you want natural glow look
B00793N7Q0|5|Its great and its affordable! Unlike other men and women that prefer the smaller bottles,this is better! It smells good compared to the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner! Its alot thicker too,which I think is better!
B0002RPZSI|3|The unit looks nice, and includes everything advertised. The shelf for makeup is small, and there is only one outlet on the stand, so if you're hoping to plug in a curling iron AND hair dryer you're out of luck. There's also only one hook for an appliance, so it won't take as much clutter off the counter as you'd hope. Having said that, my wife is happy with it, and our bathroom looks nicer with it in place. <br />
B00NFZB5JM|4|This wig is awesome. My sister wore this on our vacation to Florida, and I had to order one for myself. It's full, tracks don't show in back. I'm happy with my purchase.
B0097G3XDY|5|This is a good product.
B001J6O118|5|These blades work well.  I am thankful it came in only a few days.  I needed it quickly & badly.  Douglas
B003X4MQM0|5|I love it, it's The only product that vive me a wonderful finish in my air
B008RXUIP4|5|I love Philosophy products very much. The Apricot & Cream is my favorite because not only does it smell devine, it works very well as a shampoo. All Philosophy washes are 3 in 1, but this one works best for me as all 3! My hair feels soft, but not weighed down. I highly recommend all products from Philosophy.
B0085N3DZI|4|These under eye gel pads apply and remove easily.  They are comfortable for the client and exactly what I needed to ensure the adhesive does not stick to the bottom lash.
B00GT0DBK6|5|Great set! Cute color and I went from G6 to 00G extremely fast! These didn't irritate my ears like some tapers do!
B001TVFI9M|4|Nice and light while effective
B002YPZ85G|4|Great iron! I've only ever owned a Croc. Looking at reviews, and the heads of people who own other brands, I will only ever own a Croc! It takes my very thick, very curly, non-relaxed hair and makes it smooth and silky!  My only complaint....I've bought two so far, and am about to buy my third one.  The first was done in by a power surge - no fault on my Croc.  The surge literally melted the plastic!  The second one lasted about a year and died at the very end of flat-ironing my hair last week.  I bought one from Sally's that was touted as being \\"great\\" and am not satisfied!  My hair looks like everyone else's!  THIS JUST WILL NOT DO!  It may be a yearly investment, but it's worth it!  I LOVE MY CROC!
B003H2AU8K|5|Great price. My fav conditioner for years.
B0036298GG|5|As with all Clarins products, quality is superior. The delivery was right on time, and the price was convenient. Thank you!
B001BDIDCC|5|Best concealing treatment I have ever used and a great improvement over Covermark. Finally a concealing treatment that blends with my skin and takes a few minutes to put on.
B00GQP8H8A|1|Cheap product
B00DH0TRYA|5|Pretty much exactly what I needed. It had enough room to hold my new set of Pueen plates as well as the rest of my collection (with room for a bit more). I'm definitely getting another when I get more plates!
B0036WTV2C|5|If it weren't for the Dr's Night Guard I would have had to have several of my teeth replaced by now.
B005HIH7YM|3|I loved how soft and smooth my hair was after using this, but the smell just gagged me.  The scent was so strong in the shower, and I hoped it wouldn't be as strong after it was rinsed and dried, but unfortunately I smelled it all day and it's gross.  If you're sensitive to smells, don't buy this.  I won't finish the bottle and definitely won't buy it again.
B000XJ92E8|4|I really like this brush for keeping in the shower to exfoliate my face. Its great for day-to-day dead skin removal. I would not recommend this if you have extreme dry skin or flaking. Like a peeling sunburn for example. The bristles are too long to really offer the leverage needed. This makes it perfect for gentle scrubbing you need for daily use.<br />This brush comes with a topper to put into. This is basically impossible after first use without bending out bristles. I don't really use it so it doesn't affect my usage. Topper does not have a hole in it or anything so there is no drainage so you wouldn't want to use it unless its dry anyway. Could be helpful for travel.
B0036IIFK0|4|I bought this cream for my aunt . She has a very dry skin and she is living in a dry and hot area . As she says  this cream is for her daily use and moisturizing her skin very well . She also put this cream for different occasions such as parties ...
B004UDQ6GK|5|Recently switched to this from the micro-sculpting cream based on reviews and am very glad I did. I need less product to achieve the same moisturized feeling and the packaging is designed to keep the active ingredients fresher longer (rather than the screw-top jar).
B00EOXX5YM|5|I have very pale skin and I live in Florida so of course I want to look like I have some tan without laying out and burning! I bought one bottle of this from Tan Physics website. I put this on after exfoliating and I love the color! I don't look fake just a little color.  I have also tried other stuff. This is the best for me.  I'm 60 yrs old and finally have a nice tanned appearance.  I will not be putting it on to deepen the color..just a little once a week will do for me! I would look silly with a dark tan!  This is a product that I will be keeping in stock for sure.<br /><br />It does have a color of its own which helps it to go on even and really helps out. You should have a hand mirror to look at places you can't see and if you see blotches...just rub it in more.
B001DKF08S|5|I really like this for use after radiation treatments.  It absorbs quickly even though it is thick and oily, leaves my skin moist but not greasy.  I will continue to use it beyond treatment.
B0006ZM4LC|4|It should be self-evident that the effectiveness of the shaver varies with the skin type and condition of the user. From my own experience, Remington Titanium is the best and most effective. But this Braun looks far more solid and feels better in hand. It is washable, international voltage, comes with a solid case, and can be used as corded shaver (when the battery is out).     But the shaver is all plastic, the rather cheapish kind, especially the part the screen is attached to. The trimmer is a bit sticky as well. Even my much cheaper Braun 1775 feels better built than this. The polished plastic handle looks nice from afar, but upon close examination, the quality isn't typical Braun as I know the brand. Hope it will last well. I am rather amazed by my Braun 1775 ($30) - the battery seems last forever and it works great. So I bought this 5775 as a impuls buy when I saw it at local Target for $56. But I am not so sure about it's life expectancy because the way this shaver was put together.    Based on my experience, the Remington is the loudest and worst looking and awkard to hold and use and the trimmer on it is useless. BUT it is the best shaver for me - as close as Gillette Fusion, seriously! I actually use the Remington 5200 to clean up what the Fusion has missed! But I am a sucker for the look and feel of the Brauns. I used rotary type in the past, but now I am completely convinced by the performance of these linear type shavers.     All in all, I like this one for what it is - not expensive and get the job done and looks cool!
B002ZKO3O2|2|It burns when you apply it and it smells really cheap. I really thought it would be better because of the reviews but it really is nothing like the lilac I had before.
B008RODQGG|5|This is a neat little diffuser.  I've been running it in our great room, so it doesn't overwhelm the room with scent.  My husband thought it was a little much for our smaller bedroom.  I really like it though--I've been using it for several months, and it makes my house smell like a spa.  I've been thinking of picking up a second one.  The light is pleasant too, and it's nice that you can turn off the light but still have it diffusing.
B000NL0T1G|5|Solid as a rock.
B000HHOPDE|5|Apply carefully and enjoy your manicure for weeks instead of days!
B00LVPDBA4|5|I really like this product and it does  a better job cleaning my teeth than just a standard toothbrush.  No complaints, and I am picky.  When I got this it was also a great deal at Amazon.
B000HM737Y|5|good buy
B004DHFVG4|3|stain doesn't last, comes off right away
B0045XSLWW|5|I get my nails done every 2 weeks in the nail salon and I always ask to have a marble design...it comes out great...but it does not look like marble...then I heard of OPI shatter...too expensive...then I found this...purchased it and wow the marble effect I wanted!I still get my nails done...but I get only clear polish...go home and polish my nails then I put on crackle...I get so much compliments on my nails and the price is just right! wish I could post a pic!
B00243FKNS|2|This left a weird film on my hair and there was a crack at the bottom of the bottle - half of the product dripped out on my tub and surrounding area.
B00H7KTEZ8|2|Nice foot soak but did absolutely nothing for fungus problem.
B005FK3M46|5|This set comes with a ridiculous amount of stamps for a very low cost. I was happy. Some of the stamps are a little weird, but some are just down right awesome. Worth the buy for me!
B0007KZWL0|5|I love this fragrance! It is soft and pretty. I feel feminine when I wear it. Perfect for summertime. I was pleased when it arrived and the description I read was accurate.
B00BJMSVKO|5|greattttt !!
B002MXPBY8|5|I highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone who is frustrated with the typical dryer found in stores.  It is of professional grade, will dry your hair much faster and the dryer itself will last for many years if the proper care is given.  This is of a different quality than what you can buy in a retail store.  It is made to last forever--think of how many heads a stylist must dry all day!  I tell all clients and friends that the Salono brand is the ONLY dryer to buy.  You won't be disappointed--worth every penny.  Use the nozzle, too!  Makes a difference when drying straight hair.
B000U0F9GA|5|Really great mirror. The light and magnification really help when doing eyebrows and checking for unwanted hair growth. The mirror also has a plug where you can plug in another small item.  It is sturdy and compact.
B0058E3XJI|5|Love the product!
B00H7KTEZ8|5|It really working wonders, I was expecting from something &#34;tea tree&#34; be good. But this salt kind of exceeded my expectations, we (my hubby and I) are both happy with it. It gives really-really tired feet an excellent relief. Highly recommend it for bad feet as well, as my husband has feet that not getting tired, they are all &#34;burning&#34; etc. And this salt-bath gives it much needed relief.
B005J60Z2I|5|This mask is great. Your face feels well hydrated and smoother even after one use. Absolutely love it and recommend it!!!
B003156OLA|5|My husband had used it for as long as it was out.  I don't know why they discontinued it since it was out only a few years and very hard to find
B00827ILWM|2|Substandard. I think.
B00CR2NBW8|5|Bought this to replace the same model I'd had for a couple of years or so. This is one of the best sponges I've found. Just abrasive enough to feel like you're getting really clean, but never irritating to the skin. Really love it.
B00FCJYB6I|5|I was already a fan of the Tea Tree Oil and was pleased to see that Chamuel's Sweet Almond Oil is just as wonderful a product.  Again, the bottle is HUGE!  My biggest complaint about essential oils is that they cost so much for so little for a quality oil.  I am thrilled with the quality and quantity of the Chamuel Oil products.  No skimping here!  Just great value for a great product.  Now that winter is coming, I am so glad I have enough oil on hand to keep my skin moisturized.  Fantastic product!
B0016A7CHW|5|This product was recommended to me by an aesthetician at a spa in Scottsdale AZ as I have a little mild rosacea on my face.  I have used it for 5 months now and love it. It feels so calming when I put it on my skin.  Leaves my skin soft.
B00GJ33RIO|1|BEWARE : CONTAINS SLS<br />how can they say honest and use SLS. I will never buy again nor recommend.
B00WQY2PDI|5|Great tools, good case, solid purchase overall.
B000NJE4UA|1|I was expecting 4a,4b curl pattern . instead after washing and using Loreal power moisture conditioner. this item is easily 2B,2C hair type. this purchase for practice roller sets on kinky natural afro textured hair. give it 1 star bc the details are inacurate and way off.  aside from that its soft wavy hair and easily detangle during the Loreal power moisture conditioner application. its nice and approperiate for those looking for 2B,2C hair type. I will keep it and make use of it.
B004SGKMA0|5|Standard in our house for our shaving needs.
B001E767EQ|5|I really hope they never stop making this product. I discovered it a couple years ago at my local natural/organic type Coop market. It has become a staple in my bathroom. I use it every day to MIX IN with some of my facial moisturizers. I mix it in with a sunscreen moisturizer that is too thick, it does a nice job at diluting it. I also find that some of the facial moisturizers I use at night (anti aging) or the ones that are for acne prone skin to be just too darn strong! The Earth Science Face & Body Skin Care Balm allows me to dilute these products and make them milder, yet still effective (and of course save a few pennies depending on the products involved).<br /><br />PROs<br />- natural! No nasty chemicals or ingredients. The first three ingredients are completely natural (water, aloe, witch hazel) and the rest are pretty innocuous sounding<br />- I used to use a Neutrogena Moisture product that was pretty mild, but found that this one is even milder.<br />- This product is completely noncomedogenic (at least to my skin)<br /><br />CONs<br />- The only thing that is sort of bad about this product is its smell. It isn't horrible as some reviews state, but it isn't great either. The smell does dissipate pretty quickly anyway (as in, it won't linger on your skin all day long the way a cologne would).<br />- It is a little non-rich, which some would think of it as a great thing. But that isn't an issue for me because as I stated above I mix it in with other, super rich moisturizers to achieve a nice blend.<br /><br />This is a wonderful product. I hope they never stop making it. I buy it by the bulk here on Amazon now.
B0067K7XDY|5|Excellent product. It really makes rough hands soft.
B007U7TORG|4|Exactly what I wanted...
B009DU4QYE|5|My mom purchased this for me after years of struggling with oily hair due to PCOS. I have to admit, I giggled at the name, but it is straight and to the point! I have noticed a big difference in my hair in so many ways. I guess my hair was so bogged down with oil and build up from other shampoos, that this just feels like a miracle shampoo! I usually use twice and follow the directions, leaving it in 3 minutes at a time. First application never seems to penetrate as much as I'd like, but the second one?! Holy lather heaven! My hair is really dry-feeling before blow drying, but that doesn't bother me at all. I brush from tips to roots, which minimizes tangles (but I've always been tangle-prone)! My hands also feel a little bit dry after using, but I do not care, there is lotion for that!...it is solving my horribly oily hair (usually need to wash twice a day to not feel grossed out by the oil)... and after a blow dry my hair not only feels amazing, but is very soft and seems to have a fuller look! I also feel like I ALWAYS have to straighten my hair...but with this product, it does something to my hair that allows me to go without straightening it. Miracle shampoo!
B001MA0QY2|5|I still have a hard time believing the price I paid for this gem. Save your bucks and go with this iron!  Don't think twice, just do it. A gazillion positive reviews can't be wrong. Works just as well as my Paul Mitchell iron. I also like the oil that came with it! I am very pleased.
B00AAI8D3I|5|Do yourself a favor and buy these pendant necklaces!  You will find no better company and better customer service than GreenAir.  Their products are great and they care so much about their customers!  These necklaces are the cutest thing, and functional too!  Customer for life!!
B0056OPVLI|5|My salon started using this brand about three years ago, and stocking it about a year ago.  I am pretty happy I can order it on Amazon instead of schlepping to the day spa anytime I run dry.  While it is slightly cheaper than other  high-end brands like Kerastase and Bumble and Bumble, I swear by the Milbon brand, especially for my fine, highlighted blond hair.  My hair is in wonderful condition after using it; less flyaway, and it seems stronger and shinier.
B006DR2DI6|2|disappointing, no fragrance. Outside bar irritated skin with use.
B004LZ7WEC|5|I originally bought this from my hairstylist, and then online.  It does what it is supposed to do. LOVE IT
B003YJ9YBU|5|Favorite Cleanser
B00CCNQYUS|5|I have found that this toy has added another dimension to my love life.  My husband and I have found that it make things feel a little snugger and it gives his penis something sold to rub against especially at climax.  I has been a lot fun exploring new things.  I do recommend warming it up in your hand before inserting it and also use lots and lots of lube. Unless you like sensation play.
B00C0C6CZS|5|Amazing.  I have some acne scarring that was depressed and ice pick like.  After using this just once - last night - the overall depression of the area is decreased and the ice pick scars are much less noticeable.  The whole area looks much more normal and filled in.  I understand that this might be due to some initial swelling, but it seriously looks 80% better overnight.  Will try to remember to update on whether the effect is lasting.  Great product though, and cheap enough to simply replace as needed.
B003V360NY|5|I got this shaver a few weeks ago to replace a Panasonic Vortex unit.  I have to say, so far, it rocks in every way.  It is super quiet - not even half as loud as the Panasonic.  It is close, and it is quick.  It shaves closely even when I have two days' growth, which is much more than I could say for the Panasonic. They have some very good deals on this item now - shop around and do a Google search for a rebate.  You won't regret buying this item.
B00GDSLYEE|5|It does a great job to my hair
B00QRO56LQ|5|Very cute purse bottles great for perfume
B000O3UC06|5|Simply the best skin lotion for healing burned/damaged skin.
B000BFTAMS|5|I have used this for years! Tried other expensive products and have gone backt to Ponds! I am 46 and people always say I have great skin and I tell them that it's because of Ponds!! My 24 year old daughter loves it too! Not greasy, my skin feels great all day!
B004EFG4BG|5|Excelent !!!
B004V45E4I|5|My husband love it!!!! And it smells great!!!
B004WG4CQ6|5|This nail hardener is amazing, I wasn't able to have long nails for the last 4 years, now thanks to Quimica Alemana my<br />nails are hard, long and beautiful. Thanks,
B00HLZ8SG0|4|Looks good when take pictures but doesn't look good in real life.... Oh well...
B005XIDZHO|5|Awesome product. It does the job
B001TKOHMM|5|Something good, logistics soon.
B00BFFQMBA|5|I was told about Ultrax Labs Hair loss blocking a month ago and have been using it ever since. i knew ahead of time that i would definitely have to wait a few weeks to really decipher weather this product was effective or not. I googled and looked up videos on youtube to have a visual of the results ahead of time and I must say i have noticed a huge difference in thickness of my hair. My hair has gotten fuller and I am honestly just so pleased. I've tried a few things here in there just because I've always been insecure about my hair and finally came across something that works. It takes time so just be patient and give it a chance. Trust me, you will not be disappointed. I also have seen a huge stop in shedding as well!
B00ATNWDL2|5|Quick and easy way to gel color your nails. They do chip if you abuse them but since I don't have that issue I can wear them for about ten days to two weeks. Thank you.
B00JVVB0T4|5|This is my favorite makeup. It is very light (not heavy on the skin) but offers great coverage of blemishes in the skin, dark spots etc.
B002HWS9G6|4|We travel extensively and this is just the toothbrush to take.  The only reason it did not get 5 stars is that it goes through batteries rather fast and it is hard to get the bottom off to replace them.
B00DJY8UMY|5|I like this a lot. It has feels like a very rich leave in conditioner. But there is some hold and weight to it that allows for nice defined soft springy curls and twists. It works really well on my natural hair and I will definitely be getting it again! Great product.
B00CVDTMI0|4|Did swatches of all of them. They go on really nice, yes there are a lot of browns, not a fan, but I like about 50% of the colors, the ones that weren't brown,  and for the price? It's a good buy.
B0101212YE|5|Perfect!
B001AWZ5L6|5|I got this flat iron about 6 years ago and it JUST stopped working. Best flat iron and I've even owned a chi.<br />Will be purchasing again.
B001Q5CYZM|4|This somehow strengthens nails, had really bad splits up the middle to the quick that i couldn't get rid of by cutting.  When i used this, they stopped splitting after using every other day for a week or so.  When i stopped using this the splitting returned.  Oil isn't cheap but only takes a a couple drops to do all your nails.  It's a little messy since it's oil, but my painful splits are gone.
B003XDVERE|5|Better price on item I use all the time. There was never any at the market. So I bought a lot of 6 & saved.
B0091BKNSS|1|Dry!
B00H56KCUU|5|Inexpensive and really smoothens my face! I love this!
B00C1965H0|4|The next time i'am ask it will be this product.  Oh wait I forgot to tell you that theres hardly any loose hair so the price<br />Is best of all thanks.  wish it was in other colors!!!!!
B00G2JURC4|5|Great Product... so good in fact my neighbor &#34;stole it&#34; having noticed the difference in my skin
B00HSDHW2G|1|0 stars! Enclosed is picture of what is sent when you order. 3 brushes next to a dinner fork. You decide if this is what is decipted in description.
B007XJ6DXE|5|Great product.  I've a drawer full of different ridge filling base coats and this one is the only one I use.
B000YT5NIG|5|Product arrived as promised and well packeged.
B000QUSAQ0|4|I have adult acne, and I've had it for years now. Salicylic acid doesn't do anything for me, and benzoyl peroxide just dries up my face. (Not to mention, it doesn't seem to stop my breakouts) This Clearasil product is the only thing that will stop the acne for awhile. My problem never seems to go away 100%, but as long as I am using this, it seems to put a halt on new pimples. When it is on my face, it feels like a mud mask AND it smells! But that is a small price to pay for something that actually works.
B00JMHF8EU|5|It's awesome, just the right amount for trying to keep shorter hair tame!!
B0043TUSME|3|Color in photo not a good representation of the shade you're considering.  I wouldn't have purchased it had I have known.  Quality of CoverGirl  product is what you have come to expect.  However, it's best to buy this one personally rather than shop it from a photo.
B003AYEFU4|5|I absolutely LOVE this product! I received it complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster in their VoxBox and it is perfect for my wavy hair! It is just enough hold to &#34;scrunch&#34; my hair and leave it still feeling touchable!
B00GTC0DYQ|4|It took about 5 shampoos (it recommends 3) before I noticed an affect on my split ends. But there was a difference.  The nice thing is that it didn't build up too much so I had greasy or limp hair.  I've found it best to use suave products in pairs to get the best results.  And to give them several washings to do so as well.
B007IUPZJG|5|My sister told me about this product after seeing it on the Today show- I decided to give it a try.....It has worked miracles for me. My hair definitely is fuller etc. It will always be a staple in my hair product supplies!
B007XNEXGY|4|I have definitely noticed a boost in my tan in the past few days since using this lotion! I personally just don't like the smell & the Orange streaks that I've gotten. Overall, I would recommend this lotion.
B007TKZI74|3|ordered this a while ago to put on my nails. many of the hello kitties have messed up faces. usually hello kitty has a yellow nose. these do not. just so you know they are not rounded to fit your nails. but they are still very cute. came with a bunch of hello kittys and bows.
B003X4G25C|5|I am very pleased with my purchase.
B001DHI0R4|4|This color was a bit bright for me, but I liked that it didn't go on as dry as some other lip stains.  This seller is awesome and included some tips in the package.  I followed one of them and am using a brush to apply so that I can get a more subtle shade. Also, did I mention this seller is awesome? My package arrived quickly with some special extra touches that are pretty rare these days. :)
B000052YQ2|5|I like this product I have sensitive skin and it doesn't cause me to breakout at all.  it leaves my face soft I have gotten comments since I started using it about how nice my skin looks
B00GOBPDAG|5|Good product
B000C1Z4WQ|5|Got this as a present for my mommy's birthday and she absolutely loved it. The bottles are gigantic and the price was awesome. I definitely will be getting this product again for other women in my life.
B001G5FOLI|5|These are my go to blades, I've tried many but I keep coming back to Feather.  They are aggressive and cut well.  The quality is top notch and consistent compared to other blades.  I can get about two weeks out of each blade before having to replace them.
B001T8QJM0|4|Not what I was trying to order, good product but much too large of a size for thin hair
B0000535UM|5|I'm 23 years old and started noticing my hair getting thinner and weaker. I switched my regular shampoo and tried a few different \\"natural\\" shampoos - Burts Bees, Organics Olive Oil, and a few others but this JASON brand has been the best thus far. Smell is a subtle minty \\"barbershop\\" smell - masculine and clean. It leaves my hair feeling soft, and my hair has been very strong since using this. At first my scalp would tingle slightly - I do not feel that anymore, but did not mind when I did - I actually liked the sensation because it felt like the shampoo was working hard. Try using this shampoo with the condition by JASON - also very high quality. Only downside is the price - its more expensive than other \\"natural\\" brands but I think its worth it considering the downside of sulfates and various chemicals.
B004NCFOZM|5|I got a sample of this lotion in a birchbox about a year ago, fell in love with it, then found the full size on Amazon.  At the time, my skin was all over the board.  I was getting breakouts and felt like every lotion/cleanser combo I was trying was making it worse.  This lotion, for some reason, was perfect.  I typically have &#34;normal&#34; skin, dry in the winter and combo in the summer, and use this moisturizer year round.  If I am feeling on the dry side, I will use the lotion on my entire face, let it soak in a while, then mix a little more in with my foundation.  My skin has been clear, softer, brighter, and I have noticed the tiny lines that were beginning to appear around my eyes are gone.  Love it, recommend it.
B00PTF3VSE|5|Was very happy with my order
B0040078RY|1|These really aren't good.  I ended up throwing them away.  The edges are too blunt and do not grab the hairs.
B000Z63VSC|3|The powder works okay on my face.  I find it's hard to get the powder into the brush.  I personally wouldn't buy this type of powder application again.  I had a similar one from Channel that I found easier to use.
B00OT4DGG8|5|I loved these. Glitter is always a little messy so I do my eyes before my foundation. Only on special occasions though, very pigment especially when used with glitter glue and mac fix+
B000TD5K0S|5|I have tried many brands on the market, Skinceuticals, Obagio...you name it.  I keep coming back to Fenix.  It is a moisturizer and Sunscreen all in one.  Love love love this.  When I run I still use a sweat-proof Neutrogena product, but for my daily regular use this is my go to project.<br /><br />Update June 2013:  This is still my go to Sunscreen for every day wear.
B00CRKHGUS|1|it does not really warm up that much and it takes a long time to get the whole hair done. Unfortunately it is too late for a return but I would not recommend for purchase
B005A8ICIO|5|Love this perfume.  It smells wonderful.  I would highly recommend it.
B0009OAHRI|5|Lovely, classy smell!
B001126YXS|5|Excellent
B001L6V0U6|5|This soap lasts forever, it smells wonderful and it really has become part of what perks me up in the morning. I hope they never change I might use this soap the rest of my life. It was actually worth the money, not just for quality but for economy. This soap is harder, dries faster and lasts longer than the alternatives. It is designed to work best with a light lather which creates the perfect amount of lubrication and softens the hair.
B0020MMNHY|5|What a delightful surprise to find I love the smell of the perfume as much as the lovely container.
B00E4MR99A|5|I have Neutrogena products for many years And then my Dermatologist told me to only use this product I just changed from one face soap to this one And I really like it
B00JZJLNP8|5|As advertised, quick shipment, great scent. Recommended seller.
B000GIL0IW|4|good
B002VECIU8|5|great purchase...love this color and service was wonderful
B008OHVVZE|5|I love this product my stylist uses it on my hair weekly when I'm home. I bought it for traveling with me and I'm unable to make my weekly appointment. This is the second bottle I've purchased.
B000NG808A|5|I have been using this shade of OPI nail polish for several years and then found it was being discontinued - yikes - say it isn't so - love that color. Looked \\"high and low\\" to find it to no avail and had thinned out the 2 bottles I had till I could no longer use it so went to Amazon.com and hurrah there it was - I ordered 5 bottles - that should last a little while until OPI brings it back---- hopefully.<br /><br /> Love the color and the shine and receive many compliments.
B009O8XRK4|3|Thank you for the perfume, but I received the perfumes opened.
B0026VN8N2|1|The rollers do not get hot enough to curl your hair no matter how long you let them heat.  The clips that come with the rollers will not hold them securely in your hair.  I have returned them.
B00L4EX7XS|3|Just okay
B002W53LFW|3|had to get the bangs cut it all so has  a cow lick in the bangs will not stay down  flat the cap is not right cant get it to fit need it to go around the ear  it don't do that will  not wear it like that  but other than that its a nice wig
B00D9NV2D4|5|The Shea butter is of excellent quality, we have been using it for homemade hair products and skin moisturizing and have been more than satisfied with the results.
B00012FFPW|3|small
B0031DF8LO|4|You can't go wrong with Hawaiian Tropic.  It's always my first choice when it comes to sun screen.
B00BZ02FYS|5|Bought this for my Franky Cosplay, and styled it myself.<br /><br />After the styling it was a hit at the convention I attended.
B00O2DQO4C|5|This stuff really works, I had looked everywhere for something that would help my dance and running shoes and this is the best ever. I apply it on my feet as well and it helps a lot. Great product. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B003VMU63K|5|This is the only Gelish that required only one coat for full coverage.  It is a nice colour.  I prefer the Gelish colours to all of the other Gel Polishes out there that I have tried.
B00CP6FTSA|3|Thought they were real mink, for the price I guess they are ok but you can tell they are fake
B000FS05VG|5|BEST HAIR DRYER EVER!!! I'm so glad I purchased this... my hair has never felt so smooth and looked so shiny. Thank you Amazon for another great beauty tool
B004GF8RYG|5|I WAS SEARCHING AND SEARCHING FOR THIS LOTION BECAUSE OF THE FANTASTIC RESULTS I WOULD GET FROM MY TANNING SALON WITH IT.  IN THE SALON THEY WERE CHARGING ME $10 FOR A TINY CUP OF IT, BUT I WOULD GLADLY PAY BECAUSE IT MADE EACH TAN LAST LIKE FIVE TIMES LONGER AND WOULD SAVE ME MONEY.  IT CAN'T BELIEVE I FOUND IT HERE AT THIS INCREDIBLE PRICE.  THIS LOTION WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT TANNING AND WHAT TANNING CAN DO FOR YOU.  IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS THAT DON'T THINK TANNING WORKS, HAVE THEM TRY IT WITH THIS LOTION AND I GUARANTEE THEY WILL BE REGULAR TANNERS!
B00J8UJNU6|2|Not worth the money.  Works no better than any other eye care product.  Disappointed.
B000A3V21S|5|Item as described. Fast shipment. I've been using these for years. Helps to keep my facial skin smooth.
B003D7YOTU|5|not only does it make your hair smell good, but it also makes your hair SILKY soft
B00ADUWL0Y|5|This is a beautiful perfume that is very hard to get.<br />I first used it in about 1992 and purchased the 3.3 oz size which lasts me a fair while. Every opportunity I get I buy the same large size. The perfume continues to work for me in excess of 18 hours which is amazing. It is a fantastic fragrance.<br />Gail
B003LW4L2W|5|After lots of research I decided to venture away from the multiblade razors and try a doeble edged (safety) razor. I decded on this this razor because of the price and good reviews. There is honestly nothing bad I can say about it.  It provided the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.  I normally get bad razor burn, or bumps from shaving with one of the multiblade or fusion razors, however after only 2 shaves with this my skin is clear and smooth. This is my first safety razor so I can not compare it to other safety razors, but I can say hands down it is better and more cost efficient than any of the multiblade razors. I tossed my Pro fusion and mach 5 after my first shave with this...
B00336EUU4|3|I been using the gentle crust regularly and just finished my box.... Here's the results:   - My teeth seams to be whiter but not alot. Please look at the back of the box it's indicate that there will be NO \\"Dramatic Whitening Results\\"    - I didn't experienced any sensitivity which I felt with the other regular crust strips.  - I'm about to go back and use the other crust because I do want to see dramatic shades difference and try to put it for 4 min 30 sec instead of 5 min.  Beside... There is Satisfaction Guaranteed so I'll return this product (package & invoice within 60 days of purchase) and use the money to buy the other strips.
B0009R5CA2|5|[[ASIN:B0009R5CA2 Cotton Clouds 220's White (100% Cotton Cosmetic Pads)]]<br /><br />Why wonder what to buy when you see so many packages of cosmetic cotton pads.<br />THIS IS IT!!!  COTTON CLOUDS is the \\"King\\" of all cotton pads. THE VERY BEST!!!<br />I use it every day in so many different ways.  Great for removing nail enamel, gentle around my eye area, then I wet the pad and use it with my cleanser and toner to remove my make-up.  In fact, when I've had a very long day, I soak the pads in ice water, wring them out, and then place the COTTON CLOUDS over my eyes for a while.  When I get up I'm usually refreshed and re-charged.  I never want to be without COTTON CLOUDS, and I love to buy them on Amazon, since I shop here all the time for so many other items.  And for Travel I take along the TRAVEL SIZE.  The bag is smaller and so easy to pack.  I never leave home without them.  Try it for yourself to see how really great COTTON CLOUDS are.  Once you do, I'm sure you'll be hooked like I am and so many members of my family as well.
B00GDULTRE|5|Good & affordable
B0013J99FO|5|I have previous experience with this sharpener and it does an excellent job on keeping a blade sharpened if used regularly. This one was bought as a spare in case they are not available when the one I am using breaks or wears out in the future.
B00HUX0U50|1|Product was old and hard.
B00HRP3T2W|1|I RECEIVED PLASTIC HAIR. literally. it was in the trash as soon as i opened the package.  Total disappointment. It was also beyond shiney, my niece wouldn't even wanna wear them. Maybe i got the bad hair out the bunch?
B001A4826E|5|great
B001G7Q0FA|5|I'm very pale and usually bronzers don't go on evenly but this one does.  It looks really natural.  I think the lip bronzer in the lid is useless but the moisturizer/bronzer is great.
B0001ZWUBQ|4|I love the smell of Avon shampoos and conditioners (I use the Straight and Sleek ones).  They really make my hair FEEL softer, but I haven't noticed a big difference in the condition of my hair.  This is only a regular conditioner (vs. intensive conditioner) so I know it only has short term effects.  In other words, only deep/intesive/treatment conditioners actully improve the condition of your hair over time (according to Paul Mitchell).  Regular conditioners mostly help to detangle, and in that case, Avon conditioner does a great job of that.    I just use an intensive conditioner weekly to make up for it.
B002XURD32|5|I absolutely love the Clarisonic Mia.  Im thirty four and have always had mild acne and my skin was starting to look and feel dull.  Adding the Mia to my skincare routine has made a huge difference in the texture and clarity of my skin.  After three months of using once a day to cleanse my skin my breakouts have drastically declined and my skin is more vibrant and youthful.  I was using the facewash that came with it in the beginning which wasnt ideal for me but once I switched to a milder cleanser I started to see results.  Highly recommend!
B00W4H25LE|5|the best
B00404TBAW|5|have a lot of women around me that love its smell at work
B0013945H6|5|I have been using this shampoo for 6 months with the conditioner. I have noticed a distinct difference in my hair and scalp. I am also noticing small new hair around the hairline. I have read some people don't like the smell but I love it. Both the shampoo and conditioner last quite a while.  The smell - to my nose- is very herbal. It also has a cooling effect on my scalp.
B000KHKH92|4|I usually hate hand sanitizer, they usually have a slimy feel that dries sticky. This one makes your hands feel silky. The sent is strong, but not offensive. Because it is made from essential oil, rather than an artificial fragrance, it is a crisp smell, not chemical, and it fades quickly. Maybe the first minute it seems to strong smelling.
B001F71L8C|5|It Cleans better than any Denture Cleaner I have every find. It's the best!!!! That's is how come I gave it 5<br />Stars.
B00MNNA20A|5|I will be buying more when I start to run out.
B00CFDDNW2|5|the shipment arrived as expected
B00N41JF08|1|These batteries are a joke I don&#34;t know how people get away with this crap!!!!!!!
B000J45DTU|1|This doesn't work at all, wet or dry feet.  Nothing came off my feet.  Sandpaper would work better
B002HWS9GG|5|I have one and purchased this for my daughter. I really think this is a good product, my daughter loves hers. Good purchase and I highly recommend it.
B005U8DZ4A|1|This made my tongue very sore, even after watching a video to make sure I was doing it correctly. I would not recommend this product.
B000IZ8KZ4|1|This shampoo did not get my hair clean. The product doesn't lather well either. I had to use more than usual to feel like I was getting enough in my hair.
B0029ULZOY|5|This is my children's favorite, go to every time! Ages 16, 11, 6.  Even my 6 year old son wants to wear it.  It is smooth, not greasy.  I am not a fan of the vanilla smell for most products out there, but 100% pure has it right with this lotion.  And if you are a family like mine, that strictly do not use products that have chemicals added, then this is a must have lotion.  We have used many products from 100% Pure and have loved them all.  From make-up, lotion, body wash.  I have fine blonde hair and I love their glossy-locks product, which doesn't weigh down my hair but helps to style it. Check out their website for additional products.
B00DCHA6SO|5|Just got this n there great! Fast shipping too!
B0017I53AQ|4|I agree with Huffman,  It's the best lighter that I've ever owned. You could weld with it. Last weekend attended the Ybor City Cigar Heritage Festival and everyone that saw and used my lighter loved it.  All cons are true.  I had to carry a refill in my truck (but I lit about 30 cigars that day).  WARNING! The words about burning your hand are understated.  In addition to being dangerous when you can't see which side is up, people that aren't familiar with it will think the bottom is the top because of the round hole in the bottom (punch).  So I rarely just hand it to someone to use. 1/4 second pop on your hand with this thing will blister the heel of your palm if you have the burner turned up.    But I would buy another one, without hesitation.
B002CPPTZM|5|Great product
B006T2AQSY|5|I used this 4 times (my hair is thin and I did not need much each time, so 1 bottle was enough for 4 applications). my hair is significantly lighter - i had dyed it black for 2 years. It does only work to a certain extent. my hair is no longer black, but it is more coppery than my normal light brown. this is because of the dye, not this product. I am getting married soon and needed a way to get my original hair color back, this was a good product. If you need to redye your hair for an event however, do it at least 3 months before hand just in case you need a professional when it's done. I spaced the applications out over 4 weeks, and this worked best i think, rather than 2 and 2 as the bottle suggests. I would definitely buy this again, and will likely not need to spend $100+ to change my hair again before my wedding, so i am a happy camper :)
B007Q35I1U|5|I first ordered a purple flowered Vogmask because of an allergy cough I couldn't get rid of. Then I saw the other colors and decided to get a couple more so I could more or less match the mask with my outfits. I really like it! And it really does help keep the coughing away.
B009GYVMAS|4|I really liked this product. It looks and feels so good within minutes of application. I've been using it for about a month and my blackheads have diminished significantly. I've also noticed that my skin in a lot more smoother. Just use it after exfoliating and it produces the best results.
B00DJNNZ70|3|This product works great at first but unfortunately dries out pretty quickly
B00192AQ5M|5|One of my favorite Avon perfumes...of course the ones you like, the ones they don't keep.  My sister and I love this perfume, and now it is very hard to find.  My shipment came very quickly, and my sister was in heaven that she can still get her favorite perfume.<br />My order came very quickly, and in excellent shape.<br />I hope the supplier has a good supply -- I need to stay stocked, and so does my sister!!!
B003IUAZR2|4|I use in my home made cleaning products.  I wish it had a dropper plug but it works great and I use a plastic pipet that came with old synthetic oil refreshened I no longer purchase anyway.
B002JAXW6S|5|I got him this for use at my house and he liked it so much he ditched his old one and takes it back & forth from his place to mine.
B00JPNQC2S|5|Very beautiful
B0046MZNH8|5|I have battled finding a pale enough shade that doesn't look fake for my skin. I have a very rosy fair complexion, a pinky milky mix with dry combination skin to boot. This done did it! I wish Anemic was in a liquid foundation, I would buy it in a heartbeat. This blends my under eye coverage and controls the shine from a long day. The pigment is very light, obviously, but I would not recommend to use it as your sole weapon of evening out your complexions- I do, but that is only because I can't find a great foundation color. I had apprehension since it was Manic Panic brand, something I hadn't used since I dyed my hair fire engine red years back. Take a chance on it, you won't be sorry!
B00FAEOCP0|5|Amazing!
B007L51ET8|5|especialy left side
B000C23698|5|I love this perfume and have used it for over 20 years. Scent of carnations when you wear this.
B00JCZTDFC|5|These are really great for getting moisturizer out of the jar, however I really did not need 100, I guess they will last a long time...great price and fast shipping : )
B0072CP1VW|5|Application is smooth and stays on all day.
B00CLILRMY|5|I wasn't sure about this product as I usually do not like serums and do not see much results with them. This is a wonderful, easy to apply product. It deeply moisturizes and also has reduced redness and broken capillaries. I have small spider veins on my face and large pores. This stuff works like magic to tighten pores and reduce any redness. I will be getting this again and again! A little goes a long way because it spreads so easily so it is a very good value too.
B0090UJFYI|3|Watery, does not seem to moisturizing my skin, or it is just not for me. I don't know. I have ordered another brand and it works much better.
B0006Q23H6|2|I have used these products for a few years now and have been very happy with both the Evening Primrose Shampoo for Dry Hair and their Lavender and Avocado Intensive Conditioner.  As of my last purchase (12/08), I found that the company has definitely changed their formulas for the worse.  Having loved the scents of these products in the past, they are now mediocre.  The quality seems to have degraded also, as my hair does not respond as well as it did previously.  Have any other regular users noticed this?
B000FYVOJC|5|My first experience with this type device.  Was really surprised how easy the process, and how good the result.  Completely satisfied.
B0017HRQVQ|2|The tube was damaged upon delivery and some of it was leaking out. :/ It is a bit runny.  I ordered fair to light, but it is WAY darker than my skin tone and too orange. The product has a very pleasant smell though.
B004AIZZ1M|4|Nice and convent. It has a little bit of perfume like smell, but goes away rather quickly. Since I wash my hands so many times a day, this helps keep my cuticles much nicer.
B003AAVAM4|5|I love the smell of this UNISEX fragrance.  It is very fresh and crisp, and most importantly UNIQUE.  I've had my bottle since last summer and am about halfway through, but once I run out will definitely be purchasing again.
B0068ZWGIU|1|I bought this perfume off of HSN. My mom told me I could either pick snooki perfume or Vera Wang Princess. I chose snooki and highly regret it. The Bag is nice but the perfume smells really cheap. It has no pretty fragrance to it like Vera Wang. She asked me if I liked it. I said yeah, but if I could return it, I would
B000PNXBVW|2|Been using it for over 1 month. It stings real bad and leaves my face burning, itchy and red, I've gotten lots of peels in the past and never got that. My skin hasn't improved much just got drier and flaky (which led to clogged pores and break outs)
B00080M1OK|5|I received my bottles of Rejuvinol AM/PM from Amazon. The delivery was so prompt- it came to Canada, no less, in a really short period of time. The recommended usage is 2 x per day so I am on my 5th application with no trouble at all. I have mild rosacea and combination skin somewhat thinned by retinol. Today it looks smooth & even & almost a little less wrinkled. I'm 52 so there are some definite creases in there that I really don't expect a topical to rid, but the general appearance after 2 days looks pretty good. I topped it with Valmont 24 hour cream mixed with a little bit of foundation. I see an order for a full bottle in the future if this keeps up. And I was so very skeptical......WOW! I really love the fast shipping to Canada and the efectiveness of the Rejuvinol. Keep up the good work!
B004Z209HS|5|Very nice n velvety texture does not leave skin greasy makes my skin  nice and soft like this oil
B004GHAW1U|1|I've bought this color couple of times in the past 2 years and at the beginning it turned out just like the color looks on the box, I just dyed my hair Today and it looks like a cherry chocolate instead of soft violet black. I am very disappointed and will never buy it again.
B008JRNAE4|3|The pencil was just okay, i actually like my brow powder better due to the brush.  The pencil contents fell out of the pencil and broke on the 3rd day.
B0000AJ3PT|5|This lotion is a staple for me. As long as I use it consistently, it gets rid of those little bumps on the back of my arms!
B00CPTQXK0|4|One of the bows did come undone but overall a really cute hair accessory!
B000ALFTW8|5|Great product. Effective and gentle. Think Clinique is discontinuing it though.
B000050AUO|1|You say it has a holder, it has no holder for the heads.<BR>It gets one star (it should get NONE).<br />If you buy a car it should come with tires, right?
B007UZO2GG|5|i love how innovative this train case is. the three layers allow for much more storage. enough compartments to keep everything organized.
B000052XYE|1|Springing Curls Mousse by L'Oreal has got to be the most foul hair product I've ever tried - and believe me, I've tried some real stinkers.  I have four categories by which I judge hair products: style, control, frizz and hair texture.  This mousse failed in all.  I HATED the texture of my hair after using this.  When my hair was wet it felt greasy and when my hair was dry the greasiness was still there.  I HATED how frizzy my hair was from this mousse.  In the rain my hair frizzed up so fast!  And even when it wasn't raining my hair still has frizz in some places.  What I HATED most was the control.  The curls didn't hold and my hair wasn't controled enough in general after using this mousse.  I wanted alot more hold.  I HATED the curl this mousse gave.  Curls were in some place but not others.  Some places had individual curls but other places had big messy clumpy curls that were stuck together.
B00F2DHD7I|1|Lenses are warped
B007HJ9VFM|1|Worked decently for a while, but after a few weeks and minimal use it just doesn't work. Turns on, but doesn't cut hair at all.
B004R7PH78|5|LOVE IT,
B003BMI68W|1|It says 12 count, but they only sent me one. I'm just so sick of returning things I'm keeping it.
B008J1JBUW|3|I thought it was cute! My only issue is that it isn't as deep as normal cases that come with solution.
B00ORSUTZC|5|Great, basic brushes at a really affordable price. For everyday, basic brushes this set was a great buy.
B001G7R3L0|5|nice
B00F6VM8JE|4|Does what it is supposed to do, reduces the bleeding after the inevitable wiggle of the straight razor. I turn to it once or twice a month (that is when I know I need to re-hone my razor).
B00L3FP10K|5|Wonderful product with smel of chocolate.  Packaging is neat, delivery was very quick. Very easy to melt, I'm using it for face and arms, because my skin is very dry. I like results, my skin is back to normal.<br />I like the seller, I would use them again.
B000KVH1QU|4|Bought this because it is perfect for traveling and when you really don't have time to wash your hair. It is good for an instant freshening up.  The smell is quite nice, it is not too strong and there are several different scents, this one is my favorite though, it has a coconut essence to it. I was surprised at how clean your hair looks after a few sprays.   Just make sure you don't spray it too close to your scalp-I have dark hair and if I spray it too close it is too intense and it can be difficult to get rid of the white powder.
B00G1VY32S|5|Super cream for the price!  I have used many moisturizers over the years and this is now one of my favorites.  Elegant packaging and smells divine!
B000PJ705O|5|After many years of good service, I thought I was going to have to buy another Norelco electric razor. It started to cut out on me while in use. It turns out that the molded cord had just had too many years of twisting and turning and had broken a lead inside. Purchased a new cord and the razor works like new.
B000I20Q72|5|I bought 3 versions of back scrubbers for family members, this ended up being the winner for me. Funny how such a simple little thing can &#34;make my day&#34;!
B00BSXKGIO|4|My daughter likes it.For sure not for little one and make to much mess.You have to know how to design before you buy the product.
B00886J2I4|5|We used this paint for field day at school. Other reviewers suggested using a sponge for application however we found a brush was easier with it's consistency. Bright orange color without being neon and although the bottle seemed small it covered a lot of faces.
B009DU4QYE|5|I'm in love with this product. My daughter's hair was always greasy and we tried every de-grease shampoo on the market. Finally, I found this one and my daughters hair hasn't been greasy since. WE LOVE MAPLE HOLISTICS!!!
B003N3J41M|5|My mom absolutely loves this perfume. She was SO excited that she got it for Christmas. I even like it! It smells amazing.
B00GJAPUKU|5|Love this lip gloss....
B000I4C074|5|Cleans better than traditional toothpaste, no chemicals, and a little goes a long way. My husband and I love it!
B002PMLGVI|4|Worked great at removing yellow and brassy tones. I left on 20 minutes and hair was too red when i first rinsed and started to dry! SCARY. But once i dried and used flat iron hair was nice even blonde. I would use again!!
B00GLE8SNK|5|This stuff is like magic! I absolutely love it! I saw troublesome dark spots start to fade in a matter of days and now I am hooked. It isn't greesy and my face feels &#34;hydrated&#34; after using. You do have to continue use daily otherwise the dark spots will return. I feel like I have less fine lines and that my facial skin is &#34;firmer&#34; as well. I feel like my skin looks &#34;brighter&#34; and healthy. I first purchased this product when I noticed some dark spots starting to appear. I now use this product daily as a preventative measure. I can seriously tell a difference in my skin and don't stress about wearing makeup all the time because I am so happy with how my skin looks. A bottle lasts a really long time even when applying twice a day. I would highly recommend trying this product. On a side note, I have been so happy with this product and the company's customer service that I am now branching out and trying their other products.
B000GCH12C|5|This is a great color for dark brown or black colored eyebrows. Irid brown is subtle and blends in well with my black brows. I am very happy I purchased this! And the stencils that come in 3 different thicknesses are handy.
B0009VQ8J2|5|I still think is Jergen's lotion repackaged. It smells awesome and it's creamy smooth, not oily at all. Love it!
B004ID39I0|3|It gives a boost but not the best in the market.
B009DU4QYE|4|I really liked this product. I was hoping that by using this product, I would no longer have to wash my hair every single day. I didn't realize what a difference the shampoo was making until later when I used another shampoo for a few days and my hair felt heavy and dirty. While I wasn't able to skip a few days by using this shampoo, it did keep my hair looking less greasy at the end of the day (the problem may not be my hair but my oily forehead). It has a pleasant smell and seemed to keep my hair nice and healthy.
B001LF4B80|2|This soap is highly fragranced so if you are allergic to fragrance this is definetely not for you. This soap is moisturizing for your body however I have very dry skin on my face also and my skin is mature. This soap smooths skin meaning it exfolliates and too much exfollation on mature skin makes it drier so found I could not use it for my face.
B008OOYXMK|5|Excellent hot comb. Highly recommended.
B002K8UB9A|5|Not only does this reduce shine and help to prevent blemishes, but my skin feels all around better. I have mild rosacea, and this doesn't irritate my face. I just need a dab, and it leaves my skin feeling smoothed, soothed, and refreshed. I'm not using it in conjunction with other products in the line (I can see that over drying). This alone is great for me.
B000OOU9US|5|It works great. That Dr. That recommended it did not say how much to use it or what  it is good for.
B00NT0GUA2|5|I love this soap. I've been using it for my shampoo, body wash, face wash and even hand soap. It's way more natural than all the other products I was using, and it works really well. Now when I travel I just need one bottle instead of 3 different products. I feel clean and it doesn't dry my skin or hair out. I haven't even been using conditioner. I did find this same product for $1.50 cheaper at my local Whole Foods, so may start buying there, and may try another scent next time.
B0001XKA2Y|5|I don't like to use mascara and found this product to be a great alternative. I use it only on my lashes. I put the gloves on (the disposable ones, not the thick ones) before I even open the containers. I put enclosed sticks with tiny amount of cotton ball wrapped around them into each container (cotton swabs work too). I make sure there are several sticks in each container since I don't want to double-dip. I sit close to the mirror and work on one eye at a time.<br /> It really helps to have the sticks ready in the containers especially the one with the dye remover since you need to work quickly if you accidentally put a dye on your skin. I am careful not to apply the dye too close to lash roots (it will sting your eye a lot !) It is important to wear gloves since the product will stain your skin. You don't want to worry about removing dye from both your finger and eye area.<br />It really helps to keep open container inside the box they came with since it keeps them secure. The dye will stain you counter or whatever surface you put them on if you spill it.<br />If you are careful, work slowly and have things prepared in advance you'll get great results.
B002NCRBPA|4|Finally, a beautiful neutral shadow. Looking for a long time for a shade like this, but hope to find somewhere less expensive.
B00BF9E2FY|5|What a great product. I suffered form itchy spots on my back, Sarna cleared it up in one day.
B00C92YNIM|5|Summer is here and I tossed the ones from last year and inserted these for continued dry feet and decreased odor. I summer from hyperhydrosis of the palms and soles and this is the perfect solution for those close toed shoes, now I can wear any shoe type with no discomfort. At the rate i sweat I often need to swap them out during the summer but they are well worth it and do the job
B0080CO2F4|5|it looks very nice in my hair, however it doesn't actually hold the hair in place, you have to put your hair up first and then add the clip.  It is prettier than it looks in the picture.
B0015K9BXQ|3|I dropped it a couple of times in the shower and a piece came off.  I couldn't put it back together!  The clipper worked fairly well to keep my hair short every 2 weeks.  I liked how it was one length.
B00XTM39EU|5|My feet are very rough and calloused from wearing work boots at my job so I decided that I should buy a foot file since pedicures can get expensive.  After reading reviews on Amazon I stumbled across the Mousand Foot File and let me say that it is magic.  My feet have never been smoother and the price is very affordable.  It is also very gentle and I haven't had any problems so far!  Great product!
B004NJ8WFO|5|My husband bought me this for Christmas, and this brush is amazing!!! I love all the attachments especially the pumice stone! I would recommend this brush to anyone and I literally use it everyday when I wash my face!
B003654RSW|5|This is a great product, and being able to order it online makes my life more simple.  This product covers well, has a very light feel, and I never have to worry about touch ups.  Thank you.
B007ISIY4G|5|Good deal !
B00HFQQ0ZQ|5|Does a thorough job of cleaning
B00D7MZ224|5|Great quality and the color is amazing as usual.  Essie is the beat nail polish in my opinion.  Shipping was fast and the price was great.
B004P1AY4C|3|I'm no shaving snob, but this razor has issues. No straight razor comes shave ready. The blade was machine honed and was not stropped. The edge is very uneven. Do yourself a favor, buy the &#34;blunt&#34; version. Its less work to hone your own edge than it is to re hone the factory edge. I'm stubborn though I'll roll with it. Not that I care but the scales are garbage but all they do is hide the edge and look good.
B00KRBLD1C|5|I got this originally to avoid spiders in my room but I used aroud  all the house to enjoy the smell
B000ALDK1A|5|Love this stuff !!! Keep it in the fridge and it is great on sunburns !!! I have had trouble finding it in local stores happy to have it here on Amazon in bulk !!
B005KL3B64|5|I chose this product for its mattifying effect, meaning that it took the oily look out of my hair. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the volume in my hair increased as well. It doesn't require covering the whole head to get the mattifying effect, either.The powder is white and my hair is dark, but all of the powder brushed out very easily.
B0094DH1RE|3|the only thing that sucks is that the part where you put the glue on is thread...<br />other than that the eyelashes are nice, they look long but not too dramatic, you could wear them everyday :)
B007WKKKI8|5|Love it.
B00HA0EWCK|5|Great vintage look.....
B000OAFBP0|3|loved the size,,just not the color,,,,would be nice if this came in # 113, 14 gr,,,,deep olive,,, like the size.
B0029OIWNC|5|Very very good smell!!!
B002ECCY6U|5|Had a couple of problems because of bad electrical cord, but they were so quick at trying to solve that I still had to go with 5 stars !
B00009RB1C|1|ordered hq 55 as pictured and came hq 56. boy can;t trust anybody any more just will buy offline at walmart or so.
B004KEKI5Y|5|Has no pleasant smell, but I have very dry skin. I have used this before and I like it. Has no perfume in it. they do have it in lavender if you prefer.
B00SM99KY8|3|I want to like like this sunscreen, but in the end, it was a mismatch for my normal/combination skin.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. physical and chemical sunscreen;<br />2. lightweight so application is a breeze;<br />3. dries quickly to a nice matte finish; and<br />4. does control sebum<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. quite a strong alcohol smells initially;<br />2. leaves a white cast;<br />3. feels heavy and greasy toward the end of the day; yet<br />4. my face (especially around the cheeks and eyes areas) feels also quite dry/parched toward the end of the work day also; lastly<br />5. the bottle is tiny, so the cost is not cheap unless you can buy it directly from Japan
B00021VM0O|5|Great foundation, just love it!!  Easy to  apply  great coverage . I am very happy with it !!!!  I use it daily.
B001CBEQME|5|very nice tips great for acrylic nails at home or for business.they are long but you can cut them glad i spent my money on them!
B000UIENIW|5|Great product. The smell is not overwhelming like other scents. The bottle size is perfect. They have many different scents within this line and they are all good.
B00V5YFCVM|4|Love the carrying case, love the color of the brushes & they're very soft. Have not used them yet since I just got them yesterday, so I will update after use. The paint smell is very strong I can really smell it on the carrying case and I think the brushes just have a little smell from being in the case.
B005NBRX2O|5|My friend is obsessed with this perfume. i went cheap this time and bought it from here and guess what it save both my time and money. The product comes in OME box which is great.
B001FWXIVU|5|This perfume smells so great & long lasting. One of the best perfumes I purchased, buy it & you won't regret it. I really love this scent.
B000VVT94G|5|Works very well! From its weight, you can tell that it is well-made and has plenty of torque to it.<br /><br />Word to the wise - when mine arrived, the tips of the shearing heads were positioned together, instead of having the top plate peeking over a little bit. If you try to use these clippers without an attachment when they're in this state, they will DESTROY your skin. Make sure you adjust the clipping heads appropriately, and then tweak the adjustment screw on the body to align the heads properly so they don't make that awful chattering noise when they're out of alignment.<br /><br />Wish it came with more attachments!
B000U08ZN4|5|i spent some of my x-mas and birthday money on this brush and absolutely love it. for the first time in my 53 yrs. of life, i enjoy brushing my teeth. i can really see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth too, plus the health of my gums. the only problem with it is the price of the replacement brush heads. but that should be expected with what i spent on the toothbrush itself. but i was lucky enough to find a super deal on the 'flossaction heads' that i prefer at only $12.99 for (3) of them. and although the toothbrush hasn't told me to replace the head yet (how awsome that it does this for you), i can see definate wear considering that i just purchased it on 1/1/08. maybe it's because i brush more thoroughly with this one and have never had an electric toothbrush before.
B0061S8N7W|5|Great product. Every bottle has been reliable, high quality C serum. I had been using a similar product made by another company, but more expensive and less effective. I think I'll keep using this one and reorder in the future.
B004M7WKKK|4|Its look blogger in The picture but really Its a small pallet but Its ok i like it
B00AIRI0SO|5|Recommended by a friend in order to help my wife remain in good spirits as she has not been feeling well as of late.
B006Z5K3FG|5|I got this for my daughter that loves makeup. I'm so glad I did. I enjoy seeing her express herself through her makeup. She loves it and I've. Even used it a few times without her knowing. :)
B005WKJB6C|5|This lotion smells so good!  So clean and fresh :-)
B00G7PCHIK|4|Degree has made a pretty good deodorant here. The fruity scent is a nice break from the typical flowery and baby powder stuff. It seems to do the job reasonably well, though we've had a few days that were hot and humid enough that you'd have to bathe in antiperspirant to avoid being soaked with sweat.<br /><br />On the whole, pretty good. I tend to like the way Dove's products feel against my skin by just a little bit, but it's definitely not a situation where I'd never be willing to use Degree instead. Just a mild preference.
B000168CIA|5|Dr. Bronner's is an outstanding soap.  It leaves my skin squeaky clean.  There is no fragrance in this bar and it's leaves me clean and fresh.
B004A7PAU4|1|the best soap. 5 star rating
B00016XJ4M|5|Absolutely wonderful and refreshing product. Will definitely purchase again.
B00336EUTK|4|works good
B00BKOL53Q|5|I am very pleased with the performance of this product. I have purchased peels from other Co's off of the internet that did not work and was a waste of money. This was a perfessional quality peel. I do however recommend the neutralizer that goes with this product.
B003MBHVP6|3|This product works well, but it's a slow process. I definitely don't think it's worth the money.
B00949CO66|1|Caused breakouts...
B0041K8O6C|5|love this product..
B000P2515C|4|This fragrance has great projection and great longevity 5 to 6 hours on my skin is the winter. It might be longer in the summer out here in New England. I recomended. Excellent compliment getter
B005OKPZR4|4|great price as add-on item, got this for the guest bathroom. i try it out, like the smell. moisturize alright, but not good enough for cold Michigan winter. For summer is great, especially after all day out in the sun and lake
B00K2O3NV2|5|great
B000Q9YQ0U|5|This product has my full recommendation.  All the features are user friendly.  The night light is an added feature that has now replaced an old night light in the bathroom.  The temperature of the hair dryer isneither to hot or to cool (kinda like the porage the 3 bears told about in their story).  My Conair is a replacement dryer and if something were to happen to the dryer I would not hesitate to purchase another one.
B001QD4RUY|4|The good:<br />-A little bit goes a long way<br />-Really good for crunching out the curl when your hair is dry, leaving curls really soft and defined afterwards<br />-The scent is almost nonexistent, but fresh<br />-NO SILICONES OR SULFATES!<br />-Water-based<br />-So so so cheap<br />-Good hold (even against gravity! I've used it to give my niece a fauxhawk before lol)<br /><br />The bad:<br />-Doesn't work all that well as a spray gel, probably because it's water-based<br />-Can leave weird white chunks of product in your hair if you don't spread it thinly enough<br /><br />The conclusion:<br />This is an absolute staple for my 3b hair. I would recommend it anyone, even people with straight hair. 4.5 stars.
B001EXJPIU|5|Wonderful bleach! Anyone who wants to be a blonde with a shimmering glow, get this product!!! I am no longer a blonde but was when I ordered this and if I ever decide to go lighter I will be repurchasing this!
B003DQOCI4|5|My son had this on and was out in the sun and swimming all day yesterday.  No sunburn today!  Spray works well, and I love that it is paraben and preservative free. Will be buying again and again.
B002QFMY42|5|I love this palette it gives you so many different shades of pink blushes and their a good size so it will last and the price is great.
B009DRX49U|5|Oh My GOD !! works so so good for me !
B003ZZHD6Q|5|Let me start by saying that I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!  With long, naturally wavy hair that is super thick and prone to getting oily fast I wasn't sure how this would work out.  But I took a chance and I'm glad I did.  This stuff is thick, both the shampoo and conditioner.  Not watery at all so you're going to need to make sure you lather the shampoo really well, and that when you rinse the conditioner out that you do a thorough job.  Like many others have pointed out, this stuff smells GREAT!  I can wash my hair in the morning and it still smells wonderful at the end of the day.  My hair is straighter using this too which is nice.  I wasn't sure that would pan out.  Oh and my hair doesn't get as oily as fast but isn't fly away like it was with the stuff I tried before this.  Seriously a great buy.  Definitely one of my best purchases this year.
B000C1UE8A|5|Bigger than I expected.
B00028M3N2|4|I used this product to make my own Verbena hand and body lotion.  The scent is okay but has a very artificial smell - in fact - every time I use the lotion people tell me I smell like lemon pudding. Not sure if that is good or bad...
B000EVKYQK|1|I don't know if this stuff is especially formulated for African American hair or what, but I'm white / hispanic mixed and most Af.Am. hair products work on my extremely course, dry hair. This stuff was AWFUL!!! It's SO greasy I had to shampoo my hair FIVE TIMES TO GET IT OUT! Which caused even more damaged!! If I could give it less than a star I would! Don't waste your money!
B005OG2W6K|5|got a great deal when i purchased this exact iron! works great on textured hair as well as more straighter textures as well, i prefer this over any ive used at work (im a hairstylist) ...i just purchased a few more FHI irons only because this one heats up to 410 & i need a 450 degree iron... I STILL RECOMMEND THIS for home use in between salon visits!
B000N2J0O2|5|Great brush!  My husband loves it and I use it for travel.  The rest of the time I use the bigger Denman paddle brush which I love.
B00I11RWDS|5|Excellent!!! Love it!!!!!
B001JOWUEA|5|This stuff is great! I have a skin condition and it has helped lighten it and stopped the itching.  Way less expensive then the dermatologist. So glad I was able to find it again.
B000GBK1YS|5|Very nice, and it's a light shade, but very pretty!!
B0012RYKDI|4|My friend love this.
B000NNCJLM|5|Arrived exactly when it said it would, and applied super easy. DO use some oil or something on your skin, as it's a little easy to get onto ears. I dyed a base dirty blonde and ended with a silvery purple and would definitely buy it again.
B0046VILNW|4|Perfect if you are starting to learn how to smoke your eyes. Purple isn't really my color (it just looks like a bruise on my skin tone), but I really like these quads.
B00LBIIJEY|5|Used this kit to re pierce my nose.<br /><br />Pros: includes two needles, clamp, multiple body jewelry ,fast shipping & low priced<br />Cons:Does not include gloves & the clamp is made out of plastic.<br /><br />All in all i would recommend this product
B0017M5Y0Q|5|Okay , here's another product from Make-Up For Ever that gets a rave review. Why?? The liner stays put yeah . It really does. I use  a natural beige color and it works well w/ most of the Lip colors I have . So let's say I use the liner on my whole lip and then use a lipstick , their brand or other wise . I know because i have done it, that the liner is going to stay put. Okay , it doesn't work as well if you smoke or drink a lot but then what product will.It again is highly pigmented . Color is rich even the natural beige color. Transfer rate is minimum on clothes and such but still as w/ most liners  it will transfer to a degree.<br />I will never change liners again. I used to use Revlon's liners because they stayed put but this one works better.Hope this helps.
B000C1Z33Q|5|Ggjghh
B00B22RDQO|4|these toe tips came promptly, but were a bit thinner than expected.
B008HODSNW|1|I bought two of these to made into dreadlock extensions believing these to be human hair. Don't buy these before reading the reviews! They are completely synthetic and crap! Highly disappointed and, pardon me, but completely pissed off. Will never purchase from here again.
B001RV2J82|5|I have been on the Sensa program a month now and it really does decrease cravings for no-no foods like chips, cookies etc.  I quit using it for a few days and I can tell the difference but I am back on and doing well.<br />This is a long term weight loss program for me. I want to lose 30 pounds and I am doing it the healthy way with proper diet and exercise...a friend is doing it with me and I encourage others to do the same. Try the Sensa...I figured I have tried everything else and why not this? I think it works. I will definitely order Months 3 through 6. [[ASIN:B001RV2J82 Sensa 2-month Starter Kit 6 Piece]]
B0083CXEW8|5|Good
B001MA0QY2|4|excellent
B005GMYFA8|5|Skin Below the Chin, &#34;Pure & Clean&#34; body spray with Aragon oil is one of the best products in the world and the scent is absolutely beautiful. It's a delicate, light clean smell that would appeal to anyone, in my opinion. The results are fantastic... you just spray some on your skin and instantly your skin feels soft and silky to the touch. It's not oily at all... very light, in fact, but leaves your skin soft and fresh.<br /><br />So, FIVE stars for the body care products (as are their lotions) ever, but NO STARS for the ridiculous price of $29! The only one I could find to make a review on Amazon is sold by CosPro. The usual price for this in any drugstore or health food store is about $8... Yes, EIGHT $$ and this company, CosPro wants to get $29 for this bottle along with $4.99 shipping? So, if a person didn't know the value or &#34;suggested retail price&#34; of this product CosPro would get $34 for an item that sells for $6-$10, and Amazon allows this? Are you kidding me?<br /><br />I suggest you buy this product  elsewhere until Amazon finds a reputable distributor who isn't trying to gouge consumers with unwarranted markups. I will make a complaint to Amazon regarding CosPro, but I've seen this type of ridiculous up-marking on other products sold through Amazon and I don't understand why Amazon would allow other companies to take advantage of consumers from the Amazon website!
B001QY8QXM|5|These razors work for me. No razor rash and very smooth. I get 4 or 5 shaves from each blade. A great value.
B000NJOIK6|3|These work just ok. My forehead still is shiny from all the oils that build up, especially after lunch. Good ol' soap and water works better.
B008F5DCFC|3|First off, the packaging is adorable. The bottle is frosted glass and shaped like a flower, and the box containing the bottle and the sponge is sturdy. Second, the scent is great-smells floral but light. Third, the bottle comes with a spatula attached to the cap, so you don't have to use your fingers to scoop up the product.<br />However, that's where the pros stop. The color is way too light for my skin, and when I applied it, I looked like I was sick or something. My face looked pasty after the application-and my skin has a healthy, light tan but far from olive toned. It was disappointing; I had hoped the #2 would be dark enough. Another thing is that while the consistency of the bb cream was jelly like, after applying it my skin looked too dry. I will try again after putting more moisturizer on first, but my Missha bb cream worked fine without putting a moisturizer on beforehand. As for the color, I will mix it up with a darker base since I have the whole bottle anyways-no point in wasting it.<br />I was trying to see if I could replace my Missha bb cream no. 27 (honey beige) with this one, just to change things up. For now, I'm going to have to stick to Missha (works really well with my skintone and coverage is great), but hopefully Holika Holika comes up with more shades.
B000CQPRBE|2|My face is extremely oily, unfortunately for me I tried this out (even at night when I was home) and within an hour my face was as oily as usual. I'll be returning.
B001B679JM|5|Our daughter, loves this incense and I had to let her have it  to make her happy!  She loves life and all of nature.
B009YQOVYC|3|These were ok for the purpose. They are small and the ink isn't professional ink, but hey, for the price and purpose they worked.
B007F6FCS2|3|nice and good quality !!
B001OMVB38|5|Excellent shave soap. Works well for a nice close shave.
B000052YN5|5|My skin Dr. told me to buy this product. I was buying something from my spa where I get my facial, about twice a year (if I'm lucky). So she told me to buy this product instead and use it day and night. I have to say I like it a lot better then the spa stuff. First its not greasy and seeps right into my skin. I have roscea and it works wonders. Absolutely love it and the will buy it again from this company.
B00KRF3GPO|4|The first time I wore this, someone asked me if I was going hunting. It looks very &#34;camo&#34;. So I paired it with baggy black cargo pants and an old pair of Doc Martens--it's a &#34;look&#34;!
B00ONA52X8|5|i got this wig within 3 days of purchasing it, i absolutely love it, i got the light pink one and it is true to color and fits great, highly recommended
B00121PZZG|4|I am still trying to get the most use out of this product.  The sticky texture takes getting use to, but I believe my skin is glowing as a result of the product....too early to tell for sure.<br /><br />RL in Stone Mountain
B00DZ3YTGK|5|I purchased this product to make DIY sunblock as I have two children that break out in a rash with regular chemical sunscreen, and my fav natural one has been discontinued. I made up my first batch of sunblock today (using 20% zinc oxide), and was extremely impressed with the results. It far exceeded my expectations! It rubbed on smoothly and the hint of white on skin disappeared quickly. I still have to try it out on the lake for effectiveness, but so far it's 5 stars.
B00DU6ZV28|5|I received my Braun CoolTec Solo Shaver several months ago through a program run by Braun. I've used a variety of both electric and manual shavers and this definitely has the least facial irritation of any of them. Even when trimming down from over an inch of facial hair, my face avoided most of the irritation that it often experienced.<br /><br />As this is an electric shaver, it tends to do better with more common trimming. If you regularly only shave every few days or have heavy facial growth and are used to a manual shaver, plan on adjusting your schedule a bit.<br /><br />It's mentioned in some places, but as this is a sealed shaver, it is safe both for use in the shower as well as that you can clean it off by rinsing it in the sink. This means that even after a heavy shave, you can rinse all of the bits clean without major fuss. This is a major improvement over my prior electric razor, which needed to be brushed and had beard dust that was almost impossible to remove.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great shaver that will serve me well for those times when I need to stay clean faced. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a shaver that's safe with water.
B0036QFZ46|5|I've use this all the time.  My nail salon charges twice this amount.  Will definately be buying more thru Amazon once it's needed
B00QXIDW2G|5|*THOUGHTS FROM MY HUSBAND ** A common complaint I hear from lady dental assistants when we talk about beards while the dentist fills a cavity is that beards are scratchy. Their husband grew one a bit, then it was not pleasant to the touch, and she decreed he must remove his manhood! (the beard I mean, in case you were confused). Sadly, at the time, I didn't know of Smooth Viking Beard Oil to recommend, otherwise I would have. Then everyone could be happy. The husband, as he could have the beard he wanted, and the wife, would could enjoy that manly looking man she married, and the soft, snugly beard. Like all good things, sometimes it just takes a little effort to get from itchy beginnings to how things aught to be.<br /><br />When I tested this beard oil, I put it on half my beard, and after it had soaked in, I left my wife feel and compare the sides, and not knowing which was which beforehand she correctly identified which I had applied the oil to. Well, she said 'this side is softer'. I can't say if this would be as effective on a fledgling beard, but on a full beard it works quite fast.<br /><br />Applying the oil to a beard is as simple as using the dropper to put 3 drops on your fingertips, then rubbing it into your beard. Not enough to cover your whole beard because it's that fantastic? Just use a little more! I'm pretty sure you could have figured that out, but it's printed on the bottle, in case you forget.<br /><br />Got a beard? Get this beard oil. It works, and everyone will be happy. **This item was received for review**
B0043X90QA|5|Got a couple of packs of these.  One size 12 and one pack size 10.  Great insoles.  My husband used one size 10 and cut the other one down for me to a women's 7 and we put them in our snow boots.  My sorel boots were supposed to be to -25 but we went ice fishing and my toes were cold.  When I added this insole, that did the trick!  I can go out ice fishing all day and into the night and no cold toes.  It is definitely nice to have warm feet when it's cold out!  It also did not bulk up my boot, I still have plenty of room for my feet.  But sorels usually have extra room in them, even though I didn't have any room left for length.  My toes were close to the end but he cut the felt so it didn't go up on the sides at all. I don't double up on socks either.  Ever.  Cause it restricts my feet and is so uncomfortable.  But these insoles added comfort and warmth to my boots!
B004OHQR1Q|5|Beautiful colors and they came in on time! They do exactly what they say with no disappointment I would recommend to buy this! I mean for the price they actually work!
B00A2ZLKM0|5|Easy to apply.  No drying time.  Lasts up to two weeks.  I always get complements on my nails.
B00D1HPKC2|5|These are great
B00AFMFC1U|4|although the listing said they would send an anti-dust plug, that never came but i'm not concerned about that.<br />for a petite girl, the collar is quite big and possibly bigger than the example photos but nonetheless, i like it.<br />what really bothered me the most was the factory dust smell but that odor can be eliminated by drying it.
B001TJD6SY|5|Loved this.
B0065JCV84|5|Ok, scent is awesome, manly! Not for women nor kids. But women like it and know your not like other guys! The hold is medium depending on how much you use, a little goes a long way! For me, I have fine curly/wavy hair ( no crazy fancy hair) and I put it on when my hair is not too wet nor too dry to get the best control and shine! Water based washes out clean and easy. Root beer in color! Only for \\"true original\\" men!
B002XURD32|5|I absolutely love my Clarisonic.  When you are finished using it your face is so clean, shiney and smooth. I have been using it for 3 days now and can tell a big difference in my skin.
B007CY0EHG|5|What is this really?!.
B00KLJDYL2|5|This is quality I cream. I have been using it for a few weeks now and can definitely see a difference.
B000C2370G|5|Great!!
B00HIDT94U|4|I got this for my sister in law and she just loves it!
B00CSWRQ96|5|Great shampoo beyond expectations. Excellent value for the dollar. Brought out the silver in my wife's hair and greatly conditioned it.
B0109MLE2Q|5|I love natural products!  I've been searching for a coffee scrub for some time after watching a Youtube tutorial on how to get soft, glowing, vibrant skin.  I used this all over my body, face, arms and legs were where I needed it the most.  Your skin will feel amazing after using this product.  It smells amazing and works amazing!  I can't tell you how awesome this product is...you have to try it for yourself!  The only issue I have is the packaging.  I wish it came in a better container that was easier to close and seal.
B00ARF428O|4|I use this primarily as a beard trimmer more than anything else. It does a great job in that department. The adjustable head attachment is about on par with any other trimmer I have had.  Battery life is really good as well. I only use it once-a-week, and I charge it once a month.<br /><br />The extra's it comes with seem to be gimmicky and do not really work. I tried the shaving foil and found it to be pretty useless. I have not tried the nose hair trimmer, so I cannot speak to that (something does not sit right about sticking a spinning, sharp object up your nose). I use the brush to clean it off and have never felt the need to test its water-resistance.<br /><br />For the price, not bad, but I would not say it is anything special.
B0006PLOWW|5|My mother-in-law recommended this product.  It is everything she said it was.  My nails felt stronger and more healthy after the first application.  I will recommend this product to anyone
B00359UXQE|5|I wish it was a larger size it goes really fast but I love it. Seller is great very fast shipping.<br />I will buy another one as soon as this one is empty.
B007YT34TY|5|So much better than any other pair of tanning goggles I have used. They are very flexible so they actually bend over my eyes to protect even the outside corners. I will never buy a different brand.
B000I5HJ2Y|5|I'm a makeup artist and absolutely love the beauty blender. It's perfect for blending and contouring. I love using it much more than a foundation and conceler brush. I would highly recommend this product, it stores and washes easy. Try it you won't be disappointed!!
B002IULDP6|5|I use this on my hair before flat ironing or using my blow dryer and it helps keep the color longer and not be brittle and dry
B00VVMX07G|1|The hair is soft and takes color well but after I dyed the closure the curls did not return. I will not purchase hair from this vendor again
B00R89IN7I|5|Does wonders for my hair.  Trying to go natural.
B001CJVP02|4|My favorite eye shadow, ever, is [[ASIN:B004X8LBS0 Maybelline Expert Wear Shadow Trio, Bronze Glitz]] hands down.  None of my local stores are carrying it anymore, and it's starting to look like Amazon won't be either.  Currently you can only buy it from a 3rd party seller - for a jacked-up price when you consider the shipping.<br /><br />I tried this compact and found the lid, crease, and brow colors to all be quite reminiscent of the \\"Bronze Glitz\\" colors albeit slightly less brilliant.  The colors in this set are not quite as bright, and have less shimmer than Bronze Glitz.  They do blend well and wear fairly well.  Not as well as Bronze Glitz though.<br /><br />Also, you are getting much less lid and crease color in exchange for the liner color, which I don't use anyway.<br /><br />All in all I like the set, and if I didn't already have a favorite by Maybelline that is similar to this set I'd like it a lot more.
B000C1Z6VA|5|it was nice
B000GDC4JQ|5|I absolutely love these murad products.  My daughter has them and I used them 4 days and could not believe the results.  I had to buy my own products, fast.
B00009RB0X|4|Some of us want a straightforward electric shaver that doesn't have a heavy battery pack & charger to mess with.  Just plug it in and shave. The 6423 is quiet, smooth, and light weight.  Too bad Philips discontinued corded shavers!  There are still some stocks of them left on the market. GET ONE WHILE YOU CAN.
B00TBSY0PS|5|Love this mascara. It takes longer to apply but its worth it. I wear contacts and so far i havent had any problems
B004L5YA4W|5|I received my order quickly and was extremely pleased with how fast it was shipped and I love how it makes my hair shine and volume is good.  My first shipment had leaked some into the plastic wrap.  I wasn't asking to return it just wanted to inform yarok of so they could check on how they wrap.  I emailed them and told them what happened and that I did not want to return it that I was just informing them.  I received an email immediately and yarok shipped me a replacement in short amount of time.  I will continue to use the Feed Your roots and I will continue to order from yarok.<br />Good product, good customer service.
B001AFGLI4|1|I bought this to be able to have my own dryer on a 3-week trip to Europe. I got the hotel maintenance person to bring me a screw driver, as I'd forgotten to change the setting to 220 before I left home.  He changed it for me, but the first time I used it it &#34;blew&#34; my adapter. I didn't realize that's what happened - I thought maybe I just had a bad adapter, so I borrowed my roommates adapter, and it &#34;blew&#34; that one too! I was going to bring it back and ask for my money back, but decided I needed to save weight in my luggage, so discarded it.  I obviously wasn't pleased with this purchase.
B0020BBEWU|5|Love the product. It is easy to apply and comes in a very nice container.  Would say it is very good.
B003UHD778|1|We took these on a long road trip and none of them would stay closed, as a result the cap slips off easily
B000143066|3|This has got to be the weirdest shade of burgundy I have ever seen.  It was more of a dark mauve and looked nothing like the picture (I know that usually things don't, but usually the picture is somewhat close.  This wasn't).  I ended up giving it to my mother.<br /><br />The vino shade was more of what I think of as a burgundy or red wine.  I liked that one and kept it for myself.  I also ordered red hot, which was a dark, cooler shade of red which I also kept for myself.  Both of those turned out more like advertised on the site.<br /><br />The lipstick does stay on very well, but it will dry your lips out without the included gloss.  I bought other shades as well and generally I like it.
B007TC0HIC|5|good conditioner , just started to use it, and can feel the difference
B00CMSE8CE|2|The color is not the one described in the image. I didn't realize about  the title &#34;Gold hair ties&#34; before purchasing this product. It was really disappointing when I received a yellow hair ties.
B007JWZL3I|4|It works!  It covered the gray and lasted until the next shampoo. It has a forceful spray.  I tried to cover a small area at the temple, but the spray was too strong; it covered the gray and it also covered some skin.  So I tried a little less pressure and that worked, but it also dripped. I was over the bathroom sink so that wasn't a problem; it cleaned up well.  That's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.
B00MAOCY2G|5|I got this to try along with the Violet swirl shave gel. I love it! 5 blades usually seem excessive.... But I got one of the smoothest shaves ever! Will definitely purchase in the future to continue to keep my smooth legs :-).
B004Y9GV60|4|I love this stuff but if you have bad dark circles under your eyes as I do, it can't cover it by itself. You need to use a corrector underneath.
B000C2133O|5|I love it!
B008EXTHYK|5|beautiful wig, the ponytail high quality
B000G0GW6K|5|This is my second go round with the shaver. I tried another one but it didn't even come close to my satisfaction at the functionality of this one. I recommend it highly. It gives a great, close shave.
B000ZV1WJ2|5|So fun!
B00CDDU7DC|5|Wonderful nail strengthener!
B000063SLR|4|Great product and easy to use. It really keeps the gums healthy and cured my gingivitis. I bought it on my dentists recommendation.
B0000ZRLJ8|5|I love amber and have many varieties of it, this one has many layers to it. It starts out with warmth as expected with amber but gently a more vanilla comes forth with further wearing. It is thick more of a resin than oil, there is a rod on the lid to help you get the product out. A little goes a long way as with most perfumed oils. If you are looking for a scent that is not the chemical soup at the perfume counter at Macy's, this is for you. I have allergies and perfumed oils do not set them off.
B00PFCTYKK|2|I purchased this when blog sites said this was a dupe for my HG brow gel, Benefit Gimme Brow.  Unfortunately this was not the case. The color on L'Oreal's brow plumper is a very warm reddish brown, not attractive on most (brow color tends to be cooler than hair color). It also flakes off throughout the day in horrible little beads. Not recommended.
B000P275GU|5|I have used Interlude for many (many)years (smile) and i am sooooooo happy to be able to still get it through you.Thank you so much for your prompt delivery.This is the ONLY purfume that will stay with me all day.Thanks.<br /><br />  Sincerely<br />  Sheila
B00AFCP2Y2|5|Great product, can't wear my hair naturally without it. My husband and son use it as well.
B0007D8E12|5|All items purchased rate 5 Star<br />  The Dove Anti Frizz Cream has been disacontinued but replaced with<br />a product even better.<br />  Everyone, shop and enjoy........D in Alabama
B00AU831VC|5|This is hands down the best conditioner I've ever used! Your hair is so soft and silky after use.Try it you'll love it!
B000XE2344|4|I really like the scent of the Avatar cologne and my son requests it every time he runs out.  It is hard to find and is great for a teen or young male.
B007VN57F2|5|I love this
B00ATFDOTK|5|Works great,just need a discount cause I order every month
B00GX5QUXW|5|its great. its fixed. it works
B000JVW9CC|5|I had trouble with the proactive system but this spot treatment actually works really well. I use it every night before bed and can feel the difference in the morning.
B00N3G84V0|5|Great to find this in travel size.  Works great in my scalp with psoriasis.
B0002DNXZE|1|I was excited to receive the eyeshadow, until I opened the box and saw it was no where near the correct color yet, it was labeled \\"MAC Espresso.\\" This is fake, not even worth paying to ship back!
B00132FUNG|5|This brush is very comfortable, the timer works just fine and it takes up very little space. What more can you ask?
B004K0CRIY|1|I did read some reviews before I got this but I managed to read only the good ones apparently.  I had prepped my nails and applied the first step for the gelish nails, flipped the switch and to my luck nothing happened. I messed around with it for quite a while, made sure I didnt do anything wrong in the instructions, and still nothing.  Of course I am returning it but I have ordered a new one in hope that this one will work.  If it does I will probably update my review because I'd really like to do my own gelish manicure very soon!!!
B004S0C66Y|2|I have been using this consistently for three weeks with no results so far. I would not recommend this product. Maybe I'm using it wrong or maybe it doesn't work. At least it smells nice.
B0050I2WUI|5|about 6 months ago I started using Garnier's moisture rescue refreshing gel moisturizer and I loved it For a girl with pores on the larger side and skin prone to becoming shiny this moisturizer was a miracle!  Found this face wash while searching for the moisturizer and decided to give it a go based on the reviews and my love of the moisturizer  I was not disappointed!  Leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight, it has a very reasonable price especially considering the size and how well the product works Highly recommend
B000NG90X4|5|My favorite color!
B00FF2FKFS|3|Its ok but cheap fabric. Its not that good when worn. It makes u look old.lol. it looks good when tucked in ur pants. Size too big
B000Z61PEY|5|great product! love it
B004YJ9G6C|5|I never used the \\"Tarte\\" brand before so I decided to try the travel size before investing $30+ in a cosmetic brand or item I know very little about.<br />I had the need to test it out as soon as I received my order and all I can say is... \\"WOW\\"!! It leaves a nice, mat, airbrushed finish and doesn't settle into fine lines, like most other finishing powders do. No greasy shine after an hour or two. It keeps my face mat and flawless for hours. Wonder how well this powder holds up in Summer tho?<br />This Clay Finishing Powder is by far the best I have ever tried.<br />Like any product that's a bit pricey, I recommend to anyone who hasn't tried a product yet, to get a sample from a department store or see if the main website for that particular product is providing samples or carry travel size items. My self, got my travel size Tarte Finishing Powder here on Amazon.<br />So, now that I tried and absolutely love this product, I will be ordering full size and will be testing their other products. Can't wait to try this brands concealer and foundation.<br />P.S. _ This product was ordered thru seller \\"LAST_ITEMS\\". Item was packed very well and shipping was fast. Thank you LAST_ITEMS :)
B00AZIZUD4|5|I use Pantene products almost exclusively.  I was really happy to try this one as it promises repair and it really delivers on that promise.  I have a medical condition that causes extreme breakage and fall out if I comb too hard.  After using for just one week I have noticed the breakage and fall out lessen greatly.  I also like the fragrance.  I recommend this conditioner over any higher priced drugstore brand conditioners.
B000TC36KU|4|This comb is very stylish and who doesn't love feeling a smooth leg? The only reason I didn't rate this as a 'love it' item is because I realized I already had a comb that could serve the same purpose as this. But at least I have a good conversation piece when I take this bad boy out in public.
B002O0D8P8|4|good
B000KL2EIU|5|This is great for a quick whole house fragrance.
B003YCH1G2|1|This product causes allergic conjunctivitis. If you google it, you will find top results with customers relating their allergic reactions to this product.
B00DO40YXM|5|I received a sample in a Glossybox and loved it as soon as I tried it.  My lashes and fine and short and this mascara lengthens and thickens better than any other brand I've tried, and I've tried many brands.  I've had no irritation or flaking and it lasts all day.  I will buy this product again.
B003SKFE6E|5|it really holds your hair and if you want a product that your style can last this is the one.
B00Q306R4O|5|A very good serum for eyes, I really like it
B00012NJKU|5|This is a great face wash. It takes off makeup really well and I love that it is soap and cruelty free. I think this will be the only face wash I buy from here on out. My skin still gets a little dry it spots I had trouble with dryness before using this; but I think that's just because I live in the desert. Completely cured the oiliness I was having trouble with on my forehead because it is so gentle. Plus I can use it when I am pregnant. I like this better than any face wash I've tried before (and I've tried a lot!).
B002HWS9GG|5|What can I say, Oral-B is tops!  I use this round brush for the back of my teeth, closing my mouth while brushing to clean my back teeth better.  My dentist loves me as they don't have to work hard on me.
B000VSG1PO|1|Awful!!! Was so excited to get my first pair to only be disappointed when I recieved it!!!! FAKE FAKE FAKE!!! Well learn to read reviews before purchasing anything again!!! Printed label to drop in mail tomorrow!
B005GQTJGE|5|Love the color! Very natural! Shipped quickly, very pleased!
B00BUHL4O8|1|Too greasy!<br />I bought it because consumer reports s gave it great reviews..<br />but I ordered the wrong product.. I ordered this instead of the mousse..<br />This product is very greasy on my face!<br />Neutrogena (I forgot which version) was less greasy..
B008G95K70|2|Reeeeally small container and I received about 15 of each color. Big let down. Next time I will check who its shipped from. Hong Kong is such a rip off. Going to the craft store
B000X2FPXC|5|What a great product - cleaning, laundry, body wah
B005A2M7WC|2|My husband bought me the box with lotions from Macy's  for the same price and this one smells very different. Don't recommend.
B0044WR954|5|Great product. I see a minimizing of pores as well as old blemish scars.
B00L1KFQKC|2|I wanted so badly to like this product! I love the fact that it is all natural and it smells yummy! It just didn't do it for my hair. I recently had my hair stripped of its color and needed a great conditioner but this just wasn't it for me. Worth a shot with the money back guarantee.
B00008BFXL|2|I got these as replacement heads, one of them worked, the other was so loud that I had to end up buying another set. I ended up buying the Philips Sonicare HX7022/30 Eseries instead. It was much better and a tighter fit.
B00VL102ZU|4|OPI is a great product and this gel is an absolutely beautiful color. My only problem was that the gel chipped off after 7 days.  My manicurist said that my nails were dry and that was the cause of the chipping.  We are hardening my nails (no gel for a month or so) and then I will try it again.
B003YJAZZ4|5|Having switched from regular razors my skin has become so much better. No more burns or cuts and its very close.<br /><br />Please note that it took almost two weeks for my facial hair to adjust to the razor as it has been said all over the manuals. So if you dont get a close shave the first time, dont throw it out yet. Also, if you have a thick beard then you will need to trim it first, Its not a lawn mower.
B0041MILEA|5|Goes on nicely and works well with my fair skin. Happy to find natural products at a reasonable price! I would recommend the product.
B00AWRGZ0K|5|the best shampoo I've ever used!<br />I've recommended it to several of my friends!<br />I will continue to try new Aveeno products.
B001AMRQ2W|1|My husband purchased this product or a version of it around 2004. We have replaced it through Philips/Norelco multiple times (at least 4) because it just stops working. Believing in the Norelco product, we accepted their assurance that each time was just a fluke. Some service representatives also suggested that it was the power coming into the house, although no other appliances have problems. But as my husband said today, it is statistically impossible that he always receives a razor that stops working after a year and a half or so. Called Norelco (Philips) today and they said that although they stand behind their product, since they replaced/upgraded his razor in the fall of 2011 and his original purchase was in 2004, they only stand behind PURCHASED products for 2 years. We are switching to Remington!!
B00GF1NZLY|3|Love the tea tree oil but did not receive the recipe book.<br />HELP!  Please send. I can only rate it 3 stars but will change to 5 when I get my book.
B002MZ8BK2|5|This is a must have for the stamping plates....and it works so well!!  The final results are awesome and look great!
B003UH0528|5|I saw this product used in a tutorial on YouTube and thought it might work well for me and it has.  I'm not a professional...just wanting to learn more about cosmetics and techniques.  I'm very satisfied with the product and will purchase additional Sigma products in the future.
B004LXHF4Q|5|Bought Milan<br />It glides on very smoothly and takes a while to mattify, but a very cute color overall<br />It smells a lot like cake batter (which is not a bad thing in my opinion)
B000Q6RHJA|4|I'm on coumadin, a blood thinner, and I'm not supposed to use regular razor blades because of the danger that a little cut won't clot.    My legs have been qualifying me for a part in the next Planet of the Apes remake, so it was time to do something about it. I never knew a guy who liked an electric shaver, so I wasn't expecting much. I figured I'd just go with whatever would work for the best price because whatever I'd get just wouldn't do a good job.    Well, I'm presently surprised! The hair on my legs was LONG, so I went over it slowly and several times. It was not as close as a razor shave, but it wasn't bad at all (kind of like the way my legs feel the day after a razor shave.)    The razor cleans easily and makes it easy to do touch ups, which I do pretty much every other day since I like it smooth. The directions say it can take three weeks to get used to an electric razor, but I had no such time problem. No razor burn, nothing but a pretty decent shave!    I can't honestly say that when I'm off the blood thinner that I won't go back to manual razors. I like the closeness of the shave. But for between times and a quick touch up, this razor is definitely worth the purchase price.
B004AQKKOG|5|I *love* this tan extending lotion from Swedish Beauty! I've used California Tan and Austrialian Gold products in the past and nothing compares to this one by Swedish Beauty. This lotion goes on smooth and doesn't feel \\"caked\\" on like other lotions. It also absorbs quickly into your skin and you can put clothes on right after applying without feeling 'icky'. My clothes do not stick either as with most lotions I've used in the past. The moisturization lasts all day with this lotion (I have even shaved at the end of the day and don't need to use cream because this lotion is so hydrating!) This Swedish Beauty Tan Extender will give your tan a nice, healthy glow as well and will keep your skin looking healthy. Give it a try, you won't regret it!!!
B0020Z31S6|4|Creamy, without the greasy feeling, can cover blemishes. Best to apply before foundation for full coverage. No break outs for me.
B000ZMEW66|5|I have been using this shampoo for about a year or so now.  I have fine, straight hair that is prone to breakage.  So far this shampoo has been a good substitute for Wen (which was the best for my hair but way too expensive and difficult to deal with that company).  So, I ordered again a couple weeks ago, and I was sent Blue Chamomile Shampoo now with Moroccan Blue Chamomile and Argan Oils.  This formula is not as thick. Overall though, I think it has been a fine change.  My hair feels soft after I use it (of course I also use leave in conditioner).  I think it lathers pretty much like the old shampoo.  The Argan Oil is supposed to add hydration which has been good for my hair so far.  Oh, and the smell isn't as strong for this new formula as the old.  I never really liked the old smell anyway, so this is a bit of an improvement for me.
B0007CXWUG|5|I have been using Confixer for 15 years,occasionally try other brands and have always returned to Confixer! Great product for BIG hair!
B00KR163S0|5|I love these mints! The very best thing is that there is no sugar and NO ASPARTAME in these! I've heard Wrigley's discontinued these, so they came from China! They are the only mints I've found without this awful chemical in them and they taste great too!!
B000NJJFBI|5|I have shoulder length hair, I purchased some other brand kind from Walmart, and didn't really care for them.  This set though, I really love.  My hair has different lengths so I really appreciate the fact, there is so many different sizes.  I was a bit apprehensive about some of the reviews due to the fact some said some colors didn't bend, and had a smell to them.  Mine all bend very well,and have no smell to them at all.  If your hair is hard to curl, these are great!  I haven't left them in over night, but sometimes when im in a hurry, I take a spray bottle, lightly mist my hair, and leave in for about 20 min.  I have the nicest curl.  Give the Rods a try, the price is right for so many rods.  I nearly gave this much money for far less from Walmart, and am not happy with the walmart ones.
B007M81B4M|5|I have always used this product an WOULD NOT DO WITH OUT IT i have recomended it to all my  friends an will always it deserves more than 5 stars :-),,,!
B0011TP6W6|5|THIS IS REALLY GOOD STUFF. I LOVE IT IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT. I'M GETTING DARK FASTER.
B007NJT9OO|5|Was unsure about this cream due to mixed reviews but decided to give it a try. It's expensive for sure but my pigmentation faded dramatically, so I'm very pleased. I doubt it will ever fade completely but at four weeks I noticed a difference and now, at eight weeks it looks even better. I've gone from desperately trying to conceal the brown spots with multiple layers of concealers and makeup to using one light coat just to be on the safe side.<br />I have sensitive skin and have had no irritation or breakouts with this.
B000P20R6A|5|muy bien
B001PRJ9XQ|2|I am disappointed - the smell is not nice and it is greasy.. I used to like the fragrance but I think something not right.. Will not buy again.
B0089MUOOS|5|all my life i struggled with body blemishes. so i can definitely tell you this stuff is super worth it and fast acting. not only does it clear you up, it also adds a pleasingly supple touch. so just take a chance, this stuff will change your life!
B001ECTZNG|5|Great product.
B001MA0QY2|5|Great
B0009V8N5E|5|Natural looking tan
B00PYK2UI6|1|Of this &#34;type&#34;, this is my 3rd or 4th one because they all keep breaking, however out of the box this one's quality was evident and considering all the others only use two batteries and issues as for I'm hopeful that this will have more durability,  but,  hands down,  the brushes and everything else I go,  a genuine value purchase<br /><br />06 2016 ID
B004U3XNMA|5|I really like this cream. It's dense but lightweight on. I use it as a night hand and body cream. Great for legs daytime.
B000VDFKLK|5|While this instrument has an unusual shape, it works like a charm lifting an ingrown toenail up so it can reseat itself in the proper growth channel.
B0074FHKDE|5|NICE
B00JOK84AK|4|Perfect to use already, only one or teo montj to expire
B004SBVI2G|4|My hair is natural, very thick (curly, kinky, nappy, whatever you want to call it!)...i usually blow dry my hair straight and recently starteing flat ironing it.  I tried this creme because i LOVE their curling conditioner.  I have to say, the results were nothing to blow me away - not much of a difference then when i straighten it with no creme.  HOWEVER, it did get straight a bit faster than normal.  I spent less time trying to get this stuff straightened out than usual (normally my arms begin to hurt)...<br /><br />Than being said, i probably will use this again.  I used with the thermal protection spray.  So I'd probably use again just because of the notion that it is protecting my hair better and getting to the straightness a bit faster.
B008CC4FHW|5|Good
B000K7J1PI|5|I have used it every day since I received it.. And I'm noticing a difference especially in pictures.. Arrived pretty quick after I ordered ..
B000WN593I|5|Most anti-frizz products are a serum or cream that you must rub on with your hands. I love the spray! I have thick, frizzy hair and it makes my hair smooth and shiny. I use it on my dry hair.
B00KVEEVNW|5|This product is great. I love that it has a tiny peppermint scent (nothing strong) when you first squirt out the moisturizer but you can't smell it after that. My face feels smoother and softer.<br /><br />I did get this product free for my review and honest feedback. My review is my personal opinion of the product.
B001RMP7M6|4|I bought this item for my daughter, and she just loves it. I really like it also.<br />It is large enough that your hands fit in without  touching any thing so as not to smudge the polish.<br />It dries your nails pretty fast, and if you're worried about the uv light you can always buy the anti uv gloves which are very nice.<br />Also this is a nice- looking prouduct.
B004HGHD44|5|Just purchased this little gem last week and I am really impressed with the results.  It promises a shine that lasts for 3 days but the shine is still going strong after 5 days.  It looks like a high brilliant glossy topcoat.  Lasts through showering, washing dishes, etc,.  Totally worth it for those who want shiny natural looking nails without using polish.  Would definitely buy again!
B00OA458MC|4|I have always had issues sleeping--both falling asleep and staying asleep.  When I was younger it would take me at least an hour of laying in bed to fall asleep.  Although it has gotten better as I've gotten older, I still have a lot of issues with sleep.  I got to try this out via Influenster, and I have to say: I am really digging it.  The first day I tried it out I set it to the middle level, and it was a bit too strong.  It actually woke me a up a couple times.  However, the next day I put it on the lowest setting, and it was absolutely perfect.  I slept like a baby--and I have been the whole time using it.  I got about a week out of one strip.  As the scent got weaker, I would just put the device on a stronger setting.  I'm sure there are other things out there that could help with sleep--maybe anything to do with chamomile and lavender scents, but this is a good one.  I really suggest it.
B00IDWP4IA|5|With all the abuse my skin takes on a daily basis, it really appreciated this serum!!  It's easily dispensed in an eyedropper and spreads on quickly on your face.  My skin soaked it up and it's easy to tell when your skin has enough because it plumps up and smooths out.  I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum sold by same company afterwards for even more effect.  This serum is on the thin side and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is thicker.  This serum can be used day and night and does not interfere with makeup at all since your skin soaks it all up.  It has made a big difference in lightening my dark spots, evening skin tone, plumping and smoothing out skin in general.  It's truly super food for my skin, I feel like my skin soaks it up eagerly and it replenishes vital nutrients.  It's a very gentle serum that can be used on sensitive skin and it has kept my acne away too.  I have oily skin and this is a great moisturizer without adding any oiliness.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The smell is slight and pleasant and you get a lot that will last a while.  It's definitely a great value and very easily incorporated into any skin care regime.  I use the Proactive + and this product complements it nicely.  I had gotten to a point with the Proactive + where my skin tone was not improving any more and with the addition of using this serum, my skin has started improving again.  It was probably not able to improve without the nutrients it was lacking.  This is a great product and highly recommended!
B003YJQMHY|1|THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME FOR ME TRYING THIS PRODUCT, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ANYONE ELSE BUT I LEFT IT IN THE TIME THAT WAS ON DIRECTION, WHEN I WASHED IT OUT MY GRAY SEEMED MORE GRAY..SO I WON'T BE BUYING FROM THIS SELLER.
B00IEXSQPG|5|excelent
B000P20R6A|5|Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...<br /><br />Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela...
B000142S6Y|3|This stuff hydrated scalp and hairy good hold. I thought it had hold so I bought it. I guess it's still a good product. Buy it.
B000U6IZAQ|5|Best frizz control product that I've ever used! Not to mention, it smells like a slice of heaven!!!!
B00467AOOU|5|smells really god, I gave it to my wife and actually she was asking me to get another one. she just love it.
B00BJ56ZOU|5|This is the first time I've used an Essie nail polish. I've been impressed: it goes on smoothly and looks good for days even with a clear coat. This color seems to dry with a hint of blue-  it's really pretty color. I would buy it again.
B00AILKE6G|5|My wife really likes this hair dryer.  The bright red color stands out and my wife is happy with the color.  Even on a low setting, this hair dryer gets the job done with ease.  It is a little bigger than her old one (also a Remington which stopped working right recently after 5 years of use) so it didn't fit in the small drawer, but that isn't a big deal.<br /><br />Best of all, this hair dryer adds volume and is offered at a reasonable price.  If it lasts at least 5 years like the old one, we will be happy.
B002KDP3QQ|3|I haven't seen the instant effect on my hair as it promises, and the smell is chemical-ish. True it is a treatment but the result isn't as expected. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and it's okay.
B00GBDP6VS|1|This is not at all the item I received.  The headband I received only has half of the Gem stones shown in the picture... Only covers the very top of my head, does not come down the sides at all...Very disappointed with this item.
B001AO0WDA|5|I have used this product a total of four times in a row on my hair and it has completely changed the way my hair looks and feels.  I have naturally curly hair that I wear shorter and straight.  Between the hair dryer and the flat iron, it takes a beating!  But, this masque has totally revolutionized my hair!  It feels so silky and healthy.  This is worth the price!
B000052XW5|3|This product was just okay. I have very rough and dry feet. This product was not what I had hoped for but it just could be that it is not designed for the problem I have.
B00KRUB6OM|1|Not safety
B00J2HQCPO|4|This product is a much smaller (and I think better) size than Eos.  Eos feels a little gritty to me and is big and clunky.  This is much more the texture of chap stick and about a third the size of Eoa balls.  I prefer this product to Eos.  The packaging is also more attractive and classer looking.
B00A51P1VC|5|The brushes are super soft and gentle to the touch! I have sensitive skin and the brushes work great with liquid and powdered makeup.  Shipping was surprisingly fast! Came in a safe package.
B0035RE2TA|4|It's very soft, but hard enough to brush off dead skin, which makes it perfect as a body brush. I also use this on my scalp (I'm not bald, so it works through short hair) to knock off flakes, which makes my head feel good after brushing. It comes with suggestions as to how to clean the brush and when you should replace it, but I will buy another one whenever I feel like it isn't working anymore, which may or may not be when they recommend it.
B00IXQUZAI|5|I am excited about this product.  Using a natural sun protectant is a healthy, and because this product is endorsed by Dr. Oz, I knew I could trust it.  I look forward to seeing the results.
B000782SQY|5|There are no better tweezers than Tweezerman. Precision ground by real human beings, you can be assured the tweezers will catch onto the finest, thinnest hair you focus your obsessive-compulsive attention onto. Hooray!
B000E7YK5K|5|Happy with product. It was a gift
B006WBBJEW|2|For some reason, this particular OPI nail polish was very \\"watery.\\"  I had to put 3+ coats to get the necessary coverage.<br /><br />I sometimes believe nail polish, as perfumes from other countries, once they arrive to the U.S., get watered down in order to stretch the product.  Of course, I could be wrong but I have never received a nail polish soooo thin, ever!<br /><br />I'm sorry to have to write a negative review :-(
B005MR89L8|5|If you haven't tried this product - RUN, DO NOT WALK - to you nearest salon and purchase this.<br /><br />I've been using this for three days and my hair has NEVER been so soft since going natural in August.<br /><br />The smell is wonderful (I just put some in my hair and I was trying to figure out what the smell reminded me of...can't figure it out YET), the texture is rich and silky and the way your hair will feel after an application...you will not believe the difference.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for all curlies/naturals!!!
B0029OSN4U|1|I have had the Tria now for at least eight months. I couldn't agree with these positive reviews less.  Don't waste your money.  Go to a professional.  Trying to unlock the machine each time is such a pain.  It will not work on small spots, like toes or fingers because of the design of the tool. You can't use it on your face or chin or moustache hairs.  Had I known that before I bought it, I would have thought twice.  Now I have to go to a professional to get my toes and chin done because this thing won't work on such a small surface space.  This bulky thing is simply not worth the money.
B008IEN0D4|5|Fits perfectly.
B0056GOHN4|1|Well I have to say I am disappointed in this razor I had high hopes for it but  I absolutely would never buy these again nor what I recommend these to anybody they happen to be the worst razors I've ever used in my entire life
B00065AS60|5|At first I wasn't happy with this eyelash curler because the pads were very stiff and did not work well with my lashes. However, after several uses the pads softened up and now make my lashes look long and beautiful. My eyelashes are completely flat/invisible without this eyelash curler and now I can't leave the house without it! When I apply a blow-dryer to this curler for 3-5 seconds as well it makes the curling process much faster. The backup pads are also a very convenient add-on.
B009P3CCYA|5|Non greasy light moisturizer, drys and smooths the little bumps on my arms
B0086VI9TE|3|great value
B0013J90AS|4|Works good, just wish it lasted longer.
B00LYWYQNK|2|I bought this at Walgreens as an impulse purchase. Sucked it up & paid the steep price but was not totally happy with the results. Keep in mind, you MUST buy the top coat to &#34;cure&#34; it which they don't tell you until you read the fine print on the bottle:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Goes on VERY smoothly<br />Leaves a nice shine<br />Dries quicker than regular nailpolish<br /><br />Cons-<br />Does not last anywhere near 14 days. By day 3, it starts to chip and I'm not hard on my nails (I work in an office). My regular nailpolish lasts longer.<br /><br />Its a shame because I like the pros, its just not strong enough of a pro to get me to stop using regular nailpolish & pay for this expensive nailpolish that lasts 3 days.
B0079R6BD2|5|Excellent product!  My hair has gotten thinner through the years but now appears thicker and stronger.  I've been using it in combination with Coconut Oil (put on my scalp and lightly over hair about an hour or two before I shower).  I also put a little Tea-Tree oil on the sides (where hair is more thin) before I sleep.  This combination of products seems to really be helping!!!
B004L4EING|3|The bowl is perfect in size, weight and durability.<br />The soap is pretty simple but a good for a beginner (non-scented). I microwave the soap in the bowl for 30 seconds to get a snug fit & prevent water from collecting around the edges after a shave.<br />The brush is solid in ever way but the build. The bristles fall out pretty easily when soaping up each and every time I use it. I've had this for over a month now so it's not just a few early bristles. At this rate I'll have to get a new brush before the end of the year (pretty unacceptable).
B00OQAXI4K|5|It is very small but fabulous
B005BTLM8O|1|I received the wrong product and very unahappy how they've handled the return process. I now need wait days just for a return label.
B006R06ISU|3|Tasted weird. Kids weren't a huge fan.
B00RW61FRM|4|I'ts just regular old dental floss....but it's fine.
B00R1IL1MA|5|got my straightner today i jus used it and im in love with this thing my hair is super straight which i could never achieve with my revlon straightner my hair is soft and shiny i am goin to tell all my friends about this amazing straightner by far the most amazing one iv had . iv never seen my hair so perfect in my life. deffinatly 5 stars . thank you ev beauty..
B0017WGHRU|3|The Old Spice anti-perspirant is great, that's why I ordered a 6 pack. However, they have redesigned the container. Now, the cap can't be put back on without pressing it against the deodorant and pulling little chunks out the next time you take off the cap. Amazing lack of thought put into this new cap. Also, the wheel on the bottom has been redesigned so it's a lot harder to turn and bring up more deodorant. I'd say to just buy it in the store where you might still be able to get the old style dispensers, this new design is nuts.
B009XRM1J4|5|I love  this stuff. its great if you need to use a flat iron on your hair. keeps it shiny
B00OLJDWPG|5|Love it! Very comfortable to wear, and sparkly. I hope it doesnt irritate my skin. Shipping took a long time, but was worth the wait. Will order again.
B00GAC0Y2G|5|This costs less than Muro-128 and is the same.
B000GX795K|4|I've owned this shaver for a few months now, and I echo the comments expressed by another reviewer, great shave (particularly after being cleaned).  Overall a very nice shaver.  No complaints from me.
B003I8YJ3U|5|Love the scent! Ocean potion provides great relief from sun burn and moisturizes skin.  It is better than gel aloe.
B000NL0T1G|5|made the switch from expensive gillet 20 blade razors, or whatever number they are up to now. I get a way closer shave with this, when i use it with feather blades. Been shaving with this one for over a year now, and its still perfect. This thing will last me for a lifetime i think.
B001B4QY8G|5|This oil smells great and works in our diffuser. The price was reasonable and we received the product as stated and well packaged.
B000K7GYQ2|5|I collect bath products when I travel, including overseas and have used more scrubs and soaks than I can count.  I happened upon a LATHER store in Scottsdale recently and introduced to this product. It is awesome. So many scrubs either \\"melt\\" before they do anything or they can be too oily or can be extremely rough. This scrub is perfect--smells good, just enough exfoliation without being rough and doesn't leave the shower greasy.  I highly recommend LATHER products.  Their muscle cream is also outstanding!
B008KHRLKW|5|Loved giving my sister this gift - we are huge Gaga fans! The brush comes loaded with two songs: Bad Romance and Born This Way. Gaga can make anything more fun - including brushing your teeth!
B008R68DAI|3|The jars were a nice size for certain spices.  However they were not airtight! I am so disappointed since I bought eight of these.  Have to decide what to do with these.
B004L08KSO|4|I am trying to switch from disposable razors to a replaceable double-edged blade.  I chose this brush based on the recommendation of thesweethome.com, and I'm happy with it so far.
B000QLRS30|5|I love this set!  I have the regular-sized mark brush kit and this one.  This one is exactly like the big set except it fits into my purse perfectly.  The brush ends are full-sized, but the handle portion of each is shorter which makes the set perfectly compact.  These brushes are also excellent quality.
B0009EILAS|4|Have been using this product for a few years. I live in a very dry climate & it really dries out my skin. I also have sensitive skin & can't use any products with dyes, perfumes, or strong detergents without breaking out in hives. This product is gentle, does not dry out my skin or cause hives. It's an affordable alternative to clean sensitive skin than other products on the market.
B000G1EQ1W|5|I had reviewed the Braun shaver on Consumer Reports, and then investigated any online reviews.  I have been very pleased with the performance.  I have a rough beard that grows very quickly.  Basically, I usually have a 5:00 shadow by noon.  This shaver gives me a smooth comfortable feel, with a close shave that lasts me the entire day.    One of the concerns I had read in other purchasers' reviews was the frequency and cost of the cleaning component.  I am more than happy with that function, in that I think preventative maintenance is a necessity with most things.      I must admit, though, that I am only pressing the button to initiate the cleaning function in the middle of the week and on Sundays.  My process is that I clear out the shavings before placing the shaver back in the base unit. Then, regardless of when the base unit's indicator says it needs an intensive cleaning, I am only doing it twice a week.       I am in my 40's and this is probably the 4th electric shaver I have had in all of this time.  I am very pleased with it.
B00M1E5F1W|1|As recommended by Norelco I purchased a new replacement head for my SensoTouch 3D shaver, which I after 60 years of using Norelco (Phillips) shaver rate as my best shaver ever. I have used the RQ12 replacement head for ca. 3 months now, and find it to be a disappointing purchase. In addition to being very uncomfortable to use, it does not have the capabilities to produce a close shave as the original head could. Finding it to be an unacceptable replacement I contacted Norelco by mail to register my disappointment and unsatifaction and inquired as to the possibility of obtaining a head of the original design. Apparently The Norelco Capital. could not be bothered since I never received a reply.<br />I had fortunately kept my original shaver head, which now is back on the shaver and outdoing the new replacement in several ways.
B001B10GS8|5|me encanto el producto  y venia en excelentes condiciones, el tiempo de entrega fue el mismo que se describia alli
B0023RSYHO|3|The hair dryer is nice looking, but very noisy! My main complaint aside from the noise, is that I constantly touch the \\"off\\" switch while holding the hair dryer handle. I wish the on/off switch was in a different spot. On a scale of one to five stars, I give it a \\"three.\\"
B00XX07NUE|5|[[VIDEOID:67dcae3866db700a868eee0278550da3]]This set of 2 wowly nail clippers are very well crafted and has a unique design that we don't often get to see. It has a toe nail clipper and one for clipping nails from fingers. The clipper is made of stainless steel and has a nice matte finish. They are really easy to hold in hand and get into position that is comfortable for me to clip nails. The clipper is great quality as it cut through nails with ease and doesn't get stuck at all. It's also really easy to clean them and the fact that these can be washed is great, since it's stainless steel it won't rust if washed so I am really happy. These will last me a very long time, highly recommend these nail clippers.<br /><br />*Royalty free music was used in video<br /><br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

B0000AFUT3|5|I purchased this and let me just say that it's a must even if you travel alot. You can pack it with you.
B00JC0ZPE0|5|Leaves your hair soft and shiny and most importantly tangle free.
B002LFLQ14|5|Beautiful color, very pleased!
B003DSYZNE|3|I think this soap is a little drying( maybe I should try it again in the summer months when my skin is not as dry) .It’s a good exfoliator and the scent is not overpowering.
B004XBDPHC|5|I love all of the Toppik products.  My hair is snow white, and very fine and these products do give my hair lots of body.  Would certainly recommend it to anyone that needs  products to add body to their hair.
B0012QK3HG|3|This is an all natural mousse, which is what I was looking for. However, the consistency comes out as a foam, but as you rub it into your hair, it becomes almost sudsy, as if you haven't totally rinsed your hair. It works fairly well at providing some volume on blown-dried hair.
B001FB5U0I|4|this is the only Body Wash my husband likes and most places around us, do not sell it.  It is convenient that you have the product.
B000Q6JA5E|5|I have psoriasis and this shampoo keeps it to a minimum. No build up on my scalp. Love it and good to my hair as well. Only use light leave in conditioner as this is great shampoo
B005EQMRZG|4|I love the color!!! I love nars n its long lasting
B000YJ2SLG|3|After hearing about ceramide on a (doctor's) talk show, I wanted to give it a try.  Based on reviews, I thought I would give CeraVe a try.  What sold me was that it was Non-comedogenic. Well, sadly, not for me.  Just using a pea size amount for my face, I seriously broke out, and they were not the tiny little whitehead kind!  I had a zit on my cheek  and 4 more on the chin area.  Wow.  I kept with it, hoping it was hormones or something.  Nope, as I am writing this, I now have 3 more.  So, safe to say, I am done with this product.  What I did like about it:  It absorbs nicely into the skin, does not feel greasy, and my skin (where I did not have acne) felt smooth.  I typically have an occassional zit.  Normal skin, but a little bit more dry in the winter months.The only thing that changed in my routine was this product.
B000UOK1MS|4|This cylindrical gripper fits neatly over a door knob to make it easier to turn for those of us with reduced grip strength due to arthritis. I am using it on a screen door knob and it is a little loose (presumably this knob is smaller than regular door knobs?). Despite the looseness, it still works well. I thought I would have to replace the knob because it had been hard to manipulate but this device has solved the problem completely.
B004KIB688|5|I love this product! I haven't been able to use it<br />since my dermatologist quit carrying a year ago. My face hasn't been happy so I looked on Amazon and voila! Received it 2 days ago and<br />my complexion is already improved!
B00GGR7YGO|5|Having very dry and damaged skin Argan Oil was my last resort to heal and moisturize the skin on arms and legs.<br />I had the fortune to try Argan Oil infused hair treatment (shampoo, conditioner and oil) , the result has been great, my hair looks and manages wonderfully<br />With using the pure oil my skin is healing and losing some of the dryness. In addition my nails have recovered from breakage and  look healthy now.<br />The pure Argan Oil should be an additive in many health and beauty products.
B00AK5BMRK|5|all good!
B0076OFKXK|1|splat is GARBAGE you can buy at wal mart dont waste your money go to sallys or some other beauty store for your bleach and use special effects hair color here on amazon AMAZING colors and lasts forever!
B003Z6VB5Y|5|The scent of this soap is astonishing; like a freshly cut grapefruit, just amazing. And so gentle and so luxurious! I smell it frequently throughout the day, sort of aromatherapy in a bar. HUGE bar, very beautiful and will make you feel like a King/Queen when you use it. As the old ad said \\"Try it you'll like it\\" only in this case, try it you'll LOVE it.
B000GCSCSE|5|Excellent, the hard-to-find original from 1980s
B001KYTRJK|1|The crayon breaks constantly.  I get about half use out of the product even though I carefully use THE official sharpener with it.  Seem to have gotten worse over the last 5 yrs.  I m looking for a replacement but can't find anything as thin.  Boo Hoo.
B003O3YXDK|5|This product rocks.. great for sensitive skin .. truly great for face and body.
B00JIFWRWC|5|Great dye, love my new hair color.  I won't use any other brand.
B00GY2BBYC|5|The container is a simple and elegant design like a dove. It is easy to store in your cosmetic bag, cabinet, or travel case. The shape makes it easy to retrieve from a busy/messy drawer.<br /><br />The deodorant dispenser is easy to use and allows the desired amount to be applied to your body.<br />The texture of the deodorant is soft and clear upon application. You can apply it and confidently throw on a shirt without the dreaded white streaks that could show up on your shirt afterwards.<br /><br />It has a subtle scent that is pleasant not too noticeable or offensive.<br /><br />The addition of Shea butter is an added bonus. It is wonderful to apply to your feet if you need extra protection from sweaty feet that can result in foot odor. It is so wonderful to avoid stinky feet.
B00CE2JC9W|4|I do really like it. I just don't have that much time to use it.
B00H3TPCD6|4|They made a loud noise in the beginning but I assume because they hadn't been used but with a little oil and adjusting they,are they. Estate clippers I own I would recommend these to anyone
B005OU4J6C|4|This product gives a nice texture to my skin.  It has a natural shimmer and smoothness to the skin.  But for me the color is way too light for my medium olive skin tone.  This would probably be five stars for a fair-skinned person.
B001OMI93S|4|I have very dry and sensitive skin.  This moisturizer is very light, and not too heavily scented and has not caused any bad reactions to my skin.  It has a very nice and light feel and spreads easily, however, it did not moisturize as well as my other facial moisturizers.  At this price on Amazon it is a nice cheap base facial moisturizer that I would recommend to people with normal or oily sensitive skin, but if you have super dry skin like me I would look at something with a little more moisturizing power.  I use L'Oreal Youth Code but this product is very nice if you're just looking for something light for sensitive skin.
B0086XZOWM|4|I like it....
B004ZHNI12|5|I've used this product for years and it is the only one of it's kind that really works all day.
B00ARF42H0|4|No complaints. It does what it needs to do!
B008I2IKI6|5|look good. have not used yet
B008DWSJ1O|5|Received my hair color yesterday, and colored my hair today<br />WOW!!!!!!<br />looks fantastic, I am really happy with the color, the procedure was very easy to follow<br />with excellent results<br />A very big thank you<br />Christine
B0012XO0PU|5|This product is over my expectations. It cleanse your skin deeply. It def works for blackheads. The only bad side is it is expensive.
B005BF5856|5|great stuff. Reduces puffiness
B004RRG4A2|5|Very soothing after shaving with a blade and offers great sun protection with SPF 20.  Use it year round every day.  Non greasy.
B00KQQPJ1S|3|it doesn't have the same fragrance  that it had in 1967
B006U9D6D8|4|I like this set a lot. Obviously not the highest quality however they do the job.
B00BB8O8F8|5|Great product.  Quick shipping; quick results...and smells GREAT!  I would recommend this product to anyone who tans relatively easily.  I like the fact that it can be used with products containing sunscreen.
B002FAVWEG|1|The product arrived only a few days after I'd ordered it.  I was surprised by that because it was coming from Europe, supposedly.<br />Anyway....I've been using this product as recommended, twice a day for the last four to five weeks and nothing's changed.  Nada.<br />Zilch.<br />My condition isn't even that problematic.  It's just a few red capillary veins that are showing.  I can't even imagine if<br />I was counting on better results with an even worse condition what I would have felt like?  I guess the only way to get rid of this simple problem<br />is do the laser bit.  Too bad. Thanks for nothing, Skin Doctor.<br />The only thing that's changed is the bottom line of my bank account.  It now has twenty bucks less in it.<br />Buyer beware.
B003UBTYKI|5|Price is just reasonable for this product. Whenever I need the replacement head for this brush, I will buy it from this amazon.com.
B00EIRGM58|5|Exactly as claimed. Very natural looking.
B001E96UYQ|5|This works well
B000UUMXQE|1|Product it good.. but it came open and it was spread all around the box making everything dirty so it was lost.
B003ZP5GFQ|4|This is a great automatic tweezer<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) does not shave! it pulls out / tweezes your hair like a tweezer. that means that your hair will come back thinner<br />2) actually works!<br />3) pulls even the tiny fine white hairs on the surface of your face<br />4) easy to clean<br />5) strong unit, wont break.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1) battery life doesn't last. It works best with a fresh pair of batteries because then the motor runs very fast. maybe it's the batter that I buy.<br />2) it's loud and sounds like an electric razor. so if anyone catches you using this it will look like your shaving your face lol.<br />3) the little plastic cap will get lost but it is not important.<br />4) not precise. it will work for general areas like the arm, armpit, cheek, chin. but you cant shape your eyebrows with it.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />great product for the girl who has a lot of tiny little unwanted hairs. works well and lasts a long time.
B00JUJ1DY4|1|Contain SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate). I would say that Tom's of Maine are the worst simply because they camouflage their products under such terms as \\"natural\\", \\"organic\\" and other guises, while sneaking in some very toxic substances into them. This misleads and in fact deceives the unaware consumers who neglect, or do not bother, to read the ingredients on the packages.
B003EDD7SM|1|SAVE YOUR MONEY, SUCH A WASTE!!  I BOUGHT THIS THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE GREAT. WELL... I SHOULD HAVE READ THE REVIEWS FIRST.. THE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON. SO I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT EVEN WORKED. NO CHANGE AT ALL. THEY REALLY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO MARKET/SELL THIS BECAUSE RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING DOES NOT WORK. NO RED LIGHT AND DOES NOT EVEN STICK TO FOREHEAD ALL THE WAY. VERY DISAPPOINTED...
B000P275RY|5|EXCELENTE EL PRODUCTO, TAL COMO ESTABA DESCRITO, MUY CUMPLIDO CON EL TIEMPO DE ENTREGA Y ESTOY FELIZ CON LA COMPRA
B00DV0F8CQ|5|I used it for cooking and salads. I chose Hazelnut Oil by H&B OILS CENTER for the certain B vitamins contained in Hazelnut. Very few store handle it. So happy to get it through Amazon!!!
B003AY949G|5|I love this stuff.  When I first heard about &#34;Moroccan Oil Treatment&#34; I thought Pssh!  Another overpriced 'hair miracle'.  Then my hair stylist gave me a sample.  I loved it!  But I wasn't going to pay the ridiculous price of what the salon wanted.  I found this online, and it is exactly the same as the salon, just less!
B0046NPGZQ|4|This kit is perfect for someone who is just beginning to play with eyebrow shaping. The brunette color is a little dark but you can mix the 2 colors together as you like to get the desired result.  I will say that the stencils probably won't work unless you have the exact right eyebrow size for them, and they are hard to keep in place while working with them. That is really my only complaint with this product.
B00GMXIZE2|5|I've been using this product a little over a month now and I've noticed a huge difference. My face is smoother and  my well earned but hated wrinkles have improved. The price is right for the amount of product that you get.
B003UH0528|4|Love this brush, use it to apply liquid foundation. It leaves a great airbrushed look and uses less foundation then another foundation brush I had. Love it!
B00GMP4KQM|4|I like this 1.7 oz size because it fits perfectly in my travel toiletry bag. For whatever reason, stores in my area now only carry the full size stick (too big) and the minuscule &#34;travel&#34; size which is about as worthwhile as the ill-named &#34;fun size&#34; candy bars.<br /><br />As for the Degree solid itself, what can I say? It works. If it didn't, I wouldn't have bought it. Everyone's tried their fair share of deodorants and antiperspirants; this one happens to work for me and has for quite a while. I'm a satisfied customer.
B000UWAWQU|4|i love this product.  my teeth never felt so clean even after regular flossing.  the only thing i can say negative is that it is not as powerful as the one you hook up to your faucet, but the attachments for this clean the gumline better.
B000MN63CO|4|Fit perfectly
B001CE6T76|3|I thought the brushes would be firmer so that I could draw a straight line on my nail.  But, they are not firm at all.
B004T3QT68|5|very good!
B000NO713C|5|Love these. Somewhat expensive.
B000NDME6C|5|its my favorite green food. not a lot of fillers. keeps me pooping regular. i am very into it. buy
B003CY0QL4|5|excellent
B00CU5749S|1|This thing is really primitive. It looks like the end of a door stopper with two rubber ends. It does get the hair out but not just your black unsightly hair....every single little blond hair as well and SO SO SO painful. I would rather wax or pluck.
B00IDWP4IA|4|It's lovely to apply to my face. It smells divine. I have now moved to my second bottle and I have definitely noticed a difference. My skin feels more softer and looks brighter.  I will continue to use it! Thanks Instanatural!
B00107BB82|5|Sooths pain.
B001VEZIME|5|A+++++ LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! GREAT SMELL & WORKS FANTASTIC ON MY HAIR !!! & ESPECIALLY THE PRICE & PROFESSIONAL PACKAGING TOO!!! WILL PURCHASE AGAIN & AGAIN!!!
B003983HZK|4|Gillette makes the best razor...
B000EGMBZ2|5|Love this product.  Gives me volume without making my hair feel heavy.  Glad I found it on Amazon because it is discontinued now.
B00ED3EIT4|5|i only used the sponge a few times,but i love how well it stipples makeup and the air brushed flawless look.it give the most natural coverage.and works great with powder and liquid makeup,powder or creme blush..it takes an effort to clean it though.lots of rinsing and squeezing .but i love the finish and coverage.just wish it was  cheaper.so far so good.i hear you have to be careful not to dig your nails into it.hope it lasts a long time.
B008JG1YZ2|5|is really great
B0027CRZT8|1|This dried my hair out soooooooooo badly!  I was doing my normal wash day routine and my hair felt amazing until I sprayed it with this product.  I went from soft, well conditioned, and pliable hair to hard, dry, and inelastic hair.
B001B7NPY4|5|Does exactly what it says it does. Whitens your teeth fast.
B001BKNJUQ|5|Cant change it to anything.<br />It is great after wax or shave. Doesnt tingle.<br />It has pleasant aroma, works whole day, doesnt leave this white marks while you are getting into your fancy clothes.<br />Beautiful!
B005IUGZC4|5|I absolutely love this product! It turns my hair from looking dry and dull to shiny and moisturizerized immediately. It lasts forever too since you only need a few drops for each time.
B0058V0KR4|3|Shade is a little too orange…I like a more peachy color.  Won't purchase again.
B00110OKHW|5|Perfect for when my pores are getting too large, when my skin starts breaking out, or when my skin is looking dull.  It fixes all of these issues for me.  At first I used it 1-2x/week until my skin leveled out.  Now I only use it every couple of weeks when the afore mentioned issues crop up.  Wonderful product.
B00NKWYC9U|5|Just as described.  Fast shipping.  Good purchase.
B001MIZMN4|2|Smells like orange juice!  Would NOT purchase the second time!
B004UKT2PU|2|ITS OK
B004JFGWZ4|4|No complaints.
B008RYUZTC|1|Slippery and awkward to use.  After using all three masks, I saw absolutely no change.
B001KYNZB6|5|Love it!!
B00HG1JFXY|5|I don't usually write reviews for products because I think it's a waste of time but I'm so impressed by this product. I've been losing hair for a few years now just because I got stuck with some really unfortunate genetics. As a result, I've tried many products to alleviate the situation to no avail. In comes Ultrax Labs Hair Lush which I found while searching on amazon since I had a gift card to use. The good reviews led me to give it a shot and I can't say that I regret the purchase at all. Do yourselves a favor and at least try it out. It's only been 2 weeks of my using it but I've already seen amazing improvements. I'm going to buy more of this magic product as soon as I run out.
B000RZLL38|5|This is the third wall mount I have purchased. L ove the convenience and that  I don't have to keep in a drawer.
B004TGQAWS|3|With the purchase of the spray I was told I could receive a free bottle of something if I reviewed it. Prior to receiving my spray product, I request this one because I thought it was a great value!<br /><br />Once I got it, the spray gave me a headache so I immediately discarded it. I contacted Zyloo and asked to cancel the shipment of this oil.<br />They have not responded and I just received it today. I have thrown it away because I do not intend to use it.<br /><br />I will not know if it &#34;works&#34; because I have not actually used them since my first headache with the spray.<br />I did not give this one or two stars because I do not know the quality of this material, just because I had an adverse reaction does not mean everybody else will.<br /><br />I am sure the customer service is great if they send a free sample of something in order to get a review.. Good Luck to everyone who purchases these items, I am sure they work great. Unfortunately, my body cannot handle them.
B000NG6D48|5|My favorite color!
B00HDFZNN4|5|Product seems to work but little hairs break a part which is not good that can cause an in grown hair.
B002KG5TQW|4|This mask is just wonderful. I love the whole PTR line of skin care so decided to try this, even though it's a bit pricey for my taste. I only paid $38 and change via Luxe Beauty on Amazon, but even that is higher than I like to pay for a mask, because I honestly have never really thought any mask lived up to its claims. This mask goes on nicely, if a bit awkward, since you've got to have some water on your face. After that, it starts to cool and gets almost a shaving cream effect. It starts to feel cool, like a menthol effect, but no stinging at all. After ten minutes, I rinse it off, and cannot get over how nicely it picks up my complexion. Very, very nice effect. I'm 49 years old, and although I have been blessed with really good skin, the signs of aging are showing up, so very good quality skin care products are of great interest to me. Try this mask before you have an event to attend and see if it doesn't perk up your face too. Very, very  nice. This is definitely on my list of must-haves and I'll be buying more before it runs out, because it's a regular part of my routine now. The only issue for me is that I'm kind of cheap, so I am always trying to make things last, but this is an exception! Go ahead and run out, I think, because I'll just replace it. I just hope it is not discontinued, because that seems to happen too often with products I find. Great stuff! Good price and fast shipping with professional packing by Luxe Beauty. Thank you!
B00FJ2FM52|5|awesome, great smelling soap!
B000C1W38O|3|The cologne smells awesome no doubt but it wont last long. Max 1-2 hours and that too if someone stands really close to you. If I had bought it from a shady seller I would have thought that maybe its just the one I got. But I bought it from Amazon. The bottle looks fancy in the picture but it has a very cheap feel to it. So don't think about gifting it.
B00B6SNDR2|4|Good color, a little too dark on the tint
B00OTLOHY6|5|I have somewhat thick hair and long too. So far this brush is a lot easier then my old one to use. It seems like its made a bit cheap but it is light and it gets the tangles out pretty easy. Also it doesn't seem to rip my hair out as much as my old one. My hair is semi wavy and tangles up fast and this brush has helped me keep it in check a bit better.
B0041T2ZNQ|4|Does what it's supposed to do. Good price. Too new to comment on reliability or longevity. I bought another one after I tried it.
B000QUM4Z8|5|This product really works.  I needs some more and will buy again.  I have been using this brand for over 20 years and regularly get compliments on my youthful appearance.  I have skin that is sensitive, but this doesn't bother me.
B005VTOOZM|4|The smell is wonderful and feels good on the skin.  This is something you have to mix so just be aware before you buy.
B000I25WQM|5|I ordered this after some research on DMAE. I have been used this for a week and it works wonderful. The most significant change is on my lip. I also put some of this serum on my lip and it reduced my lip line in couple of days. My lip looks full and more natural pink color now.<br />As to the face, yes it works! Well I dont have any obvious fine line but I can still feel that my skin became younger and younger. I love to touch my face now LOL. Besides, I only use a little every time so I think 2 Oz can hold up to next year. According to that, this is a very good value. I do want to purchase more for my friends and my mon and my aunts. :)<br />Yeah~
B00ISEOY20|5|Thank you I love this product and will purchase again
B002H0N2K6|3|The tattoos are cute and not very big in size. But the glitter effect in the tattoos make them rub off very easily. (On purpose or accident)<br /><br />So they're great if you want it for just an evening, but don't put it anywhere that may rub against your clothing.
B008EN3XCC|5|this item is great! it straightens hair quickly. great for those stubborn hairs at the nape of the neck and for the front and sides of the head. MY favorite iron to use on little kids hair.
B0018DAUKI|4|Great smell and great results! wish it wasn't colored so brightly orange - because the formula is so thick I have to practically hose the shower down to ensure no orange residue dries.
B002WJHLKO|5|Great scent, nice addition to our home.
B002VARDDO|4|Have used this twice now and found it very luxurious, it's is smooth and velvety on and doesn't sting or dry out my skin.
B006GQYSC8|5|love it
B00NQH5CHA|3|If you have not tried coastal scents products, you are missing half of your life (if you are into makeup). Everything is so easy to apply and lasts all day.  This package contains the Beginnings Face Primer, the Divine Eye Liner, and the One Step Face Primer.  Face primer lasted me more than 8 hours and made my skin really silky and smooth (so makeup applies good).  The beginnings face primer really mattified my face and the makeup was all good until evening (see the video links below)  The eye liner do not smudge at all! Make sure that you have an eye makeup remover because it stays on even after sleeping in it.  As for the step one eye primer, it is expired I think because it is oily, watery, and separated (not like my other tube which I bought from coastal scents. That's the reason for the 3 star review. The other two products in this bundle are really great.
B00CSWALQQ|5|I saw this brand for the first time on YouTube as a recommendation so I ordered it from Amazon. I also ordered another color with it. I love these glosses! Very moisturizing, great color and staying power.
B003H8182G|4|This is, by far, the best color I have ever applied on my lips. If you have a warm brown skin tone, this color will work really well for you. And the best part is, it's a real purple color without any bright red undertones; in spite of the fact that warm colors usually work well on warm skin tones, I find that bright reds tend to look a bit tacky on me. This may have to do with the fact that my lips are two different colors: my top lip is basically purple and my bottom lip is pink in the center. So you can imagine how difficult it is for me to achieve a single color on my lips. As far as lip stains go, anything with a red undertone tends to look bright on the center of my bottom lip and then crimson/brown wherever its purple, because a lipstain is absorbed into your skin as opposed to covering your skin color as a lipstick would. The great thing about this particular shade is that it basically makes the pink part of my lips match the rest of my lips. So if anyone else has this sort of problem, this is the shade you want to go with.     That being said, the swatches you see here and the color of the cap only reflect what color you will achieve perhaps if you apply an extremely light single coat of the product if you are fair to medium skinned. Any more than that and you will end up with a deep purple shade, almost wine colored (without the red undertone that wine has) which is way darker than what the cap and swatch look like. If you do not have dark skin, this may produce a much more dramatic look than what you're looking for (if on the contrary, you want dramatic, this is perfect). On the other hand, people with dark skin who also have dark lips like me will be quite pleased that this lipstain gives very good coverage.     And finally, here's why I took off one star:    I have used the Revlon Just Bitten lipstains and would say that they're probably a million times better. For one thing, they have a lipbalm on the other end. You need to apply lip balm AFTER you apply any lipstain, as it goes on exactly like a marker would, leaving your lips extremely dry. I know many people think it makes more sense to apply the lip balm first, as it feels a bit weird to put the marker on dry lips, but doing so will only damage the tip of the marker and instead of staining your lips, you will mostly be staining the balm that's on your lips. I did this a few times with my Maybelline lipstain and after that the product just changed consistency when it went on my lips: it was sort of oily as opposed to watery like its supposed to be so it wouldn't fully absorb into my skin in some areas and it would deposit hyper-pigmented residue. Overall, it just became a mess and I had to go buy another one.    Lip balm is however not what actually makes the Revlon ones better, as you can use any lipbalm and it won't matter. The two things I hate about this Maybelline stain is that it does not last even half as long as the Revlon does on your lips AND that after a few uses, it seems as though the marker has dried out. In light of that, it is extremely annoying that I cannot find a color as perfect as Plum Flushed in a better quality lipstain.      So in conclusion, if you aren't looking for a very specific shade, don't waste your money on these, as you'll be able to find most shades in the Revlon selection; for quality alone, these would get only two stars.
B00BCRMPLM|5|I use this shower gel to wash my sister locks. It's gentle, suds and cleans very well,  I love the smell that stays on my locks for a couple of weeks, and it doesn't make my locks hard. This is a must have for me. I know my locks are clean, healthy, groomed, and smell wonderful. I greet my family and friends with a hug. They always say, &#34;your hair smells nice.&#34; I smile.
B00MG962AA|5|Love it!! Leaves my skin feeling nice and clean. I have oily skin so I follow it up with an oil control moisturizer and my skin looks great all day!
B00006IV46|4|Product was not in original packaging, but was just what we ordered and expected.  Good purchase!
B000PXYAL2|2|Not as advertised.  Would have returned it.
B002SVQV8Y|5|Having been a big fan of Soapy Soles for years, I knew I had to try these. I’ve not been disappointed. If you have a sensitive skin, might want to use every other day, but otherwise I’d highly recommend it !
B000ILPLEQ|5|I literally cannot do my makeup routine without this. I use it to line/shade eyes and shade eyebrows. Its a wonderful and sturdy brush that I use every day. Best brush to far.
B004G7SRZ8|4|Ive done this twice. The first time I followed the instructions to a tee and used a flat iron with a heat of 450. Worked awesome for about 3 months.<br />I did it again, but didnt use the same flat iron and only used a heat of 410, it didnt last as well.<br />For the cash strapped, I would toally use this product. And yes, your hair will omit a fume and even 'smoke'. However, my hair does that when I spend $150 at the salon.
B004QM0OJ0|5|I use multiple products from Dr. Katz.  The products from Dr. Katz meet my needs more effectively than other options which I have tried.  That has contributed to my loyalty.....since I've been using his products for about/almost 20 years.
B000A3ZN7M|5|great
B00C7DYBX0|3|My skin did not like it!  Became irritated , lots of redness.  I stopped using it.  Less expensive products work well for me.
B002BGT7DM|5|I love this stuff!  I have a huge drawer full of expensive hair products that have been replaced with this one bottle!  It makes my hair healthy, shiny and my curls are amazing!  I LOVE my hair now!  I bought a 2 oz bottle and it will probably last me 6 months with everyday use!  so great!
B001QKX4I8|4|A Christmas gift for my tween daughter who wants to try makeup (only at home!) for the first time. Very cute & compact, decided on this one becuz of the mascara & eye pencil, making it more of a complete kit than most others. I paid $18/free ship, 10 days ago.
B004USI5SC|5|This product is absolutely fantastic. I only use it a few times a week, because the shine and softness lasts even after washing your hair! It makes my hair look healthier, softer, and gives it a great shine. It makes me feel like a model!
B00BBFR3RQ|2|It is nice and light but adds a too sparkly shine all over the face that appears oily in my opinion.
B001DZM9LE|5|unfortunately, the world has become a place where a person cannot walk safely by themselves  at night or in some cases the day. having something to give you an edge up on an assailant may mean the difference between going home or going to the morgue<br />I recommend this and the others offered by Cold Steel
B009MR7S6G|5|It's not a heavy day cream.  Perfect for under makeup.  I like it cause you can use it day and night without a greasy feel.  I have used these products for over thirty years and I hardly have creases and no wrinkles.  I get &#34;wow, your skin is beautiful!&#34;  There is no need to spend a fortune on skin care products.  Avon was the first with this line and the rest are just copying them in my opinion.  Like I said I stared with this line and I have tried the others but I always come back to Avon anew cause it works and my cash outlay is minimal.
B005H85PIW|5|Great product will never use gels again
B0000CC64W|3|Having found some Olay products that I thought were excellent I gave this one a whirl.  After 6 weeks of use I don't notice a decrease in lines.  My skin is extremely dry, flaky with uneven skin tones and I have noticed improvement in these areas.  Is it from this product or one of the others it is impossible to tell.  I do like that it is fragrance free.
B0092MCO88|3|Pros are it has four settings and a powerful fan.  Con is that it is SO loud!
B00O72P2DW|5|Nice smell not over bearing!!
B000PI0YBM|4|I've always used a wash cloth to wash my face, but I've always felt that the wash cloth was harboring bacteria. With this brush, I can give it a good rinse and it dries out nicely leaving a tool that feels very hygenic the next day. It takes a very light touch with circular motion to feel like it is doing the job. If you press too hard the bristles just collapse.
B00FXH7YZ4|4|Nice Shampoo. Leaves hair soft without any residue. I didn't give five stars because the top of the container is horrible. No way to squirt the thick shampoo out of the hole. I lost a bunch of the expensive shampoo down the drain while opening the top in order to get some out. For the price there should be a proper way to dispense the right amount.
B0042T07N0|3|The sponge applicator split in two the first time I used it, I am fair skinned, but the fair did not cover like advertised on TV. I will purchase the medium then I will review it. It is smooth and does not have a perfume smell, it does not come off on your clothes.
B000C1UEVC|5|estoy muy contenta con mi compra, recomiendo al vendedor... el envio fue rapido y me enviaron exactamente lo que compre
B001ET789M|5|The best mousse you could ever want.
B0062OZHYC|5|This is terrific solution, the color is brown rather than orange. I have just started in the spray tanning world but when everyone saw my natural looking tan (& completely even) they all wanted to have me spray them. I am excited to try the other solutions from this line.
B003156NMA|3|It works well as a face wipe but I can't tell any difference from other &#34;non-sport&#34; face wipes.  The wipes are small (just enough for your face assuming you're not really dirty) and soft.
B003V37Z9W|5|I moved to the Norelco from an old Braun 360 system.  The shave is as close as the Braun.  The Norelco does a better job around difficult areas.  There is much less going back to tough areas with the Norelco.  Underthe nose is good, neck and jaw are also good.  It is much better at getting those difficult hairs that stick to your cheek.  The Braun always left a few hairs that I need to go over and over again.  This is much better than the Braun.  Cleaning is easy, you can use the cleaning system or clean it under water.<br /><br />Note: you cannot  use Braun cleaner on the Norelco.  The Norelco cleaner is soap based while the Braun cleaner is alcohal based.
B001MIZMP2|5|If you aren't the sort of character who enjoys slathering yourself in a colorful multitude of overpriced designer gels each morning, or maybe you don't have the patience to take half-hour showers, or perhaps you simply don't enjoy women staying overnight at your bachelor pad - THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU!<br /><br />Instructions:<br />1. Open<br />2. Apply<br />3. Shave<br />4. Scrub<br />5. Rinse<br />6. Win
B00GA798H8|5|Darker than expected which was/is a good thing.  Great product and would be a great price if on Prime!
B000BP0NN8|5|I have been using this product for years.  I much prefer it to regular talcum powder, especially after showering.  It seems purer.
B00HEUBA3A|5|Works great
B000EGIFBQ|3|This left my hair a little rough feeling, even when it was being shampooed.  Not very silky but seemed to leave my hair with more body after drying.  I would definitely do a good conditioner afterwards though to keep the hair healthy in case.
B000I1S18Y|5|Excellent product except for trimmer being made in China.  You think that  Wahl would have made the trimmer in the USA also.  No we have high unemployment but give it to the Chinese.
B001E27F2Y|5|I had a manicure and this particular polish was used on my nails. I bought this polish because it is so pretty and adheres to my nails very smoothly. I would recommend this polish to those who like a dark color of polish.
B002H91BPA|5|It lasts well and doesn't dry lips!  It's the color I like and have had trouble finding.  I've used it for about two years.
B00FOGWXQY|4|Low cost coverage with primer that I couldn't find in stores any longer.  Numerous compliments on skin when using it.
B000M4DTF2|5|By chance I discovered Becca \\"Turkish Rose\\" cr&egrave;me blush and found it to be the best blush I've ever used. What a surprise--for looking at it in the pot one would think it's a \\"terrible color\\".  It blends in with my fair complexion (which can be sallow), applies smoothly, and looks so natural.  Right now I'm ordering as many as I can find online--it's been discontinued by BECCA.  (I live in Istanbul, Turkey, for six months of the year, so this is so funny to me to now have a blush with that name.)
B001QY8QXM|5|Great value on excellent DE blades. While not as sharp as Feather blades (which proved a little too sharp for me - lots of sensitivity after shaving), these Astra blades give me 5 shaves without the tenderness I experienced using Feather blades. And at less than a third of the price of Feathers, what's not to like? Two years of blades (I shave every other day) for $10 is hard to beat.
B006K3TZS4|5|I Luv this product. I use it to dye my grey hairs and it gives the best red highlights
B004D282AQ|5|Very nice.
B000GDA08S|5|This is the first product that has ever made a significant difference in my skin. My face has evened out and calmed down which makes me a very happy customer. Highly recommend!
B000WM1HS0|5|A little pricy for a Bath and Body product but they do not sell it in stores any longer and my mom loves it!!
B008L6EWCW|5|After using this for almost 2 years, I can't imagine a day without it. I have light blonde hair so when the light hits it, you can see frizz, split ends etc... since I've been using this blowdry creme, it has helped to smooth my hair out when blow drying. Sometimes when I let my hair air dry, I put this product in anyway and it still helps with the blonde problem!
B003V265QW|5|I got this as a Christmas Gift and love it. I did just recently buy a new one bc my hair has got longer. No complaints about it tho. It's a great hair tool!
B000MMYIM2|5|This is the best  moisturizer I have ever found!  It works immediately, it's light, and it has a delightful light fragrance.  I highly recommend it.
B00HIDT94U|5|Very good duality
B00009YJSJ|5|Works great, easy to install, good drying power.
B004VMGTWQ|5|These are nice, good quality facial towelettes.  They are amply-sized and made of good quality material.  They also smell pleasant and clean well without irritation.  The packaging is excellent - not only is there the sticky tab over the opening (which normally wears out halfway through the package), but there is also a plastic snap tab so that they will stay moist and fresh from beginning to end.  Good quality, good value.
B003ZUOCN8|5|Great color!
B00A0IWSIO|5|I swear by this stuff! If you want shiny, silky smooth, touchable hair, then this is the styling oil for you! Pump a small amount the size of a dime or nickel into the palm of your hand, rub your palms together, and then smooth it through your hair. It works great on both dry and damp hair, but I prefer to use it at the very end of my hair care routine, after I'm done styling, to add shine and tame any stray hairs or frizz. When applying this product, please remember that it does contain oil, so you want to concentrate mostly on the ends of your hair (mid-shaft down) and avoid the roots. Otherwise, you'll end up with oily looking hair. The scent of the Moroccan Argan oil is absolutely divine--if you like musky or spicy scents, which I do. But don't worry, it will fade after a few minutes so it won't interfere with your perfume or cologne. This keeps my hair super soft and healthy looking all year long. Highly recommended.
B005P0X2Q4|5|I like the taste very much. It is very soft and leaves a minty fresh taste in your mouth. The best thing of all is that it does not have all the bad chemicals. It arrived fast. I would recommend it to anybody that wants to keep the teeth healthy and ready for the dentist to see.
B00DXFCFG6|5|Best blades ever used
B001MA0QY2|4|Works pretty well! Gets hot very fast. Lightweight. Great value for the price. Comes with a glove and a tiny product sample.
B00DD4OJD4|5|i absolutely loved it. i used it the entire summer and it fit everydthing i needed. i love the fact that it was small and easy to take everywhere.
B000GLRREU|5|Power cleaner for your teeth and works in a few seconds even if your on the run.<br />Removes everything from your mouth in a blast of water
B00ALV8EL0|5|I must say I was completely surprised by how light this shampoo this was.  I have spent years using shampoo that has extra stuff in it.  What do I mean by extra stuff?  Conditioners, anti-aging properties, and other agents that can really weigh down your hair.  This is completely light, and very cleansing.  I was amazed at my hair could get so clean with this shampoo.  I love that a little goes a long way.  Nexxus has always been known for their quality and this shampoo is no exception.  Very nice shampoo.  IF you are looking for something light and cleansing I can't think of a product that I have tried that works better than this.
B0039UTUL8|5|Good
B0056TA0NM|5|EASY TO APPLY. WORKS WELL. ONLY CON IS THAT IT HAS TO BE REDONE ABOUT ONCE A MONTH AND SOMETIMES THE TASTE IS LINGERING.
B002RX2QFA|4|I like the slight citrus smell to this shampoo and it works well.  I'm not sure if it was normal but it did seem thicker, more gel like than thick liquid that you typically expect from shampoo.  The drawback I think is the price, but it's one of the better organic shampoos that I've tried so far that works with color treated hair.
B00IKD3MX6|5|The product was as described and arrived early. I've been using it for about a week and am very pleased. I use this instead of my old facial moisturizers. It's hydrating but not greasy; leaves my skin very soft and comfortable. I love mixing it with a drop or two of lavender essential oil, especially at night. It probably will take me a year to get through this bottle--you really only need 4-5 drops for your entire face and neck. The dropper built into the cap is very handy. Highly recommend, especially for the price.
B004XJNKT2|5|Perfect!!<br />Shipped on time as well :)
B00JTPIT8C|5|Now I don't have to fight with my wet hair any more when I get out the tub and its cute great buy :-)
B00EP8CSVW|5|It was a gift for my mother because I had used her supply up. It was sort of hard to find a discontinued fragrance. Love it.
B009GEUOZ2|5|Love this product. Goes on smooth and blends nicely.
B00DRDAWEG|5|I can't get over how lovely this product is. I love it that I can stick to my regular, unscented all natural face lotion, and add a pump or two of this delicious oil. The apricot scent and feel is extraordinary. Feel so pampered. My skin feels beautiful. I'm buying the whole line!
B004PEG3T4|5|PERFECT BALANCING CREAM. I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 5 YEARS NOW.
B00DUO8RK8|1|way too small
B004ZC13OG|3|This works okay, but I would always end up using my tweezer or my hands like I was used to before.<br /><br />Ended up throwing the product away.<br />**Shipping was efficient.
B0006NZOR0|2|I was hoping the aroma would match that of the bubble bath. Instead it was very faint by comparison. The aroma is not bad, just unusually weak.
B005IMH9PO|1|The negative reviews are correct. This is not the Ace hard rubber comb one wants. Ace/Goody got taken over by Newell Rubbermaid. These must be the same people who refuse to make the old kitchen drainboards that everyone is clamoring for. Now they've mucked up combs. What next?! These combs scrape your scalp and clearly are not going to last. Not even the manufacturer thinks they will last since there's no longer a guarantee. What a way to ruin good and essential products. Some companies are able to produce high quality products in China, but this company is giving China a bad name.
B004YWRYUY|5|I like it.
B004I5RU2Y|5|This was recommended by my 40+ year old friend as the best product in it's class. I absolutely love it. My skin felt better after the first use and looked better within a week. It's a perfect \\"gift to self\\" or for someone who will take 2 minutes a few times a week for lovely skin.
B0002G214U|5|I have not yet used the product although i love the size of it so that's why i gave it the high mark
B0077LAJT2|5|I use the Personna Double Edge Razor Blades with a Merkur Model 38 HD Classic Safety Razor. As I noted in my 5-star review of the Merkur safety razor, the Personna blades provide a fantastic shave at a fraction of the price of multi-blade razor cartridges.<br /><br />I found multi-blade cartridges offensively expensive. I could never understand the cost, but when I'd try generics from the drug store, they didn't last as long, and they didn't provide as good a shave.<br /><br />I switched to the safety razor with these blades in part because of the cost savings, in part because of reviews I'd read of safety razors, and in part because I liked the idea of shaving with something hefty. The safety razor embodies a certain traditional masculinity to the shaving routine, and these razor blades provide an exquisite shave.<br /><br />I love the sensation of the blade cutting through my stubble, and I have not drawn blood a single time in nearly three months of use with these blades and the Merkur razor.<br /><br />I find that I get about one week with each blade. I could probably go longer, but the blades are so inexpensive, I see no reason to push it. I change the blade Monday morning, and I don't have to think about it through the rest of the week.<br /><br />The blades are individually wrapped in easy to open pouches, and the box has a cut-away flap and acts a dispenser inside the medicine cabinet. These 100 blades take up less space than 10 shaving cartridges and provide for a far less cluttered bathroom than traditional cartridges.<br /><br />I am, as you can tell, very happy with this purchase.
B000YY5QDS|3|The first time I used it it burned very bad all around my eyes, I immediately washed it off. I noticed that it had burned the most when I applied it on my eye lid so the next day I tried just a tiny bit only under  my eyes and it burned just a little for a few seconds and then went away. I've been using it now for 2 weeks and it's working good. It only doesn't burn under my eyes I can't go on the sides or on top.
B00DD5IVXW|5|I love this invisible part wig I left part my hair out everyone thought it was a sew in. What a tease for the price much cheaper then paying $200.00 For sew in then you can take it off a night. I will buy this again .
B0047HGD4E|4|Like many other people on here, I received a product that didnt work. I was really disappointed, but I contacted amazon and they sent me a new one which works great.  I don't know why they don't test these things if everyone has problems.  One thing I wish I could change is the one bigger attachment doesnt lock into position or anything, it moves around, so be careful.
B004JK1NIA|1|I am very disappointed with both this product and the packaging that it came in. The little yellow box that it came in completely fell apart during shipment and thats how i received it. Also, it says in big letters &#34;Ages 5 and up&#34; right on the front. They should really make that font much smaller it sticks out more than the title and i was intending on giving this to my boyfriend as a birthday gift. Not only that but the small button on the blade was loose i dont know if its broken or if its just really cheaply made. This product is useless i'm going to need to find a better quality comb somewhere else. I definitely do NOT recommend this product. Never buying this again!
B000NLHXEC|5|I really like this product. It's very easy to use. I wish I had found this years ago.
B002V15XUS|5|Contains real essential oils in a non chemical blend.<br /><br />Works !  Smells good too  .Purchasing more for friends and myself as well.<br /><br />rpergola
B000RMPOTS|4|Great color, don't expect your hair to be a bright red if it's dark brown or black, it will look orange-ish on.first take. If your hair is a light brown , blonde, or orange it will look red; GREAT! :-D
B00Q794RMA|4|sticky, has a smell.  gets all over everything.  definitely isn't 'water' in that it doesn't evaporate.  i put it on my feet, got up to use the restroom and now there are oily foot prints everywhere.  all over the bed.  just kind of a mess.  not sure if it works - symptoms are less severe but i'm attacking my RLS from 5 different angles .  has by no means been a miracle worker for me but will keep at it
B00H1P15VK|5|I was looking for an &#34;elegant&#34; male gift and this was PERFECT!!! I was expecting something lightweight and hollow...not at all. All the tools were sharp, shiny and most importantly amazing quality. Even the packaging was nice. HE LOVED IT!!!
B003U05DC2|5|I have been using Kerastase for years.  I don't use but a small amount and have found it to work very well on my hair - I am 70 years young and have thinning hair - this conditioner works great for me.
B000C1ZA0C|5|Love my Oscar! This is my fave! Keep the price down for us retiree's! Love the dusting powder but it too high for my budget! thanks , Diane Dukes
B000XVSNTQ|5|I like the convenience that any Venus blade will fit into the razor handle. I did feel however that the handle felt a little cheaply made, but did not sacrifice the overall performance of the razor.
B000XE5260|3|Very nice using it right now!different than the dreamer, Eros,and the original another good one!!
B00NBAKXIA|5|Excellent product.  I have been using Radha Eye Gel for approximately one week and I am already seeing a difference in the lines  and the dark circles under my eyes.  I have tried many more expensive products but the results with Radha Eye Gel are the best that I have seen.  I am very, very pleased with this product.
B003RDXI10|5|Great hold.  Great fragrance.
B000C23210|5|smells exactly like when I 1st used it back in the day (late 90s).
B003J9R50W|3|Average quality for this type of brush.
B006OR6CDC|5|mix this with water and witch hazel .  great when camping i spray on the ground and chairs, dog and myself.. keeps ants away too
B00SABM3UQ|1|The spray bottles didn't work, and the perfume leaked out of them
B005Y91VVE|5|I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!  I have dry hair and when I put this on my hair it was in heaven.  Cleans and rinses nicely and smells wonderful!
B00005A77G|5|If you like to play in the garden, but then have dirt under your nails and in the cuticles, this is a very nice wash to keep handy.  This is my second tube, as I was so pleased with the first.
B006T5OCJ0|5|It's great
B000BNRKPY|5|Very mild taste, the best ever!
B00A3Q3N5A|5|I bought this for my son cause he has had a bad acne problem! This is part of his daily facial cleansing routine!! He absolutely loves it!!
B001E11CPQ|5|We use this stuff in our daughters' ears when they have ear infections, and although I can't provide proof, it works! And does a much better (and safer) job than antibiotics. Our youngest one is allergic to penicillin and amoxicillin, and we really depend on this for removing the infections when she gets them. It's also good for infections caused by scratches and whatever else. Great stuff, and as long as they keep making it, we'll keep buying and using it.
B0091OCB94|4|Nice price. Good product. Soft scrub that doesn't feel like it's sanding your face off. Smells clean. Cruelty-free. All things considered a solid product that does the job.
B002AJSY48|3|After using this product for about two weeks and half the tube, I have not seen much improvement to my periodontal condition.
B000P22TIY|5|I got a compliment from a 10 while I was walking on campus...<br /><br />You know those hot girls that give out free samples of Red Bulls?? The really gorgeous attractive ones ?! Yeah one of them went out of her way to tell me that I smell really good.<br /><br />This scene is MY SCENT! (Not because of that) This is the type of cologne you can wear anywhere, anytime. Whether you're about to get a hand job, you're going to hit the gym, going out to a rave with your buddies, or you're simply going to work. This scent can be worn ANYWHERE!!!<br /><br />It is not overpowering at all. I have a tendency to over spray myself with cologne because I question its longetivity and tendency to even be noticed. I over sprayed this half the time I wore it and I got no complaints but rather compliments. Other colognes I've used that I've over sprayed, I get the &#34;overpowering lecture.&#34;<br /><br />This is the real deal if you want to wear a cologne that makes it seem like you're not even wearing a cologne ! You just got out of the shower, and your whole body just happens to smell naturally fresh and great. 👍👍. Two thumbs up.
B004TP9FHG|5|I use every day,
B004Z2TALO|5|I first brought this product at a cvs when I visited USA, when I ran out I couldn't find anything like this product in Australia, thanks to Amazon I found this product here online. This product is value for money and worth the extra shipping cost to OZ. This product is a great all over conceler that glides on the face with a smooth natural look and still providing the total coverage you need with a light weight feel on your skin. It is the best all over conceler ever !!
B003FF5IZ4|5|This spray will take care of all you frizzy issues, it is an excellent product. I read about it in a magazine and decided to try it since I already use the oil they made, I needed something for after straightening to make my hair shinny and this product does the job. Well worth the price, it will last you a long time, just 1-2 sprays about 8 inches away from the hair will take care of the shine all day!!!
B00JVC8F00|5|Love this
B0042B4PC2|5|This stuff makes my man smell like I could gobble him up. This is a MUST for people who want to attract with a smell! haha. This also makes the perfect gift for a boyfriend. (and you both benefit)
B0075X0Z46|4|Not as sharp or precise as I though but works well for it's intended use. I was brave enough to try the eye brow combs and was pleasantly surprised that it trimmed them up nicely without fear of shaving them off.
B000I5MJ8S|5|I have to say that I was a little skeptical of buying this at first because I thought that it was an insane price for a sponge. However, I received an amazon gift card and figured I might as well give it a shot. I am SO HAPPY that I did. I have fair, dry, and acne prone skin. This sponge makes my makeup go on flawlessly and makes my face look almost as if my makeup was airbrushed. It doesn't make my dry patches stand out and I have had so many compliments on my makeup just in the first week that I have been using it. I noticed that a few people complained about the pink dye washing off onto their skin, but I am very fair complected and this never happened to me. One thing that I have noticed is that since you apply your makeup with the sponge damp, it is a bit moist for a while. I found that it helps a lot to use a light powder to set it. my makeup looked nice for about 10 hours, which is wonderful!! I haven't tried cleaning it with other methods so I don't know how well it cleans without the beauty blender cleanser, but the cleanser has a nice scent and seems to get most of the makeup out of the sponge. I love love love this product. I am so glad that I purchased this.
B002DI3SKG|1|I have white skin but this product is for really pale white skin, the tint is almost yellow. I couldn't use it since it made me look like I was sick. They should have included a picture of the tint tone they were selling so I wouldn't waste my time & money.
B006K9OQSC|3|This works alot better than the thin plastic kind, but it is still tricky to get your hair to stay in it and roll to make a perfect bun as the photo shows.
B00CNTJHQO|5|I was having a tough time finding a natural, sulfate-free shampoo that actually works for my dry, flaky scalp. This one is IT! It's gentle enough on my hair for daily use, smells good, and reduces flakes quickly. It's definitely worth the price!
B00F88D4PW|5|I bought these as an add-on item to get free shipping. I hadn't planned to buy new make-up brushes, but the case was cute, the price was great, & I really did need new brushes.  They had only one review (it was good!), but i have been amazed at what high quality these brushes really are! ! I've been using them for several months now & haven't had any issues with shedding. They are well made & suited for each individual use. Not too soft, not too stiff. They feel nice on my skin.  I wash them w/baby shampoo, after each use for the ones used w/creams & liquids, weekly for the ones I use for powders, & dry them flat. They dry quickly and hold thir shape well. The handles haven't scratched or chipped. These are much higher quality than the more expensive Merle Norman bushes I bought ages ago. They work well with powders, creams, & liquid forms of make-up & apply just the right amount which you can build upon for the type of look you want. The case is cute, durable, & easy to wipe clean.  It has individual spaces for each brush, which I like because it folds up and stores easily. I  bought an ELF curved liner brush & fan brush and have room to  double them up in one space w/ another brush. The two powder brushes come w/plastic covers. The only thing that could make these better is if they had the type of brush written on each individual brush or at least some kind of diagram. I'm familiar w/most of them, but had to google some images for others.
B0049H5DOI|5|Great stuff!
B006UET4XE|5|Beautiful bold line on the first try,  but be careful,  it smears like crazy if you mess up and smudge. If you do, take makeup remover on Q-tip, or lotion, anything else will leave horrible smudge marks.
B004OEBRDW|5|I just started using Bare Minerals and love how light it is. I also fould it to be a great price! I would recommend the product to anyone with fair skin.
B00IGAVDVG|5|Great hair dryer for the price.  It has a cold setting which is wonderful especially if you're trying to use less heat in your hair.
B001DITLF8|5|It has a perfect toxicity rating from EWG. It goes on thick and white, so I can see where it's applied. It feels great on my sensitive skin, helps my skin maintain moisture, and it smells awesome. I can't say enough about it.
B002WTC37A|5|I dye my hair a LOT and this stuff really makes my hair feel soft.
B008IG79UM|2|I had just joined a Red Hats group and was looking forward to getting a &#34;red hat&#34;.  First, it took about 4-5 weeks to arrive and when it did, I was disappointed at the size.  It's ridiculously small and it's really hard to tell that from the picture.  I knew it was a fascinator, but this was one for a child sized head!  Wouldn't recommend it, even though it was so cheap.
B003FV82VA|4|I like it but I'm having problems keeping it in my hair. This is the first time I've had long hair to work with.
B0019V5E96|4|I have tried this one and then the Max corrector. This one is definitely for what it advertises. I need something a little stronger so I like the Max corrector, but this one is still a great product
B004CMAMVO|3|great item but no box
B00CK2Y110|1|Perfect transaction, love it , love it, love it. Very unique fragrance. Great buy. Thank you!!!
B000GG0NT6|1|I m sure the product is great but receiving the freaking thing is a problem. the first time I received the shampoo, the bottke was broken and totally empty. Then, I contacted Amazon to send me another one, and until now nothing in the mail??. I like shopping at Amazon but you can reach anybody... WTH
B001KOTQIW|5|Very good product excellent 100% good quality came in good condition always try to qualify according to the purchasing conditions
B0014WJLPS|5|I originally started using this product when I had surgery and my eyelashes fell out.  I was skeptical at first but really wanted them to grow back to I gave it a try and you wouldn't believe them now!  I was really convinced when I read it had been developed for a man who's wife had cancer and experienced the same problem.  I order it on-line at Amazon and because of competition it has come down in price considerably and you don't need a prescription.  I have cornea issues and checked with my doctor first and he said the active ingredient is the same in Revitalash as it is in Latisse and also the chemical that is used in Glaucoma drops which causes the eyelashes to grow.  I have always been worried about brown spots, but my green eyes have stayed green as I'm careful to make sure I don't get the product in my eyes and I have not experienced the two major side effects, itchig and burning, which with all of my allergies, it's a wonder!  I would recommend this product to anyone who has an issue with their eyelashes or who just wants eyelashes that are gorgeously long and thick.  And mine didn't start out this way before they originally fell out!
B001VH6F9G|5|Fast! Safe! and better prices that the local big box stores and i didn't have to pay for the gas to go get it. Doesn't it make sense to just &#34;click&#34; buy it? C'mon go ahead.....Do it.
B002YFSBV4|5|This is beautifully made and of high quality, very classy and elegant. Sturdy design. It is a little bigger than I expected which was a nice surprise. I am having a beach wedding and did not want to overdo the accessories. This will be perfect. I ordered one for me and one for my maid of honor. I also had occasion to contact the artisan. She was more than friendly and accommodating and I couldn't be more pleased. Very happy with purchase. I'm trying to talk her into making bridal bouquets. Wish me luck!
B004M6GTHQ|2|This product made my hair stiff. The recommendation was to use it prior to the curl enhancer. For me, using the curl enhancer alone works better.
B00KOJ9008|5|I love anything the instyler puts out there products work so well with my hair I definitely recommend this product!!
B004KUI8YG|5|I tried a sample from Birchbox and it made me fall in love! It doesnt leave your hair sticky but it does give you body and hold your curls in place.
B001G7QBFY|5|Easy application and offers a creamy, natural glow to cheeks.  Perfect shade.
B0026IBSVE|3|Nothing special here. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. I needed to do several passes to get all the hair - which is pretty standard for my hair type. I have medium width hair, but a lot of it. I had to stop twice to re-oil and clean the blades because they stopped cutting (again this is normal for my hair) The packed contents are nice, but the attachments feel very flimsy. Maximum length attachment is 1-inch, which is kinda disappointing since I prefer 1.5 or 2-inch options. The build, however feels solid and is rather ergonomic (in a good way, its a smart design)
B00008BFXJ|5|This new slightly angled brush head is great. I have used a Sonicare for about 4 years and the new design is much better. <br />Sonicare use has really improved my gums which had been bleeding and  receeding.
B002RGRJC2|5|I have corse hair, this stuff works. Softens up my hair and makes it easy to blow dry and style.
B0079M5PLG|5|I've been taking pills regularly for years and always hated the geriatric looking pill boxes. Finally I'm no longer embarrassed to take out my pill case  in front of people. The case is very stylish and most important is that it's functional. I love the Sabi line and would highly recommend to anyone who takes pills/vitamins regularly.
B00BPEBYPU|5|This conditioner makes my hair so soft i can brush through it when it wet without putting any product in. I have gone through almost every store brand, salon brand and deep conditioning mask and oil i can find and i am buying a giant bottle of this conditioner.<br />I am not as thrilled with the shampoo but it is good.<br /><br />Con- like all pureology products i find i use a large amount. (my hair is down to my lower back)
B000V76ANI|5|This is a wonderful sunblock, especially for kids. It's easy to apply and protects well, but is not too think, not greasy & doesn't leave a white coat on the skin.  I highly recommend it.
B00PC4ETXI|3|This is only one glove, not two as pictured
B001399LNY|4|I love these, and I always keep one new one on hand.  The reason I keep a spare, though, is that the teeth fall out after about a year.  The rod still heats well, but you can't use it without the teeth and I have not found any replacements for them.
B001N1H6DO|5|Grand daughter loved it and so did mommy. Made it easier to comb through her long curly hair. Would recommend!
B004PX874E|1|I obviously tried this parfum before I bought on line, this smelled horrible. What a waste of money.  I will never buy perfumes on line again as I was unable to return this item because it is liquid.  Live and learn..........
B003MJG19K|1|Im mystified by the high praise others have given this product and purchased it based on the high marks.  If it works for them, great. For me it absolutely dried my skin out to the point where I looked like a prune. This was alarming as if you are a middle aged woman you might be able relate to. I tried to give it a chance, using it for several days but had to give up finally.
B007VDULAI|5|These clip ons are favorites for when I want to change my hair style quickly and give my hair a break from glue or sew ins.  Since it is Yaki no one knows its not my hair unless I tell them.
B000AA5VAO|5|I have tried other facial hair removers, but this works the best. It has been over 4 months since i started using it and I don't regret any purchase that I have made. I use it for my upper lip, It only takes four-eight minutes and eliminates all the hair. I have a sensitive skin and I have not seen any negative effects. With the price, I highly believe that this is one of the best Hair remover in the market.
B000ME2YWG|4|works great
B0030GFXLW|1|I'm curious how this can be labeled for colored hair when the first ingredient is Sodium Laureth Sulfate. Sulfates are well known to strip color from hair. Loreal does the same thing, only the sulfate they use has a different name. What ever happened to truth in advertising?
B0030DE8F2|5|It has reduced the under eye wrinkles and bags that I previously had. I have been very pleased with the results I have had with this eye cream.
B00EOB0042|5|I have tried many &#34;natural&#34; deodorants but nothing works as well as this.  The lavender smell is great and it really does protect against any body odor for the entire day.  I chase around my 7 month old, work out, and live in a very hot and humid area.  Despite running around all day, this deodorant really does an amazing job!  Really happy with this purchase, I have already repurchased this item.  Just a bit of warning though, a little goes a long way, a thin layer will do the trick.  I have applied too heavily and noticed that when I did perspire that it solidified, not that big of a deal though.  Thank you for making an effective, non toxic deodorant that I feel comfortable and confident using, especially around my baby.
B00GXMCJRQ|5|Recently my granddaughter had something in her eye.  We went into the bathroom and I took out an eye cup my mother used for me.  After filling it with water and my granddaughter using it for the first time, she replied, &#34;This is magic.&#34;  So we got her her own and put it in with her Valentine presents.  She will be thrilled.
B004W1XHPS|5|My husband loved the scent of this! It is not too strong or masculine but definitely has the presence of cool manly scent. It also stays throughout the day.
B00ENJN8S0|5|it takes all my deadskin ..i use it every 3 days.. very good sponge!
B00DNVW6BE|5|This vibe is on the large size and is significantly longer than the Aneros Helix which was a major disappointment. The Helix has an annoying knob on the exterior that makes the it too painful to use and it was just too short to reach my prostate. I have a long torso so maybe that's why I needed the extra 3&#34; the Verve provides.<br /><br />It has proven to be water tight so far. It has an O ring at the combination battery cover/switch/speed control knob (just like ever other vibe like this one). It is absolutely smooth with molding seams or rough spots. Very good speed control though the adjustment is a bit awkward as the knob has quite a bit of resistance when trying to turn it when inserted. This may loosen up with use and I suspect there is an O ring behind it as well.<br /><br />The size (width) was a bit daunting at first, but working slowly with plenty of lube got it just where it needed to be. For someone more &#34;experienced,&#34; this vibe could be on the small size judging from some of the plugs and other products I've seen. For a novice like me, it took a bit of getting used to but I've now gotten accustomed to it. The angle and length are absolutely perfect for me. I would recommend it without hesitation.
B005NZ6790|5|but only because i want these all to myself.. forget you guys... i bought my first pair of these years ago and the cord shorted out on me.. i attempted to fix them but after seeing this price... why waste the time.. love love love these.. probably saved myself thousands over the years in haircuts and i dont have to tip myself  ;)
B0041NZBXI|5|Great fit and my husband uses this blade almost every day. I love the clean shaved mans appearance...nothing pleases me more than a man who takes pride in himself .
B00P1S3FTY|3|This stand is a lil flimsy. Sometimes it falls over once I put the wig on it. It's not sturdy enough. It serves it's purpose. It was easy to put together. It's great for traveling.
B002ANEDRG|1|It is funny that a fogless mirror made for the shower foods up every time. Made of cheap plastic, poorly designed, one area on the mirror doesn't attempt to be fogless while the rest will fog after a couple minutes. Way too expensive for what you get. Wish I could put less than one star. I would like to say you get what you pay for but in truth I paid waaay too much and should have gotten so much better quality. This um is worth maybe $2.00.
B00TYSRAJS|2|The reviews misled me.  I've used an electric groomer for years...wahl.  I bought this one because it's wireless.  It is also very underpowered compared to what I was used to.  I ended up purchasing another wahl and the difference in power and cutting is night and day.  I will keep this as a back up for small cutting jobs....
B00FSBWDR4|4|My hair is gray and It really made them shine and not look brassy!
B00GPP4RIU|5|Good product. Just add it to my collection.
B00H8ZSHNM|5|My wife loves this product.<br /><br />When I am planning to order anything from Amazon, she reminds me she is running low on Phytoceramides, true or not.
B0084HCIHY|4|I am so grateful that I don't have to melt this Shea butter whenever I have to use it. I would have rated it five stars but every time I use it, it makes my hair itch. I'll try mixing it with some of my oils and see if that helps. over all, best quality Shea butter I have used.
B000P250TE|5|This purchase was for a Mother's Day gift, and I think it will be lovingly accepted. The two item set is a beautiful gift.
B0036YGAZ6|5|My wife loves Calvin Klein Obsession and I like it on her too.  You can't go wrong with this!
B00FS0Q8GW|4|It makes me look better.<br />I need it to wear without ponytail and it's not stable on my head. :)<br />Just for now I try my best to figure out, how use it. I really want to wear it.<br />Actually, quality is pretty good.
B000052Y2W|4|I use this with the UltraSwim shampoo and it works really well. My hair doesn't feel as soft as it would if I weren't swimming but it does the job for the most part.  I have long hair past my shoulder blades and I swim 2-3 x week for about 6 months out of the year then I revert to swimming 1 x week.  It has a nice mild fragrance and I also use it prior to jumping in the pool to further protect my hair from the chlorine.  After using the shampoo I place the conditioner in my hair and leave it in as close to 3 minutes as possible because I have gotten the best results that way.  Also, it helps to use the shampoo and conditioner as soon after leaving the pool as possible.
B00R848RZQ|5|Makes my skin feel better and it seems to smooth out wrinkles as well! Will order more when this runs out! Great product!
B00IS6XPQY|5|My lashes are actually thicker since using this enhancer.  My lashes have always been long and when using mascara they look thicker.  The difference in using this product I dont feel I have to use it.  My eyes are very sensitive and using ANYTHING is a risk for me. I put this on every morning after washing my face.  Loving the results!
B001G5HZCY|5|These things are amazingly sharp.  I have a dense, beard with very coarse hair.  I can destroy a lesser razor in a single shave sometimes.  These razors glide right through with no problem, and I get several uses out of each blade.  I would recommend these to anyone who has gotten into DE shaving.  There is review after review online that will say the same thing.  I do caution new DE shavers though... these things can cut you up in a heartbeat.  Do no apply any unnecessary pressure on your razor while shaving... simply concentrate on maintaining your blade angle, let the weight of the razor do the work, and these blades will do the rest without a problem.
B000EVEKIS|5|I have been using this product for along time to keep my hair moisturized and thickened.  This really works when it comes to hair growth.
B000OYJ9AO|5|Have always loved this lotion. Amazing scent. It's described as strawberry banana, but I think more tropical coconut.
B00PJV5VYK|3|Fits kind of awkwardly on my belly button since the heart is really big. I probably won't be wearing it very often. However, it's good quality and I didn't have any problems with it.
B008RIA2WI|5|comfortable
B001JK6N3I|5|It works!
B00RPQ1JYS|5|Love It!
B0006O2GNO|5|Everything was ok!
B00FPKJ1JQ|3|I wish they came in more colors :) yellow black and etc :) their adorable I love them!
B0045RIURE|1|Not sure if we had a bad sample but the taste was really REALLY bad.<br />We tried several and they all taste about the same but this one, all thou strong, is just completely useless.<br /><br />To bad
B00JFRLP9Y|5|this is just what the Dr. said I needed
B00IQMG5QW|5|Exact color match. Arrived in good condition. The package arrived early. All in all, a great experience.
B009UA2BCG|1|These eyelashes are HARD, they do not feel natural and the hurt to wear throughout the day. Half of them are worthless, depending on what kind of look you're going for. I usually don't write reviews but I just wanted to warn the next possible buyer - BEWARE: there are much better products out there for a better price.. and the eyelashes don't actually poke or hurt your eyes!!
B00I4A9PMM|5|Revitalash is the best. I tried rapidlash product for two months but couldn't see the result. For me, this product surely works.
B00GA2GQMI|3|Ok
B002D48QMA|4|Good price, timely shipping.
B00008ZPG9|5|I use no other cream. This is fantastic.
B00IT1HKV4|5|I use this oil on my hands before I go to sleep. It has softened my cuticles, moisturized my skin and strengthened my nails. My hands look younger and feel great. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of moisture. It does have a light nutty smell. A little goes a long way. Will buy again for myself and as gifts to others.
B00E68O4JU|5|I'd like to start by saying don't be frightened away by the negative reviews you might read. I always search reviews of products before I make purchases, especially ones that have higher price tags. At first I was worried after reading peoples horror stories of needing to cut off their hair because it got stuck in this styler. I still really liked the concept of this styler and took a chance. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!! I couldn't use a curling iron to save my life. Even when I did manage a curl or two with a regular curling iron the curl would fall out within two hours.<br />As soon as I got my Curl Secret I couldn't wait to try it out. Like many of the positive reviews I reiterate &#34;read the instructions&#34;. Be sure to have the styler facing your head in the right direction, only use 1/2&#34; - 1&#34; sections of hair, and make sure your hair is tangle and product free. At first I struggled finding a comfortable way to hold the styler. It is a bit awkward until you get used to it. Put your section of hair in, squeeze, it twirls your hair in, wait for the beeps, release, and you come out with a truly amazing curl.<br />I'm not sure how any of the people who wrote negative reviews were using this styler to end up getting their hair stuck. If you try to put too much hair in the styler beeps and will not pull your hair in. Pretty simple there.<br />Aside from how easy this is to use I absolutely love how long the curls stay in. I curled my hair and after a ten hour work shift it was still as curly as right after I did it. Plus, the next day they relaxed a bit more and gave a softer look. I have done nothing but rant about this product any chance I get. Don't let those negative reviews scare you. Buy it!!
B000N758A2|3|This do not work as well for me as I expected. It does not give my hair the shine that I wanted. It is just ok. I am African American with relaxed medium length hair
B00Q2MYU1U|4|I never really put anything after I shave, and I do have a lot of facial hair.  I had to put this at a about half my face, that's the area that I shave.  It was more soothing than I expected,  I did not personally experience the 'cooling' sensation but I did feel a positive difference when you put it on.  It was not greasy which I loved and easily absorbed by your skin.  One caveat though, the scent is a bit too strong, and putting this on your face, so close to your nose is quite overwhelming.  It will be great if the manufacturers can tone down the scent a bit or better yet, offer an unscented version.  Overall, a great post shave balm that gives your skin a smoother  and calming feeling
B005X6M7JS|5|OMG!!! I love this product, after 15 years of struggling with acne I have finally found something that works great and clears my breakouts fast. the first day I noticed a amazing difference in the size of my pimples and my skin began to clear fast , this is a great product very easy to use and and will save me a lot of money by not going to my expensive spa that charges $100 per treatment, for anyone dealing with breakouts give this a try it  WORKS!!!!!
B00EQF3O30|5|It's a good addition to the fragrance.  These products do not have a dominant scent to them.
B007DMS9XI|5|Love this
B0015KHMRS|1|The Silver colored models are good quality - this one didn't work out of the box. Cheap, flimsy feel - just junk. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!
B000O5VKK0|5|Product arrived promptly, as described and performs well with ALOT of nose hair - no pain, which is nice.
B001WAKUIO|1|Product is not the real thing.  Do not buy from Beauty It Is.  Shampoo was runny and must have been watered down.
B000PZCGAW|5|Really like the smell. Good seller. As for pores, stilling trying. Hope it works!. Only tried for a week or so and the result is not yet showing...
B00HQW86WY|5|Love Loma products.  All natural and not too expensive.
B00478LF78|1|Vendor was great, however; I've seen no noticeable change in my condition at this point and have been diligent with its use...as is the case with everything that I've purchased to &#34;cure&#34; this problem.
B0018MQHO2|5|Actually, I rarely give 5 stars. Have had this for several months now. It works, is sort of attractive & doesn't get moldy. It is everything I've wanted. Looked for some time before I found it. Thank you.
B001FXUTUM|5|it does hurt cuz your pulling out your hair, but it works too...good price for this item since its only a spring
B001OVQSJG|1|I think this product is not authentic. It left my scalp VERY DRY AND ITCHY after I used it and it did not perform as advertised. I think the supplier of this product is diluting it or something. I hope that amazon fixes this.
B0014DJ06W|5|My hairdresser (who commutes between Israel and the US) presented me with my first bottle-ette of Alfaparf Semi Di Lino Diamond Pure Crystals Illuminating Serum -- and when I couldn't 'beg' it from him, I was delighted to find it at Amazon. Truly marvelous for<br />\\"crowning glories\\"!
B00BZWSG3A|5|I began using this yesterday and I'm loving it!  My color is light 48 so I didn't get it here, clearly.  This IS a full coverage foundation that dries down to a matt finish; meaning a little goes a long way.  I use Benefit POREfessional primer first then using a Beauty Blender sponge 'pounce' this over my face a section at a time until I have the coverage desired.  Love the finish!  Contour and blush glide on like a dream.  I highly recommend this product but I suggest you get it at Sephora and save over $20 to spend on something else, like a new lipstick!
B000IOBF16|5|I don't have sensitive skin, and this product works great!  I use it daily and it really helps with the exfoliation of old skin on my face, quickly.  The new skin is more flexible and less wrinkly.
B00009RB1E|5|Delivered fast, brand new, reasonable cost and shipping.    Be sure you are buying 1 for your specific Norelco razor.
B0009ET3SC|5|great towel.
B0012KJ8WS|5|EXCELLENT!! Just what I was looking for and good quality for home!!
B0054LHI5A|5|good find, great price
B000U0C65C|5|This flat iron is a great tool.  Heats up super quick.  Gets really really hot fast so be careful not to use too hot.    Silkens and straightens hair leaving a perfectly smooth finish. Great when used with chi silk infusions and IC hair straightener.    I recommend this product to anyone...................
B00LXL261Q|5|For my daughter's prom hair do - she loves them!
B00B66SRV6|1|This stuff has lots of Splenda as a sweetener. And I don't trust the &#34;non gmo&#34; label either. If it's not organic corn it's not pesticide free. Ucan did not quench my thirst and gave my digestive system a workout. Not good for you-stay away!
B0038SPKQA|1|I'm sad to say that the lady that wrote the review describing the smell of this cologne as pledge hit the nail on the head. It not only smells like pledge.... Add some pepper to that and bottle it up and save urself 125.00. Before you waste ur money on any cologne from the internet go to a store and smell it. I have purchased 100's of items from amazon and have been pleased with them all until this purchase. Although she sent her's to the homeless shelter I will be using mine to freshen my work boots.
B00HCRDS4O|2|It flakes. I have to keep checking to see if there's anything under my eyes, even though I only put on a little at a time, like the instructions say. Eyelashes do look longer though
B006POOQ1E|5|Love the smell and the way it wakes me up in the morning. It's rejuvenating and good for you!! My eyes look tired because of kids and working but this is a very nice treat for myself, I love it!! I'm 40 I can vouch that it works!
B000050FDY|5|This was the cheapest I found this product anywhere. Very satisfied.
B004J4LYU8|5|It is very natural looking, unlike the rest of hair color that turn the hair reddish. I think this hair color is by far the best yet
4639725450|4|thanks
B000NL34JU|5|Special Effects is the shizzle.  It grabs and holds like nothing else (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, MANIC PANIC!)<br /><br />I've been Atomic Pinking a stripe in my hair for many years and the quality is consistent.  It will also turn your hands and towels pink.  There is no extra charge for this.<br /><br />Here is a \\"helpful\\" guide to applying this, or any vegetable-based color to your hair:<br /><br />[...]
B00BFJGJ3M|5|First time using pomade that my barber recommended trying and washes out easily with just water, it also has pretty decent smell to it as well I would recommend to anyone who wants to try out pomade for the first time.
B007ZH2AW2|5|If looked all over for a short Diamond Deb nail file with the sharp pointed end. I had previously gotten an 8&#34; but it was too long and the point was rounded. Did not like it. This 4&#34; is perfect so glad to have found it.
B00U79I9XE|1|It gets too hot and melts your toy
B005F4EACU|5|I use hemp seed oil in a body lotion that I make. It is a wonderful product and works very well in recipes for moisturizing treatments.
B003ATS2QC|4|Easy to set up.  Blue numbers lock at weight so you can step off and still see the weight.  No need to &#34;pre-cal&#34; with an initial step like my previous one
B0094BQIQQ|3|Pravana makes amazing long lasting colors. Unfortunately this is not dark green at all. This is a deep turquoise. I was very disappointed as I cannot find a good dark green anywhere. It's a beautiful color just not at all what the color is described as. If you want a good dark long lasting turquoise hair dye then this is what you are looking for!
B002R72N36|5|I love these! I use all the different sizes and it gives me a clean uniform curl. Very easy to use
B000R8W4BS|3|I like it. I don't really notice any change, but it feels like I'm doing something good for myself. Is that enough to buy it again? I don't think so. I will have to keep looking. I don't believe in miracles, but there should be something out there that helps remove those dark circles under my eyes. There is concealer, but I want to fix it, not hide it. This does neither, so far.
B001GS6OB4|5|These epilator is super easy to use, pain free and it really works, I use it in my legs, underarm and facial hair and it works great.
B000WN2T9U|2|Very poor quality not what i expected it doesn't look like a tiara at all its more like a hair clip with a comb . keeping it only because it came with veil and gloves that i haven't received yet .
B00AU9VX3Y|2|Great Product, Great Shipping.<br /><br />Don't tell anyone but this is 50% of the reason African Americans age so well. shhhhhhh<br /><br />Ervin<br /><br />UPDATE!!<br />So the first time I purchased, it was great,  came in nice tubs in a very nice packaging the second time it showed up in these silver non labeled pouches and plastic bags. Looks home made, which is not what the description said when I bought it.<br /><br />There are just these bags of yellow clay looking matter. I'm not happy at all this time. I still love shea butter, but the seller's execution is terrible. I'll find a new source .
B00EZM9ESS|1|I ordered this product thinking that they where supposed to be neon but i didn't receive any neon studs Mine are in black, white, silver, gold, and red. I wanted some brightly colored studs to add a pop of color and i instead received dull boring colors.
B002NTAAII|3|The soap is great but I only got one soap instead of a set off three, so the price was a rip off, and is why I give it only 3 starts. To get 1 soap I can get it cheaper at Gracious Hime in NYC.
B008ZT0QQG|5|Love this product, of all the retinol serums/ creams I have tried, this particular Neutrogena retinol is the best by far. When I don't use it, I can really see a difference in the pores, tone, and color of my skin, in my opinion, this is the best retinol out there!
B000EBAHHG|5|This is a great product and was very happy was able to order in such a large size.  I am definitely going to order again and again.  Use this several times a day.  Delivery was very quick. Thanks.
B003N8QU4Q|5|THE FRIST TIME I SAW ONE OF THESE MY GRANDMOTHER GAVE ME ONE.  I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE I FRIST PUT ONE TO MY HAIR.  I RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO USE ON CHILDREN'S HAIR.  IT DOES NOT PULL TANGLED HAIR  AS A COMB WOULD.
B0058DOH5I|3|This step is as advertised...a little extra height to help me get in bed...nicely made and functional.  It arrived on time and way over-packed.<br />Kind of like a Russian doll...a box in a box in a box...factory box, another box, and an Amazon box--plus bubble wrap...
B00J44UVZW|5|I have heard from TV personalities over the years that Phytoceramides are to be a &#34;Facelift in a Bottle.&#34; The main ingredient in Plant-Derived Ceramides replenishes the ceramides that your skin loses over time. Studies have proven that Phytoceramides can increase moisture retention in your skin, which drastically affects the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.<br /><br />I just started taking Phytoceramides, and am eager to see what benefits I gain from them. I feel like I am doing good for my body, and my future appearance/health!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review.

B000EVEL14|5|My mother in law swears buy this, it's the only product she uses
B003SJ0FSW|5|I have used this a few times and it does what it says in the ad,since I have dry skin I don't do too often and I follow the directions carefully.
B001VCUQE6|5|I would nick my chin if I don't pay close enough attention, so be cautious when using these blades. Very sharp!
B002NG9PSW|5|This is a good, quality product.  My husband's hair was so dry (he's 60) that I put some on his head and rubbed it in his scalp.  His hair actually turned darker - (it was grey) now it's salt and pepper.  Everybody commented on how good his hair looked.  That's how dry his head and hair was.  Helped with dandruff because it is a scalp tonic too.  This is an oil so you have to use sparingly or you could get a 1960's slicked down look.
B00S5LB08W|5|I have been applying this product to my face after I washing. So far it has been a good experience. Goes on nicely without leaving a greasy residue and the pump bottle makes it easy to use. I'll continue to use!
B00HZZPDY6|5|Product feels great on skin and noticeably smooths my face and hands. I am excited to see long term results!
B00LBZFLOS|5|Everything I'm expecting :)
B0050QJ0YQ|4|I feel like this wand doesn't curl the hair as nice as a regular curling iron. Makes curls tighter as well
B00IAYWXJE|5|I really love these I've ordered them twice already!
B002X9XV48|5|This lotion was a great purchase for those being a little friendly to their wallet. The tanning salons will ask over 100$ for the product that Amazon sells here. I purchases somewhat worried that I might receive a different kind than the store sold, or a rip off version, but this was the real deal.<br /><br />This lotion has a great fragrance, something a little fruiter but not coconut on the beach fruity, but it also is amazingly silky and has a great darkening affect. If you are looking for a good bronzer that smells good, does a good job and even leaves you feeling smooth, this is a great product to help your tan stay darker longer.
B0044B4GJC|5|I've been using this product my whole life and I love it.  I have beautiful silky thick natural hair... no frizz... Thanks to this product.
B00BR0H6KY|2|These strips do not stick to your teeth very well and when I finally got them on the strips started to dissolve into little pieces. My teeth are a little whiter though.
B003Q8NQW2|2|I like the pen like applicator.  I have tried the other lipstain's that have a roll on applicator.  Those are horrible.  The color is very pink.<br />It does not seem to stay on my lips very long but,  it could be because I do not put very much on.  I do not want to have such PINK lips.
B002KQCC1M|5|very good
B007QEOK4A|5|I've gotten these twice from here and they are always consistent, unlike the local store. They add a very pretty pink and white to your nails and last for weeks at a time. I can usually get two sets out of each box. Min 3 sets out of both boxes from the extra nails.
B002ZSW7OC|1|First of all the box was gross and sticky and when I opened the product it seemed as if it was already opened, then I used the product and it made my face feel extremely cool kind of like I put toothpaste all over my face. The product didn't do anything for my skin. My overall experience with this product was horrible, I would not recommend this product.
B004883YSU|3|It seems like Korres was trying to jump on the lipstain-esque bandwagon, but this is more like a lipgloss than a liquid lipstick. By hour 2, the color starts to bleed off the corners of my lip, but the color is nice and it's pretty moisturizing, albeit somewhat sticky. I will not be repurchasing.
B005PNAQLA|5|It puts more effort into oral.
B00GOBPDAG|2|These clippers are NOT ultra quiet as advertised, in fact the are just as loud if not louder than the $11 clippers i bought at Walmart. They do have less vibration but not quieter.
B00N8S5ZWE|5|Great price . And the way my son goes through cologne low prices are always appreciated!
B0083U0U7M|5|Great price, blends wells. Need to order more.
B0008KLOIE|5|It is the best thing I have found for my back pain relief. Highly recommend this product.
B002W701LC|5|Lovely fragrance and gentle on sensitive skin.
B0076Q7WH0|5|I was looking for Shampoo without sodium lauryl sulfate (neither any similar ingredients). Although some brand is titled &#34;Natural&#34; or &#34;Organic&#34;, only part of their ingredients are &#34;natural&#34;/&#34;organic&#34;. I'm glad that I found Pura d'or. Its ingredients show authentic free of sulfate.
B0054S63JA|3|I don't think it's as great as everyone says. I'd rather use the liquid bottle. This way is for the rich and people who are busy and in a hurry on the go sorta speak.
B00A3C3N5O|2|same plate designs on most of them, stamping is not as advertised. would not buy it again
B00JH2SFBS|5|Creamy texture! Smells great!
B000KOO8YA|5|I m glad i finally found this
B00ARF42H0|5|This is really one great trimmer.
B00466RIH2|5|it makes my face feel soft and smooth
B000N93VPY|5|At first, I was trying to put these on my Andis master clippers and they didn't fit. \\"I thought\\" they didn't fit but the guides have springs in them. So I clip in the back and push the extra guide forward and shazaam my clip guide works great.
B00B9Q16ES|5|Thank you very much, you did a good job :) excelent! you've been very helpfull :) ... again thank you !
B0058E3XJI|5|Delivered in 2 days ! Was cheap smells great and works really well! Very very happy with this purchase!!
B00GF1NZLY|5|good product
B005GMYPMG|5|Great product and good shipping,AAAAA+++++
B007SZCG0C|2|I used to be a stylist so this is a semi professional review. I changed my review to &#34;I don't like&#34; half way through based on the changes it made in my overall hair texture, not growth or loss. At first I loved the way my hair felt, I probably had a ton of build up based on hard water and product and this took it down to my own hair which is very fine and certainly thinner than it used to be or I would not be searching in the first place. So half a bottle left after about 6 weeks of use. I know about growth cycles and I possibly didn't use it through a cycle, I just got fearful of the end result if continued  I did not see a Surge, probably a waste of money and possibly a negative effect long term. Again I looked for a miracle and I know this is not it. And at worst this is not good advertising, you will not experience a surge and you will spend a ton of money hoping you found a cure.
B00T8J25RK|5|The flash tats are all gorgeous and I love how they have so many different collections so you can pick the style you like the most or experiment with them. They're super fun for the summer time. They're pretty easy to apply. Depending on where you place them and how often you fidget/touch them they last anywhere from 3-6 days. I found that the ones closest to my wrist didn't last as long as the ones farther up my arm because with each movement of my wrist it caused the temporary tattoo to wrinkle and if stretched too much they would tear a little. They are also easy to remove with an oil based makeup remover or just plain olive oil. I absolutely loveee flash tattoos. So easy and SOooo beautiful. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.
B000FTYUKM|2|The product package shows \\"7 Day trial\\" sticker on the front of the box. When  I peeled the sticker off the box it shows that it is actually only a 3 day trial package. I found it to be very misleading and will think again before purchasing anything else from Amazon.
B00I6DVPFW|2|Fun colors in the jar, but really more that I'd only use for my toenails or hand over to a teenager--and small bottles so you can use them up before they start to separate. In the end, though, I kept the black, the silver, gold, and two glitter top coats. I use the glitters on my nails as a way to toughen my base color, but everything else goes on my toes because her colors are not thick and they chip, chip, chip. Two coats of any of the lighter shades, for example, come out looking streaky. You need three coats, really, and by then, it's hard to not have a mess.
B00AMO22SM|5|I love taking baths in this salt! You notice a difference in the water instantly. I usually use about 1-2 cups of salt for each bath, and it is lasting a while.
B00R1W99VQ|5|I love this plate. Etching is deep enough, image sizes are large enough for my long nails. Plenty of options to choose from.  The only thing I would want changed is a complete design such as the hearts design on the bottom with the message, the heart was not complete. Overall I would recommend and to let you know I bought a duplicate a back up so I have 2. Thank you for a great product.
B00HSE4WJG|5|bought as a gift but planning on getting  myself.
B000AUIFCA|5|I believe so highly in this toothbrush that when I couldn't find one to purchase without having to buy 2 or more regular brushes with it, I took the advice of a store clerk to check the internet.  I was delighted to find the offer of 3 Oral B Triumph FlossAction Power Toothbrush Refills for a very resonable price.  I made my very first internet purchase, when I ordered them and am very pleased.
B001MS7GYW|5|At 25 I can finally say I am happy with my skin. After many, many years of struggling with break outs (starting in 6th grade), I found this to be the only makeup that gave me the coverage I needed and wanted without causing breakouts or making me oily. I wish I had found it before wasting so much money on products I hated or that caused more breakouts. This goes on very smoothly, covers what it needs to cover, but is not thick and does not look heavy. I apply it with a wet makeup sponge (which you can also find on Amazon) and find that it gives me the best coverage. This makeup does very well at making skin tone very even, and I think it has actually IMPROVED breakouts while covering them up at the same time. My only complaint would be that I think the color is a tad off for me. I purchase #20 because it is the closest to my skin tone- a shade lighter is way too light, a shade darker is way too dark, and #20 is a tad too dark. It is probably also the most popular color because it is often sold out in stores, which led me to purchase here. I would encourage anyone to give this stuff a try!
B00OHZF98C|5|Quick shipping and excellent packaging. The serum makes my skin feel soft. I will know more as the effects of the serum when I've used it for a longer period of time.
B00HHYLF6U|3|The blades are kind of okay. Some are only good for a day or two and then others seem more normal and can last for about 6 days or so. The price was good though.
B001ET7EAU|5|To all my male brethren who suffer from dry skin, especially in the winter time: fear not, for here is your answer.  I've been using this shower gel for over a year.  It smells of sandalwood, i.e., it has a manly smell that slowly dissipates over the course of the day.  I hesitate to say that your skin feels moist after drying yourself off from a shower, but it definitely doesn't feel dry.  I still use hand cream in the winter time [[ASIN:B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]], but this shower gel suffices for spring, summer, and fall.<br /><br />Get it, and banish your cracked, dry skin forevermore.
B00028QFAY|5|No odor. You can still sweat, which I actually want when I'm working out. I've had breast cancer heard that the regular kind is a carcinogen.
B004YRUDIY|5|This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used, and considering my vanity cabinet looks like its own beauty supply store I know what I am talking about.  This left my hair so soft and took the puffiness out of my roots.  I have 2a hair type, but my neice;s hair is 3c and I used this on her hair and it did wonders!!!!
B00IBJ54UI|5|My hair loves this conditioner as much as I do.!
B000NNQV7U|5|Years ago I used to use this but can't find it in stores around here. It's the exact same as I remember. Works great, washes clean and smells perfect, not like chemical gel at all :)
B00C4VL48K|5|I've used the Palladio brow pencils for about five years now and really prefer them over many others.
B00150G59Y|3|I also am (probably was) a diehard user of Pureology Nano Work shampoo and conditioner, however after reading the two previous reviews regarding the sale of Purology and the new watered down version I will let everyone know once I use the product I just received.  If it is anything like the previouse reviews, I to will find another product.  Man, the previous product was awesome.  I am sorry to hear that it has been sold to another company and is no longer the same, but watered down.  Good luck to everyone in finding a product that was this great.
B00NV6T1TG|5|I use this for studs. It's very small but that's what I was wanting. Great price!
B00HJ9SNSQ|4|chain has a clasp, but is shorter than I would have liked. i'll be adding onto it. Otherwise, great piece. Looks exactly like the picture.
B004GCBYA8|2|Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick in Primrose is a candy pink, much too light for me personally.  It is definitely not suitable for any women over 25 years of age.  It is also goes on dry, caking and dragging on the lips.  I only wish I hadn't purchase two of these lipsticks, one of which I had already opened, making it non-returnable...a waste of time and money.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|Greater clean than I thought
B006RFZ98K|5|Works great for your pores and blackheads , great for oily skin
B00K4PLC30|5|I use this product with standard Jergens lotion to add a luxurious feel and longevity to my husband's back massages.<br />My husband works out several days a week and usually has sore muscles, so I make an effort to massage him any chance I get. One evening,  unbeknownst to him, I added this the Sweet Almond Oil to our standard lotion, and VIOLA -- he was instantly transported into another realm and wondered how I managed to provide the best massage ever. My husband was absolutely thrilled with this product addition to our massage routine.<br /><br />Additionally, my child tends to have dark circles under her eyes, and after placing this oil (no lotion dilute)  around the eye area, the dark circles have lessened. I'm sure it will be just a matter of weeks until they completely diminish. The Sweet Almond Oil is very gentle on the skin and adds great moisture. I'm very pleased and will be buying again.
B0000C88FL|2|Despite its price, this was not a good replacement shaver for an older, noisy electric shaver.  While it performs well when shaving legs, BEWARE as it is very rough on underarms (as the enclosed product brochure warns.)  It will still be necessary to use two shavers.  Additionally, the shaver head foil broke after less than a year.  Back to using the old shaver.
B001KYSB3I|5|It's the best!!
B002U26LX6|4|The best lotion ever.  Absorbs into the skin and really moisturizes.  My skin looks and feels wonderful.  Silky and soft.
B00GF7HHT4|5|My first try at henna was with Henna Guys burgundy.  Researched the best way to get the deepest burgundy and decided to mix with all organic lemon juice, let sit for several hours before applying (instructions say this isn't necessary w/burgundy), then applied with a bottle (after several applications I recommend a plastic bowl and brush), wrapped in saran wrap, then left it in overnight for about 10 hours.  Color came out beautiful. I went from a dark ashe blonde with some gray, white and silver, to a deep, rich burgundy.  The first application faded a lot, normal for a first time application.  Mine bled w/every wash, which I do not do daily.  I also deep condition w/organic coconut oil w/i the first week after app, this deepened the color, making it richer. Decided to use BAQ Jamila for a second app, hearing that burgundy would be easier to achieve w/o the bleed.  Wasn't nearly as impressed. Jamila was very orangey, and I experienced bleed, but not for as long, but the color faded quick. Very quick. Ridiculously quick (baq 2012). Went back to Henna Guys burgundy.  Love this color.  Yes, burgundy bleeds a tiny bit w/every wash or swim in the pool. It's not the henna, it's the beet root that gives it the burgundy that's bleeding. So even when this fades, it's still a deep rich red, with a little less purple every wash. I like the purple, so I'll be experimenting with light glazing using manic panic in hot pink & ultra violet which I read somewhere may help achieve my goal. Before I do that, I am going to try my next app of HG burgundy mixed with filtered water and not letting it set for hours since the instructions say it isn't necessary, just to see if the color comes out more burgundy (had read that w/some hennas it's not productive to let them sit due to additives to achieve other colors besides basic lawson henna color like Jamila). If you want a burgundy with a purple overtone, then expect to apply more frequently, or supplement washes w/a beet juice concoction. The smell didn't bother me at all. Better than the chemicals from dye. Highly recommended.
B004H5D40W|2|This product does not stay put in the shower unfortunately.
B0009OMNW0|5|This stuff is amazing for those of us with short or fine hair...  It is simply the only product I've ever used (and I'm metro sexual as heck) that can instantly mold your hair, and it will never move.  No waiting for it to &#34;dry&#34;  or having to trick it into place then spray it with hairspray quickly and hope you don't encounter a breeze before it dries...  Nope, it plain works.  FYI if your hair shouldn't be too dry or too wet (unless you like the wet (but not Shiney) look when applying.
B00IGWP7S4|3|Hard to get it to stick to the brush.  A little too powdery
B000NN1XP0|5|Good shipping, good product. Happy with my purchase. One bottle for home and one for my handbag.
B0031ZV8OS|5|I purchased two of these brushes (I have 3 girls) and they are wonderful! One child has sensory issues so brushing her very long hair was always a problem, not any more!  I wish I would have found these brushes sooner, they are great & I highly recommend them.
B009CFMYAS|5|One of my greatest pleasures is taking bubble baths with my 11 year old daughter.  It has been a challenge to find a product that I can trust for both of us. TotLogic Bubble bath is perfect--it allows me to soak my tired muscles while my daughter plays with the bubbles --no worries about any chemicals!!<br /><br /> I highly reccomend this product for ALL generations!
B00AC2MCWU|3|It's ok not too strong
B000FMVL1A|3|This has been a great product, but it has changed.  Now it burns the eyes.  Still seems to help with the scalp.
B00BWB086C|5|Nothing in the world has improved my hands like this product. My hands were dry, chapped, bleeding, and embarrassing. I slept in gloves with warm vasoline, I tried every hand cream suggested! And then some! Now, my hands are smooth and hydrated. Even my age spots are fading! A true miracle for me.
B00PG89Z9I|5|Excellent
B00JB6JKZU|5|I love this product.  It's a creme, but not a thick, heavy creme.  It really does add volume to my short, thin hair.  I definitely see a difference in my hair when I use this product.  A little goes a long way, so it's also a good value.
B009B1853S|1|I had to return this product because it smells nothing like the original Love Love Love. I was highly disappointed that it didn't smell like it should since I know how it should smell since I'm an avid user of this fragrance.  Luckily the return process with the vendor was easy & I got my refund in a timely manner.
B008NAW30Y|5|Excelent
B00APVZ7HA|5|My sister introduced me to the product and all I can say is WOW! After just a few uses, my skin looks much smoother, my pores are smaller, and those stubborn blackheads are gone! This product is super easy to use and hasn't irritated my sensitive skin! This has now become a staple of my skincare regimen, and I can't wait to explore the other options from Peter Thomas Roth.
B002WDXGCC|4|works great gentle massage and very quite
B00TKS5Y3Q|4|Nice! Very high quality clipper set. The smaller clipper works best for me - I use the larger clipper only for my big toes.
B004GHCTNE|1|I purchased this Violet Soft Black color because I wanted a bit of a plum colored tone to my black hair. I've used the Midnight Collection before and was satisfied with the results, so I decided to give this color a go. Needless to say, the color is misrepresented on the box and will NOT touch black hair.<br /><br />After use, I noticed that my roots (virgin hair) were extremely red. Almost orange. The remainder of my black hair was untouched. No color difference whatsoever.  I spent $10 on something that not only made the top of my head look like Chuckie from Rugrats', but didn't do anything except damage my silky locks. Would never recommend.
B001ESA2YG|5|this stuff works great. My daughter had long thick hair and this really helped to get it detangled and brush will recommend
B00W9VDV0E|4|It took a while for my body to get used to not having heavy metals rubbed to my skin, but after about a week of use this works perfect, just like you'd expect a regular deodorant to! Although it isn't ainti-perspicant, I found that I sweat way less now than when I used regular deodorant and forgot to put it on, for example. I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were other options in fragrance. But other than that this is the best deodorant I've had.
B000ALBLXY|5|muy bueno
B002VBRPZO|5|I love this mascara!  I first tried it after receiving it in a sample package; it was even a full size tube!  My lashes are very sparse.  I used to use the pink and green stuff but that started getting too flaky and didn't do as good a job as it used to.  I am amazed that even one coat makes my lashes huge, long and thick, and this has never flaked on me.  The amount in the container to true to size too and I keep thinking that it's about time to run out but hasn't yet and I've had it since September '11.  For me this is the perfect mascara and I will not waste my money on any of the other mascaras which claim to do as Mally actually does.
B00T6IHQCC|5|Biore Pore Strips are wonderful and fully deserve 5 stars.  I don’t find that the charcoal adds anything, so I debated on whether or not to remove 1 star for the Charcoal version.  I decided to stay with the 5 stars, since they do the same 5 star job as the regular strips and perhaps those with very oily skin would see a difference.  That said, I will be sticking with the regular, less expensive Biore Pore Strips.<br /><br />I could find so scientific studies which addressed the use of charcoal to control acne.
B00JJO972A|5|Really a good, heavier foundation to help cover scars.  Lasts through humidity unlike others I've tried.
B0051E3426|5|love them there flexy as can be and sturdy definitely worth every penny. I can wait to style my hair with them tonight!
B00BC4SVPE|5|Bought the phone case for my wife and she loves it.  It arrived early and was just as good as it looks online!
B00CN4L5DM|5|I work in an Amazon Fulfillment center and are required to go through security checks daily. I absolutely love this bag! I carry many items with me and they are able to see them easily which helps me go through with no problems. I would recommend this to anyone! Also, I received this item very quickly. Makes me proud to work for a company that is customer driven. We strive hard to ensure every single person is satisfied with their purchase!
B008DLT9H8|5|Wonderful, perfect shape. Love how my eyebrows look nice and clean. I wish i bought two lol. Maybe i'll just have to buy one more.
B0017QK75O|3|What a great way to save on waste!  The soap itself is nicely scented, suds up well, but unfortunately a bit drying.
B0047EPTIS|1|Its ok but loreal you can do best than theese over all love loreal all the way ok tray them
B0015AFWH0|5|bien
B00ACN2Q84|5|NICE AND QUITE , FIT VERY GOOD IN HAND .  CLEANS UP QUICKLY, THANKS
B00C7VVMFW|5|I love this product, I tried it while on a recent trip to Hawaii. The coverage is amazing not greasy.
B002AMUID0|4|It is bad for package. when I received it , all the packing are broken. hope you can pay more attention for future order.<br />Smell is very light. think it is suitable for me!
B0009OAIHM|3|doesn't smell the same
B008V1YLPA|5|This is a great beach bag.  Fits a lot of towels - about 4 total.  I can carry my sunblock, my tablet, my sunglasses, and the 4 towels.
