B00003CXRP|4.0|Really liked this movie about 5 days after I saw it originally. It took awhile for its content to &quot;hit&quot; me. I also saw it in a theater where the people laughed at Tom Hanks' antics, rather than sympathized, which I think really detracted from the film.  It gives you a lot to think about - what you would do if you were stranded, what you'd think about, etc. Overall, I think it's a really good movie, but the plot dragged a little and I didn't like the ending (everything happened too fast and too easy).
B00005R2M3|2.0|Shakira was in over her head.  She may have had such a tough time turning pretty Spanish into pretty English that this cd lacks the idomatic elements of language and sound that makes English Pop-Rock-soul music the most popular music in the world.<br />Since English uses consonant clusters it is not posible to produce the beautiful sounds that a vowel based language like Spanish permits.  Native English speakers and singers use the harsh grinding sounds of consonants to produce rude rock and crude pop.  Sonic perfection is not the goal!  <br />Sakira will only get better once she understand that noise is what drives English popular music.
B00005OM4N|5.0|(...)ok i really usually dont like pop music. im not a big fan of boy bands or any other of the little teen queens. but britney really surprised me in a good way! this album isnt your stereotypical \\"pop\\" music. it has a much funkier, nastier, more rhthymical flavor and that is so great to hear! shes got some really sweet, heartfelt ballads on the cd. but shes also got some straight up awesome songs with beats that will totally rock you. \\"boys\\" the one the neptunes produced is off the HOOK i swear! theres no real way to describe it except to tell you its got an awesome beat, great rhthym, and some dope lyrics that will make you look at britney spears in a totally different light. this girl isnt trampy, shes just growing up and it totally comes through on her cd which is DEFINTELY for the best.
B000002HD5|5.0|WARNING! This album causes extreme heartache and sorrow. It is brutally honest with absolutely NO apologies. You will hurt. I mean this is really some heavy shi-errr, stuff we're dealing with here. How can Greg Dulli be so right on? He really lays it all out.  And i thought after hearing this that nothing the whigs churned out since could possibly sound good, even if it WAS good, because this album is so AMAZING (and amazing makes merely good things seem like total DUKE) but i was wrong, so wrong. Shame on me, i'll never doubt thee again, Greg Dulli! Everything you do is amazing!
B00005LMBK|5.0|It seems like more and more &quot;supergroups&quot; are beginning to pop up on the scene now-a-days. Fortunatly for us, Gorillaz manages to create an entirely new sound, in addition to an incredibly good cd. The music on Gorillaz' self-titled album mixes hip-hop, trance, dub-reggae, and &quot;alternative&quot; (to borrow an umbrella term I don't really care for). I'd recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for something different than what is currently around.
B00005QDW5|2.0|Why would you buy a compilation package of such a well-known and best-selling band?  There are two possible reasons.  One is that you're a Pink Floyd tragic, and the promise of a re-mix of Echoes, some other modest remixes and one new(ish) track of modest merit, _When the Tigers are free_, is enough to have you loosen your wallet.  <br />If that's you, you're a mug.  People like you bought the last album by Gilmour-Mason-Wright without Roger Waters, _The Division Bell_, because it wore the Pink Floyd label.  Even though _Momentary Lapse of Reason _, the first album by The Other Three, should have been warning enough that owning legal rights to a name doesn't mean you'll make music worthy of that name.  <br />In short, some people will buy anything under the Pink Floyd label, but don't trust their judgement on how to spend the CD-buying dollar.  Me, I'm an irrational Pink Floyd fan too; I own all the albums up to Waters' departure, even his awful _The Final Cut_, plus various solo projects, rarities and bootlegs. Worse, I let nostalgia and hope mislead me into buying the first live album by The Other Three: _Delicate Sound of Thunder_.  But that dreary album taught me that there's a limit, and it was a few steps past it: it taught me that not everything labelled Pink Floyd is worth owning.  And that brings us back to _Echoes_, which is not worth owning.  <br />The other reason you might consider buying this compilation is that you're not a Pink Floyd collector.  You're considering owning this because you don't know too much about Pink Floyd but you'd like to have the highlights without owning the whole set of 13 albums.  (Or 17 or 18 albums if you count Gilmour-Mason-Wright without Waters as Pink Floyd.  But the post-split product isn't Pink Floyd, not on any purist grounds but simply because it isn't any good.)   <br />If that's you, you may be wondering: 'This compilation seems to contain a lot of excellent music.  How come it isn't worth buying?'  <br />Fair question.  The reason is that on this compilation there are too many dud tracks; the ratio of good tracks to dud tracks is lower than on any Pink Floyd album between _Piper at the Gates of Dawn_ and _Wish You Were Here_.  This so-called 'best of' isn't as consistently good as any of the early albums.  So if you want to own two Pink Floyd CDs, I'd recommend you start with _Meddle_, with _Dark Side of the Moon_ for seconds if you're after the familiar, or _Piper at the Gates of Dawn_ for seconds if you're after the freakish and quirkish.  <br />How come there are so many duds on _Echoes_?  Basically because late Pink Floyd is over-represented.  There were ominous signs on _Wish You Were Here_ and _Animals_ that the band wasn't working together any more, but Roger Waters took over with a vengeance on _The Wall_.  By then he'd turned from an interesting songwriter into a pompous bore who'd rather lecture than write a tune.  _The Wall_ is needle-thin, musically: _Another Brick_ has a great bassline, but tracks like _Comfortably Numb_ and _Run like hell_ are only 'highlights' because the rest is so very, very dull.  On the earlier, musically creative, albums they'd be filler at best, on a par with _See Saw_ from _Saucerful of Secrets_.   Waters' last Pink Floyd album, _The Final Cut_, consists of too many words delivered tunelessly over some musical noodling around from Gilmour and Mason.  Thumpingly obvious words, too: War is Bad, and other such insights.  <br />Roger Waters' post-Floyd solo albums only prove there is actually something more pointless than Pink Floyd without Waters: and that's Waters without Pink Floyd.  Listening to _Radio KAOS_ or _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ is like being trapped in a bar by a drunk shouting _Partisan Review_ headlines at you over the jukebox.  Anyway, so Waters left to pursue unmusical interests, while The Other Three sailed on to fill stadiums as a Pink Floyd covers band.  Having let their song-writing ability rust in the years they werepassengers in their own band, they weren't up to producing good new material.  Gilmour's folk-influenced _On the Turning Away_ is the best post-Waters Pink Floyd song, and probably better than anything Waters has written since he left, though it's nothing special.  Oddly, it isn't on this compilation. The post-Waters tracks on this compilation are not even the best of that lamentable cash-in.<br />So what you get with this compilation is good stuff from the early, good, albums, and dud stuff from the late, dud, albums.  Because Pink Floyd was so consistently good when they were good, and then so consistently bad when they became bad, you don't need to mix up the periods.  Just get one or two of the good albums from their remarkable best, and enjoy yourself.  <br />Quick Pink Floyd buyers guide?  First buys: _Meddle_, _Piper_, _Dark Side_.  Get any two of those instead of buying this double CD.  Explore further: _More_, _Wish You Were Here_, _Obscured by Clouds_, _Saucer Full of Secrets_, the live CD of _UmmaGumma_.  Not unpleasant but not necessary either: _Atom Heart Mother_, _Animals_.  Basically tedious, with too few good moments: _The Wall_.  Beer coasters: the studio CD of _Umma Gumma_ (though there are two good Waters tracks amongst the rubbish), _The Final Cut_, and everything by The Other Three after Waters left.  Don't buy Waters without Pink Floyd, either.  But that leaves plenty of music that _is_ worth hearing.
B00005QXXO|3.0|Rarely does an album disappoint me as immediately as 'I Might Be Wrong' did. Radiohead are one of the few bands on the planet that actually MATTER. They are unique for numerous reasons, and talented beyond my comprehension. I just cannot imagine why they would want to release this album. Radiohead seem to try too hard to defy people's expectations. Amnesiac was culled from the same sessions as KID A, showing the world that not only were they not interested in pushing their musical boundries with every release, but that they quite possibly INTENDED to misguide our expectations. Whatever irony is left over from their recent experiments in social behavior has been completely used up with this unnecessary live record. I feel as though Thom and company have released this record to simply prove a point: They are Radiohead and can do as they please...even release a live album that adds next to nothing to their catalog. My problems with the album are as follows: The performances themselves are below average. (I have seen Radiohead live, and they are amazing.) The song selection is a slap in the face. Eight tracks, only one being officially previously unreleased. The record is short...Barely making past the EP mark. Etc Etc<BR>Basically, the listener is left detatched, and emotionless. At least, I was. I can't help but to feel that this record is intentionally bad, which makes me bitter. If Radiohead were so interested in shaving off the majority of their fan base, then they should stop touring, stop performing &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, and release records every 5 years. They obviously like the attention they get and the money that comes with having #1 albums. So what is the point of this record, really? I'm starting to feel as though there is no point, and that frightens me.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|Friends recommended this movie to me.  Smart friends.  Memento is a classic who-done-it murder mystery (...) We are deliberately fed conflicting misinformation at the end of the film (or should I say the beginning?).  It is as if the director (...) structured the plot-line in reverse chronological order, with the hope that his audience would be sufficiently confused that they would either assume there had been logical explanations for everything or, better yet, they would had invent their own explanations.  My friends have come up with differing explanations (...), however these explanations are not necessarily grounded in the \\"facts\\" presented in the film.  (...) <br />The real kicker is that many people are watching the movie over and over, hoping to figure it out.  Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man will sooner figure out \\"Who's on first.\\"  And that's because Memento, like Abbott and Costello's famous routine, is not a riddle - it merely thinks that it is.
057120211X|4.0|Disturbing, but sensitive and thoughtful.  Is it really just a judgement call between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;insane?&quot;

B000008H1Y|5.0|By far one of the best albums.  It highlights Ian Anderson's ability to draw on the music of old and merge it with today's (70's?) music that makes us think.
B0000524CY|5.0|In 1973 William Friedkin created a screen adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel The Exorcist.  It is a character driven drama that deals with the demonic possession of a young girl named Reagan MacNeil (Linda Blair) and her faith-finding mother's (Ellen Burnstyn) desperation as she sees her daughter consumed by this evil supernatural force.  The film earned ten Oscar nominations.<br /><br />The way in which The Exorcist presents its characters and allows each of them to develop in this horrifying predicament is what sets the stage for the horror to seem so genuine.  Especially considering that in this setting, regardless of your faith as an audience member, everything that happens and everything priests Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) and Father Lankester Merrin (Max Von Sydow) believe in is absolutely real.  It is their piety and endurance in the face of such evil that are precisely the tools needed for Reagan to be saved.  It is their duty and they are the film's heroes.<br /><br />On the flip side, the demon, Puzzuzu, who has consumed Reagan, is just as devote to evil.  Merrin makes it clear to Karras that the demon is a masterful liar and that they must not listen to him no matter what.  Later on we see first hand the psychological onslaught of lies that they must endure.  It is almost as powerful and horrifying as the earlier stages of the film where we see the gradual manifestation of evil in young Reagan.<br /><br />The shift from normal little girl to full blown demon in the Exorcist contains, at least within the context of this compelling drama, the scariest images ever portrayed on film.  I saw the Exorcist for the first time when I was pretty young (in fact, too young).  I didn't even get to see the truly scary parts until years later, but even the early stages gave me nightmares.  The scene where we hear little Reagan screaming from the other room and the doctors rush in with her mother and they see her flopping uncontrollably from the waste up. Then she suddenly leaps up and begins to talk as the demon for the first time. \\"The sow is mine!\\" she shouts.  I was told that the film would only get worse from there, but I didn't watch much beyond that until a few years later.  So it stewed in my mind and I imagined horrible things and suffered quite a bit of nightmares.  When I was 13 or so I saw it again, little did I know that even those years of imagining what could be worse then \\"the sow in mine!\\" sequence did not prepare me for the crucifix scene.<br /><br />I watch the Exorcist every Halloween as it is the only classic that continues to scare me to this day.  Part of that is nostalgia but it is an incredibly compelling movie as well.  I can't stand hearing the people who say it is funny and that they laugh when they watch it.  It isn't that I couldn't find humor in they way they watch it; it is just that they've missed the point.  Watching a horror movie should be like riding a roller-coaster.  You should enjoy the excitement and hold your arms up in a roller-coaster to maximize the experience.  The mind-set to enjoy a film like the Exorcist should be similar.  You shouldn't see it as a test of what you can and cannot look at.  If you approached a roller-coaster that way you might get a stiff neck.  With a horror film you are supposed to be afraid.  That is what makes the experience an unforgettable one.  There are so few horror films that can do that but the Exorcist delivers every single time.  That is what makes it so exceptional.leaps up and begins to talk as the demon for the first time. \\"The sow is mine!\\" she shouts.

B00005QK3W|3.0|Pause a moment, folks.<BR>We've just been allowed a look and a listen to a man's life and soul in the process of self-repair.  That alone should balance out some of the criticism too liberally sprinkled in some of the preceeding 114 reviews.  I won't knock the reverent gushings of true fans, either.  Loyalty is not to be dismissed so lightly.  Sir Paul hasn't released this not-great/not-bad album because he needs the money, but because he wants to share a life under reconstruction.  The man has produced great music before and will do so again.  Buy it or not, but recognize the work for what it is:  a very personal statement.  (By the way:  Thanks, Cavern Club, Liverpool for the pre-release listening party.  What better place to hear McCartney music?!)
B00005Q66T|5.0|This collection is a good reminder of what kind of artist Madonna is. Look at the song selection. Erotica, Bedtime Story, Human Nature, songs like these would be considered risks, and Madonna does take risks which is why she released them. Sure they didn't chart but it shows the makings of a true artist. She doesn't care what goes to #1, she just releases quality songs. GHV2 is a collection of some of her best songs from the 90s, ranging from all her albums from Erotica to Music, and everything in between. Not many artists could do the things Madonna does, and if they could they probably wouldn't, she's in a class of her own. Songs like Rain, This Used To Be My Playground, You'll See, were probably not included because they ended up on her 1995 ballad compilation SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. Yes there are songs missing, but lets celebrate the great songs that are on this cd, this is just another reminder of what a true gifted artist Madonna is, and I predict it wont be long until we see the next chapter of her hits, in another cd.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is simply the greatest. Interesting characters, compelling plot, amazing visuals, and a masterful soundtrack all make this the best. Looking for something to buy your Anime-lover in your family? Get this DVD. I guarantee you will love it.
0767817443|5.0|Yeah, it's silly. It's derivative. It's not the greatest (or even close). Still, I think a lot of people are missing an essential point in this film...IT'S A PARODY!!! It's a big joke, with running gags, lots of humor, fun characters, especially Broderick. Matthew Broderick is at his best when he looks like the idiot hero; he's self-effacing and lovable and that should be enough. They constantly mispronounce his name, followed by &quot;er...whatever&quot; and he's regularly referred to as &quot;the worm guy&quot;. It happens a lot. I'm a fan of running gags. That so many people took this film WAY too seriously may explain its failure. The extras on the DVD are good, especially listening to the uber- master Emmerich trying to sound like the expert (which he's NOT!). A bit disturbing to me, was to see NYC destroyed, yet there were some great aerial shots of the WTC. When one watches a goofy film like this, it's good to keep in mind that it's all fantasy. The aerial shots were glorious, and can live on, at least superficially, as a testament to the NYC skyline, as some of us knew it. The ones who don't like this film are the ones who can't find humor in the silliness of grand fantasy.

B00005NW02|2.0|This album is a big disappointment.  Their self titled album caught me by surprise- i liked &quot;Sugar&quot; and was really shocked to hear that the rest of the album was just as good and better in some places.  They had catchy guitar work,crunchy rythms and those intense vocals.  Now the lyrics are just annoying with simple phrases screamed over and over. There's no melody in these songs, and the guitar is nowhere near where it was on the last album.  The last album was so much more creative. Toxicity sounds like what you'd get if you asked some teenage SOAD tribute band to make some new songs.  What happened?
B000058T5E|5.0|This is most certainly one of Jeff Beck's best albums yet. But before I move on, let's clarify that. I believe his best albums to be: Blow by Blow, Wired, Guitar Shop, and You Had It Coming. <br />You Had It Coming is one of the best guitar albums ever released. This is obvious from the start, because Jeff Beck is THE best guitarist ever. Listen to the solo during the fade out of Left Hook. It's so fast and smooth you'll have to send your pants to the cleaners TWICE. <br />Nadia, as mentioned in previous reviews, is the standout of this album. Jeff Beck is obviously the only person who could pull this off, and he did in fine, fine fashion. He gets a massive, rich tone and his famous phrasing and tricks are shown throughout the album. <br />Now, you may be turned away from the electronic drums and all. Don't be. Even if you don't like the song, it is impossible on this album to NOT be overwhelmed by the talent. Loose Cannon lives up to it's name. Suspension is a calm, mysterious piece that will leave you begging for more. Nadia, as mentioned, is one of the best songs Jeff has ever done. Rollin' and Tumblin' is a wonderful cut showing Jeff can play the blues better than ever. Dirty Mind is wah-bliss. Beck doesn't pump his wah Hendrix style. He's too good. You have to listen to it to realize the control that he uses on his wah.<br />Every cut on this album is plastered with sheer emotion. Every note Jeff plays in Nadia is full of intense emotion and soul. Listen to this album a few times. If it doesn't stick the first time, listen again. This album has soul and emotion all over it. 5 stars indeed!
0451524985|4.0|Lady Chatterley's Lover is not my Lawrece's favourite - see &quot;Women in Love&quot; for that honor-, but I think it is a very great novel, and it is praised as his best. Although the title mention The Lover, in my opinion the book is about Lady Catterley herself.<br />It is very interesting to imagine the effect the story might have caused on people by the time its was first published. It's known that the author had many problems in order to get it released and had to use his own money to get it printed.Even nowadays, Lady Chatterley may shock some puritans, but its effect would never be as strong as in 1928. The large use of slang names for private parts sounds a bit funny, but still disturbing.<br />After finish reading the book, the mainly feeling I had was: selfshiness. All characters most of the time just worry about themselves. On the other hand, I would read very naive if I believed that human beings are not natural born selfish, consequently, people in this book are very close to people we met on the streets when it comes to feelings and emotions. Clifford, the husband, is disgusting. He is a British aristocrat and as so he looks down on everybody all the time.Nobody is good enough to be an equal. Mellors, the lover, appeared to be very polite and open minded in the beginning, but I change my mind in the middle of the novel, after Lady Chatterley spends a Sunday night with him. He sounds very sexist and racist in his speech. However, I think that was the common sense by that time, today readers may feel a bit unconfortable with his opinions- as I did-, but he can still be taken to. But the real 'star' of the novel is Connie, yes, I am talking about Lady Chatterley herself. At first, Clifford takes it out on her all the time- and I felt sorry for her.  Later, she finds a new love and starts living her own life - this is the best part of the book. We can't run her down having the love affair because she had such a boring and senseless life before Mellors. By the end - I won't give it - she is not the same person.<br />Some nice twists are saved for the last chapters, what makes the reading much more interesting. I highly recomend this book for whose who are not afraid of reading - and discovering - about sex.y the end - I won't give it - she is not the same person.<br />Some nice twists are saved for the last chapters, what makes the reading much more interesting.

B00000I924|4.0|Who Else is a great album. It isn't as good as You Had It Coming, but it's a great CD for a Jeff Beck comeback. It has blistering guitar parts and some funky rhythms. Brush With the Blues is obviously the standout of this album. Jeff gets a great tone and his solo in this song is one of the best solos I've heard him do. It's totally amazing. After hearing this I wanted to pack my guitar up, send it away, and get a nice little job somewhere. No one, not even Jimi Hendrix, can get close to Jeff Beck and his skills of guitar. This album is a good buy.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Amidst the seemingly never-ending stream of bubblegum pop, when a new group is compared to the Velvet Underground or Iggy &amp; The Stooges, one has to pray that rock has found its salvation. This may be it...There was no way The Strokes could live up to the hype they've received, but that doesn't change the fact that this is an amazing album. The songs are universally short and they rock hard throughout, and while there are a few standout tracks, (Barely Legal, Someday, Last Nite, and Hard to Explain are great!) there is nothing that could be labeled filler on the album. Admittedly, the lyrics suffer from a certain lack of creativity, but this wasn't supposed to be Dylan anyway, and The Strokes seem to be having such a great time on the cd that it's difficult to not enjoy every minute of it. This is raw, energetic  rock that harkens back to a better era for the genre, and the exciting thing for us rock fans is that The Strokes should have even better things in store for us in the future. I popped this disc in my cd player when it first came out, and it shall remain for some time; I haven't enjoyed a cd this much since OK Computer or Nirvana's Unplugged in New York.
B00005QFHG|5.0|Yummy-boy did I enjoy this flick. If I had but one complaint it would be that it was not spoken in its native tongue. I found it rather odd that it was situated in a small French villa and everyone spoke perfect English. Aside from that it was splendid! Juliette Binoche was wonderful with her majestical chocolate. Now, being a hugh chocolate lover myself I could have easily been cast under the fantastick spell of the treats she cooked up. More important is the message that this heart warming film revealed-that love should have no boundaries or labels and that each should be accepted as is. The towns people came to realize what Judy Dench knew all along-and that is to enjoy life to the fullest. Johhny Depp is yummy as well and very hard to resist. I am thrilled that he came back to fix the squeak in the door (wink wink).
B00003CXSM|4.0|I have to say that I was a bit skeptical at first and it was a little difficult convincing my boyfriend that we should watch this movie.  I am not a big fan of either Jennifer Lopez or Matthew McConaughey, so it had to be pretty good to win me over.<br />     What I really found was a really cute movie about a little girl who was all grown up and since she hasn't been lucky in love, she worked to plan the most elaborate wedding celebrations for everyone else.<br />     She thinks she meets Mr. Right and finds out that he is already engaged and she is planning his wedding!!  As this movie is somewhat predictable it is the perfect romantic comedy that has you rooting for love to conquer all.  If this is the type of movie you usually like.....definately get it.<br />     And by the way, even though some people classify it as a &quot;chic-flic&quot;, I think my boyfriend enjoyed it also!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Three months after seeing this movie for the third time its still in my head and still playing games with it.  Incredibly complicated yet devastatingly simple, i still didnt see any of it coming, i still dont really understand how it was all woven together, but boy am i impressed.<br />Its hard to think of a more intelligent movie, and one that requires quite so much concentration, this isnt a popcorn and sunday afternoon movie, this one needs you awake and alert and concentrating on every sly move the narrative pulls or you could quite easily miss the beauty of this movie.<br />Shot in an unusual style in that the movie &quot;develops&quot; much like the photographs the main character takes to help with his memory, slowly and partially.  You see it tells everything backwards, from end to beginning then end again, except the end isnt quite the end, confused? sorry, but its hard to explain.  <br />Essentially we see one scene, say five minutes worth of plot, then the next five mins shows events leading up to the part we just saw.  For instance if for instance we just saw a five minute scene starting with the character walking into a house, when thats done we see another five minute scene climaxing in him pulling up to the house.  I've explained it remarkably bad but it really is ingenious, and a crucial subplot intersects these scenes giving a nice background and an unusual twist to the overall story, as well as providing a slight relief from all the head-swirling of the main story.<br />The story itself concerns Lenny, an ex insurance investigator whose wife was murdered, fairly straight forward except lenny suffers from a memory disorder which means he has no short term memory, thus he uses polaroids and tattoos and hand written notes to help him along his way to finding the killer, but at the same time is never sure of who people are and if he can trust them.<br />The cast headed by Guy Pearce is generally very very good and Guy himself shows why he won rave reviews after L.A Confidential with another excellent performance.  The direction is pretty slick and extremely sly and all credit must go to the makers not just for thinking up such an intelligent story but for comitting it to film and making it work.<br />If any downfalls of the film exist its in that it may be a little too clever for its own good, a lot of people wont have the patience to concentrate for the whole movie and may find it boring or hard work, not generally what people want from entertainment and thats a fair expectation, I know I have to be in a certain frame of mind to watch this myself and know many people to have switched off halfway in.<br />That aside if your prepared to work with the film to its conclusion and to keep your eyes open and your mind on the plot then its an extremely rewarding experience, one that will have you gasping, full of admiration for all the players involved and with a head full of questions to which there is no answer other than possibly watching again.  The sort of film you watch and immediatly want to talk about to anyone else who has seen it, and restores faith that sometimes you can get an intricate story from somewhere other than a book.<br />Sorry for the clumsy review, this is one movie that just seems to have that effect on me :)
0446310786|5.0|As it had been about 27 years since I had read this classic, I had forgotten much of the detail of the book.  I loved every single page of it this time around and I am sure that I understood it a great deal more than when I was a teenager.  This is a remarkably well-written book with humour, pathos and charm, besides its more obvious look at various types of prejudice.  The fact that the story is told through the eyes of a young girl gives it a wonderfully innocent appeal but constantly challenges the reader to look at its larger social issues.  Despite the fact that it is set in the 1930s, this classic has not aged at all.  If you have not read this book at all, get to it; if it has been many years since you have read it, have another look at it - you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXMG|5.0|If you liked Cameron Crowe's other well known effort Jerry Maguire then this movie will probably leave you with the same satisfied &quot;nice&quot; feeling and the same silly grin on your face.<BR>A semi autobiographical work it creeps along with humor, sentimentalism and a strong cast, ultimatly leaving you with an affectionate look back on rock culture and what it means to the musicians and the fans alike.<br />Patrick Fugit does a very good job as the young man in question and Billy Crudrup and the always great Jason Lee (Chasing Amy, Mallrats) are equally good in support.<br />Kate Hudson is the revelation, as Penny Lane she exerts the same beauty, and strange mixture of innoncence yet world weariness as a 70's Holly Golightly and by the end of the movie you feel as though you could fall in love with her in an instant, which if anything adds credibility to the fact that most men in the movie seem to do this.<br />The soundtrack is fantastic, and while I do have a soft spot for the kind of music from the late 60's and of the early 70's I was never really a fan of some of the artists used... but it was perfectly complimentary, and the scene on the tour bus with Elton John's &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; never fails to make me smile and feel good, although i've never liked his music in the slightest. So credit must go to the director for this scene.<br />It might be too sugary for some tastes, but I found it just about sweet enough, i cringed in all the right places, i laughed a lot, i envied the main character and so generally fell into every emotional trap the director set for us, not once, but on repeat viewings also.<br />In short an excellent feel good movie, not quite Jerry Maguire, but close enough, and more importantly, different.<br />I should also note the special features, which were very good and added value to the dvd, especially so the Rolling Stones articles of a young Cameron Crowe, which consisted of in-depth interviews with (amongst others) Led Zeppelin, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, fascinating reading, especially as I've already said, i have a soft spot for some artists from this time, these being some of them.

0312979479|4.0|And Then There Were None, by Agatha Christie is a mind bending, and thought provoking murder mystery. Eight guests are invited by seperate but mysterious invitations to spend their holiday together on Indian Island. While each guest is different in many ways all have one thing in common, which you will find out as you read. An old nursery rhyme of Ten Little Indian Boys leads a  scandalous curiosity throughout the book. I've never read a book like this, it's almost like playing the board game Clue. You must play close to every chapter and detail if your ultimate goal is to solve the mystery before you're done with the book. Agatha Christie did an excellent job creating different characters all playing key roles to the mystery of Indian Island. This book his different because it is written with thoughts coming straight from the characters rather then just telling the events. The reactions of the characters help develope a good flow and clear up any confusion you might have while reading. &quot;It is lovely here. The hills and the red earth and everything so green and luscious looking.&quot;-pg18 said by Vera Claythorne You wouldn't have guessed that this novel was going to be any kind of mystery. Agatha Christie leaves no description out, at the beggining of the novel. Although the title may sway your oppinions, her description of a what seems to be vacation island is the last thing Indian Island is. Many of the guest who would be staying on Indian Island first viewed it as a welcoming  of oppurtunities, that was also assured in their invitations to the island. What the guest do not know is their beautiful beach resort island is going to be the setting of a huge murder scene. The vocabulary that arises in this novel is not too difficult but does take some time to analyze as you read. This book is for anybody who wants a good suspensful mystery. And Then There Were None has many main characters and is often hard to follow. If you have trouble with this, I do not reccomend this book for your choice.mend this book for your choice.
B000001FKY|5.0|The year was 1987.The &quot;Hysteria&quot; album was released.Later on I bought this album.Whe i first heard it,i thought it was a piece of rubbish cos if the album doesnt start of that well i consider it that.U have albums which have good start off like Megadeth's &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;(trust).Well as the album  progressed i found it really good.It's kinda alternative rock.&quot;Women&quot; and &quot;Rocket&quot; were ok.The&quot;Rocket&quot; video was good though.But then the magic started.7 hit singles they said.2 of them had failed.The next song &quot;Animal&quot; is a real good song with the one handed legend simply excellent at the drums.&quot;Pour some sugar on me&quot; and &quot;Armaggedonit&quot; were a little faster and were the first of the good sngles on the labum.&quot;Love Bites&quot; is a kinda ballad.It has a slow guitar in the beginning but then Joe's vox get louder.&quot;Gods of War&quot; according to me is the second best song on the album.The first obviously being &quot;Hysteria&quot; the title song.It's a little slow but it has progressive drums to it.&quot;Run riot&quot; is a little faster than the others on the album.This album is a classic!!!Steve lives on!!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Honestly, this is my favorite CD. It is a mix of all of the classic love songs. You can't listen to this CD and not pick up a song that you do not recognize. With its vibrant beats and familiar choruses, this soundtrack is addictive. I know my CD is so beat up from its constant use. Although it is missing a few favorites from the movie, such as Like A Virgin, The Sound of Music, and Spectacular Spectacular, it still is an amazing soundtrack that adds a new twist to old songs and keeps you coming back for more.
B000002MQ9|4.0|I first heard of DCD about 12 months ago when a friend sent me some samples of their songs. One of the songs that particularly captured my attention was YULUNGA and I knew that I had to hear more from this unique groupe!<BR>I then got my hands on Within The Realm Of A Dying Sun. I perticularly enjoyed the songs by Lisa my faves on this album are Summoning Of The Muse,Anywhere Out Of The World,Xavier and Cantara. I look farward to hearing more DCD albums and have looked at the reviews and it looks as if AION might be next!
B000009QPO|5.0|The Jayhawks, along with Uncle Tupelo and the spinoffs of Wilco and Sonvolt define the alt.country music genre.  Catchy country flavored rock that is reminiscent of the Eagles in the early 70's but with far more complex arrangements and harmonies.  Hollywood Town Hall is a defining moment in the alt.country movement.<br />The harmonies of Olson and Louris are magical. The deceiving intensity of &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; and &quot;Sister Cry&quot; and the melodic &quot;Clouds&quot; are arrangements that exceed anything the Eagles did in their early days.  <br />This album stands up to multiple listenings, but is even better after seeing the band in concert.  <br />Above all else the Jayhawks are made up of outstanding musicians that introduce themselves to you at the Hollywood Town Hall.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I'll keep it short. Crowe did the best job of acting since George C. Scott did Patton. It took me weeks to summon up the emotional strength to go through what Maximus went through a second time. The best acting job of the last 20 years.
1573225517|5.0|As a guy, It is difficult to admit that we are interested in reading an occasional story about male-female relationships.  Of course, it is also equally difficult to find a story that effectively connects with male readers about such a topic.<br />Rob would make a lot of guys top five list of guys we most identify with.  He is immersed in his record albums, spends countless hours in frivolous conversations with his friends and is constantly belaboring his complete inability to start and sustain a relationship. <br />In Rob we find a soulmate, because he has a philosophy about making a good cassette mix, constantly organizes his music and makes lists of his favorite things.<br />Even more so, he connects to our own equally stupid habits about relationships. Fortunately for Rob he finds an answer about how relationships should work.  Too bad so many of my buddies haven't gotten the same clue.
B00005QK3W|2.0|How dare producer David Kahne call this album 'more like the White Album' than any of Paul's other stuff? It couldn't be further from the truth. It's rubbishy lyrics that could have been better penned by a 13-year old, recycled hooks and poor vocal delivery really really turned me off listening to the album ever again.<br />Sure, this may be a result of high expectations, and on listening to the album again and ignoring the garbage-for-lyrics 'let's go drive in the driving rain'??, I enjoyed it more. But why not have high expectations? Paul is a billionaire singer-songwriter spanning 4 decades and you would think with this sort of experience he would have learnt how to differentiate between a good song (anything on Flaming Pie was better than this!) and a terrible one (and on Driving Rain was this!) - for goodness sake, Paul, Wings are dead!!!! No more 70s/80s production please, and let George handle the Eastern rhythms.<br />If I'm going to spend an odd A$25 on supporting and encouraging an artist to do further work, I should have high expectations. The reason the Beatles were able to write lyrics in an afternoon (in most cases) were because John Lennon was such a word-smith he knew just how to tell Paul his lyrics were (...) not good. If only someone else had the guts to tell Paul these days....
6305736650|5.0|There are so many lines that have been copied, parodied, emulated and misspoken from this film that Casblanca is a 100 minute film history in and of itself. <br />While the performances of Bergman and Bogart are outstanding. Multiple viewings reveal the entertaining characters that make up Rick's Cafe Americain. Claude Rains and the brief appearance of Peter Lorre are noteworthy, but so to are the bit parts played by Sydney Greenstreet, Madeline Lebeau and Leonid Kinskey.<br />The DVD is wonderful in its clarity and is an absolute necessity for any movie buff.
014028009X|4.0|After moping around the house sick during the long-awaited 4-day weekend, I decided to get myself some reading to lift my depressed spirits. This book is just what the doctor ordered. \\"Bridget\\" is a very quick read; you can polish it off in a day easily and you'll be laughing out loud the entire time. I kept expecting the neighbors to drop by and say \\"What are you doing in there?!\\"<br />Sadly, this book rings true for too many females, regardless of age or nationality. Discontentment with work, men, body image, and family are obviously universal. Misery loves company and \\"Bridget\\" proves it. Nothing lifts the spirits like realizing that you're no more (or less) neurotic than most everyone else. \\"The therapeutic value of a [reality check] is without parallel.\\" Buy this book!
B00003CX5P|5.0|The Phantom Menace disappointed many of the Star Wars fanatics. But what film could have recaptured the enthusiasm we felt toward the original trilogy?  The technical achievement alone in further realizing Lucas' vision is worth the price of this DVD.  Unlike the fantasy stories of Tolkien and Rowling, Star Wars has always been told through film.  As a result, we constantly thirst for the complete vision of the Universe created by George Lucas. The Phantom Menace delivers.<br />The Star Wars enthusiast can poke holes in Lucas' choices in both plot and character.  That is a luxury that the Star Wars trilogy gives us.  After all, half the fun is critiquing this beloved fantasy world.<br />The DVD is outstanding and encourages multiple viewings.  The deleted scenes included are not all that interesting, but the documentary on the creation of Episode One is worth watching. <br />Any Star Wars fan should be ashamed if they do not own this DVD, even if they don't like Jar Jar Binks.
B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney is great in this crazy caper of a movie, as is the entire cast.  If you like high-spirited music, witty dialogues, and a little bit of surrealism I think that you will like this movie.  The soundtrack is really good, it sets the mood well and if you like the sound of old folkish music it is just plain good.<br />As for the extras that come with the DVD the only one to speak of is a music video of the main song performed by the characters in the movie, not to much to speak of in the way of extras.

B00005O3VC|4.0|I don't know if they spent all this time remastering this movie or if I always saw it on overused videotapes.  The pictures are clear and the colors are brillant.  The sound is crisp.  Nothing like I remember the movie.<br />The extras are almost worth the price of admission alone.  There is a lot of new and old material.  The best being the sing alongs, the lego scenes, and the Japanese version.  There is also the standard commentary and interviews stuff if that interests you.
B000002H5I|5.0|This is by far one of my all-time favorite albums, and one of the only albums I insist everyone ought to own. <br />Tracy's debut posesses a lyrical, vocal and musical clarity and simplicity not found on her later work. Each track tells an achingly personal and timelessly political story in an accessible, meaningful and grounded way. <br />If you don't already own this, buy it. I insist.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This cd really shows off britney's true talent. it shows how she has matured over the past years. i would suggest this cd to anyone. most people still think of her as the little teenybopper but on this cd, she really has turned very rockish.
B00005AXEL|5.0|An almost flawless work from a timeless singer-songwriter. A stunning collection of memorable tracks, seamlessly and evocatively produced. Stevie holds onto just enough of her divine witchiness, while taking on a new, and very real persona -- that of the wise and rugged traveler.<br />&quot;You know me, I'm a nomad. I can't feel bad about the way I am.&quot;<br />This album is great road music, as well as great room music. Stevie is a survivor, and this collection's incomparable awesomeness is well earned.
6304773382|1.0|Really bad movie thats all I have to say. It did not make any sense. If you think that this is a classic you have to have a poor intelligence.
0385505833|4.0|When Blair Krank leaves home for a year in Peru, her parents realise that Christmas just won't be the same this year.  Luther Krank, a tax accountant, calculates that last year Christmas cost them $6,100 and decides that this year the Kranks should skip the Christmas festivities altogether and take a Caribbean cruise instead.<br />With the cruise booked and word out that they won't be celebrating this year, the Krank's begin to prepare for their departure on 25 December but what they aren't prepared for is the reaction of their friends and neighbours who are determined that they won't skip Christmas that easily.  But, when 'disaster' strikes the neighbours all pull together and show that they really are full of the Christmas spirit.<br />This short novel is a quick and funny read which made me want to put on the Christmas songs and decorate the tree.  I would recommend it to anyone whether you love Christmas or can think of nothing better than skipping Christmas yourself.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus just happens to be one of the most rewarding experiences in rock, along with all of the other Tool albums.  DO NOT DISMISS THIS BAND BECAUSE OF THEIR METAL IMAGE.  Many people have fallen into that pit, but I guarantee that if anyone with an open mind sits down and listens to this cd, they will eventually fall in love with it. That is the magic that Tool is capable of.
6305903182|1.0|Scream one, was cool. Scream two, was acceptable. Scream three? Next to this, Legend of Bagger Vance looks good. And you should read the review I gave it! Lol. Well, you gotta give them credit for trying to continue this movie. But they shoud have stopped with two.
0385505833|1.0|I listened to the unabridged version of this book as an audible.com download...what a disappointment.  I don't expect Great Literature from Mr. Grisham, but this was one of the worst books I've ever read.  It reads like it is intended as a screenplay, starring Chevy Chase or Leslie Nielsen.  Many reviewers have spoken of how mean spirited the book is - I wondered if Mr. Grisham was intentionally lampooning people he knows in real life.  This is a sad, sorry little book.
6303140157|5.0|This is an absolutely great movie!  I don't know which is better, the music or the movie, but the music alone would make just about any movie worth it.  Even if you hated Sister Act 1 (which I loved), you should at least rent this one for the music parts.  I actually saw this one first - it got me hooked and I went back and watched the first one.  I'm going to get the soundtrack as soon as I get some money.  :)  (I'm a college student  = I'm broke)
B000002UA7|5.0|I am not an unqualified Kate Bush fan (having sampled various of her albums over the years, I have never been compelled enough to actually purchase them), but I do recognize that she is a unique singing and song writing talent who has created an unclassifiable body of work - something like a pop/no-wave hybrid often swollen beautifully with lush production values and instrumentation, and always shining with that sweet but powerful voice.<br />Having admitted that I am by no means a devoted fan, I must now state that this CD is a great collection for somebody like me. All twelve tracks (most from various albums dating prior to and/or up to  1986; one - &quot;Experiment IV&quot; - released here for the first time) are stunning examples of the talent Ms. Bush possesses for musical narrative. I use the word narrative advisedly, for many of the songs included here are what I believe might be called &quot;story songs&quot;. Perhaps the greatest example of this is &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Kate's swirling and passionate take on Emily Bronte's gothic love story. &quot;Experiment IV&quot;, another good example, is a sinister tale about corrupt government devising weapons of sound. The track selection here is cohesive despite the differences between songs - &quot;The Man With the Child in his Eyes&quot;, for instance, is a ballad of sorts, while &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is a wild and percussive trip into a world of Australian Aboriginal myth.<br />True, as noted here by real fans, this collection will probably not be worthwhile if you are seriously into Kate Bush. But if you are simply looking for an introduction to her work or a simple &quot;best of&quot;, this is a wonderful selection of music that will move your heart, feet, and mind.
B00004NHCC|5.0|This is perhaps, one of Sarah Vaughan's best recordings--a must for all jazz enthusiasts.  Although the next lines are a bit off track, whenever I look at the front picture cover, I can see a snippet of melancoly and a look of determination in her facial expression. No! This is not the youthful and exurburiant Sarah Vaughan we saw in her days with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie or even when she under contract with Coloumbia Records. This is a mature person who has lived and seen all too early in life. <br />Sarah is matched with some of the best musicians of 1950's.   Clifford Brown's trumpet playing is outstanding; Jimmy Jones(piano), Joe Benjamin(bass) and Paul Quinichette (tenor saxophone) are also excellent. Although I was somewhat mystified with the inclusion of Herbie Mann--his flute and improvisation techinques were no match for the rest of the group--I have grown accostumed to his basic skills. Mann is a pleasant edition to the group. Whenever Mann seemed a little shaky in his playing, Clifford Brown would come in a little early with his trumpet solo, which would in turn, reinforce Mann's previous solo.<br />All of the songs on this album are a &quot;tour de force.&quot; However, if you are a bit hurried, listen to &quot;Embraceable You&quot; and &quot;April in Paris.&quot; There are no vocal acrobatics here; these compositions are strong in their construction. Absent is the baroque ornamention so often exhibited in some of Sarah Vaughan's renditions; the restraint she applies enable us to hear her amazing voice. If this album does not bring you tears of joy, you are not of this world.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Beautiful interplay of themes on a Wagnerian scale.  The final track: Breaking of the Fellowship is hauntingly emotional.
B00005LDD9|5.0|THE 1984 RE-RELEASE VERSION OF METROPOLIS WITH THE GEORGIO MORODER SOUNDTRACK IS WHAT PEOPLE, NEW TO THE 1924 FILM, SHOULD SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME. NOT THIS VERSION (ALTHOUGH I LOVE BOTH). WE HAPPEN TO HAVE A VHS COPY OF THE RE-RELEASE VERSION AND ARE NOW LOOKING FOR THE CD VERSION.  THE SOUNDTRACK CARRIES YOU INTO THE MOVIE WITH A NEW APPRECIATION OF THE FINER FILM ARTS AQUIRED BACK IN 1924.  WITH PAT BENATAR, FREDDY MERCURY AND SAMMY HAGAR (JUST TO NAME A FEW) BELTING OUT THE SOUNDTRACK, ITS A MUST SEE AND HEAR.
B000002H33|5.0|First - I won't make fun of you because you don't own this. (or at least I'll try real hard)  because that would make me a music snob.  I love great music, and I like to share it with others.......  after the monumental drop Metallica has taken in the last ten years it's easy to forget how increadible they were (still are live).  Metallica changed my life, and I can never make up my mind which album is my favorite,  this one or Ride the Lightning, but if any album should be called the masterpiece of music it is Master of Puppets.  If you can listen to Orion without getting chills (after so many years,I still can't get over the bass solo towards the end) well then you are not man enough to watch Braveheart, therefore you are banished from my presence.<BR> Enjoy your life!   <BR>p.s. this album will make it better!!!
0446677450|4.0|I'm always a little annoyed when someone repackages good ideas which have been around for some time, and lo and behold, has a bestseller on his hands.  Of course, if it were that simple, I'd be on a beach somewhere in Hawaii next to Robert Kiyosaki.  Nevertheless, the book makes many less-than groundbreaking points including:<br />...if you can take a risk, you don't really need (a lot of) money to make money<BR>...if you spend a raise before you get it, or even shortly thereafter, you will always be living paycheck to paycheck<BR>...Charles Schwab knew something a lot of other people didn't (read his biography)<br />The most annoying thing about the book, for me, was the storytelling in the first two chapters.  The same theme is repeated about 6 times, when once would have been enough for someone who is reasonably intelligent and doesn't have lots of time to spare.  Eventually I started to skim.  I'm sure Kiyosaki's second book could have been condensed into these two chapters instead, but his publisher saw an opportunity for extra profit.<br />All of that having been said, everyone who's serious about making some money needs to start somewhere, and this is where I began.  The book reviews the basics, points you toward more tools for learning (not all good - read the reviews on &quot;Inc and Grow Rich&quot;), and for me, started me thinking about real estate investing.  But again, if you're serious, you'll need a lot more ammunition before you're ready to begin pulling the trigger.  Happy hunting.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|Grown up with with Bob's songs since the sixties I have never heard better dylanish poetry since &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;. <BR>His voice has suffered from too much singing and too much living, but it has ripened to the great blues voice in &quot;Love And Theft&quot;.<BR>Listening to the text of &quot;Mississipi&quot; I hear a philosopher sing an abstract of life just as compact as Lao Tse's &quot;Tao Te Tjing&quot;.<BR>Yes there are bitter words in his songs. Yet all bitter words of the blues are being compensated by a strange feeling of &quot;freedom and love for all those who have sailed with me&quot;: Great album, a Masterpiece!
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie has not only an attractive, and powerfulcast, but possesses an amazingly entertaining plot.  Based on the real attack at Pearl Harbor, this movie is both sad, and comical: dramatic, and wonderful.  For anyone who has enjoyed the actors in this movie in other movies, this is a must see film.
B000002AS3|4.0|In my opinion, if the Beatles and the Rolling Stones had a baby, Oasis would be the result. You can clearly hear Beatles-sounding tunes and lyrics in &quot;Live forever&quot; and &quot;Slide Away&quot;, both of which have been known to choke me up on occasions. Rolling Stones-esque music can be heard in the tracks &quot;Supersonic&quot;, &quot;Up in the Sky&quot;, &quot;Shakermaker&quot;, and my personal favorite of the whole bunch &quot;Cigarettes and Alchohol&quot;. Fun to listen to, fun to sing, and, on occasion, the songs are even fun to get stuck into your head. There have been days when I'm at school, and one of the songs pops into my head. I am simply not satisfied until I get home and listen to the whole CD, beginning to end. This is a great album. It's addictive, it's catchy, and, most importantly, there are three more discs to listen to! Hooray for Oasis!
0790729725|5.0|with those simple words, we are plunged into the dark underbelly of crime from the 50's to the 70's.  the true life story of Henry Hill moves us in ways that remind us of Scarface and The Godfather.  a fantastic cast, and a great story (a true one, keep in mind) make a stellar movie.  a must see.  words alone cannot convey the power of this movie.  see it!
B00000BKDS|5.0|While almost anybody says &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; is the ultimate Maiden album i think that this debut is number one and BEAST a number two. This album has everything a good metal/rock album good needed an explosive openener an explosive final and between that great melodic metalsongs and some dark ballads my favourites on this album are &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; the Epic Classic the instrumental &quot;Transylvania&quot; and the Ballad &quot;strange World&quot; although Di Anno hasn't such a big voice as Dickinson in this song he is the perfect match. this is certainly one of the most powerful metaldebut's off all time and everybody who claims himself a hardrock or metal fan should have this classic in his collection.
0385505833|5.0|I am a non-Christian and lived North America for five years.<br />I don't think Skipping Christmas is a funny story but agree that this is a classic.  John Grisham has skillfully depicted the world in a manner that an outsider will observe Chrismas in North America.  You can see the picture better when you keep the decent distance from it.  This season in North America, Chirstmas spirit is so immense everywhere that I do not surprise even some insiders plan to skip it.  We are living in an era of global economy where too many 'different' people are breathing and living close by.  Skipping Chrismas is a classic becasue it was written in 2001 and published after Sept 11. This book is probably showing us a clue to think about what is like those terrorists' feeling - why they hate America.<br />I am a Buddist and I enjoyed Chrismas North America very much - as a visitor.
B00005MKA3|5.0|From his last three albums this one is definetly his best while Exodus and kaya where made to receive a new audience Survival is actually a trown back to the begin of his island career in 1972 with Catch a fire or even earlier the lee perry days<BR>the songs are outstanding &quot;So much trouble in the world&quot; was the best choice for an album opener &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; a good follow up and the rest stand like a rock. actually the best thing of this album is not Marley's great voice but the fantastic drums of charlton barret. the sleeve also looks good it immidiatly says that this is a roots album and when you listen you certainly will agree
0553573403|5.0|I had never read any fantasy before until a friend of mine got me hooked on this series.  All I can say is that since 1996 I have been waiting patiently for each book to come out.  It is great to see how everything comes together in the later two books. Goerge R. R. Martin is an innovater in Fastasy novels.  I have read others since then and none of the others compare.
B00005QZWI|5.0|The music on this CD compliments Tolkien's story perfectly.  The story is one of impending darkness with a ray of hope that good shall prevail.  This CD captures those feelings and moods perfectly.  Yes, it does sound heavy at times (notable exceptions are &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; and &quot;At the Sign of the Prancing Pony&quot;) but this is a story of these peoples' world on the verge of destruction.  Fusion jazz or some lighter music just would not have been appropriate.  The use of choir music in this CD is wonderful.  It adds yet another dimension to the music.  If you appreciate Tolkien's work then I think you will appreciate this CD.
B00005QK3W|3.0|I am a long time fan of McCartney's work, having all of his post-Beatles cds. &quot;Driving Rain&quot; is one of my least favorite cds from Paul. It seems that everything about this disc was done poorly, right down to the haggard looking picture of McCartney on the cover. The music strikes me as downbeat rather than loosely structured. Not only are the songs downbeat but McCartney appears to have nothing to say this time out. While Johnny Cash or Tom Waits or even Leonard Cohen make the same type of downbeat music they seem to have more to say than McCartney. &quot;Lonely Road&quot; sounds like a different take on &quot;Stranglehold&quot; from &quot;Press To Play&quot; and &quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot; sounds like a slowed down version of &quot;Old Siam&quot; from &quot;Back To The Egg&quot;. I did think that some of the instrumentation reminded me of &quot;McCartney II&quot; and &quot;Wild Life&quot;, yet the words and music on &quot;Driving Rain&quot; lacks the charm and charisma or even melodic touches on those previous works. There are no tracks like 1993's &quot;Hope Of Deliverance&quot; or 1997's &quot;Young Boy&quot; on &quot;Driving Rain&quot;. There are but a few moments of inspiration that McCartney seems to make something work on this recording like the songs &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Your Way&quot;, &quot;Heather&quot; and &quot;Rinse The Raindrops&quot; but most of the cd feels tired or forced and glaring unmemorable compared to past efforts. If this cd is meant to be more experimental then it's not even close to &quot;McCartney II&quot;. If this music is supposed to be a return to McCartney's early days it doesn't touch &quot;McCartney&quot;. What's with McCartney's cd covers too? His image is doing nothing in gaining him a new audience. There are a couple of things McCartney needs to do: 1. Work with Rick Rubin, the producer. Rick has done wonders for Johnny Cash's waning career and kicked life into the old horse and made him edgy and viable again. 2. Get with Cash and the Bee Gees about improving McCartney's image. 3. Stick to the melodies Paul and be sure you have something to say before putting out product. I think John Lennon would have a critical circus with &quot;Driving Rain&quot; especially McCartney's weak attempt at peace with &quot;Freedom&quot;. All chorus and no verse! Doesn't compare to &quot;Give Peace A Chance&quot;. I know Paul can do better than this release just listen to his cd of covers on &quot;Run Devil Run&quot; produce not two years ago!!! That cd was quite good!. 2. Get with Cash and the Bee Gees about improving McCartney's image. 3. Stick to the melodies Paul and be sure you have something to say before putting out product.

B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams brings to life the harry Potter's music. I enjoyed<br />with soundtracks like &quot;Hook&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: Episode I&quot; and now I enjoyed with the music from the movie &quot;Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone&quot;.<br />On this CD there are nineteen tracks that reflects the different<br />aspects and escenes from the film.<br />If you had seen the movie and you loved the music, buy this and<br />with every track you'll remember the terrific and fantastic escenes from &quot;Harry Potter and The Sorcere's Stone&quot;.<br />I am waiting for the release of the movie on DVD and I hope that includes the isolated score. John Williams rules!.
6303148352|5.0|Steven Spielberg has always been my favorite movie director because of his innate ability to tap into people's fears, hopes, and aspirations.  And while he may not always be successful at it (1941 and HOOK being examples), he is successful far more often than not.  JURASSIC PARK, based on Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, is a prime example of Spielberg's abilities.<br />The story revolves around the dreams of an eccentric billionaire (Richard Attenborough) to construct an amusement park on an island 120 miles off of Costa Rica that features genetically engineered dinosaurs, created from cloning dinosaur DNA.  He invites two paleontologists (Sam Neill, Laura Dern) to the island to check it out for themselves, along with a hugely cynical &quot;chaos&quot; mathematician (Jeff Goldblum).  But while the park itself is overwhelming to its visitors, including Attenborough's two grandkids (Joseph Mazzello, Ariana Richards), there is a strong feeling that Attenborough and his fellow creators have left a few things out.<br />Then it hits.  An overly ambitious security expert (Wayne Knight) has involved himself in smuggling dinosaur embryos off the island for a competitor.  But the only way to pull it off is to shut down the entire park's security systems...which is exactly what happens, unfortunately.  With the fifty miles worth of electrified fences shut off, and a tropical storm lashing the island, the dinosaurs break free of their enclosures.  What results is some of the most terrifying and suspenseful sequences of 1990s cinema, from a director who clearly studied the techniques of the Master, Alfred Hitchcock.<br />Winner of three Oscars (Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Visual Effects) and a $1 billion box office winner to boot, JURASSIC PARK, scripted by Crichton and David Koepp, is a hugely entertaining and relevant science fiction/suspense thriller that, while giving audiences the requisite chills and thrills, also has a warning about the potential dangers of cloning, which now seem to be coming perilously true in reality.  Even well-meaning enterprises like this film's amusement park are susceptible to human failures or lapses of morality.<br />Neill, Dern, Goldblum, and Attenborough are pretty good in their roles; and, contrary to what others might think, I don't think the special effects overshadow them.  John Williams, yet again, provides Spielberg with another memorable music score.  Followed four years later by THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK (a very respectable sequel), and in 2001 by JURASSIC PARK 3.
B00005QIPH|2.0|It was difficult for me to believe just how hyped this band actually was; it was even harder for me to believe that people actually bought the hype. For the love of god folks, if you honestly think this is the end all of rock n roll then you really need to get out more. I just can't for the life of me understand why everyone thinks this record is so good, yeah so it's better than Limp Bizkit, but so are alot of things. It doesn't sound at ALL like the Stooges, there's no Television guitar work on here, yeah, so the singer sounds a little like Lou Reed, big deal. So someone ripped off VU, it's not the first time.<BR>All this is is a pop record, an okay pop record with a good single (last night or whatever it's called).  Calm down already.  <BR>Yeah, and they never payed their dues, not cool.
0786915749|3.0|The story begins much like a typical Dungeons and Dragons adventure, with the characters gathering and setting out for a quest for no obvious initial purpose.  Part One of the book is fairly linear and straightforward, whereas Part Two contains more twists and turns and is more engrossing.<BR>Like a typical RPG game, there isn't a lot of logic in the storyline.  What seems more striking is the lack of attention to realistic time and space scales:  people walk across vast distance in a couple of days, and a warrior pulls down a lift which can elevate his full weight.<BR>However, for fantasy role-playing fans, the book should be good entertainment on the whole, as it is very smooth and well-written.  Most of all, the characters are likeable and represent a fair sampling of archetypal fantasy heroes.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby has complied a great work here. I loved the last track titled, &quot;My Weakness&quot; and also the varied other songs within the record. A great work and highly recommended by this country boy.
B00003CXC7|5.0|1954's Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock remains one of my all-time favorite motion pictures. Even though nearly 100% of this film takes place in one very small studio apartment, it's never boring, never loses momentum, and never releases its suspenseful \\"grip\\" on the viewer!  And we wonder, just as Jimmy Stewart's character wonders ... Was this murder?  <br />Kudos all around on a flawless effort here!  Favorite J. Stewart dialogue: \\"Well, tell me, what do you need to search .... bloody footsteps leading up to the door?!\\"

B00004Z459|5.0|Many people are like, &quot;Oh, rock music, bleh,&quot; but Linkin Park is really good. They have awesome, clean lyrics, excellent riffs, and the coolest DJ!
B00000J7JO|5.0|Great energetic record. Interesting in a way. Half the songs are more melodic mainstream pop single ballads which i do not care for. But half the record is vintage Chili Peppers rock out with your c**k out funk.I like Dirt could go on the 1st record. Get On Top is straight up Uplift mofo Party Plan. Right On Time and Purple Stain manage to funk it up hardcore too. Shows the Chilis dont care about radio they do what they wanna do
0767819594|4.0|This movie is awesome. Sarah Michelle Gellar is sexy, seductive, and a drug user who has her way with her step-brother Sebastion. She seduces her step-brother to make love to a teenager who has a boyfriend(Reese Witherspoon)and she finds her self falling in an untrusting love trap. When Sebastion trys desperately to make love with her, Kathryn(Sarah Michelle Gellar)makes a plan, one if he loses she gets his car. If he wins he gets to bed Kathryn. This movie was so good. I love watching it over and over, but it is not recommended for young youth. This movie contains quite confusing scenes of sexaul frustration and some crude words that you do hear often, but it is not used literally, just in an anger type way without showing the feelings.
B000002LRX|5.0|FNM even manage to oneup The Real Thing. They upgrade the sound to a more twisted rock metal sound . very raw with a lot of sampling and also some experimenting. Patton takes a much larger stance with the songs here changing his vocal styles each song and even 3 or 4 times in the same song. Land of sunshine is the fucnky brother of from out of nowhere and Caffeine hits like a ton of bricks. Everythings Ruined is more polished Funk Metal and Malpractice and Jizzlobber is metal insanity. Be Aggressive is funk with a cool cheerleader chorus and A Small Victory is also more polished pop single  territory. Kindergarten is a great rock song and Midlife Crisis is pretty slick and even better live. This is Faith No More's Masterpiece. Truly Brilliant.They lower the Funk elements but the funk is still there. Crack Hitler is great 70's disco funk. Bill Goulds bass once again is top level. Mike Patton proves that The Real Thing was only the beginning
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney sure has grown over her albums. I have heard all of them and I love them. This one is awesome compared to the others. My favorie tracks are:<BR>I'm A Slave 4 U<BR>Overprotected<BR>Bombastic Love<BR>Boys<BR>Their are some others. I got this cd wrapped up for my Christmas gift and I can't wait to open it. Although I have saw it. Britney Spears is awesome. I hope she makes a new record as well. I love the cover and the back side. It's a new Britney. I can't wait to see if I can get the Britney Spears-Britney: The Videos the DVD. It has all the behind-the-scene footage and Bonus features. All I can say is that this is A great album. I gave it 4 stars because some songs were just not there such as &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; I really don't like this song, but the Cinderella song on the album is good as well! Great Job Britney! You're Growing Up TO Fast!
B000002UV1|5.0|Picking up where Uplift Mofo Party Plan left off the Chili Peppers truly funk it up on this record with more fast paced funk stylings. Stone Cold Bush is perhaps Fleas best bass solo. Good Time Boys is a great album started more funk metal that rivals Faith No More.Higher Ground is a great funk styling and Sexy Mexican Maid adds a lil spice to the show. Johnny Kick a hole also contains a badass Flea solo. Taste The pain is a great ballad where Flea plays trumpet while Subway To Venus also contains horns. The Chili peppers play it raw here with no regard to MTV or mainstream popularity
1573921394|4.0|Are We All Keynesians Now?<br /> Most educated Americans know something of John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist whose hugely influential work &#8220;T\\"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\\", strongly influenced economic theory and practice during the last half of the twentieth century, particularly with regard to the role of government in stimulating and regulating a  nation's&#8217;s economic life.  Nevertheless it remains true that almost all of the \\"intelligentsia\\" in general, and most economists in particular, have never read the book, despite the fact that it is readily available in today&#8217;s mega-bookstores such as of course, Amazon.com (at a reasonable price and) in a good quality paperback. <br /> Indeed, by a curious twist, the people who seem most to have made some attempt to read Keynes' oeuvre are those who appear most outraged by it and determined to revile it.  If one is skeptical about this, (read the reviews), where veritable \\"frothing at the mouth\\" denunciations seem to dominate.  These would hardly be worth reading except for the mindset they reveal, which goes far toward illuminating some of the attitudes of the 1930's otherwise inexplicable at the beginning of the twenty-first century.  Their very virulence convinces one that Keynes was clearly on to something; if an author enrages half the world he must be at least half right.<br /> Keynes detractors are right about one thing: \\"General Theory...\\" is a tough read, though not for some of the reasons they indicate.  Keynes actually uses very little mathematics, the alleged prevalence of which is one of the points usually cited in criticism.  He uses a little elementary algebra and a little differential calculus, hardly enough to swamp even the most modestly gifted sophomore who has been exposed to the subject.<BR>He does not generally contradict himself, as some allege, beyond the level of ambivalence to be expected of anyone who realizes he is treating an inexact science where many conflicting views can hold some claim to legitimacy.  Rather, what makes Keynes' work an ideal bedtime companion for those inflicted with insomnia is the obsessive care<BR>the author takes to be absolutely precise, the somewhat antique 1930's British English<BR>employed (though some, including the present reviewer, may see that as one of its charms)<BR>and the regular use of Latin phrases familiar to Keynes and his contemporaries, such as, e.g., \\"ceteris paribus\\" (roughly translated \\"all things being equal\\", meaningless to American readers whose formative collegiate experience included little in the way of foreign languages of any kind, let alone classical ones.  The trick in reading Keynes is to get beyond these inconveniences of packaging and unwrap the very real gift of ideas enclosed.<br /> Keynes' economic prescriptions are now so generally accepted, even by most conservatives, certainly including \\"W\\", that many of us find it hard to recognize what the argument is all about. These days it is taken for granted that the government has a responsibility to stimulate the economy out of recession, at least to the extent of reducing interest rates, and modestly applying the brakes during overexuberant expansion.  It is accepted that two of the factors exacerbating economic downturns are the fearfulness of investors in the face of declining corporate earnings and the reluctance of consumers to to put down money they suspect they may need later if they are laid off from their jobs.  It was not always so.<br /> Some imagine that Keynes work, along with the massive nineteenth century tomes of Karl Marx, constitute a response to Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" a work at least as misunderstood, often deliberately so, as \\"General Theory...\\".  That is not the case; Keynes hardly ever, refers to Smith and, in any case, those who have read \\"Wealth of Nations\\" are well aware that Smith, a truly charming writer quite apart from his undeniable genius, is far moresympathetic to the average worker and much more critical of monopolistic business practices than imagined by those who have deified him but never read him.  Instead, the dragons which Keynes sets forth to slay are those who later built a truly \\"Dark Tower\\" on Smith's rather benign foundation.  Those dragons include, most notably,  David Ricardo, Alfred Marshall and \\"Professor (A. C.) Pigou\\".<br /> Keynes cannot help but admit to the suspicion that these economists' written views on the question of employment, or the more pressing question of unemployment, reflected their identification of the social classes most likely to buy their books; he never states it quite that baldly, of course.  It seems almost incredible to us in this age that the prevailing opinion expressed in those writings is that all unemployment, at the organizational if not the individual level, is voluntary; that depressions and large scale unemployment result from the perverse refusal of workers or their labor union representatives to recognize their labor as just another good in the market, subject to a reduced price in the absence of demand occasioned by downturns in economic activity.<BR>One wonders if some of the tolerance for Adolf Hitler manifested by large segments of the British upper and middle classes, and smaller segments of their American counterparts, in part reflected his action on accession to the Chancellorship to reduce German wages by one third all around.  Whether that, by itself, increased German employment numbers or simply made economic room for a huge rearmament program that effectively eliminated labor redundancy is a good question ?but for some other essay. <br /> Keynes argues quite persuasively that a perception of fairness is essential in a democratic society. (10 points to Adolf for fairness?)  Wage reductions in capitalist economies tend to be spotty and opportunistic, rather than universal, typically affecting those who can least afford them.  Keynes also argues thatthey do virtually nothing to solve the problems of the economy, partly because employers may very well decide not to decrease prices comparably and, more importantly, because of cascading effects on overall demand; workers on reduced wages don't rush out to buy new automobiles.<P.

6305736650|4.0|Casablanca--generally regarded as one of the best movies of all time, and I'd say with good reason.  The love story set against the turmoil of World War II, combined with the larger theme of bringing the US into the war, make this a great movie on many levels.  Bogart's performance as Rick is terrific, and Bergman is a perfect foil for him as Ilsa.  Casablanca has been referenced so many times, it would be easy to dismiss it, but the movie is too powerful for that.  No matter how many times I watch it, the mixture of powerful performances and a great story keep my interest every time.<br />The DVD version is well-worth it just for the picture quality of the DVD compared to video, but the extras here are only fair.  The only major extra is a documentary hosted by Lauren Bacall, and while it's fine, a movie this good deserves more.
0140434151|5.0|I am a burgeoning literary scholar, so it may be rather unfashionable, as I am told, to say that I am a Janeite - though I have never gone so far as to throw a tea-party in her honour, I will say that I am exceeding fond of her novels, her style, her characters, and her corrective social satire.  If she were not dead, lo, these last 185 years, I would positively send her an elegantly written letter declaring my love.  At any rate.<br />&quot;Emma&quot; is a fine novel, as though it lacked only my approbation to make it so.  In it, Austen explores the vagaries of the marriage plot in the way only Austen can, with all the humour and satiric bite of which she is capable.  She imagines a solipsistic community, Highbury, &quot;a crowd in a little room,&quot; if you will, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and Emma Woodhouse, the 21 year old mistress of Hartfield, presides socially over all.  Through and around Emma's point of view, Austen examines the various social, class, and economic relationships that hold the community together.<br />&quot;Emma&quot; begins with a very Doodian rhexis - the cut - Emma Woodhouse and her sedentary old father's society is broken up by the marriage of Emma's governess/best friend, Miss Taylor.  Creating a sort of void in Emma's life, a newcomer to Hartfield, a 17 year old girl named Harriet Smith, becomes the intimate friend and a reclamation project of sorts for Emma.  Emma, convinced the &quot;natural daughter of somebody&quot; must be, like Fielding's Tom Jones, related to someone of wealth and influence, tries tirelessly to play the matchmaker, filling Harriet's head with delusions of grandeur.  Throughout the novel, Emma must face the chastisements of her landed neighbour, Mr. Knightley, the quiet support of Mrs. Weston (Taylor), and the temptations of a relationship of her own, while learning the limitations of her own understanding of the world in which she lives.<br />As in most of Austen's novels, &quot;Emma&quot; focuses on the changing nature of the English economy, and how it trickles into even the most secluded of English towns, forcing a reckoning and acknowledgment of the shift in English society from primarily aristocratic hierarchy to the moneyed-middle classes.  That Emma is a young woman indicates that the transition must happen immediately, with the present generation, which is difficult, especially from Emma's privileged, though not exactly aristocratic vantage point, to understand and accept.  The intrusion on Emma's peace by such characters as the young, ambitious vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton, the up and coming interests of the merchant Cox family, the industrious farmer, Robert Martin, and the incessant bombast of Miss Augusta Hawkins (and her associations with Bristol, epicenter of the British slave-trade) provide a range of perspectives on the possibilities of the rising and increasingly influential middle classes - and the impact they have, even in so small a village as Highbury.  Austen asks us to read the microcosm as in some ways, importantly representative of the macrocosm of England.<br />I think in all of these points of interest, at least to me, I've forgotten completely to say how deftly Austen presents these critical issues with such decided humour, grace of style, and flawless execution of plot and character development, as to make the most glaring philsophical and social issues seamlessly blend into the comic forefront of the novel!  One finds it difficult not to laugh straight through the first three or four chapters altogether.  Her characters, from the delightfully disturbing hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, to the initially unreadable Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax (who must foreshadow Jane Eyre), and the irrepressibly vociferous Miss Bates - are all well drawn and memorable.  This review is getting really long and pretentious now, so I'll stop - go, start reading &quot;Emma&quot; this instant.

B0083ZRAJS|4.0|L. Frank Baum (1856-1919) failed repeatedly through one bad career choice after another--until 1900, he wrote THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ, which was published with memorable illustrations by W.W. Denslow.  Literary critics have never been greatly enthusiastic about the book or the sequels that followed it, but children and the general reading public adored them.  A 1902 stage show and the famous 1939 film fueled interest, and one way or another, Oz has been with us ever since.<br /><br />Most people know the story.  A little named Dorothy Gale, who lives in Kansas, is whisked into the air by a passing cyclone and ultimately lands in Oz, where she encounters good witches, bad witches, a humbug wizard, and most particularly a scarecrow, a tin man, and a cowardly lion, who become her friends and helpers as she struggles to find a way return home.  But the book is quite different from the various stage and film versions in terms of detail.  There are two good witches, not one; the flying monkeys are not specifically evil; during their travels Dorothy and her friends encounter strange animals, an entire village made of living china, the flatheads, and a spider-like monster the lion fights to gain a kingdom.<br /><br />The story is very episodic and the characters are not as well developed as they will become in Baum's later books, but all the foundations are here, and Baum would go on to write thirteen popular sequels, not to mention a host of other novels, plays, scripts, and poems.  Many of Baum's works, especially the Oz novels, gently satirize social conventions and norms, and quite a few anticipate technological rises in the form of telephone, radio, television, and the like.  The Oz books are particularly noteworthy because they tend to center on female protagonists who find themselves more than equal to the men who oppose them.<br /><br />THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ is past copyright, which means that anybody and everybody can and do publish it, and you will find it in every form imaginable.  Whether you want a digital or hardcopy, the thing to look for are editions that have the original Denslow illustrations, which add so much charm to the novel and which are quite unlike anything seen in later stage and film versions.  Recommended for children and clever adults everywhere.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerin every form imaginable.

Like you were there taking a glimpse of Landon Carter's life.
0141301155|4.0|Never mind the painfully literal film version: Charlie's adventures in the chocolate factory are more akin to the Brothers Grimm than popular cinematic fantasy.  Both children and adults will be amused by the appropriate symbolic way in which the wicked are punished and the good rewarded.  An excellent &quot;read aloud&quot; book that older children--and grown-ups too--will enjoy reading on their own as well!

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I'm a great fan of light fiction, particularly clever fiction, so when our gang collected at a friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner, and we settled in for the usual low key after dinner recovery period in front of  the TV set, I voted for the Shrek film on DVD.  Although I hadn't gone to see it  in the theaters because it was a &quot;kids&quot; film, I had &quot;broken down&quot; and purchased the DVD on the recommendation of a friend's daughter (Grace, aged 8 years), and loved it.  So did the friends with whom I watched it at Thanksgiving.<br />As with any successful comedy, whether cartoon or human driven, the story has various layers to it, appealing  in different ways to different age groups.  For those of us who have grown up on works like Monty Python, Saturday Night Live and other irreverent fare, the punch in the eye to standard fairytales is enjoyable.  (Early on  Shrek tears out the &quot;and she was awakened by true loves' first  kiss&quot; page out of his book in disgust and uses it as toilet tissue!)  Younger children will probably love the cute little donkey character, young girls the Zena like princess, young boys the mud bath of the ogre, etc.<br />As usual, Eddie Murphy does a superlative job as the &quot;annoying, miniature beast of burden.&quot;  As with his little dragon character, Moushu in the Disney film Mulan, he is both dear and slightly idiotic at the same time.  He has all the genius for delivery that Robin Williams exhibited in Aladden, but brings with it his own style, a  more direct and more connected sense, that one finds in all of his work.  His was by far my favorite character.  I hope he does lots of other voice over parts like this in the future; he's truly gifted.<br />Mike Meyers is the real surprise, at least to me.  I've only seen bits and pieces of Austin Powers in trailers and was not impressed.  When I was told that it was he who played the central character Shrek, I have to admit I was impressed.  Maybe CGI characters are his forte!<br />One of the facits of the work I liked best was the clear message--lost entirely, I might point out,  in the Disney version of Beauty and the Beast of which Shrek might be considered a modern day version--that happily ever after, love, and happiness do not come packaged in a pretty or handsome face.  Although the Disney movie pointed out that, as the old adage has it, &quot;handsome is as handsome does,&quot; it botched the works by changing the beast into a handsome prince as his reward for being a person worthy of love.  Any school dance wall-flower knows for a fact that this never happens.  Shrek makes it clear that, while a person may not be what the rest of the world considers attractive, they are beautiful as long as the one they love sees them as so.  In fact, the movie makes several points important for adults as well as children to learn.<br />The visual effects of the film were impressive.  The hair, facial affect, and movement of the characters was very real.  The movements and habits of the little donkey kept reminding me of my great danes Courageous and Tempo.  Expressions on faces created a sense of person and mental and emotional content that most cartoon characters lack or can only approximate by physically &quot;aping&quot; human behaviors.  The humans were not quite as real as some of the central individuals  in Final Fantasy, for instance, but the fact that they had to interact with totally make believe characters in a believable manner, made this less an inadequacy and more a means of promoting the story.  In fact, the facial affect of those in Shrek were far superior to Final Fantasy despite their overall less &quot;real&quot; appearence.  Probably the most impressive innovations in the film were in environmental design.  Many of the effects were very realistic, even more so than the much awaited monument to CGI, Final Fantasy.<br />The double DVD edition, in addition to providing the wide screen and the pan and scan versions ofthe film,  has several special features.  My favorite was the &quot;out takes,&quot; that is the computer bloopers that produced bizarre results.<br />This is definitely a wonderful addition to a family library of videos or DVDs and would make a lovely holiday gift for almost any age group.the film,  has several special features.

0345451325|5.0|As many people have said, most books of this type (based on a game) seem to be quickly written and rather unexciting.  This book is the exception to the rule.  I was rather apprehensive going into this book but found myself hooked very quickly.  From the training of the new breed of 'supersoldiers' to the fantastic space and ground battles this book never slows down.  The characters are wonderfully well developed, the action is intense and exciting (loved the battle for Sigma Octanus), and the book as a whole is perfectly paced (you'll never say 'it was good, but slowed down a bit in the middle').  If you are planning on playing the game (I'm halfway through it myself) this book is a must read.  Even if you don't plan on playing Halo but are a fan of military sci-fi action this book will satisfy.  I will also be seeking out Nylunds other novels.
0786880708|5.0|I am a voracious reader of books of all types, with a strong interest in Buddhism, and particularly Buddhist psychology.  This book is one of a precious few that I hold close to my heart.<br />Kabat-Zinn has managed to write a book that is gentle, comforting, and practical.  That the book is comforting and gentle does not mean that it shallow or filled with simplistic platitudes.  Rather, comfort flows naturally from the quiet passion of a teacher sharing earthy wisdom.<br />That the book is practical does mean that it is dry and monotonous, or that it emphasizes technique at the expense of the heart.  Instead, Kabat-Zinn gently touches on what meditation and what meditation is not.  Without arousing anxiety or dampening enthusiasm, he refutes misunderstandings and guides the would-be student around the common snags and obstacles of a new meditation practice.<br />The book is organized in short &quot;chunks&quot; that can be read a digested easily.  I carried the book with me on the subway where I found that I had enough time to read and contemplate one chunk before reaching my destination.<br />Reading Kabat-Zinn's book is a meditation in itself.  This book is one of my treasures.  I highly recommend it to anyone who is exploring meditation or Buddhism, particularly those who may be depressed or discouraged and in search of solid, caring wisdom.
B00004X01U|5.0|Music is one of Madonna's best cd's.  After venturing into the calm, peacefull Ray of Light spirituality world (which I personally liked), she returns to her old self in &quot;Music&quot;.  Everyones listened or heard all the pros and cons of this cd so I dont want to dwell on it.  But if your a Madonna fan and you dont have this cd than well your not a Madonna fan..enough said.
0385505833|5.0|As a loyal Grisham fan, I found &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; to be his best story yet.  From beginning to end you become totally involved in what will ultimately happen in this scheme to avoid Christmas.  The humor in everyone's response to their plan make one wonder what would happen if you tried to &quot;skip Christimas&quot; in your life.  Just a wonderful story, I have bought several as Christmas gifts--I can't recommend this one enough.
B00004XONN|5.0|Many avid Radiohead fans, and those who jumped on the Radiohead bandwagon after the critical and popular success of OK computer were disappointed with this album, but I really don't see why?  The album is anything but &quot;rock and roll,&quot; and thankfully so.<br />In their previous albums, the band had pushed the limits of acceptable music.  They dared to put melody into loud and distorted guitar lines; they dared to sing abstrusely about universally significant subjects; they dared to make every album different from the one before; they dared to write an entire album's worth of good material before recording; they dared to play and write what THEY wanted to, not what their &quot;fans&quot; wanted them to.  Despite popular belief, bands--nor any artists--owe anything to us as consumers and fans.  They do, however, owe it to themselves to create and perform the art that flows through their vains and radiates down on them from the sky and comes to them in dreams.  Kid A is exactly that.<br />This album is prophetic, it's enigmatic, it's incoherent, melodic, powerful . . . it's simply amazing.  Musically, the album takes so many chances.  The heavy reliance on synthesizers, drum machines, and all kinds of unheard of electronic gadgets is something that hasn't succeeded since a brief stint in 1982-83.  The apparent lack of formal organization and progressions in the compositions is also quite a bold move.  However, it all worked so wonderfully under the direction of Thom Yorke, who is perhaps the greatest musical genius of the past century.  The album somehow creates landscapes and atmospheres and entire worlds.  The catch is, it's all an interpretation of the world we live in now.  It's most similar to T.S. Eliot's masterpiece &quot;The Hollow Men.&quot;  The entire album progresses--or rather regresses from the current state of the world, with compulsive, materialistic, aimless life of the opening track, to the concerned denial of &quot;How to Disappear Completely,&quot; to the chaotic revolution of &quot;Idioteque,&quot; to final closure or total destruction that takes place halfway through &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot;  The most important element of the entire album is oddly enough the two minutes of silence surrounding the majestic and symbolic roar of a synthesized orchestra at the end of the album.  That silence and that out-of-the-blue revival of heavenly music, which slowly fades back into silence, so blatantly depicts some form of &quot;afterlife.&quot;  Due to the comprehensive lyrics and themes of Radiohead's material, I interpret this to be a straightforward affirmation of the concepts of Heaven and Hell and an admonition of the dangers of modern society's structure.<br />Even if the music itself does not appeal to someone, everyone must appreciate the album's diversity and audacity and its socially absconded statements of the supernatural.ly,&quot; to the chaotic revolution of &quot;Idioteque,&quot; to final closure or total destruction that takes place halfway through &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot;  The most important element of the entire album is oddly enough the two minutes of silence surrounding the majestic and symbolic roar of a synthesized orchestra at the end of the album.

B00005QK3W|4.0|I usually prefer Paul's more polished recordings over the ones he knocks out quickly but this one is still strong.  His songs continue to work their way into my head in a way no other artist's songs can.  Seems like the only way I can stop humming Magic is to start humming Lonely Road.  One quibble, I think it runs out of steam at the end.  Riding Into Jaiper should have been axed and Rinse the Raindrops is in need of editing.
1577311523|5.0|The word enlightenment is defined very applicably here. This is one of those books that makes change for the uplifting in your life, but I think if you are not open to the spirit this book may, and I say may since this book may open your spirit up, not be what you want to read. I say that since the write is very directed and aimed at lifting  existing spirituality. But dont take that negatively, there is nothing negative or weak about this one. I recommend this book to everyone, including Osama.<br />Another great eye opener is by Karl Mark Maddox, that title is SB 1 or God.
B00005RHGK|1.0|The pain is almost palpable...I'm referring, of course, to storyline, not the acting of &quot;pain&quot; in this film.<br />I was sort of settling myself in the mood of watching a good horror film with my fiancee, after having told her that what I heard; it sounded good...and squirmed with embarrassment as the film unfolded.<br />Please read no further if you HAVEN'T seen the film. Suffice it to say that you really should save yourself the agony if you haven't.<br />The film could easily have ended if a parent had driven the car.<br />(film)<BR>Brother: Did not!<BR>Sister: Did too!<BR>Brother: Did not!<BR>Sister: Did too!<BR>(divine intervention from parent): You kids either shut up or I'm going to turn this car around!!<br />Other problems with this movie:<BR>1. Our demonic creature, invincible--even invulnerable--and scary, can fly...yes, FLY...yet feels compelled to drive (yes, DRIVE) around incognito in a truck stolen from the DUEL (nod to a good film by Spielberg) studio lot in a disguise that would have made DARKMAN say, &quot;Oh, please.&quot;<BR>2. Is this creature scary?<BR>*Yes!*<BR>After you?<BR>*Oh, yes, please someone stop it!*<BR>Is it eating a victim?<BR>*Why, yes it is...let's watch, sis, whaddya say?*<BR>Most people run when they have a chance, but not our &quot;static&quot; duo...they're going to watch every gruesome moment as our hero...um...demon begins to eat someone's head.<BR>3. The scarecrow scene. Was there a point? Did the demon really feel compelled to use a ruse that was devised more to scare the audience then to serve any meaningful purpose within the story's context? Also, what was up with the CATS???? The movie was creepy enough without some deranged woman who attempts to be creepy, but is just downright eccentric and in need of better lighting for her house. Advice: use Yellow Pages.<BR>4. Victims. Victims galore. Over 500 and counting in a deserted area. Did anyone ever think of looking? Even if they were all travelers, you think that the dragnet of law enforcement would sit and ponder, &quot;You know, those darned kids took the same route as the other 498 other missing cases in this darned area. Maybe we should ask that weird fellow at the abandoned building over yonder...seems kinda strange that there is a truck parked in front of it. *spitting and bell sound*&quot;<BR>5. Jeepers Creepers...where did you get those eyes...was this really meant to shock us at the end? Oh, the demon took the little fellow's eyes...what a surprise.<BR>6. The CAR. Oh, that hurt the most. I could almost hear the director saying, &quot;Hey, Bob. This scene needs some tension. Whaddya think?&quot; Bob: &quot;Oh, I've got it!! How about making the car difficult to start?!? We haven't done that before!!&quot; (repeat 6 times -- but when it's not necessary, make sure the car starts just fine like when they decide to run over the demon). It was the first time that I can recall actually moaning out loud in a film every time I heard the engine grind.<br />With some rework and common sense, this story could have worked beautifully. It's also nice to see a horror story that serves to perpetuate itself by not making us wonder if the demon died, but to let the demon survive. But the arguing between the two main characters who somehow manage to develop an undying bond near the film's end, a pointless psychic, a creature that obviously has no need for disguise if it can survive being run over by a car several times, law enforcement that practices &quot;let's stay in a huddle so one grenade could take us out&quot; tactics, and so on, was enough to make me say, &quot;What was that? And did you get the license plate number?&quot;
0790736233|5.0|Contact leaves me speechless and every time I watch the film again I can't help but watch the credits float up the screen.  The sountrack by Alan Silvestri is also very good (I have it).<BR>I can't decide which is better-the book or the film.  I know that Jodie played Ellie Arroway geniusly.  I think Carl would be proud of it.<BR>     By the way, did anyone realize the two &quot;C's&quot; in the film.  One was in Ellie's father's hand.  And the other was at the very end when Ellie sifted rocky soil in her palm.  I think &quot;C&quot; symbolizes &quot;Carl&quot;.  They tried to be conspicuous because one &quot;C&quot; is backwards or reversed (forget which).  I love this movie.
0375703861|3.0|I was entertained and frustrated by this book at the same time. Zadie Smith has a very colorful cast of characters, but some of whom were described at length in the beginning and I got interested in their lives became nothing but lost in the background by the end, while others who popped up later in the book stole many of the scenes in the later chapters.<br />It was hard for me to perceive the characters of Samad and Alsana speaking the way they did, considering they both grew up in Bangladesh, and fixing their arguments in a way I've never seen a south Asian couple do. To her credit, Smith did capture some of the essence of Islamic fundamentalist youth groups, halal butcheries, and Indian restaurants. It seems like her strength lies in her knowledge of Carribbean culture and its immigrant community in the UK, as she really made Ambrosia, Hortense, Clara, and Irie come to life.<br />The plot of the book was running on tangents and could have been tighter, but I'm still glad to read it. I'll be interested in what Zadie Smith comes up with next time. Great first effort, though!
0452282152|4.0|Bought this for my wife, who enjoyed it thoroughly.  That's good enough for me.  At the very least, this means that if at some point I am searching the house for something to read, I'll consider it for myself.
B000006NPY|5.0|I am so tired of supposedly faithful Pumpkinheads who so easily act ashamed of this album. Billy Corgan is a lyrical and musical genius, and with that genius comes sonic and poetic evolution. Oh no...change! No heavy layered guitars, no delinquent rat-in-cage primal screamings. The people who couldn't grow to love this album, are of the grunge variety. They probably like Pearl Jam more, and think Nirvana is the greatest band ever. Woo-hoo.  Siamese Dream was ushered in with this crowd, unfortunately. Adore is a prime example of just how beautiful songwriting can be. Cobain's acid literation can't hold a candle to music so eloquently transcribed from the heart. This album is a companion to the humble, misunderstood soul in all of us. If you want blaring power chords go elsewhere, but if you are willing to open your heart to an album of youthful innocence and frail humanity, you will find a friend within.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This is a really good record.  There are a couple of knockouts, but many of the songs on the record are pretty slow and soulful. Not to say they aren't good, it just took me seven or eight listens to get a bite into the slower stuff. Bought a Whiskeytown album, and the same thing. He's got a great voice, writes good songs, he just needs someone to light a fire under his back side, because when he rocks, it is indeed Gold. You gotta want to be patient to like the slower stuff, but I have slowly acquired a liking for most of the record. It really is a very, very good record, I just wish he would pick up the pace and rock a little more.  Highly recommend that you get the limited edition with the extra disc which includes six great, rollicking songs (a great disc on it's own).
0803292406|4.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a clasic so, naturaly, I had high expectations.  I certainly was not let down. It has a totally unique style with much detail and extensive writing. Yet, this novel is a very quickly read novel, unlike other excessively detailed books like Dracula. This book is not boring. This book is fun. It doesn't ruin the plot with too much detail like other books. Other fantasy books are usually not even close to realistic. Whereas Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is close to being conceived realistic. This book has a general morbid feeling to it where other fantasies are sometimes cheerful and happy. Robert Louis Stevenson is a realy good writer in my opinion.<br>He uses a very wide range of vocabulary. Stevenson uses many 19th Century terms that seem weird and different to me. <br>One thing bad about his writing is his punctuation. He uses way too many semicolons and comas. He makes one sentence out of six or seven sentences. <br>This book was not the best book I ever read, but was not the worst either. it was mediocre.  however It was miles ahead of Dracula. Dracula is boring, whereas Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is fast paced, quick, and fun to read. its pritty morbid which is kind of a down side, but Since it is very short it is a good book on my list.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This film is still hilarious and the extras are fun.<br />I never knew that the colors were as bright as they are on this DVD.  My previous two  video versions are very grainy and washed out, this is far superior.
B00003CXXI|5.0|The first time you see this movie you will expect a childs movie but after watching the first 15 minutes you will se you were mistaken. It's cute and insanely funny at the same time! The graphics in this movie are awe inspiring, especialy when you find out they had to dum them down to make them more cartoony! You will not be dissapointed with it! Also check out the extended ending!
B00004Y7SF|1.0|I have Jewel's Christmas CD (thanks to a review I found here on Christina's CD) I also have Reba's and other less conventional interpetations of old classics, but I must say this is the first time I have received a CD and tried to rid myself of it on the same day. (...)Ms Aguilera has a beautiful voice and I could invision her singing O HOly Night in my mind's ear as being something special, but it seems she was to involved in vocal exercises to give the songs their much needed attention.
B000002MFE|5.0|I have almost every Clapton album and I can say that this is at the top of my list right next to Riding with the king. This album is both acousticly pleasing and the different versions of his popular songs are worth every cent. Tears in Heaven is worth the price alone. Hey, Hey and Layla are other great songs on the album.
B000024QML|4.0|Not only is this the &quot;drop the ambiguity&quot; record for the pet shop boys, it is their most cohesive and stunningly beautiful they have recorded since, and perhaps ever will record. From the opening defiance of &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot; to the sorrow and anguish of the soft, moving &quot;Dreaming of the Queen&quot;, this album has little bad going for it...even my least favorite &quot;One And One Make Five&quot; is still a solid track.<br />Truth be told, I hadn't listened to this in a while....I put it in the other day, and felt all the same familiar emotions swelling back up within me..the hope as I listened to &quot;Liberation&quot; or the descent into despair as I listened to &quot;To Speak Is A Sin&quot;, the fact that they still evoke the same power so long after I thought I had eeked every ounce out of them says a great deal. They also pull off a perfect balance on this album that they've never quite topped (although Nightlife is pretty close). Even instrumentally they are unmatched....Bilingual saw experimental sounds coloring the mix, where nightlife touched techno-pop at it's most slick, yet Very manages to mix better than the rest the organic and synthetic. The sound is at the same time rich, consuming, even overwhelming, but a joy to listen to any way you slice it.<br />If you're a fan and don't own this yet, what are you waiting for? If not, and you want an introduction, grab this at your earliest convenience! You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKES|5.0|This show made television worth watching and made it worth while to be involved with a shows story.  David Lynch created such a great world of mystery and fear in Twin Peaks that it made me terrified to watch the show alone.  As Agent Cooper said, &quot;secrets are very bad things&quot; so if you've never seen the show, force yourself.
1878424319|3.0|This book looked interesting at first but found it to be an over-simplication of Jungian ideas.  I was disappointed but read it anyway.  Takes about an afternoon to read through.  The author's style annoyed me but the general principles were right on.
B000002H72|4.0|This is a great, fun album, nothing heavy nothing depressing. Good rock, good hooks, wacky sounds and catchy lyrics.
B00005OWEG|4.0|No words of mine can make your mind for you. All I can do is encourage you, if you haven't already, to SEE THIS MOVIE! The book upon which it was based, Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; is also well worth a look if you have seen the film and would like further insight into the themes.<br />With Redux comes nearly 50 minutes of added and restored scenes. I think the scenes are a great look into human relations, but don't really add to the ultimate Kurtz plotline, which is really just slowed down by these other scenes. I would suggest seeing the original cut first, as it's more coherent and flows a little more smoothly- then, by all means, see this cut. There's great expansion to all of the characters, particularly Lance and Willard. If while watching the original, you noticed a somewhat abrupt change in these two, you'll find the explanation in these added scenes.<br />The reason I can't give this disc 5 stars, (Notice I say disc, not movie- the movie is worthy of 10 stars!) is because of the change in aspect ratio. The movie was shot in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio- very wide. The DVD transfer appears in 16x9 (or 1.8:1)! Why? I assume because 16x9 digital set users have complained about those &quot;annoying&quot; black bars at the top and bottom of their screen: &quot;What did I buy a widescreen set for anyway??&quot; So in an attempt to quiet these ignorant types, the producers of this disc decided to chop off a good deal of the frame. To see what I'm talking about, go to the French Plantation scene. When the widow is making drinks and the picture of her dead husband is on the opposite side of the frame, half of it is cut off! Inexcusable. I thought I abandoned these pathetic compromises when I threw out my VHS tapes!<br />Anyway, see this movie.
B000002H8F|4.0|When I think of the late 80's and early 90's this album comes up as one of the best.  So great in it's aura of noise and beauty that one might not believe it's real. Especially now when most music just comes from the bicepts and crotch.
0451203933|5.0|This was one of the better books that I have read in some time.<BR>Bowden is able to provide an up front description of the battle in Somalia. The author shows both sides who were engaged in this conflict. He also displays mistakes that were made by the American forces. This book really has significance with the ongoing Afgan war and the involvemant of Special Forces. This book covered every aspect of this battle. You get to see the family side,the military side as well as the political side. The<br />author doesn't miss anything.This book was truly a page turner.<BR>After reading this fine book I plan to read more by Mark Bowden.<BR>This book should be rated six stars.

B00005R2M3|3.0|It's sometimes hard to categorize when listening to Shakira's English debut LAUNDRY SERVICE.  It seems that she wants to be all things to all people--Celine('Underneath Your Clothes'), Alanis(too many to name), and your average dance diva--insert your choice here-('Ready For The Good Times'), while vocally sounding throughout as though she's channeling Jewel with slightly bigger lungs. Which makes for a more than slightly mixed bag of tunes. Granted, 'Whenever, Wherever' is easily the best thing to come from a Latino crossover artist since Ricky Martin's now-ubiquitous 'Livin La Vida Loca', and she brings the requisiste passion to tunes like the previously mentioned 'Underneath..' and '..Times'. But the schizo feel of it all might leave one's head spinning, and maybe not for the better.  The talent is obviously here, but consistency is unfortunately not.

6305358567|5.0|It's a tough job, being Queen of England, but Cate Blancett's Elizabeth is more than up to the challenge in this movie biography of one of Britain's most famous monarchs.<br />Not 100% accurate to be sure, but there's enough here to give a casual viewer an idea of the dangers Princess Elizabeth had to endure while she was literally waiting for her half-sister Queen Mary Tudor to die. This Mary really, really hates Elizabeth, and is about maybe this close to killing her. Lots of other intriguers don't like Elizabeth, either, and they would like to see her destroyed too. Luck is on Elizabeth's side, though, and she outlives her half-sister to become Queen at 25.<br />The intrigue doesn't end here, though; in fact, you might say it's just beginning. Who will Elizabeth marry? Will the Old Catholics be successful in overthrowing her and placing their own man on the throne? Is there anybody, man or woman, that Elizabeth can trust in this whole realm? <br />Well, if you don't already know enough English history to answer a few of those questions, I won't spoil things for you. I really enjoyed this movie myself. You get a sense of the perils that filled Elizabeth's every moment. Cate is a marvelous Queen Bess, and we see her metamorphose into the Queen who would be King, because in her time, women didn't count for very much in their own right. The real Elizabeth had often to refer to herself in masculine terms in order to project strength enough to subdue those who would attempt to topple her from power. The shrewdness of the woman is aptly displayed by Cate, and I applaud her for it.<br />If you want to see a woman learn to be her own soulmate and rule an island kingdom at the same time, then move your throne up to the VCR and put on &quot;Elizabeth&quot;.
078322687X|5.0|This movie is a classic and it will stand the test of time. This is the second &quot;teen coming of age&quot; installment from John Hues, and round 2 for Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall. The first installment, Sixteen Candles, was more of a sexual coming of age movie whereas The Breakfast Club is more of a coming of age for one's character and social awareness. Where they are &quot;teetering&quot; with; do they stay with the social allegiances of their perspective pack, or do they listen to that inner voice...the voice of reason, maturity and human compassion that's not bound to any &quot;click&quot;. I also like the choice of actors here; I think they all fit like pieces in a puzzle and make their characters totally believable. I am in the same age range as almost the entire cast and I was a senior in High school when this film came out. Allot of reviews seem to put this film within the Junior High crowd but I feel it's much more mature than that. The very message that it's trying to get across isn't understood in real life until we get close to 18 or so. The story is simple; 5 kids have to come into school on a Saturday for detention. At first they try to segregate themselves according to their school social standings. Inevitably they find out that they are more alike than they ever thought. The movie, in my eyes, is broken into 3 parts; the first part is pure character development. This is where you (the viewer) get to know each person they way they are supposed to be seen with their everyday face. At first, they act the way they think they should act, and stand up for what they always had, with out question or defiance. They stay true to their cause never steering away for a second. The second part of the film is where the movie itself develops. These 5 separate entities realize that they are variations of the same person. They have the same desires and anguishes. Their pressures and stresses are the same even though it's generated from very different sources. <BR>The jock (Emilio Estevez) has the pressure to be on top of his sport (wrestling). In return for this he gets attention from his dad, coaches and keeps his standing within his social group. This is his priority in life and he doesn't stray.<BR>The Princess (Molly Ringwald) has to conform and obey the rules of her social group in order to be accepted and keep her standing within the group. She keeps her eyes closed; mouth shut and goes along for the ride.<BR>The Metal Head/criminal (Judd Nelson) is an angry guy! He wears the physical and mental scars of growing up in an abusive house. He hates most people, like the ones Emilio and Molly play, because in his eyes, they have had a free ticket and earned nothing...things are handed to them because of their social and/or economical standings. On the other hand, he feels that he's on a whole other plain because his eyes have been beaten open and he was forced to grow up a little faster than he wanted too or was ready too. I feel that Judd Nelson's character is the most crucial to the movie. He is the key to this whole new self-awareness for everyone, including himself.<BR>The nerd (Anthony Michael Hall) is the quintessential geek. His every woken moment is spent learning. He hides behind his grades and in fact, he wants to be more accepted by the &quot;cooler&quot; groups. He also is a little &quot;cocky&quot; about his better grades and academically superiority to the other people in the room. <BR>The weirdo (Ally Sheedy) is a loner and an outcast. She doesn't have friends that we (the viewers) know of. Because her parents ignore her, She feels ugly and without a place in the world. She is starving for positive attention. I think her character was needed in this movie to balance off the cast. It would have left out a very critical part of teen angst!<BR>Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) is the &quot;Villain&quot; of the movie. To the kids, he represents the out of touch older generation and the mean spirited, hightestosterone adult. For Richard Vernon, these kids are the source of his anger and agony. He has lost touch with the younger generation for 1 reason, he got older...and the older you get, the harder it is to relate to youth. Youth recycles right before your eyes, but you keep getting older. His character is the key that releases these kids. He helps them to strip away the blindfolds and to take a fresh look at every thing and everyone (including themselves). <br />This leads to the 3rd and final part of the movie. Where they cleanse themselves of all the pentad up anger and prejudices. When the kids realize that they all have the same goal, they were just taking different roads to reach it. I highly recommend The Breakfast Club and it should go down as one of the all time great teenage movie!
B00004Y62T|5.0|This movie looked good in the theatre trailers, though I couldn't quite grasp what it was about--false identities? It made it to the $4 night at the local theatre, so I went with my sister, who hadn't even heard of it yet.<br />Wow! What a great movie!  <br />Mr. Ripley's (Matt Damon's) talent is that he's a chameleon, shaping his story to fit in with the wealthy Dickie (Jude Law), a rich boy at play in Italy with his girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow). How Mr. Ripley manages to ingratiate himself and win friends and a lifestyle he should never have is fascinating to watch. And then, things take a riveting turn, and everything's very different. When does making up become covering up? When there's a murder involved, of course.   <br />Excepting the murder, this film is a little reminiscent of &quot;All About Eve&quot; where unsuspecting nice people who have something enviable are putty in the hands of a master manipulator. The difference is that Mr. Ripley is our protagonist, while Eve is an antagonist. And what a difference from this point of view!  <br />All the actors and actresses do a great job, and the scenery is to die for--or perhaps more accurately, to kill for!
B00004X01U|4.0|Music in my opinion is one of her best albums, but didn't quite beat Ray of Light. There's sometime off about this album that made me give her 4 stars. The songs in this album has a tad too much techno involved specially in the tracks &quot;nobody's perfect&quot; and &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; which are still good songs, but so &quot;weird&quot; compared to what we've heard out of Madonna in the last few years. As it turns out you got a choice in this album, you can either hear the techno or hear the guitar. It's just that &quot;different&quot;. Don't get me wrong, she's a great artist, and I couldn't love her more, but &quot;Music&quot; also left me the feeling that Madonna is losing a little of that &quot;WOW&quot; that she once had. Yes, people are happy for Madonna and her new hubby and family, but &quot;Music&quot; has way too much of &quot;GUY&quot; and &quot;Rocco&quot; in it if you know what I mean. And yes I already know that Madonna's songs reflect her life.<BR>However you really can't beat Madonna singing in French..it's just sweeeeeeeeeeet! Of all the songs in this album &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is probably the most fun and &quot;Paradise Not for Me&quot; probably the most impressive, cause I don't think I ever heard anything like it before. <BR>In short, good...entertaining, but might leave you thinking.
0380796090|5.0|i stumbled upon this book one day and enjoyed the bright front cover. inside i found a wonderfully written romantic/comedy. This story is about a 20-something woman who one day trades a son for a husband. She goes through a long period to find her true self and along with her friends and (hysterical) family she is able to deal with her life. I laugh every time i read this book and have even bought it for my friends as gifts. Its is such a cheer-you-up story. Take the time to read this story and you will be happy you did.
0345410025|4.0|Sherlock Holmes used to always say to Watson, &quot;You see, but you do not observe.&quot; These guys would agree. Our problem is not the retention of facts so much as it is the failure to commit them to memory the first time - something they call &quot;Original Awareness.&quot; The key for all memory retention, they say, is the principle of association. We always learn something new by linking it to something we already know. Whether it's random facts, names, faces, numbers, concepts, etc., it is vital to force the mind to concentrate and to work imaginatively. I was impressed with how much Aristotle learned from these guys ;). He said, &quot;It is the image-making part of the mind which makes the work of the higher processes of thought possible. Hence the mind never thinks without a mental picture. The thinking faculty thinks of its forms in pictures. No one could ever learn or understand anything, if he had not the faculty of perception; even when he thinks speculatively, he must have some mental picture with which to think&quot; (De anima). Furthermore, the authors tell us that medical science has shown very little physiological difference between the electrical signals activated by the mind's eye and the ones activated by the mind itself. The key to memory retention is to turn the object to be remembered into something that can be pictured in the mind. Of course, this takes work. But imagine the work you'd have to do without the tools to make it easier! This how-to book gives some great tools for memory retention and its a quick read as well. You can read the whole thing in just a couple of hours. Also, check this book out from your library instead of buying it. The methods put forth are all related to the principle of association so they are really easy to recall for later use. You'll see what I mean.
B000002AVF|5.0|This release was the follow-up to 1993's hugely successful \\"Music Box\\" (more than 27 million copies sold worldwide). Mariah followed that album with what is still one, if not, her best album yet. \\"Daydream\\" was a huge singles album (though not as much as her debut album), producing 3 #1 hits and another top 10 airplay hit. The first single, \\"Fantasy\\", is pure pop perfection; sampling the infectious 'Tom Tom Club' hit \\"Genius of Love\\", it immediately became a massive hit, debuting at #1 on the Hot 100 chart and remaining there for 8 weeks. \\"One Sweet Day\\", a collabo with Boyz II Men, was released as the second single and topped the singles chart for a record-breaking 16 weeks, in addition to debuting at #1. Third single, \\"Always Be My Baby\\" is an R&B jam Mariah co-produced with Jermaine Dupri. It debuted at #2 where it stayed weeks before taking over the pole poisition in May 1996. It stayed there for 2 weeks but eventually became the biggest airplay hit of the year. \\"Forever\\", the fourth single, was only released to radio in the US and managed a respectable position on the airplay chart. \\"Daydream\\" was a huge success all over the globe, with sales topping 23 million copies and acheiving platinum status in nearly 30 countries. 1996 undoubtedly belonged to Mariah. She also received the World Music Award for 'Best-Selling Female Artist' of the year and was nominated for 6 Grammy awards. It is Mariah's second most successful album ever.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Starts out way up there and gets better and better with every listen -- my favorite Dylan record since &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; (not to slight the stellar &quot;Time Out of Mind,&quot; but I think I give this new one a slight edge...). It's a category-by-itself record that demands to be played over and over again... Brava!
B000002BQK|5.0|Back in 1997, many thought how could Mariah overdo herself after a masterpiece like &quot;Daydream&quot;. Well, Mariah proved them wrong!<BR>&quot;Butterfly&quot; became an instant success. The first single, &quot;Honey&quot;, entered the charts at #1 and by doing so allowed the album do the same as well. To date, the album is certified 5X Platinum in the US and sold 15 million copies worldwide according to Sony.<br />1. Honey - the usual jumpy song which makes it as the   first    single off the album. It has very good lyrics, catchy music and amazing overall. <br />2. Butterfly - this is Mariah's signature track, although it was never really commercially released. It actually tells the relationships between Mariah &amp; Tommy Mottola, from whom she'd just divorced. One of the best tracks on the album.<br />3. My All - the music and lyrics are so romantic it's amazing!<BR>Right from the first guitar notes the song catches your ear.<BR>Another #1 song for Mariah!<br />4. The Roof - I read so many reviews hailing this track to be the best on &quot;Butterfly&quot; but it really never caught me. The strange vocals of Mariah annoy me the most. But still, it has great music and the lyrics are good too.<br />5. Fourth Of July - even before I was listening to this song, I knew it was going to be a romantic one. I really like it and the music is terrific.<br />6. Breakdown - this is one of the best lyrically songs ever written by Mariah. It's very hip-hop and one of the best tracks on the album. <br />7. Babydoll - another hip-hop track. It's really good, though not as good as &quot;Breakdown&quot;. Still, I love listening to it.<br />8. Close My Eyes - the chorus is very cool and yet another personal Mariah track.<br />9. Whenever You Call - the best ballad on the album. Better than &quot;Butterfly&quot;, better than &quot;My All&quot;. It's so well written and the music is amazing. The verses and chorus are just stunning!<BR>You won't believe how addicting this song is.<br />10. Fly Away - I really like Mariah's interludes. And though it's not as good as &quot;Daydream Interlude&quot;, it is still better than other regular tracks Mariah has done.<br />11. The Beautiful Ones - as everyone already knows, it's a cover of the Prince song. I love this duet between Mariah and Dru Hill and though the song is a little bit long, it's very good.<br />12. Outside - my favourite song. Though many may not rank it as the best on the album, I find the music and lyrics to be the best Mariah did on &quot;Butterfly&quot;. <br />&quot;Butterfly&quot; is undesribable, and a must have. Mariah's moving to RnB is just getting better and better.
B00005R26U|5.0|I spent months waiting for this DVD, and it was worth it. An exciting performance throughout: great rock'n'roll music from one of the most important songwriters of our time, played with heart and soul, and a strong sense of community between band and audience. <br />Flawless video throughout, and an audio mix that puts you right there in the Madison Square Garden crowd. (No, it didn't strike me as bass-light.)Home theater buffs should definitely check this one out. <br />The E Street Band members' bland comments to Bob Costa in the New York City Serenade interviews are the only - albeit minor -disappointment. Springsteen's remarks merely rehash what he said to the media at the time of the CD release, and the rest basically say only that it was wonderful to play concerts together again. I would have liked to be pleasantly surprised by some new insights. <br />I've heard complaints about how the producers had failed to do the right thing, i.e. simply point cameras at the stage for three hours. Come on, where's the art in that?<BR> <BR>Or that a killer performance of this song or that was excluded. This is supposed to be a distillation of the tour, not a mere transcription of its last gig; some things would necessarily have to be left out. <br />Besides, since many of us Boss fanatics love arguing over his best songs/performances, getting to air our feelings about inclusions and exclusions is probably part of the value anyway.
0385505833|5.0|I'm not a Grisham fan, but my husband is and so &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; made it's way into our home library. Out of boredom and looking for something to read that would put me in the holiday spirit, I opened the book to the first page. Instantly, I knew that I loved the characters. You knew them...they're the neighbors who comply with all that is expected - involved in their child's life, baby-boomers who thought life would deliver more and then, just when their only child leaves the nest, they discover that they can still make an attempt to have a life...one that is all about them. And so, with travel broucure in hand, they plot a trip to the tropics and use the money that they'll save by &quot;skipping Christmas.&quot; And what a quick and delightful read. I like Grisham's style, and the way he just says it, rather than trying to dazzel the reader with artsy wording that impress only an editor now and again. Thank you Grisham and I can't wait for the movie (I just know that there will be one.)<br />Happy Holidays.<br />Fern
B00003CXB2|5.0|Simply the best of the best - enough said.  All that needs to be said.  Don't watch this at your peril.
0385505833|5.0|Another great book by Grisham. Not his usual lawyer style, but just as good. I couldn't put it down, finished it in one night. Some great laughs.
6305841861|5.0|This is Amazing, It has some widly hilarious slapstik, but other then that the movie is quite frightening. some people say this is a remake, it isnt, it sums up the first movie with about 20 minutes but the rest is all new. this is the best movie in the trilogy and i usually watch it every 2 weeks or so, this movie is a must for any cult/horror fans!
B00005LOUP|2.0|I know what you're thinking: Jim Carrey was a sure-fire hit to play the antagonist-turned-protagonist in the live-action remake of &quot;Dr Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas.&quot; And why not? His sheer whimsy and comical delight have proven him a master at tickling our fancy. In addition to this casting choice, the project also includes Ron Howard, director of the the winning &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and the child fantasy film &quot;Willow,&quot; which has become a classic hit. <br />Carrey throws everything he has into his performance as the famed Grinch, and Howard creates a film that is visually stunning in its production design and special effects. With a terrific supporting cast and an atmosphere of glee, one would think that this would be the perfect answer to our thirst for holiday entertainment. But in the end, does this reenvisioning live up to the standards set by its predecessor? My answer is a wholehearted no. <br />The film centers around the classic Dr. Seuss book, in which the Grinch becomes so consumed with hatred for all things cheery that he decides to steal Christmas from the Whos, who live in the small town of Whoville below his perch on Mt. Crumpit. Screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman add their own touches to the story, including the reason for which the Grinch despises Christmas, which centers around an attraction to a sultry Who played by Christine Baranski. There's really no imagination to this plot point: it's merely there for the sake of stretching the story to feature length. Impish Cindy Lou Who is also given more screen time, searching for the true meaning of Christmas as we are searching for the joy in this weak material. <br />Perhaps the biggest folly of this remake is its commercialized feel. The book, as well as the animated feature, is embodied with a message of the true meaning of Christmas, which can be found in the fellowship of friends and family making merry together. Here, the Whos have become obsessed with purchasing gifts and trappings, and even a lights competition between two Whoville residents. This is in complete contrast to the source material, making this version all the more shallow and detached. <br />In the movie's favor is its glorious wallow in visual excess. The creation of the wintery wonderland of Whoville is absolutely stunning, from the colorful sets and costumes, to the looming peak of Mt. Crumpit itself, which is constantly surrounded by swirling clouds and billowing winds. Of course, there is never a moment where our doubt is shaken by a believable effect, but that only serves to add to the storybook quality of its appearance. I can only think of one other movie as visually impressive, that being Tim Burton's &quot;Sleepy Hollow.&quot;<br />The Grinch himself is equally impressive, boasting Carrey in a wonderful costume that brings to life the character we love to hate. Matching his make-up with in-jokes and humor, Carrey employs a wit that followers will lovingly adore. <br />And yet, this is one of the most cheerless films I've seen in a long time, a complete rip-off of something that has come to mean so much to lovers of the Christmas season. It's a given that children will fall in love with the film: the magnificent production design is dazzling and exuberant, if not mesmerizing. Some adults may find comfort in their children's enjoyment, though I myself was unmoved by this attempt to recreate something that, in my opinion, was better left untouched.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I was very hesitant to buy this record because of what the crossover into the US market means for most artists. In a market where, everything is OVERPRODUCED and OVERSTYLIZED to the point that talent has been replaced with marketing research, quality (other than that of music engineeringers) is not required. I felt really bad the first time I heard Whenerver, Wherever (..then I saw the video), Shakira had been replaced with a &quot;market-friendly&quot; version, a sex goddess almost the size of the mountains in the background, singing a song that at best is just a catchy toon.  <br />Then I bought the cd... I was fairly pleased to see that despite the obvious preassure on her shoulders to make a comercial record, Laundry Service is for the most part a Shakira record with a budget. The lyrics are excellent, never mind it is the first time she writes in english, and altough they still are not up to her spanish standards it is well on her way. My favorite is Poem to a Horse.<br />All in all an excellent record. Buy it.
0385505833|5.0|Just to begin, I must say that I am a fan of Christmas and all the hassles that are associated with it.  However, I can sympathize with the point of view that Grisham tries to take.  Although Christmas time is ultimately a pleasent time of year, to achieve the serentity on Christmas Day, people must endure the situations that occur in this book.<br />Grisham's book offers the reader a chance to imagine a clear picture of what things could be like without Christmas.  Although, some of the situations are over dramatized, in all I feel this book captured how some people might feel if a neighbor was not celebrating Christmas.  The chance of finding people that share the same thoughts as those in the book seems remote, but hey, we are all different.<br />Overall, I felt this book was enjoyable for those that craved a different type of writing from John Grisham.<br />One thing I would like to add, for those who have read the book, it seems the Kranks exerted more effort trying to skip Christmas than actually celebrating Christmas.
B00005RIKD|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stings, but I had doubts of paying for the cd, but after listening to the first couple of tracks, I was so glad I decided to buy. This Cd is the perfect gift for those who need some sensual music during the dinner. 'Bring on the night' was very much the best investment on a cd yet, unlike Michael Jacksons Invincible, which had too much mush and not enough cool pop. If you love somebody , set them free is my personal favorite, makes me feel like I'm at a southern church, which is cool. Sting needs to do a gospel cd, that would definately rock. As long as Sting keeps pumping out the tunes, I am definately ready to buy!
B00003CX5P|1.0|Lets face it, if this film had not been a StarWArs movie. It would not have filled up the seats more than once. And no one in their right mind would have bought it!!!<BR>All the elements composing a movie are missing.<BR>This was made so that the bank account of mr.Lucas would become larger. Lets just hope that the last two are not of the same hopeless quality.
B000001ZS3|5.0|They played this album before the showing of The Empire Strikes Back the first time I saw it.  I ran all over the theater trying to find someone who could tell me what the music was.  I've had the album ever since, but when I sold my large stereo system and bought a smaller no turntable one I lost the ability to listen to it.  I finally got myself together and Amazon had it.  I love this and it's not the type of music I usually listen to.
B00005OWIU|4.0|I really enjoy this score. I find it to be magical and wonderful to listen to. I highly recommend this to any fans of John Williams, Harry Potter, and of scores that are just a joy to relax to. The only complaint that I have is that this is no where near a complete score. As anyone who has seen the movie knows, there are several key scenes (Dark forest, troll attack) that are missing and that is too bad. I hope that one day they release an longer version, but for now, this will do nicely!
0871137380|4.0|Bowden does a first-class job of bringing the reader into the action and reasoning (and lack of)for why were there.  He shows the great aspects of US fighting prowess, as well as the inexcusably bad - without being too opinionated.  When &quot;Go-Team!&quot;-type hype adds flavor to GI's perspective - he uses it to give the reader insight into attitudes: a good reason to do so..  Also shows the intelligence misses that cost lives needlessly.  Importantly, he conveys the picture the Somalis had of the action with first-hand accounts. It's as insightful as &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; - check it out.
B000003MZU|5.0|Like another glowing album of Guerra's - &quot;Arieto&quot; - &quot;Batacha Rosa&quot; is a slice of pure genius from the Dominican Republic's Simon-Garfunkle-Lennon-McCartney singer-songwriter extraordinaire.  A brilliant stylist, composer and vocalist, Guerra delivers some of his most passionate tracks and warmest moments on record, including the incandescent &quot;Burbujas De Amor&quot; - a story about fish in love that transcends its humor to become a soaring love song, and &quot;Como Abeja Al Panal&quot; - a song about unrequited passions with an unforgettable hook.  At once thought-provoking and melodious, &quot;Batacha Rosa&quot; is yet another chapter in this brilliant stylists' repertoire, and perhaps overall, his very best album.  As with other Guerra 440 albums, this is a must have collection of songs that will touch your heart, warm your soul, and deliver countless pleasures.
B000002A46|5.0|X'mas is a wonderful holiday.  It creates a feeling of warmth all around the world.  Mariah is a wonderful singer.  We can hear the emotions in her voice.  This really is an excellent X'mas album from Mariah.  It captures the atmosphere of X'mas.  Mariah sounds INCREDIBLE here.  Listen to the popular X'mas hit &quot;All I Want For X'mas Is You,&quot; this is not a traditional X'mas song--it's a song that Mariah wrote, and it's amazing.  Also listen to the best version, ever, in the world, of &quot;O Holy Night.&quot;  As well as a new song &quot;Miss You Most At X'mas Time&quot;--this is really a touching song.  I just can't get enough of it.  And another wonderful thing about this album is that you can listen to it ANYTIME, not just at X'mas time like most other X'mas albums.  In short, this really is worth collecting.
B000053VJI|5.0|I've called this the Best Latin Album for non-Latin listeners, and the reasons for this are many.  Here, on one disc, are the songs that put this legendary artist on the map.  Guerra's magic stems from his ability - unique in today's predictable Latin sound - to combine thoughtful lyrics with melodies that remain in the mind and in the heart.  From his paean to love, &quot;Burbujas de Amor&quot; (a love song between two fish - no kidding) to the overwhelming &quot;Ojala Que Llueva Cafe en el Campo&quot; to &quot;La Billirubina&quot; Guerra proves why he's Latin Music's equivalent of Frank Sinatra.  A vocal stylist who is peerless, the man can sing his heart out with dizzying effect.  &quot;Grandes Exitos&quot; is certainly a terrific addition to ANY music lover's collection.  Even if you can't understand the words, you'll be dancing in the aisles.  Pure genius.
6305364613|5.0|William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet is one of my favorite movies of all time.  This colorful, screaming version of Shakespeare's classic play will explode onto your screen!<br />The art direction is excellent.  This movie catches the eye with bright colors and appealing sets.  The script is very well-adapted to modern times.  Harold Pirreneau (Mercutio) and Pete Postlethwaite (Friar Laurence) are both magnificent in this film, which is probably due to their prior acting experiences with Shakespeare's work.  The music is haunting and blends very well  with the script.  Above all, the cinematography is beautifully done, making the movie a masterpiece of film art.<br />This wonderful movie will captivate you and stir your emotions.  It really is a great film and should not be missed.  Buy or rent it today!
B00003CWN3|4.0|&quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot; is one of those movies that can either leave you miserable and exhausted so that all you want to do is cry, or inspired and energized to go back out into the world and make a difference.  In both cases, it succeeds at being a gritty, realistic indictment on a society that places the external and materialistic aspects of life above the inner spirit we all have within us.  In doing so, it exposes the raw truth about a culture that has grown to hate, isnpired in part by the horrors we witness both at home, and at the movies.  <br />Hilary Swank is luminous in an Oscar winning performance that not only transcends gender but also identity.  Her chilling Brandon Teena, raped, abused, taunted and despised for celebrating his own individuality and inner-beingness, is unforgettable. Chole Sivegny as the girl he charms with swagger and vulnerability, lends realism to an unflattering role that in someone else's hands could have been laughable.  These star-crossed, ill-fated lovers ooze true love, far more than most of today's movie duos.  <br />As successful as the actors are in realizing their real life counterparts, the story, and its plot elements - all based on actual events - never fully do it justice.  At times you feel you're watching a terrific documentary, and then you're transported to a Lifetime-television-for-women-movie-of-the-week.  And if it's a terrific documentary you desire, rent or own the actual &quot;Brandon Teena Story&quot; which features an eerie soundtrack of the real Teena Brandon answering a detective's questions.  <br />The magic of this film is in the message, and ultimately, &quot;Boys DOn't Cry&quot; succeeds as an expose on the hatred our society has imparted on those who are different, or outside the norm.  In doing so, it serves as a much needed testament for embracing our differences, celebrating our unique characteristics, and caring less about what others think of us and more about how we can change the world.  <br />Brandon Teena was no martyr, and certainly not a saint.  But, in his short life, he made a difference by being who he was, and by allowing us a glimpse inside a full, rich heart.  This film accomplishes many things on many levels, but nothing startles as much as realizing that we all have our secrets, longings, and passions though few of us ever have the courage to make them our reality, like Brandon Teena briefly did.  Given the unprecedented events of September 11th and its aftermath, Brandon served notice years ago that society's hatreds had gone too far.  As a document of life before 9-11, this is a MUST-HAVE film.
B00003CX5P|5.0|With 3 previous, it is hard to be fresh and this is fresh stuff.  You have to put on your Star Wars brain to appreciate the Lucas genius in this flick.  This film is a cult type favorite and if you are a true blue on the first three, you should be pleased with this film, unless you are some sort of pompous [...], thinking your opinion really matters.  The proof is in the bucks and the Lucas concept continues to sell.  [...]
B00001U0DP|5.0|I was shipped this by accident from a DVD club, and rather than send it back, kept it.  I had never heard of it, but saw all the awards that it won and figured that it may be worth while.  It sat on our shelf for a while until my wife and I finally broke down and watched it.  I must say that we were both blown away.  We watched it with the English subtitles (the first movie I've ever watched completely in subs) and I must say it was very easy to follow.  The movie itself was in my opinion GREAT.  I know a lot of people are upset at the comedic portrayal of the Holocaust, but I believe that the purpose of this movie was not to make the Holocaust something to laugh at.  The movie starting off funny and light and then turning to a very heavy topic was briliant.  It showcased the title well... LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL.  The ending of the movie really makes you realize how precious life really is, and seeing how Benigni's character truely treasures his family is very warming.<br />For me, a person who is very much a slapstick comedy type person (ie. Mel Brooks, Kevin Smith, and Monty Python stuff) and doesn't usually digest drama's or moral movies too often, it was very surprising the effect this movie had on me.<br />Well worth the money!
B00004UEDR|4.0|This film shows what it is like to have a alcohol problem. Bullock plays an alcoholic that crashes her sister's wedding and has an accident that lands her in a rehab center. She goes through withdrawal and ends up finding a friend or two at the rehab center. Her boyfriend is also a alcoholic and does not understand her when she turns her life around. When she finally gets out she ends up helping a friend in the real world.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this.  It was like an exaggerated, british, more in debt, story of my life!  I identified with the main character like I did with Bridget Jones!  The best part was probably the outlandish plans she convinces herself will work to get herself out of debt.  Very amusing!  Great for a light read.
B00005RFAI|4.0|I have to say I did not like Pinks debut album. She came off as a bitter version of Destinys Child so I was hesitant to buy this album. I loved it! Pink has gone into a completely different direction and has mixed all kinds of music. Pop, Jazz, Rock, Alternative, and Disco to create one of the most diverse albums this year. Pink sounds terrific and proves she can sing any type of music. The vocals and lyrics come from her heart which was missing from her latest album. The album has a few depressing songs but for the most part an amazing album from who I thought would be just another pop/r&amp;b diva releasing songs that all sound the same. Pink deserves alot of credit for going in a completely different direction.
B00003CY0U|2.0|This is a movie made for the chase scene crowd.  It contains<BR>gratuitous sex and is just plain dumb.  Not for a thinking<BR>person.
B00005JKHP|1.0|I was very upset That some of the dialog was cut from the directors edition and also the computers voice in the background.  I thought it made it sound more like what life really would be like on a starship.  I wish they would just release a copy of the original cut of the movie.  Most of the rework on this really didn't make much of a difference.  I guess I'll be forced to buy a foriegn VCD copy in order to get the original cut.  Not worth the wait or the hype.
0393312836|5.0|After reading the many reviews that have been posted here, I'm afraid mine will not be as eloquent, nor will it be a long and detailed description of the book. However, I might be able to express the importance of this book, and perhaps you'll even want to read it when you've finished my review.<br />I may have started out reading A Clockwork Orange because my friend told me how good it was. And then I continued to read it because it was engaging, disturbing, and thought provoking. Even though the book was written over 30 years ago, I believe it is still as powerful today as it was back then; perhaps even more so. Alex, the protagonist, is almost innocently committing violent crimes with his friends; for he isn't -trying- to be bad, he just is. He likes violence, and that's the way he is.<br />When Alex's friends gang up on him and leave him to be arrested by the police, Alex is sentenced to 14 years in prison. But then the opportunity to change presents itself to Alex, and he can't help but take the offer. Without ruining the story as so many previous reviewers have already done, I can say that when everything is said and done, important questions arise: is being good truly good if it is not by choice? Is it good to be bad, if that is what one chooses?<br />The book first came out in the 60s, and the American version lacked the last and 21st chapter from the original story. When it was republished, the book had the 21st chapter. Depending on which copy you read, with the last chapter or without it, the book will have an entirely different feel to it. The old copy represents the horrible realization that bad minds are always bad; the newer version leaves the reader with hope. Hope for Alex, and hope for oneself. Change is possible, the book says, no matter what sort of person you are.<br />A Clockwork Orange is truly a great work, one that will appeal to people for different reasons; and affect them in completely different ways. But it will affect them.
0385505833|3.0|I enjoy John Grisham's previous work and also enjoy warmhearted Christmas stories around the holidays.  Since this fit both criteria I dove into reading it the day after Thanksgiving and finished it only a few days later.<br />I should probably start with what is good and there is a lot to say here.  The story grabbed me right away, the characters and the situations as they developed had me laughing out loud and for that alone I would recommend this book.<br />Without giving the end away, while reading one could begin to predict what a &quot;typical&quot; (meaning average) Christmas-type ending was in store, but I hoped for something a little more... I'm not sure what... but from this author I wanted something above average.  Unfortunatly the payoff, complete, warm and nice as it was, didn't have enough payoff for what the rest of the book had to offer.<br />Because of the average outcome I took this down from five stars to three but still recommend it heartily.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This is a CD to listen to when you're driving or cleaning- it's got good vacuuming beats.  Even the 'sadder' songs make you feel chirpy, and however darn hard you try not to join in at least some part of your anatomy will feel a need to tap or nod along.  I've tested this theory on a 'serious muso' who despises pop, and even he couldn't resist the need to nod along.<br />'Lucky' is the best track, nice beat, good happy pop that doesn't require immense concentration to understand.  Good Stuff.
B00005RDCA|5.0|with ties to the great society, airplane  was a very popular band<BR>of the 60s and early 70s morphed several times later. somebody to <BR>love , white rabbit, big hits. nice acoustic and vocals by marty <BR>balin, jormas quitar was nice and demonstrated his talents in hot <BR>tuna with the bassist , they are still playing. i enjoy this at <BR>any time ,
0385505833|5.0|What a way to start off the Holiday Season! I laughed till I cried!! Luther, the main character, is now my husband's hero. We do not put colorful lights on the outside of our home, just greens.  But this year we will be putting Frosty on the roof,  in honor of Luther and what happens when you skip Christmas. This is by far the best holiday book I have ever read!  It's a quick read, one long afternoon. And it started our Christmas season on the right foot for a change!
B00000DHR0|5.0|I love Christmas music, but get frustrated by the fact most albums have the same songs.  While this album has some all-too-familiar titles, they're expertly performed.  The rest of the album is either new tunes or non-Christmas music which should be Christmas music (e.g. Brahm's Lullaby).  Dion's performance of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; is the best of any of the Christmas CDs I own, and I own lots of them (and O Holy Night is my favorite Christmas hymn).  This CD has a light jazzy feel.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004Z459|5.0|i think linkin park was a excellent album number 08 in the end.It was the best song of the lot. I cant wait until the next album is released. you readers should definetly get this album
6300216403|4.0|This film gives us wonderful visuals in a way that could only have been done at (or after) this time in black and white. When Black and white was the only option, the film stock and processing techniques were not so sophisticated as they are here and the contrasts would not have been so subtle. As it is, Peter Bogdanovich's decision to shoot in monochrome is vindicated. Laszlo Kovacs deserved an academy award for his cinematography, but was not nominated.<br />The story is one of an adopted father and daughter, seen from the point of view of the girl most of the time. There are some very funny moments, with Ryan O'Neal's con-man selling a bootlegger his own whisky, but also some nasty bits, like when the bootlegger catches him. Ryan's daughter Tatum plays the orphan he takes with him for the ride, and she plays this well, despite the script giving her lines that seem a little too adult from a nine year-old. Madelaine Kahn gives a well-observed and very amusing performance as a tart. Well-selected period music combined with a stunning array of costumes give this an authentic, depression era feel.
B00005OM4N|4.0|It's more grown up than her other 2 albums, but still happy pop none the less.  If you love Britney and happy pop albums then buy it, but if you were appalled by Brit's 'I can't get no satisfaction' cover then don't. And why are you even looking at this page ?<BR>All in all it's more good happy pop ! I can't think of anything bad to say about it, for her age she has great skill, as well as natural ability.
6305949972|5.0|The Best and MY Favorite Disney, it tells abut my 2 best holidays Halloween &amp; Christmas I give this movie (The BEST Disney movie!). So I give this 5 stars!!
0385505833|5.0|Keeping up to Grisham's standards of a good read without being too wordy, this is a perfect read before you head out to the mall shopping.  I enjoyed the light hearted look at our Christmas traditions and the subtle message of the real meaning of Christmas - not in your face like is often seen.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|this album has matched my expectations set by Blonde on Blonde, Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61, Blood on the Tracks, and Time Out Of Mind.  it not only contains the haunting a poetic lyrics, (Mississippi, Highwater, Suger Baby) but as well contains humerous a light harded lines that make even a dying man laugh.  Summer Days, &quot;Driving In flats in a cadilac car, the girls all say your a worn out star&quot; or Bye and Byes's &quot;sitting on my watch, so i can be on time&quot; and even Po' Boys knock knock joke.  this is incredably different from Time Out of Mind, this doesn't seem like a dying man's last words, but a man who is rejuvinated in creativity.  and although at 60 is still able to be the most creative and artistic musician we have today.
B000002UQJ|5.0|This is a fantastic album in which the former Beatle shows his full talent<br />Far better than the drivel he collaborated on with Michael Jackson with in the mid 1980's<br />A lot of the old Beatles style shines strongly through the album<br />My personal favourites include the title track 'Off The Ground' - a fantastic feel-good piece , the protest against animal experimentation 'Looking For Changes' , the hit 'Hope of Deliverance' ,the contemplative 'Peace in The Neighbourhood' about simpler better times, the beautiful 'Golden Earth Girl' , 'The Lovers That Never Where' and 'Get Out Of My Way' which has strong elements of both Elvis Presley and The Rolling Stones. This album is a s magnificent and enjoyable as Paul McCartney's and The Beatles older memorable works
B00005OB0A|4.0|This is Kylie back on form as the world's best pop princess.  'I can't get you out of my head' is amazingly catchy, and it will stay in your mind for days.<br />However, great as it is I don't think it's anywhere as good as 'Light Years' which is the best pop album in years.<br />'Fever' is good proper Kylie doing what she does best. Love it.
B00004Z459|5.0|Theres many types of people in this world who are catergorized into many different groups.  I guess you can say im not in linkin parks group, but after listening to their music CD &quot;hybrid theory&quot; i dont know where i stand.  I was coming home one night after fighting with my exgirlfriend and my friend just started to blare some stuff, i was like what the heck is this, but when i started to listen i thought different. From the very first song i was sucked in.  I later bought the CD and never regreted it.  They play with so much talent its unbelievable.  Not only do they sing play guitar and drums, but they throw in a keyboarder who uses weird sounds that go right with the music.  I advise anyone who has any bad thoughts about linkin park to go out and listen to their music first, because i know i was the same until i got into touch with thier lyrics.
0060278234|5.0|Like its predecessor Sabriel, this book is great.  Lirael is a wonderful character - realistic, likeable, curious, intellectual, easy to empathesize with, yet strong and sensible.  Someone you'd like to hang out with.  Similiarly the rest of the cast shines; I have trouble trying to point out a single poorly drawn character that's essential to the plot.  The story is satisfyingly full of mysteries and secrets and adventure - I literally could not stop turning the pages until I got to the end.  Even though the book does not finish the tasks set out for the good guys, the end is still climatic.  Like many of the other readers who've written reviews here, I too am waiting on tetherhooks for &quot;Abhorsen&quot;, the final book (or so I'm told) of this so far magnificently written trilogy.
0451191153|5.0|The best book i ever read was Atlas Shrugged.  I think that alot of people misunderstand the fountainhead.  People seem to get hung up on the fact that Rand's characters don't seem to be human or the idea of selfishness being a better virtue than selflessness.  Rand has never claimed that her characters were ment to be acurate representations of people.  They were meant to show her ideal man, they are to be ideals to look up to.  Her ideas about selfishness deal with a meaning much broader than the common definition especially in connection with greed.  I believe the reason she makes all of the characters who would be called selfish  the heros is because to her selfishness goes with integrity, not sacrificing yourself to the justifications of other people.  Her characters are people unto themselves who do not  feel that they owe anything to any one and that no one owes anything to them.
B00003CY0V|2.0|&quot;Swordfish&quot; was just a stupid movie.  The movie was just boring and you knew what was gonna happen.  It was trying really hard to be something, but it ended up being nothing but a Matrix wanna-be special effects movie.  It's just a waste of time.
B00005QEO2|2.0|For whom exactly is this double-disc set intended?  Is it a hits compilation for casual fans who don't want to delve into the albums?  Well, seeing as Geffen only owned the band during the second stage of their career, it couldn't be definitive, and the single-disc best-of &quot;Big Ones&quot; covered the Geffen years quite nicely already.  Is it a rarities collection?  There are quite a few b-sides and previously unreleased tunes here, but it's mostly re-packaged material from their Geffen albums.  Even the live tunes are straight from their recent live record, A Little South of Sanity.  So the hardcore fans will have to have it, even if their paying mostly for material they already own - and a few casual fans might pick it up confusing it for a greatest hits collection.  Still, it's little more than another contractual obligation of marginal value.
6304366078|5.0|If you are new to motorsports, and don't own this movie, buy it now or at least put it on your wish list. If you're a long time enthusiast but don't own this movie, what's wrong with you?<br />The cars and circuits may be dated but not since Grand Prix has there been an equivalent racing movie - not LeMans, not Winning, not Driven and certainly not Days Of Thunder. I am convinced that John Frankenheimer (French Connection, Ronin) is the ONLY director that can shoot racing/chase scenes properly. His passion for film making AND the sport oozes from this work.<br />I suggest the wide screen version so nothing is missed.
6305897786|3.0|I saw this film with a fellow movie afficionado in the theaters, Having never before seen a Roman Polanski fim before,(no not even rosemary's baby, so crucify me! :)  I couldn't wait to chomp on this one. The film clearly operates on a three act structure. As many of you readers already would have read chunks of the story, I won't repeat it here. The first act is really good but weak on some levels, glimpses are seen of a film director at his best with his creation. Some touches are brilliant and we can't wait to get more. This is where the thread starts unravelling a bit. The second act. The second act follows the first act the same way with excellent all round touches then going downhill. When the third act comes, With all that happens before the final minutes, this is a very good film which takes its time but when it was over. My first thought was &quot;Huh?&quot;<BR>Clearly Polanski put care and love into this as it was to be his comeback kid and maybe somewhere in his fascinating mind,he got lost in a maze somewhere but this was one of the biggest let downs I have had ever watching a movie. I immediately dismissed it as &quot;a piece of crock&quot; the ending just ruined it all. But i kept hearing two stories..one camp stating my views, and the other one proclaiming a film at its best.<BR>This intrigued me quite a bit, I certainly saw some magical touches with the music, the cinematography, sets and atmosphere which was very dominant and very classically executed shots but uh uh nope..bad movie.<BR>I thought to give it another chance and oh boy this one is quite a thinker or a puzzle,and dont get me wrong , I like smart movies but am still trying to get this one. I purchased the DVD for cheap and saw it again. Yup, same good stuff I saw before but the ending really made me think. I still havent come to a conclusion. I might be an idiot or a smarty for buying this one. But this film really has something going for it, Im very sure of it so you should give this one a chance, even if its a letdown, just be sure to put your thinking hat on and watch this one very very carefully. <BR>As for the DVD, this is one of the best video transfers I have ever seen, Artisan has done an excellent job. It has to be seen to be believed how the colors come out, no hints of grain or any scratches, the blacks are perfect and the hues are brilliant. Very little chroma key effects are seen in some scenes but these are few. The sound is your standard 5.1 dolby digital with an aggressive mix. no complaints there and the extras are neat..The commentary by Polanski is entertaining and oh for heaven sakes i wished he explained the end but no...the dude left it to us. maybe it makes movie watching more exciting he thought. :)<br />give this one a go..see what you think but dont dismiss it too easily like nearly everyone else did.
1878424319|4.0|This is a MUST read.  Buy three--keep one and give two away to good friends.  Everyone needs to read this.
0316779237|5.0|David Sedaris is probably one of the funniest writers writing today.  Out of all his books this one is the funniest, which is saying a lot.  He has the perfect balance to make everyday events hilarious using hyperbole and sarcasm without actually resorting to outright cruelty.  I cannot reccomend this book enough.
0880389052|5.0|I have heard about Drizzt Do'Urden, the dark elf ranger, from many sources over the internet.  Of course, so have many readers, as is obvious here.  After reading The Crystal Shard, I was hooked.  As Terry Brooks had said (not in these exact words), once you start reading, you do not want to stop until the book is done.  I have read the Icewind Dale Trilogy, and thought to start on the series that details the origins of Drizzt, the noble dark elf.<BR>This book is definitely a fine example of the cruel society of the drow, and it is very interesting to see such a wise and intelligent character as a young and naive one in this novel.  It is quite a contrast actually, but it does make sense.<BR>All fans of Drizzt NEED to read this novel sometime, and the others in the series as well, to see how he went from a drow warrior of an evil society to a noble ranger.  I would recommend this book, as well, to any who would like to see why R.A. Salvatore has such a famous character!
B00003CXCQ|3.0|The menus are flashy and creative...but to get from one area to another takes <br />f o r    <br />e v    <br />e r.  <br />This is frustrating to me.  I enjoy the DVD menu feature so I can JUMP to an area and on this DVD you can slowly meander to that area.  The Dopey Mine game is fun...once.  Then you realize that the alternative path is only different in 1 aspect and then you are bored.  The add-on bonus features in the Platinum Edition are cool and the archival info well worth it for a colllector. But for an impatient adult, and a toddler who does not understand the process the menu action is faulty.
0385484518|5.0|My boyfriend and I read this book together from beginning to end in one sitting. I enjoyed it as much as he did. It is a great gift for anyone- even yourself.
0380778556|5.0|***** awsome book!  I totally enjoyed it, couldn't put it down. I wish I could visit Manderley..had to buy Rebecca's tale as soon as I finished Rebecca. Maxim De Winter was waaay to good for Rebecca anyway!! Daphne Du Maurier is an excellant story teller..I am gonna read this one again someday Im sure..
B00005MP58|5.0|I read the reviews about poor quality but I went ahead and bought the DVD anyway.  I have the VHS and love it...never had a problem with darkness at all, and the DVD is even better, in fact some of the scenes in the Bennett's house are even brighter on the DVD and the colors in the homes of other characters stand out more.  The story itself is the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen. It is worth every penny.
B00005RFAI|1.0|Pink has gone the wrong way, just when everyone was getting used to a great white female RnB artist, all of a sudden she has tuned into some (if its your cup of tea) Rock/Pop girl. I guess its the lack of Babyface that might of caused this disruption, Pink why the F**k did you change!!
B00003CXXS|4.0|It`s 2 bad that this film holds the number III behind its name... Because it is the best. Inventive, full of good humour and good acting. A N D  special effects. It really should have been a sequel 2 the 93 blockbuster...  THE LOST WORLD? There`s not enough sand 2 bury than one...<br />Alessandro Nivola`s Billy is good, but his part should have been built up...
B00005U122|5.0|I saw Rog in Minneapolis and it was the best show that I've ever seen!  :O  Never having seen Pink Floyd live, in their videos, they seem to come across in a very impersonal way.  Especially playing stadiums and such.  The way Rog's band connected with the audience was phenominal.  I cannot really imagine seeing a better show than this, except for when the floyd was full and functioning...well touring anyways, pre 1981.
6303614493|5.0|I'm a big animation fan, so naturally I love to see live action movies based on cartoon characters. Also, back when this came out I was totally in love with Ricci. Maybe it seems odd to give this film five stars, but then you have to commend them for making a good big budget movie about Casper. That had to be tricky. It's simple in some ways, I mean, you have the usual, greedy crook villain character that's in so many live-action cartoon movies, and you have the usual silly lines and some bad acting here and there, but there are so many good things about this movie too. The effects are great, as well as the music and the Haunted House. The voices are also excellent. Plus, there were a lot of cool cameos, which were really the best parts of the movie. Especially Dan Aykroyd in a very brief scene as Ghostbuster Ray Stantz. It was a little weird when we see Casper in the flesh at the end, looking older and acting smoother than he sounds and appears as a ghost. I also am not a big fan of Kat's mom at the end, but whatever. There are little bothers here and there, but it is still an excellent movie and definitely a fave. And definitely one of Ricci's best. I'll leave you with a synopsis, in case you haven't seen the film.<BR>    Casper is a friendly ghost who lives in an old mansion with his three rude, even abusive uncles. It's all very much a take on Cinderella. A mean, greedy woman named Carrigan has recently inherited the mansion and believes there is a treasure hidden in it, so she hires Dr. James Harvey to get rid of the ghosts so she can do a thorough search. The doc has a daughter named Kat, played by Christina Ricci, who Casper develops a crush on and makes friends with. The Doc tries to talk the ghosts into moving out, and Kat plans a big Halloween party, while Carrigan causes trouble. Various characters die, become ghosts, and even come back to life through the course of the film, leading up to thwarting the bad guys and having a very Cinderella-like ending. Very cute for the most part, and definitely the best Casper movie out there. Well worth getting a DVD of, so please, somebody, make one okay?!!!
0812550706|5.0|And yet another review for this incredible book. It probably doesn't add anything but I just have to support the book any way I can.<br />Ender's Game is one of my most favourite SF books. The story about Ender the Destroyer of Worlds is mighty imaginative and a whole lot of fun to read. For some reason it's a great feel-good book while the story is pretty black. It's about a young boy who gets recruited for a school specialized in creating military geniuses to defeat the evil alien race that attacked the earth in the past. Most of the book plays inside the school and later you'll see Ender play the part he was trained for. I am not sure why the book appeals to me the way it does. It probably has something to do with the character of Ender, the underdog who survives and outsmarts his tormentors. Enders Game was one of the first SF books I have read and I have been addicted ever since. Sometimes I still speed read through the book and it's still nice. The only problem with Ender's Game is that is so good that I don't dare to read the follow-ups. For me the story is complete. It can only get worse. I really envy those who haven't read this book yet.
B00005QIPH|5.0|After hearing this album for the first time I was blown away. Failing to conform with the qualities that define mainstream rock is what makes this music so apealing. Although I have not heard any of these songs on the radio I was familiar with a couple of them through a friend. That was the main reason that I bought the album. Expecting the rest of the CD to be mostly filler music I was excited when song after song was just incredible. The music seems to flow from one song to another. This is one of my all time favorite albums and it is a great buy for anyone who is looking for something different.
B00000720W|1.0|\\"Deathcrush\\" is Mayhem's worst album and I dare to say it. It goes only 17 minutes and has two stupid track \\"Sylvester Anfang\\" and \\"Wierd Manheim\\". The other five tracks are real raw black metal songs, but due to the bad production, you almost hear nothing. <br />I highly advise you to stay away from \\"Deathcrush\\". It'll be a disappointment. If you want to listen to \\"Necrolust\\", \\"Chainsaw (...)\\", \\"Deathcrush\\", you should get \\"Live In Leipzig\\" live album, or numerous Mayhem bootlegs. But not this album!
B00005MG2Y|5.0|Hybrid theory by Linkin park is honestly the best album i have ever listend to.It has a blend of rock, industrial, hip hop, metal and proberbly lots more, all of which make linkin park the best band in the world.<BR>P.s they're all really hot too!
B000000OEI|3.0|The best I can say about the film score for Crimson Tide is that it is a mixed bag.  I'll start with the good.  Crimson Tide, without a doubt, has one of the greatest themes I've ever heard in a film.  What makes it an even greater achievement is that it is written for a high adrenaline action film, a genre that all too frequently comes complete with superfluous noise passed off as a score.  Moreover, the final track on the album, Roll Tide, is seven of the greatest minutes in film score history, complete with a rousing rendition of Eternal Father Strong to Save.  If there is one thing that Hans Zimmer's career has allowed him to be recognized for, it is his bombast and stirring action scores; Crimson Tide just happens to be the quintessential Zimmer score.<br />But, alas, some bad yields to the good.  As mentioned before, Roll Tide is seven of the greatest minutes in film score history, but if you've heard those seven minutes, then the rest of the score is somewhat negligible.  Everything else is redundant background synthesizers, mundane repetitions of the admittedly beautiful theme (though with little development), and intermitent forays into the strident and pounding brass that has come to be associated with Zimmer and his protégés.  Moreover, to make matters worse, the CD is a lopsided endeavor that does more to frustrate than to please.  With five tracks that range from two minutes to twenty-three minutes, there is little consistency.  Fortunately, the best track is a modest (?) seven minutes, but that doesn't negate the hindrance of the rest of the score.<br />So, what conclusions can I make claim to in regards to this score?  Well...The CD is a poorly constructed and bothersome attempt for Zimmer to display the &quot;suites&quot; of which he is so fond, but which the consumer will more often than not find impractical.  The underscore can be boring at times but can shine at others with a truly magnificent theme that exceeds most action scores ever created;but--the BIG but--this theme is better expressed and more comprehensive in the concluding track which accurately represents all of the interesting material from the score.  In short, there can be no better recommendation to the consumer than to download an MP3 of the track Roll Tide, and save his money for another purchase. That one track will satisfy you better than the whole CD; but if worst comes to worst, I'm almost willing to admit that the one track IS worth the price of the album.  The decision, however, is yours.
B00005MP58|5.0|I confess, I hate series. I usually find them sadly lacking compared to (good) movies. Well, not this time. This series surpasses everything you have ever seen on TV and probably ever will see! Regardless of the genre. Most movies (I'm talking good historical films) also pale in comparison. This is an incredible piece. Not only is it sublimely acted (at all levels since there isn't a single bad actor, but particularly Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle who are both extremely convincing), but the costumes, the music, the exteriors and set designs are absolutely perfect. The sharp eye will notice a few (but oh so minor) technical errors, but they take nothing from the enjoyment. Beware though, it is addictive! You may need your Darcy/Lizzy daily fix afterwards. And you'll love every minute of it I promise!
B000002O4S|3.0|As much as I love the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; series (they are my favorite movies of all time), I can't help but feel somewhat disappointed with this CD.  I bought it expecting there would be some great film scores from the movie, but alas, that is not the case.<br />Not that what the CD offers isn't fine.  This soundtrack does have the theme to the movie which is on Track 3 (a short version) and Track 6 (the long version).  This is, in my opinion, Alan Silvestri's best work of all time.  I sooooo want to play this score in our concert band, but I don't think it's ever going to happen.<br />Huey Lewis and the News were on top of the world when this movie came out, so their two songs in &quot;The Power of Love&quot; (Track 1) and &quot;Back in Time&quot;  (Track 5) are featured on this CD.  Lewis even makes a cameo appearance in the film, playing the part of someone who doesn't like Marty McFly's loud music.<br />My other favorite tracks, besides Tracks 3 and 6, are Tracks 9 and 10.  Track 9 (&quot;Earth Angel&quot;) is a memorable song that everyone who has seen the movie remembers.  Who can forget that heart-pounding scene from the movie where Marty is about to be erased from existence?  And Track 10 (&quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;) is an awesome song that is frequently played on my CD player.  Unlike the movie version, however, this track plays the song in full.  It doesn't cut into Marty doing his &quot;rock'n'roll thing&quot; in the middle of the song and creeping everyone out who attended the dance.  Which is another classic scene from the movie, by the way.<br />In short, this soundtrack is okay.  I am glad that I have it, since it rounds out the four music disks in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; series, but I'm disappointed that so many of the musical score from the film was omitted from this CD.  I don't know why we had to wait until the &quot;Back to the Future Trilogy&quot; CD came out to finally get the music from the first movie.<br />If you're a huge fan of this series, this CD will be a must.

B0000508U6|5.0|PARACHUTES is an album that shines from the first note to the last, with 10 moody and brilliant songs.  The album opens with the wistful and brief (but catchy) DON'T PANIC that sets the melancholy tone present in many songs.  SHIVER is one of the standout tracks, with plent of alt rock airplay this fall - more upbeat without sacrificing any of the feeling an intensity of the lyrics.  SPIES and SPARKS slow things down and remind me of some of the wonderful, lenghty, dreamy Floyd tunes of the 70s - outstanding, flowing music that creates a mellow mood.  YELLOW was the first release off the album and an outstanding track, where the vocals hit their high ranges amidst a driving guitar beat.  TROUBLE is also a masterpiece with more urgency, and the album ultimately ends with two &quot;conclusion&quot; tracks - WE NEVER CHANGE and EVERYTHING'S NOT LOST, alternating, in order, pessimism and optimism in the outlook.  To me, PARACHUTES is a standout album in an era of forulaic &quot;alternative&quot; rock (i.e., name your band with a number and play loud, catchy guitar chords).  This album serves up some real FEELING - in vocals, in lyrics, and in instrumentation -  and delivers consistently, song after song, to leave you with an entire ALBUM of great music.
B00000AFDW|3.0|This album was a tad on the disappointing side for me! Paul<br />Stanley's songs, with the exception of DREAMING, are his worst in<br />many a KISS album and that's putting it nicely! The lyrics are<br />probably the album's weakest point. I really didn't want to hear<br />KISS sing about themselves and the anthems here are along the<br />lines of the pathetic anthems JUDAS PRIEST used to write when<br />they were turning into cartoon characters! Also, I could've done<br />without the wimpy ballad I'VE FINALLY FOUND MY WAY.<br /> There are some great songs here, actually two; and one of them<br />is Ace Frehley's tune INTO THE VOID. To me, this is the only<br />song here that sounds like the old KISS; it's the only song that<br />really recaptures their old rock-n-roll spirit and attitude.<br />Supposedly, from interviews I've read, this is only one of two<br />songs that all four members played on together! It's a great song, with an incredible chorus and a very typical ACE FREHLEY<br />guitar solo. It also rocks out more than any other song here!<br /> My other favorite song is JOURNEY OF A 1,000 YEARS. It's, by<br />far, the most melodic song on the album and wouldn't have sounded<br />out of place on a MOODY BLUES album and that's a compliment, by<br />the way! Gene Simmons really improved as a songwriter on the<br />last several KISS albums, almost making up for all the crap he<br />wrote during the 80's and this song may rank as amongst one of<br />his best. The string arrangements are a nice touch!<br /><br />  I also like how Ace Frehley plays little snippets of some<br />of his older guitar solos in YOU WANTED THE BEST. The Gene Simm-<br />ons song WE ARE ONE is quite nice,tho it sounds like something<br />one would hear in a Pepsi commercial! I would've liked this album<br />more if ACE FREHELY and PETER CRISS were featured more, especi-<br />ally considering how long it had been since they'd been on a KISS<br />album!  Not a great album, but still worth buying!
B00005RFQ5|2.0|I was excited about this record that so many people created hype on around me. Well, I almost wish I was still waiting! Eventhough there are &quot;some&quot; good songs buried in there, the message is loud and clear: &quot;Go to your nearest Jehova's Witness &quot;Watchtower&quot; center and tell them you are a friend of Larry Graham and you would like to become a rainbow child, a.k.a a Jehova's Witness.&quot;  This UNBEARABLE bad 80's computerized-slowed down &quot;Bob George&quot; voice is truly a nuissance. The minute the record started, I knew Prince was in trouble. It's a wonderful thing to be enlightened but don't preach all this BS about God this and God that and then drop names of Macy Gray and Common (&quot;Mellow&quot;) to prove that you are still cool, when in fact, these Prince-wannabes have become better than Prince himself (Maxwell, D'Angelo, Macy, Bilal, etc..). I wish they would release a version of the album without the murderous narration. My wife banned me from playing this record! :-) So pick up &quot;Sign Of The Times&quot; or &quot;Around The Worl In A Day,&quot; if for the 5th time; they'll still sound a million times better than this. The &quot;fun&quot; thing on here is &quot;Wedding Feast.&quot; &quot;She Loves Me For Me&quot; is pretty but no &quot;The Beautiful Ones,&quot; &quot;Scandalous&quot; or the greatest Prince ballad ever &quot;Adore.&quot; &quot;Family name&quot; is very funky (Full Graham Central Station jam-thanks Larry G!) but the intro with another-even more annoying set of computer voices-kills it before you even hear Prince. Why redo &quot;Erotic City&quot; all over again (&quot;1+1+1=3&quot;)? Also, I never thought Prince would steal from D'Angelo (&quot;Muse 2 The Pharaoh&quot;)!!! I thought it was the other way around. Too bad. I guess I'll have to wait for that nonexistent next great Prince record. A message to Prince if you are reading: Miles D. would tell you to go back to your roots, throw out your toys and make realmusic again. C'mon, we both knew him and even though you got pseudo Jazz on your record...go back and listen to Sketches Of Spain or A Love Supreme and then we'll talk. I know you still got it brother.
B00003CX5P|5.0|George Lucas has finally brought us back to how to whole Star Wars saga begins, and he lets us see it first-hand.  A young Obi Wan Kenobi and his master Qui Gon Jin uncover the plot by the evil Darth Sidious to break down the Republic by manipulating the new Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, played by the same actor who played his evil Emperor Palpatine character in the first trilogy, Ian McDiarmid.  They also discover a boy, young Anakin Skywalker, strong with the Force, and promising as the prophecized &quot;one who will bring balance to the Force.&quot;  It is very exciting for any Star Wars fan to see how it all began.  The movie answers so many questions that begin to make the original saga make more sense.  Where did Anakin begin, and what weaknesses brought him to the Dark Side?  How did the Sith return?  The movie is outstanding.  <br />I haven't even mentioned the special effects yet, but I have just one word for them: So-realistic-it-is-mind-boggling.  Never has a Star Wars Episode seen such amazing special effects.  And virtually every camera shot has some digital effect applied.  One must applaud all of the cast for their oustanding work in interacting with their digital co-stars.  Just a couple minutes into the film, and you don't even consider that the Battle Droids aren't real.  ILM has done such a fantastic job that you completely accept them as real.<br />The DVD is definately the best DVD I have ever seen.  An hour-long behind-the-scenes documentary, feature length commentary, deleted scenes with commentary, trailers, photos, making-of featurettes, and more.  There is enough entertainment and information about Star Wars to keep any movie fan occupied for hours.  This is a MUST BUY!
0385505833|5.0|This book was definitely good. I went through it very quickly and was actually disappointed when I finished because I didn't want it to be done! It is very funny and I recommend it for everyone to read!
B00005JKES|5.0|Twin Peaks = teh winnar<BR>Here are my thoughts on the DVD. It's affordable. The art direction is great as it has a cover with Laura Palmer's prom pic being a on a transparent case that covers the pic of her wrapped in plastic on the box. The fact the pilot isn't included should NOT be a reason to not buy this DVD. It still has the &quot;complete&quot; first season along with the interviews and other such goodies listed above. People who own the series on VHS can also buy this and get the first season in the best video quality possible and have it be a gem in their DVD collection. ALSO, THE BETTER THIS DVD DOES, THE MORE LIKELY THE REST OF THE SERIES WILL BE RELEASED ON DVD WITH MORE EXTRAS. I already preordered.
0767824571|1.0|Monty Python's Holy Grail is a great movie but the DVD problems take the fun out of watching. The subtitles cannot be turned off no matter how many times you go to the subtitle menu and turn them off. For this reason I recommend you do not buy this DVD until this problem is fixed. I feel I wasted my money. Why invest in DVDs if they have glitches? There are plenty of other Python DVDs to enjoy.
B000002OX7|5.0|No credible music collection exists without this powerful, timeless, now extended and remastered, statement of what makes rock & roll great
1587990717|5.0|As an avid reader of both skeptical and scientific literature, I found this book fascinating. As a Professional trader I found this book disturbingly relevant. I have always had the nagging feeling that most trading systems may be illusory and serve only to provide the necessary comfort needed to function in the face of uncertainty while providing an illusion of control (all this while I am a discretionary system trader!!). Is the market a rondom walk? Do most things revert to their mean? Does market success carry the seeds for it's own undoing? Is Taleb really arrogant? (I think he is just honest). If any of this interests you , read this book.
0380778556|5.0|I read this book as a British literature project for school.  I read it in two days, since it was so hard to put down!  This book makes you really connect with the main character, whom the author kept nameless in a stroke of genius.  I could feel the anguish and pain of the main character as she tried to fill in Rebecca's place in the manor.  I could almost see parts of myself in the main character, she was so realistic.  We've all had doubts that we could fill in the shoes of someone without messing it up.  Plus, Rebecca was so seemingly perfect in every way.  A must-read, very captivating and realistic.
B00005QG9J|2.0|This needs more heat and maybe then something good could hatch. This is a disappointment after their last album because none of the songs are memorable in the least. This is generic, commercialized garbage.
B00005QGAX|4.0|Regardless of how the irresponsible media portrays MJ, if you are a fan of his music either past or present, I would have to strongly recommend this album to you.  In my opinion this album captures a moment in his music making days that was very pure, and very inspired.  This album has not just one hit single a a lot of fillers, but many smash hits (Bad, Another Part Of Me, Dirty Diana &amp; Smooth Criminal)- and the rest of the songs you will either love or like depending on your taste for slow or ballad type music.
B000050XEI|5.0|Majestic, etheric,  celestial.  From &quot;Fallen Embers&quot; to  &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;,  Enya  touches the heart of the listener.  This is the first time I have heard this artist.  Her range and creative expression is astounding.  A refreshing and uniquely different sound.  I like it.
B00000295A|5.0|Of everything Jay Kay and the rest of the gang have done, this is the cream de la cream! I especially enjoyed Music of the Mind, When You Gonna Learn, And Emergency on Planet Earth. Jason Kay's vocals were better in Trvelling Witout Moving, but the music and mesage of the album makes up for that completly. The didgerido is aso a lot more rapid in the album and the synthesizer is terrific. All in all, the songs and lyrics are obviously well thought through and well performed.
B000031WBV|5.0|Still my favorite piano album of all time.  I moved a few years ago and lost all my CD's, and because of financial problems have only recently begun to repurchase many recordings.  When I bought this again and listened to it after a few years away, I could have cried.  It was like meeting an old love, and none of the thrill was gone.  She was as beautiful as ever.  Rubinstein's sense of rubato is perfect; affective and full of rhythm within rhythm, yet only consciously noticeable when you carefully examine the playing.  Totally natural.  Like Liszt said of Chopin's rubato, &quot;See that tree?  See how the leaves move yet the shape stays the same?&quot;  The tone is bold and sharp, proving that Chopin's music was not to be maudlinly caressed as the stereotype of a weak, tubercular genius has perpetuated. This is music to lay in the dark with, not to sleep, but to ride the night blanket away in.
B00005ALNI|4.0|This was a true dramedy!  Excellent cast members, wonderful story line. A must see!
B00004ZAV3|2.0|Where is Girl?<BR>Where is Drive My Car?<BR>Where is Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds?<BR>Where is Birthday?<BR>And the line is endless.....<BR>I think this is a weak compilation from such a great band, if U want 2 hear their best get Abbey Road, St.Pepper's, The White Album and Let It Be. This No.1 CD is not a No.1, it is just a bunch of old songs, but not their best.
B00005A46T|5.0|I really were looking forward to this album. Not only because I'd already heard a couple of tracks off it beforehand, but I really wanted to know can it beat it's debut. Hell yeah it can! 'Iowa' is definately heavier than it's prequel and Corey Taylor makes it seem like fame has pissed him off more than ever. The opening track 'People=Shit' is remarkably even heavier than the first track off their debut. It starts off with a loud noise slowly building speed, then all of a sudden Corey Taylor screeches 'Come On', and from that moment on you know that Slipknot have topped their previous effort. One thing that really bugs em about 'Iowa' is the fact that no matter how hard I try, I can't bear to listen to it through headphones. I can easily listen to it through a hi-fi at full blast and enjoy the album, but when I listen to it on my walkman, it just seems like it's destroying my ear drums. Another bad thing about 'Iowa' is that eventhough it's the best Slipknot album, it doesn't have a single song on it to rival 'Wait And Bleed' off the first. Their first single off 'Iowa', 'Left Behind' really is a great song, but it can't really rival 'Wait And Bleed' or 'Spit It Out'. I'm giving this album 5 stars because it deserves them and is a better album, but 'Sliknot' has the better songs, and even then theres only two of them. The best song on this album has to be 'Everything Ends' that is just a perfect excuse for you to scream and shout at the top of your lungs.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I love Star Trek, and I love this movie; there, I said it.  Now, on to the criticism: &quot;Star Trek--The Motion Picture&quot; is too long, too monochromatic (though the restored color in this new edition goes a long way toward correcting that problem), and too slow to be set alongside the great science-fiction films of the last thirty years.  That said, one must acknowledge this film as the last gasp of old-school science-fiction filmmaking.  So much so, in fact, it really doesn't meld with the rest of the film series or the old TV show, for that matter.  (Keep in mind, much of the story thrust here inspired &quot;The Next Generation,&quot; and that series took nearly two years to hit its stride.) <br />Thus, &quot;The Director's Edition&quot; is a mixed blessing. The film restoration, new visual effects, and sound mix are tremendous, clarifying and enhancing a number of sequences.  But the basic story is still a bit slow and overblown to be good Trek.  Nonetheless, Robert Wise's new edit does make the best use of the original material of any cut I've ever seen, including the original release and the 1983 &quot;Special Longer Version.&quot; <br />And if anything, the lack of snappy, in-your-face visual effects (a la &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;The Matrix&quot;) offers more pleasure today than in 1979.  After twenty-two years of ten-frame pyrotechnic shots, one finds relief in a film that takes its time to scrutinize its incredible otherwordly vistas instead of hammering them at the audience in five-second cuts.  And like many fans, I still tear up when Kirk sees the Enterprise again for the first time, especially now with the legendary starship's reflection looking back at him in this new print.<br />So, one might ask, should Paramount have released this to theaters?  Probably not, but &quot;The Director's Edition&quot; still belongs in every serious sci-fi fan's DVD library (and of course, that of every Trekker) because it's simply the last gasp of old-time Hollywood sci-fi before the Lucas-Spielberg revolution snuffed it out forever.  Furthermore, &quot;The Director's Edition&quot; makes a decent film even better, helping this maiden movie voyage of the Enterpirse stand on its own and not just on the reputation of its sequels.

B00005QIPH|4.0|I never heard of most of the bands the people are talking about except for the Rolling Stones. The Strokes CD is almost as good as the lastest Mick Jagger and better than the 2nd Hootie CD and a bit better than the 1st Toad the wet sproket CD. I say they kinda rock in an alternative way, without being too hard and angry like Nirvana. Maybe closer to Lennie Kravat.
0684857219|4.0|This is a good all round book with a good range of exercises for the different body parts. It deals with anatomy and shows how the different positions of holding the bars affects strains the muscle group in a different way. It's nutritional section in the final chapters of the book is a bit drap. There are a few home made protein drinks etc but nothing major in nutrition receipies. I wanted to build a big neck there is a comment on the use of head harnesses but nothing on neck development except a brief comment. If you want neck exercises look on the internet. Otherwise an all round reasonable and excellently priced book.
0385505833|5.0|We all should laugh more.  I have read all of Grisham's books and liked most of them but this one I really had a great time with.  I laughed out loud so much that my wife had to read it - then my secretary - then one of my co-workers and on and on.  My suggestion is, read it in one sitting.  It is easily read in less than three hours even if you are a slow reader but the reward is worth it.  I am looking forward to Chrisham's new Mystery Novel but in the meantime he gave me great pleasure with this short novel.  Thank you John Grisham

It's taken a while to do but the &quot;whole&quot; movie should be renominated for the 2002 Oscars!
B000002JSN|5.0|I wore out two vinyl copies of this before CDs were invented!<br />Undoubtedly, one of the top ten of all time. Firmly planted at # 1 on February 24, 1975 even before the record stores opened for business, and with good reason.<br />All of the reviews here have said what needs to be said, for the most part. I'll add only a couple of comments.<br />First, the mastering and re-mastering were incredible. &quot;Houses Of The Holy&quot; sounds as if you are standing five feet away in the studio. Tight and intricate guitar dubs, Bonham's always under-appreciated rock-solid skins, and Plant's lighthearted, though not lightly performed lyrics are the stuff of legends.<br />&quot;In The Light&quot; has always been a favorite, and sounds just as impeccable today as 26 years ago.<br />&quot;The Wanton Song&quot; was a staple for mid-70's FM stations, both full play, and as beds for spots for everything from waterbed stores to guitar shops. The hot guitar licks interlaced with Jones's keyboard created a unique sound that only Zeppelin can lay claim to.<br />&quot;Kashmir&quot; is more relevant today than it was in 75, adding to the notion that these boys were way, way ahead of their time.<br />&quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; can't help but transform everyone with feeling back to that time when you had to say goodbye to someone special, and does so unforgettably.<br />For the ultimate, get yourself a Pioneer SX-1980, a pair of 4000 series JBL Studio monitors, and a nice comfy chair. Then, kick back and listen in on four geniuses who created the ultimate rock album.<br />Ooooooh Yea--h Yeah!
0385505833|4.0|I bought the book, not knowing what John Grisham has written in the past, but rather looking for some light-hearted reading; you know, something between Reader's Digest and Taliban.<br />The Krank family's (well, Luther's) desire to pass on the hub-bub of the holiday season has surprisingly more effect on everyone than the Krank's.<br />Skipping Christmas offered the silly, upbeat, quick reading I was looking for. It is a simple story and one that most everyone will relate to. Once the book is shared with friends and family, we will use the characters and scenes to describe our own friends, neighbors and co-workers. A must-be-made-for-TV-movie book.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|When I rented this for the first time I thought to myself that it would no doubt be as horrid as all those other adaptation films that came from video games.  Once I actually watched it however my opinion changed.  Now I think that it's actually a good movie.  Now I will be the first person to tell you that it cannot stand on it's own.  In other words you have to appreciate and know a bit about the games and the main character before you have a chance of thinking this is a good film.  However compared with all the other adaptation movies that is a good thing, not a bad thing.  Overall I say that if you like the Tomb Raider games and already know a bit about them and the character then watch it, you will like it, otherwise play the game and forget the movie.
B00005R2M3|5.0|i have to say...at first i didn't think it was a good cd...but the reason for that was because my expectations were too high for her....hey...the cd is great...poem to a horse is nice...and ay te dejo madrid is cool too...i believe the reviews given by that amazon critic are just an example of pure ignorance...everyone who knows her works knows that this album, although produced by her, had a lot of influence....i believe once she establish herself as a good singer/songwriter...she will go to the old form...la shakira que a todos nos gusta...bueno...i can't believe people compare her to alanis and britney...first of all...shakira has her own style and does not try to copy alanis...and second how can people compare her to britney...what i have seen of shakira she is very humble and not egotistic...and unlike britney...she has real talent...britney...by the way...britney can hide all those subliminal messeges all she wants...but sooner or later...we will see her in &quot;behind the music&quot; specials...<br />I just have to say...that if you want something fresh...buy this cd...to all of you non latin, non hispanic people who want to learn a little about what the spanish speaking people listen too...buy this...cd...and if you can..by ...¿Donde estan los ladrones?...which is the first cd...which all songs are real real good...<br />espero que tenga exito y que pues...no la sigan comparando con britney...porque la estan quemando con eso...<br />by the way...i believe it is unfair that on the tonight show, she got very little time...she didn't get interviewed...and what about saturday night live...they are having two musical guests...just goes to show you all the prejudice she is going through...but who cares...they don't know what they are missing...

B00005JKG7|4.0|The combo of Andrienne Barbeau's voice, the setting along Marin County's stormy coast, and fog rolling in on the lonely lighthouse. It sets a beautiful mood. Not over the top scary. I've watched this movie at least ten times; I find it soothing. Never tire of it because I grew up along the coast.
B00005N83M|3.0|Jennifer's 2nd album is almost the exact same as &quot;On the 6.&quot; In a way I prefer her first album then 2nd, or the 2nd then the first. Her top 3 smash hit 'Love don't cost a thing,' was chart buster on radio and television, it's a good-danceable track--butt it gets really anoyying after you listen to it a number of times. 'Play' great track, very catchy, not really a good meaning for the song, and same problem as 'love don't cost...' 'Ain't it funny' nice song, OK video, butt same problem as the same two songs. 'I'm Real' I hate listening to it, butt the video rocks!--And the MURDER REMIX, featuring jA rULe is awesome, video rocks too---the best. She can't really strectch hear vocal to a high-pitch or low voice. So can't really say she's gonna have long career in music.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|I have been a Prince/The Artist fan since Dirty Mind, and I have always enjoyed his ability to intermix spirituality, sexuality, and infectious grooves. Well, this time he has (IMHO) failed quite miserably. I was even able to find at least one song I liked on such clunkers like Lovesexy (I Wish U Heaven), The Black Album (Bob George) and Graffiti Bridge (Thieves In The Temple)...however...<BR>This was different.<BR>I found nothing even remotely interesting about this album! I felt as if I were being subjected to an audio televangilical broadcast half spoken by a mechanically enhanced voice.<BR>Confused? You're not half as confused as you will be after listening to Rainbow Children. But, I am not unhappy I bought it. Support his music, he'll get it right again...someday.
B0000074FL|5.0|A++++ On this disk, the lyrics and mix or rock/R&amp;B and Blues make it a must have for anyone who likes Thin Lizzy. Dualing guitars from S. White and S.Gorham add to the enjoyment and showcase the talent of the two. Of course Phil wrote great stuff on this disk, even during a hard time in his life. Check the other reviews and Buy this unknown Lizzy Classic if you like any music of Thin Lizzy, even if you have to pay import disk fees. It will not dissapoint your ear.
B000007NYS|4.0|&quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; is the best album that the artist of the same name recorded before her massive popular breakthrough, &quot;Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.&quot;  As such, it is typical of Williams' early career; she was always a better songwriter than she was a performer.  At least two of these songs (&quot;Passionate Kisses&quot; for Mary Chapin Carpenter and &quot;Change the Locks&quot; for The Silos) were performed better by those who covered them.  Williams is not the best singer around, and not until &quot;Car Wheels&quot; did she learn to fully make use of her limited vocal gifts.<br />That's not to say this isn't a good album.  In fact, it is full of first rate songs.  In addition to the above, &quot;Like a Rose,&quot; &quot;I Just Want to See You So Bad&quot; and &quot;I Asked for Water&quot; stand out among the studio tracks.  Among the bonus live material, &quot;Sundays&quot; is the highlight, and closes the record.  Overall, a solid album for fans of Williams.
B00003CXTF|5.0|this movie was one of the best war movies out there.It had romance,action,and drama. Critics dont like this movie because the romance is so \\"inrealistic\\", actually they are totally wrong.This kind of romance was very much real in those times. (...)This movie is one of the best and I truely recommmened it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento, granted, will take you at least two viewings before you really understand the true beauty of a movie that runs backwards. THis movie is about a man who is searching for the guy that murdered his wife. One problem: he was injured and has no short term memory (injury to the hippocampus). He can remembe reverything very well up to the injury but after that, forget about it. He has to take polorids of everything, write notes, tatoos, all in this grand search for the murderer of his wife. <br />Here's where the movie itself takes a brand new life. By running backwards, repeating scenes over and over, by the time its over you are left with a full story, a full movie, and a tremendous impact of what memory is and just how a story can be told. <br />I was highly impressed by Memento and undoubtedly will continue to watch, and re-watch it, each time gaining more from the story, the technique, and the movie itself.
B000002MK8|5.0|One of Rod's great works...live in concert. Modern and vintage music with Ron Wood at his side. Excellent recording/show! If you have never seen Rod in person--this should motivate you to go! A show you will never forget!!! Music, voice, quality is excellent.
6305313687|5.0|American History X is very hard to describe into words, for me at least. A white man goes to prison after killing a black man that was trying to steal his fathers car. One catch: the man is part of the local skinhead movement. He's the youth leader and motivator of the community. He goes to prison with a preconcieved notion of race, friendship, and humility. While he's in prison his little brother has been taken up by the movement. A martyr of his brothers fight so-to-speak. While in jail this man learns humility and changes. Now he has to wretch his brother away from the evil of racism and gangs. <br />Played with utter brillance by Edward Norton and Eddie Furlong this movie will leave you with a lasting impact and stirred emotions. Watch it in the dark.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This DVD is great. It softens the blow of an otherwise challenged film with a great deal of behind-the-scenes style documentary. For the most part you get a sense of what Lucas and his team were thinking the difficulty of making a film like this. <br />The DVD authorship itself is top-notch; the sub-menus duck and dip around pod-racer tracks, Gungan battles, ships holds, etc. It's well crafted and well-thought out.<br />The commentary track may seem overbearing at first, with 7 people talking. But this is a film made by comittee, and it works, anyway. The comments are insightful and point out much of the craftsmanship that went into the film in a way that a pure documentary simply can't. Plus it's nice to hear Ben Burrt explain the origins of many of the sound effects - Star Wars has always had the best sounds and it's nice to hear about their creation.<br />We all agree that Jake Lloyd is a stumbling block and Jar-Jar makes you want to jump out of one of those really tall Coruscant buildings. But all in all it's a good film, expertly made, and a hallmark for technology-driven filmmaking from here on out.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento, granted, will take you at least two viewings before you really understand the true beauty of a movie that runs backwards. THis movie is about a man who is searching for the guy that murdered his wife. One problem: he was injured and has no short term memory (injury to the hippocampus). He can remembe reverything very well up to the injury but after that, forget about it. He has to take polorids of everything, write notes, tatoos, all in this grand search for the murderer of his wife. <br />Here's where the movie itself takes a brand new life. By running backwards, repeating scenes over and over, by the time its over you are left with a full story, a full movie, and a tremendous impact of what memory is and just how a story can be told. <br />I was highly impressed by Memento and undoubtedly will continue to watch, and re-watch it, each time gaining more from the story, the technique, and the movie itself.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie taught me a lot of things...1)No one likes ugly people..only other ugly people. 2)Ugly people tend to be poor and introverted and have bad social skills. 3)It also taught me to go ahead and marry someone you dont like in order to get back at someone...why not? Its completely reversible. Anyway...buy this movie for your kids and make sure they are aware of the morals it teaches.
6301174240|5.0|I love this video. I watched it at a friends place. I am hoping it will be released on DVD eventually... Then I will be making a purchase!
0804106304|5.0|This is an amazing book. It is about four Chinese mothers, and their daughters that were born in America. It tells two stories of each mother while she was in China and two stories about the daughters living in America. It is very interesting how what<BR>happened to the mothers in China effected how they treated their daughters in America. The way that the different gengerations felt about their Chinese heritage was very interesing to me. The Girls that were born in America seem to be almost embarassed of their familys, and the mothers from China embrace the fact that they are Chinese.  All the character are very different and they all seem to complement each other .I think thatI would recommend this book to girls more then boys because some of the issues that are talked about are specific to girls. I think that I would also recommend this book for people 11 and up because some of the vocabulary is a little difficult to understand. All and all I thought that this book was very good and I would recommends it to most everybody.

0194314243|4.0|I've learned English first with the help of Oxford Learner's and then a paperback Advanced Learner's Dictionary.. I felt like I was favored by god to have a dictionary like this..(...) So a brand new edition - larger and hardcover, with lots of new illustrations etc. arrived. This is the millenium edition I am talking about. And happily I threw my old one away. This new edition however was so large and heavy, partly but not only due to its hard-cover, that I couldnt use this dictionary more that a couple of times since.  So I think the millenium edition simply runs against the basic idea this dictionary succeeded in realizing in the first place - a reader's dictionary for non-native users and students of English.. Now I am going to get the old paperback edition which seems to have shown up in the meanwhile. I recommend the same to you all, unless you need a dictionary just to fill a space on your shelves.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|is how my cable company described this movie, so I saw it. I must say it was all that and more. This has to be one of the most original storytelling devices I've ever seen. I won't give too much away except to say that we follow a guy (Leonard Shelby) who has short term memory as he looks for his wife's rapist and murderer. We also see a murder at the beginning and as we follow Leonard on his hunt we find out why the murder happened because we see things that lead up to it. I was captivated during the whole movie trying to put all the pieces together like Leonard. It also had some pretty funny moments too. The guy who played Leonard Shelby, Guy Pearce,  was good and very easy on the eyes! Definitely helped me to concentrate during the more complicated parts of the movie. Not sorry I rented this dvd, not at all. Highly recommend it.
B00005RDAF|2.0|Although I am a Britney fan, I was disappointed with this DVD.  Live in Hawaii was much better- much longer, more personal (with Britney hanging out, surprising fans, etc.) many more performances (SNL skits, 2 SNL songs, tons of songs from Hawaii concert, three videos.) This was only around 30 minutes long and did not have the same personal touch that Hawaii did. The commercials and outtakes from the movie were kind of pointless.
0385505833|5.0|I will carefully store this novel after New Years with my Christmas ornaments, so I will not give in to temptation to read it again before next Christmas. The &quot;scrooge-like&quot; narrarator of this story pulls you into his way of thinking through the hilarous encounters that he endures to the touching ending with which he suprises you.  My day was made brighter and my Christmas spirit renewed as I watched an &quot;empty nest&quot; couple attempt to escape tradition with the whole world (or neighborhood) against them.  It was so easy to read; I read it as my daughter napped, and I look forward to reading it again next year.  John Grisham never ceases to amaze me with his ability to put you inside the story.  It was as if a I could actually feel Luther's foot sinking in the slush and feel Nora's heart race each time a new solicitor came to the door. Make a hot cup of tea and enjoy!
B00003CY0V|4.0|I went and watched this movie when it came out. The special effects are kind of Matrix rip. After watching it I thought I should get a copy for my DVD collection. One big thing that I found rather unbeliveable is the speed at which he is able to hack. I am a Comp sci person and as far as I know its inhumanly impossible to do what he did especially under the very interesting circumstances at which he had to do it. For those who watched this film, will know what I am talking about. <BR>If your willing to forgive and forget the little extrencities of this film it is worth watching, it has some interesting action sequences, rather ingenious if you ask me. Flying bus.<BR>The DVD comes with some interesting features including a section where you have to come up with the passwords to gain access to some photos of all things. The DVDROM features have been done with Flash media. The DVD comes with the latest interactual dvd player for the PC.<BR>All in all its a good addition to your DVD collection. <br />I did not give it more than 4 because the Case is a draw back , its a soft case and the tips break very easily.
B000006TRV|5.0|The best Pink Floyd album next to Dark Side Of The Moon.  It has the classic tunes such as &quot;Another Brick In The Wall&quot; parts 2-3 (1 sux), &quot;The Happiest Days Of Our Lives,&quot; &quot;Hey You,&quot; &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; and &quot;Run Like Hell.&quot;  These are some of the greatest rock songs of all time in my opinion.  If you're a new Pink Floyd fan, this (and Dark Side Of The Moon) should be your first albums.  A beautiful album, a must have!
B00003CY0V|5.0|I thought Swordfish was the best action movie this year. Much better then Exit Wounds and Spy Games and also Training Day. To tell you the truth, I liked it much better then the Matrix, I thought this had a much better plot. It also is loaded  with action, but it's not just based on action like Exit Wounds. It is just a hip,sexy,thrilling,action packed movie. The acting is great. The dvd has some pretty cool extras such as commentary, profiles, a documentary on the special effects, and the cool theatrical trailer. It also has easter eggs. I think this is one of those movies kind of like Moulin Rouge where you either love it or hate it. At least give it a chance!<BR>       P.S. not for little kids Rated R for violence, languge, and sex/nudity.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|I didn't expect this CD to be great. I'd heard &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; and wasn't too impressed with it. However, the CD contains some great songs, such as another single, &quot;Waiting For Tonight&quot; as well as &quot;Promise Me You'll Try,&quot; and others.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time it is wonderful!!<BR>The acting is superb, so is the weird directing. The music blends in well too. The thing is, this is a movie where either you love it or you hate it. 2 people walked out. I love this movie, I already pre-ordered it!!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Great CD! Here's a quick overview:<br />1. &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; - I'm sure you've already heard this, so there's not much to say. The rest of the CD isn't really like this song.<br />2. &quot;Overprotected&quot; - Britney doesn't wanna be so &quot;damn protected,&quot; and she lets us know in this funky song with slammin' beats.<br />3. &quot;Lonely&quot; - This is NOT a ballad, like I expected it to be! It's actually a pounding uptempo. <br />4. &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; - Very pretty ballad written by Dido. It's the next single, and really shows that Britney CAN, despite popular belief, sing.<br />5. &quot;Boys&quot; - My least favorite track. It's overproduced, and when Britney sings, it's more like she's just talking fast.<br />6. &quot;Anticipating&quot; - A very fun, unique pop song. This one will get stuck in your head for days!<br />7. &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; - Brit's cover of the classic hit is very funkified and fun.<br />8. &quot;Cinderella&quot; - This sounds a lot like loney, with the thumping beats, but it also has a really nice pop bridge.<br />9. &quot;Let Me Be&quot; - Another very addicitive song. You can also hear this gem on the &quot;On The Line&quot; soundtrack.<br />10. &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; - This song, like it's title, is unique. This is another one that'll probably be sruck in your head... but you won't mind!<br />11. &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot; - As a sucker for love songs, this is my favorite track on the CD. It's a very sweet song, but not a big, sweeping balled like &quot;I'm Not A Girl.&quot; It's more &quot;suragy-pop.&quot;<br />12. &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot; - Cowritten by Ms. Spears' boyfriend, *N Sync's Justin Timberlake, this song sounds like it belongs on HIS album, not hers. The music just doesn't seem to fit, and, along with &quot;Boys,&quot; it's my least favorite track.<br />BOTTOM LINE: Except for a couple of disappointments, it's a GREAT CD!
B00005O5JV|4.0|When I began watching this movie, I thought it was kind of waste. Silly and unfunny. But it wasn't. Oh, yesssssss! It, really, wasn't. I have enjoyed this movie. Reese Witherspoon is wonderful. She's so beautiful and talented. Of course, it would never become a classics. Screenplay is not original, actors sometimes are overacting, but... But I really LIKE &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;. It is one of the brightest pictures, I've ever seen.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|Another one of my favorite all time classic movies with some of the best actor's and actresses. I love Bill Murray, Sigorney Weaver, and Dan Aykroyd are all amazing and funny. Other actor's and actresses include: Annie Potts, Harold Ramis, Rick Moranis, and Earnie Hudson. If you love any or all of these actor's it's a must see! Even if you have seen it you must get the DVD. It's got like a special 3-D menu of the city, great special effects. With also: storyboards, split-screen compare, production photos, drawings, deleted scenes, and much  much more. It's a great movie, fun of comedy and a little bit of scary-ness. It's an awesome movie and another classic to add to your DVD collection :)
B000002KHH|3.0|Yeah, this album is good, but it's not as great as the first one. True, this has the songs most people know, but where are those cool bluesy parts? Oh well, it's a shame they had to evolve. But the hightlights on the album are War Pigs, Planet Caravan, Hand Of Doom, and Rat Salad. There are horrible fillers on this album, however. Paranoid is a filler, and the band actually did state that. Iron Man is really repetive and annoying, and Electric Funeral's verses are too long. However, this isn't a bad album. Decent.
1558216847|5.0|This is an account of a young Polish man, 25 and recently married, who was sent to work as a slave-laborer in Siberia by Stalinist Russia.  He was tortured and put in a secret show-trial under the false allegations that he was a &quot;spy.&quot;  Why?  Because the Soviet Union wanted free labor to manufacture things for the Soviet army. The gulags were an act of brutal slavery by the Soviet Union.  It should be acknowledged.  There were Americans also wasted their lives there.  The misery of many wasted lives in Siberia, for both the young and the old.<BR>He vividly describes his journey east: herded like cattle on trains, then marched through Winter blizzards en shackled in chains. Some died along the way.  His escape is one of luck and careful planning, and the comraderie of his companions he escaped with on their trek to India, makes this story interesting.  The hospitality of the many people who took them in and fed them and gave them shelter for a night is heartening.  His account of Mongolia makes one want to go their.  It is a sad tale of human misery yet also of determination and a struggle for freedom.  <BR>     <BR>The writing is not spectacular but this is a very good quick read.  I'd like to know more of what the author did specifically after reaching India.  He lost his family and friends and beloved homeland, never being able to return after the war.  Yes, there were times when I couldn't imagine a person survived such a long journey on foot without water.  I don't know how they could have survived such a long journey, going days and days without water.  And the crossing through Tibet, with what limited supplies they had is difficult to believe.  Perhaps they went through only part of the Gobi desert.  Perhaps some dates were forgotten because of a lack of a calendar.  Regardless, this is a great book that is worth the read.  After you read it you can make your on judgments.  One can learn about the gulags and how they were administered also.
B000009EAD|5.0|WOW! I am impressed. Usually, i'm not impressed by really fast heavy metal, but this is incredible. Jon Schaffer is a master of rythym. Even I, who have been playing for 6 years, can't get the fast chugging rythyms. Also, this has some of the best ballads. I love Consequences, and is a great response to the Sep. 11 tragedy. Also, Burning Times is an amazing midtempo asskicker. Then there's the something wicked trilogy. OH MY GOD! I hope they make a whole album about this. This truely is amazing. Sure, it may not have that much originailty, but it sure is energetic. If you like this, also get the albums from Blind Guardian. Thank you!
B00005QZWI|4.0|The first listen was rather disapointing.  I felt bogged down by the &quot;ring&quot; theme repeated throughout the first half of the soundtrack.  To my suprise, the highlights were the softer passages.  I would have prefered the proffesor's poems as lyrics instead of the watered down ones in several of the tracks.  After several listens I am thouroughly enjoying it.  I am glad that Shore didn't have one or 2 themes running through the entire score; I'm tired of the predictability of typical Hollywood rendereings these days.  The themes are there but are varied enough to show many different tastes.  I enjoy the way the brute pounding of &quot;The Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot; is released into the quietness of aftermath.  This can be an effective tool in the film as I can see the fellowship's shock of losing their guide followed by the numbness and accompanying sorrow.  The track in Lothlorien shows me the mystic and &quot;timeless&quot; trait described in the book.  With the dissonance of the vocal solo I can almost picture the beautiful Galadriel holding her arms up in a gesture of rejection toward the East.  The score as a whole has grown on me enough to enjoy it.  I appreciate Shore's ability to create unique tones with the various choral arrangements.  It makes me curious to hear if someone else's intepretation would provoke more emotion from listening to my favourite story.  I eagerly await the second film score with the inevitable &quot;Smeagol&quot; theme; maybe even a comic &quot;Slinker&quot; and twisting evil &quot;Stinker&quot;!
B00005LMBK|5.0|I was always a massive fan of Blur. So when I heard that Damon Albarn was doing a side project, I was intrested immediatly. I was one of the few people who had this album before the video was made. This is incredible. Every track is diffrent, so be careful what you describe them. The best tracks are Re-hash, 5/4, Tomorrow Comes Today, Punk, M1-A1, and Dracula. Actually, they're all the best. Del Tha Funky Homosapien does a few raps on 2 tracks, so the hip hop fans should love this. If you like all music, this is for you.
6304493681|5.0|I want to give the bad review right away: I would have appreciated very much if they gave more movement to the animation, very stiff, at least let them wink! The dialogue is a little artificial, but I'm sure it was the translation, I hate dubbing, really do. So, some dialogues were thrown at the spectator in a very cold manner. Other thing, about the sound, probably for the dubbing also, it sounded very low and could have done a little bit more of work, and for the music, well, not my taste.<br />Anyway, it might seem I really dislike it, but quite the opposite. I can compare it to the other few anime I've seen, Akira, Mononoke Hime, and still I like this one more. Mainly for the smooth pace, uncompromised to show stupid action sequences. The plot reminded me a lot of Blade Runner (which I prefer), it deals with similar theme. The director probably saw to many art films, and that's good, let's change anime stories; it has a lot of potential, you can create a world from a scratch, but I can't still see how everybody is obsessed to making futuristic fantasies (for Ghost it's alright, its the whole point). Well, I'm drifting away... This movie reminded me to Apocalypse Now, althought is not nearly as good as it, it has the same dedication for the visuals, to create an hypnotizing mood. <br />See it, buy it...<BR>&quot;We now see thru a mirror, darkly.&quot; - I Corinthius 13:12<BR>(The movie didn't bother to cite.)
B000002GKT|5.0|Glad to see that at least 15 other people understand how great this record is. Simply put, this is one of the great underappreated bands in rock and as stated previously, maybe the best live rock record ever. <BR>The only other live rock music recordings that are as good in both sound and musicianship are only Hendrix at Monterey, the stuff from Cream on Live Cream and Wheels of Fire and the Allman Brothers Fillmore stuff-and I mean nothing else. Name some other album and it will suffer either in sound quality or level of performance.<BR>Practically a supergroup as the definition was applied in those days, what other band had three really good lead singers and two great guitarists? (by comparison, the Allmans had only one singer, Cream only one guitarist and Blind Faith only had two lead singers...) <BR>Some people don't get it-\\"Rolling Stone\\" doesnt (...); anybody ever heard of toungue in cheek??? This piece literally oozes the kind of sexual macho strut blues artists have always employed in their performances and that maybe Robert Plant didn't mimic as well as Steve Marriott! Look at the photos on the cover and listen again and check out what a great crowd interaction piece Rolling Stone was. These guys were a ball to see and funny!<BR>The heavy metal reference is true-nothing like the roar of a Melody Maker or an SG through a Marshall- but check out Greg Ridley's tango(!) rhyhthm in the bass line in \\"I'm Ready\\".<BR>Peter Frampton was not 17 when this was made-he was born in May 1950. Still awesome for only having turned 21!<BR>This record is so good that the one classic rock radio piece they always play, \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\", is the worst thing on the record.<BR>The prefacing of this record by the studio material they'd already made shows what they could have been if this lineup had stayed together and hadn't devolved into a simple blues 'n' boogie band after Clempson joined, but then again, you wouldn't have had \\"Frampton Comes Alive\\" (ha ha ha!).<BR>The tragedy is that Marriott's death prevented any chance of a rematch...<br />Next time you come across a bunch of hot young punks who think they invented music, sit 'em down and school 'em with this record.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I suspect there are a couple of reasons why why review on this board vary so much.  Probably Paul's enemies of means like Michael Jackson and Yoko are hiring people to write bad reviews.  Come on, how can anyone say there is nothing new here? Songs like &quot;Tiny Bubble,&quot; &quot;Riding in Jaipur,&quot; and many others are totally unpredictable.  This sounds better than Wingspan to be honest. This is great stuff, ubelievably great actually.
0071373586|5.0|'Positioning' is written in an easy manner, with short but concise sentences & a wide spectrum of real-world examples. The humourous writing style of Ries & Trout makes the book an entertaining read. Despite the fact that it's been written decade ago, the concepts in the book are still timely and applicable.
B00003CY0V|5.0|I saw this in the theaters and I was hooked from start to finish;it's John Travolta's soild comeback from the pits of his massive stinkbomb Battlefield Earth.Here he is the bad guy Gabriel who,with the help of his sorta-gal pal Ginger(Halle Berry),gets a burnt-out computer wiz Stanley Jobson(Hugh Jackson)to try to hack 10 million bucks from a goverment slush fund called Operation Swordfish.There alot of twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing to the ending credits.Halle is really sexy in her role as Ginger(where's Gillagan?)and Hugh proves he's a rookie actor to be reckoned with.And action?Well,there tons of that,the standouts being the 360-pan explosion and a an airlifted transport bus flying through L.A. It's a bit far-fetched,but hey its only a movie!This film was directed by Dominic Sena,who also directed one of my favorite action flicks 2000's Gone In 60 Seconds!Swordfish makes a very satisfying addition to your DVD collection. [WARNING:There's some stuff that may be too disturbing for viewers still shakened by the 9-11 terrorist attacks,like using people as deadly bombs to demolish an a entire town.If you are,I suggest you pass this one up for awhile.]

0066620996|5.0|Some people have commented that the concepts in this book are elementary and have implied that the act of articulating them is insulting to readers' intelligence.  By that logic, we should see many more great organizations than we currently do.  If the practices outlined in this book are so easy--as some have said--then why aren't more organizations actually implementing them and seeing the success of the &quot;good to great&quot; companies?  <br />Because either we don't really believe that they're true, or we lack the courage to implement them, that's why.  Because we need empirical evidence--offered brilliantly by Collins and his team in this book--to convince us otherwise.  We'd rather believe that an outside, charistmatic CEO is the answer to all our problems.  We'd rather believe that we can say &quot;yes&quot; to any business opportunity to come down the pike than have the discipline to say &quot;no&quot; to the good, which is the enemy of the great.  Because we'd rather blame outside circumstances for our problems than face the ugly truth that we have met the enemy and he is us.
B000002LFU|5.0|Nov. 8th George Bush was elected and Green by REM came out. I knew to get it because the band ran ads saying that people should vote and buy the album. I was only 17, so I got the record and hoped Dukakis won. We know how that turned out, but Green was the bomb, and ended up making the band even bigger household names than ever before. You Are The Everthing, World Leader Pretend, The Wrong Child, Hairshirt, and the untitled 11th track are all breathtaking songs featuring Stipe showing off what we all knew he could do: sing. The deep voiced and mumbling long haired troll of Reckoning was long gone. Peter Holsapple toured with them for this record and added a new organ sound to the mix, which I think sometimes sounds like David Lettermans band. This is the last Political with a capital &quot;P&quot; album by R.E.M.. Like U2, the band had pigeonholed itself as some grass roots social causes band (not a bad thing). While forever-independant bands like Fugazi never relent from that forum, R.E.M were moving into corporate rock-land as a band, and a change of image and sound would be in order. They were the most rock star without a cause on Monster.<br />Their previous record's sound shows up again on Green in places. Orange Crush is very simular to The One I love, and  I remember California is much like Oddfellows local 151. Stand is still one of the clearest and most positive personal political anthems around, and you gotta love the wah-wah peddle!
B000002UV1|5.0|This is a really good Chili Peppers album.  I wouldn't say it's as good as Blood Sugar Sex Magik by them but it is a ver good album anyway.  I could listen to Higher Ground and Nobody Weird Like Me for hours and hours.  Very worth the money, very memorable.

B00003CXB2|5.0|An excellent, dateless, ageless film--wonderful, thrilling and moving.  The countless extra footage is priceless; each actor's  performance better than the next.  No wonder the film won so many awards.  Too bad so many of today's same-genre films substitute noise and special effects for the excellent filmaking displayed in this film.  I loved the dvd so much, that I'm ordering one for my 26 year old son.
B00003003R|5.0|This is the perfect thing to prove that GNR was indeed one of the best rock bands of the 90s, the perfect thing for every die-hard GNR fan, 6 years after the band's breakup.<BR>Live Era 87-93 is a collection of 2 CDs consisting of GNR songs recorded live, during concerts. A great way to celebrate the end of an era, and why not, to give hope for every fan that the new GNR will be also very good, just like the old one, and that the new line-up could be the beginning of another era (this CD was released after the news that Axl will re-form GNR, with different musicians from different bands).<BR>I totally disagree with most opinions in here, criticising alot about these CDs. Let me get a few things straight for those people who are not too satisfied with this release:<BR>-- the crowd noise is a GOOD thing, not a bad one, like some fans say. It gives the recordings a great feeling, makes you feel like you're almost there, at a GNR concert. After all, these are 2 LIVE CDs, and this is all they're about.<BR>-- people keep babbling about Axl singing too like this, or too like that.... well let me tell you, Axl sings great throughout the whole concert, he's in great shape and i really like it.<BR>-- so there's too much crowd noise in Patience?? So what?? It gives you the chills, to listen to that song and to clearly hear so many people singing all the words together with Axl. <BR>-- Sweet Child O' Mine isn't bad at all, i don't know what makes you all say that, Axl sings great and Slash's guitar riffs are also great. <BR>-- And how can you all say the second CD is baaaaad... when it has so many great tracks, like Estranged (one of the best GNR songs ever), Paradise City, Don't Cry, Sweet Child O' Mine or You Could Be Mine??? CD2 is at least as good as CD1.<BR>-- and so what there are tracks you like and aren't in here?? Metallica's S&amp;M didn't have Fade To Black or The Unforgiven, did that make it bad? No way! So they skipped Civil War or Coma... who cares?? Come on, people, you have here 2 great CDs, a total of 22 great songs, live, with your favorite band, what's there more to want??<BR>Live Era is a great compilation and i'm really happy they released it, because it surprises the very essence of GNR, fast and furious, strong and powerfull, mad and melodious. <BR>But just like any other live recordings, i recommend this only to the people who know the original versions of the songs, this is the only way to really &quot;feel&quot; a live song, to see all the little differences that make live songs so special.<BR>All in all, i don't regret a bit for getting this one, it's a great listen for every real GNR fan. The end of an era. And maybe, just maybe, the beginning of a new era.
0385505833|1.0|I purchased this book on the authors name alone and would know like to demand a refund.  Although the premise of the book was interesting, I found the storytellling strained and unimaginative.  This book is nowhere near the quality of Grishams earlier works.  The conclusion left me very disappointed and the feel good ending was overdone.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira releases her english debut LAUNDRY SERVICE. Let me tell you, this album is awesome! It's a mix of rock, dance, a bit of country, latin sounds, and even some middle eastern influences. Shakira has a wild, untamed, distinct voice. She puts her vocal talents to good use on LAUNDRY SERVICE. Lyrically Shakira sounds a bit wacky but she still gets her point across. Forget silly titles like &quot;poem to a horse&quot;, this album is well done. It all starts with the rock/tango &quot;objection (tango)&quot; which sounds like a wild rock and roll tango with pop zest. The hit &quot;whenever, wherever&quot; is also a nice track. The ballads &quot;underneath your clothes&quot; and &quot;fool&quot; are very nicely done. LAUNDRY SERVICE also contains 2 spanish tracks which is a nice touch. The song &quot;que me quedes tu&quot; is one of the best songs on here. Shakira sounds so comfortable that the song floats along nicely. There's even an english version of her latin hit &quot;ojos asi (eyes like yours)&quot; on here! Anyways, don't expect a fluffy pop album with LAUNDRY SERVICE. It's way more than that. Shakira wrote and produced the entire album. That makes LAUNDRY SERVICE even more personal. Shakira sounds confident in her emotional delivery. She also rocks!
0800179501|4.0|When  I  watched  KK  for  the   first  time ,it  was'nt like    other   kung-fu  movie's  my  friends  and I use  to  watch   on  Saturday afternoon's .This   movie  showed  what  martial-artist  probably  experienced  before    becoming  Bruce  Lee's   and  Van  Damme's . After  not  have  seen   the  movie  since  my   younger  days , it  brought  back  the  memories  of   how  my   friends  and  I   would   play  kung-fu  and  one  of  us  would use  that   infamous  kick stance that  never was  effective .  Anyways, this  movie   struck  the   days  of  innocents  for  me and  reminded  me  of  patience  and  it's  virtues. Definitely  an  must-have  to  add  to   your  karate flick  collection !
B00004W52U|5.0|This album should be played loud, and expect your vocal cords to hurt after you shout along with it. Lots of short and to the (...) point screamin tracks. It's really hard to write a review of this album without profanity. If you don't understand that's a good thing, you probably won't get this album.<br /> Oh, and if you buy discs because of how they will make your collection look, stick with something safer. I hear backstreet boy's latest release is real \\"edgy\\".
B00005OWIU|4.0|This CD is great if you love a CD with only instrumentals. But if you like singing meaning vocals along with it then you will be dissapointed. I'm not saying that the CD is (bad), it's actually very good.
B000002LQR|5.0|If my entire CD collection were stolen, this is probably the one I would replace first.
B00003CXBK|5.0|this movie is unbelievably and inhumanly awsome, it is almost as good as THE ONE but not quite. quite a show of japanes animation excellence, this movie is great for anyone at all unless you hate watching movies [...]. this movie has kind of short fight scenes but that does not hurt it at all because they are awsome, the main character is awsome and the movie is filled with mythical creatures and a wonderful quest for salvation. this movie is to cool, if you like anime, or love action movies, get this NOW!!!!!
B0000541AM|5.0|I saw this movie the first day it was released in movie theaters.  Warriors may have been pulled from theaters in the mid-west and back east, but out here in california - at least at cerritos mall, the movie played for a good long time. I saw this movie repeatedly week after week loving every moment of it. As a kid of 11 years old it seduced me into its world of loyalty to your friends (gang), and the mean streets of new york. Of course I've been to new york city several times and have never seen anyone running around in baseball uniforms with their faces painted like clowns on pcp. You gotta love the Riffs though - all the different gangs are like a cirque de solei gone bad.<br />It's easy to see how this movie has &quot;ganged&quot; its cult status. As Shaq daddy said when the Lakers won the world championship in 2000...<br />CAN YOU DIG IT?<br />I can definitely dig it.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club Is the most impressive movie that I see in my life, you even need to see this movie in slow motion. This is my favorite movie. I see this movie 5 times in HBO, so I decide to buy the DVD and my conclusion is that this is the best DVD in the market.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is by far my favorite. I can't understand how someone couldn't like it...but as director Baz says &quot;The first 15 minutes is a transition into it's world. Some people make the transition. Some people don't.&quot;<BR>One of the most amazing things about this movie is the people I have met through it. It is like all the people who are obsessed with it are exactly alike. Like there is something at the core of this movie that we all want in our lives, and it speaks to us in many ways. We share a special bond because of it.<BR>For those who can make the transition into it the movie brings you into it's world. It is a world you wish you could stay in for it is so bright and wonderfull and full of song. Oh now don't you all forget the wonderfull songs! Baz is coming out with a second soundtrack in February so all us fans get the chance to rejoice! There were so many songs left off the original soundtrack it was ridiculouse...okay this is getting long...in short SEE THIS MOVIE!! (and also see it on a big screen)
B00005NWLO|5.0|Lynyrd Skynyrd released four studio albums prior to the release of this record and they were all outstanding. But as good as they were in the studio, Skynyrd really showed their chops on the road. Shortly after the release of their first record they toured as an opening act for The Who and did the unthinkable by actually blowing them off the stage. One More From The Road was released in late '76 and it captures all of their power and fury. For the tour they added guitarist Steve Gaines to the mix of Allen Collins and Garry Rossington bringing back the triple lead guitar attack that made them famous. Bolstered by Artimus Pyle's drumming, Billy Powell's boogie-woogie piano and Leon Wiliknson's steady bass, the band provides the firm backing for frontman Ronnie Van Zant's whiskey-soaked vocals. Standout tracks include the powerful &quot;Workin' For MCA&quot;, the furious &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot;, &quot;Tuesday Gone&quot;, the rollicking &quot;Call Me The Breeze&quot; and of course their two most notable songs, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; and the flick your lighter on arena rock classic &quot;Free Bird&quot;.  This is a remastered deluxe edition that has several different live versions of songs and the original packaging including the original liner notes by a young Rolling Stone writer named Cameron Crowe.
B00005O5CM|1.0|I went and saw this with my friend because we had anready seen everything else. By the time the 20 minute mark came we were sitting with our arms in the air saying &quot;Why? Oh why did we waste our money?! WHHYYYY???&quot; (don't ask, we were hyper). I thought it might be cute but it didn't even manage to be stupid in a funny way (like Pearl Harbor). It was pure stupidity. And I understand it was supposed it be...but people liked it?!?! When it got to the &quot;Bend and snap!&quot; part me and my friend were sitting with our head in our hands wishing we had gone to see Moulin Rouge again for the millionth time. But alas the all sacred Moulin Rouge had been bumped by this dumb movie...ggrrr...
B000056JYC|4.0|Frampton Comes Alive came out of nowhere to become one of the biggest albums of all time. Peter Frampton released several albums in the early to mid 70's, a couple of which sold respectively. When this album was released in early '76, it exploded and stayed in the top ten for over a year. The album offers something for everybody from straight forward rockers like &quot;It's A Plain Shame&quot;, &quot;Something's Happening&quot; &amp; &quot;Doobie Wah&quot; to ballads like &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way&quot; &amp; &quot;Show Me The Way&quot; to extended jams like &quot;I Wanna Go To The Sun&quot;, &quot;Lines On My Face&quot; &amp; &quot;Do You Feel Like We Do?&quot;. It also has that voice-box. Frampton is a great guitar player and an energetic performer and those traits didn't always come across on his studio albums. They were front &amp; center on the live album and people tapped into that. Frampton never again reached the heights he reached with this album, but it stands today as a touchstone of 70's rock music.  This is a remastered package that includes three unreleased songs as well as the original liner notes written by a young Cameron Crowe who would later cast Mr. Frampton in a bit part and use him as a technical and guitar consultant on Almost Famous.
B00003CXTG|4.0|This movie is corny. That's a good way to start...during the train station scene when it was all in slow mo and Kate's dress was flowing in the smoke I was laughing so hard I almost choked on my popcorn. Ben Aflecks accent is also extremely laughable. And although there is around an hour long action sequence it passes quickly because it is so interesting. It is glossy and overly dramatic. But oh so what?! It's cute! It's sad! It's funny! This entire movie was so overdone it's enjoyable! Like no one saw the end coming...but anyway...Rent it and laugh yourself silly!
B00005N9CV|1.0|Isn't she lovely?  Diana Krall is lovely.  Her mellow voice is lovely.  She has been nicely merchandised for mass appeal on this CD of standards.  Viagra makers should consider partnering their product with this CD.  Both products seem to have the same motive.  In fact, McDonald's should consider partnering with this CD for the same reason.<br />If you want soulful singing, and Cry Me a River requires soul as well as style, choose something by Shirley Horn or Patricia Barber.  Diana's version is too whispery.  Words drop off like they got stuck somewhere.  Diana has an attractive, husky voice.  But she isn't really a jazz singer.  Compare with Patricia Barber's version of Let It Rain.  Same husky voice, but Patricia's voice has undeniable soul.  Singing jazz is not as easy as it sounds.  It requires range, phrasing, emotion, imagination and edge.  Meaning the singer, armed only with a good ear and her pipes, gets out there on at least one song and takes a chance.  Steps away from the straight structure of the song and musically develops something that, if it works, makes the listener believe it was meant to be sung just like that.  You won't ever get that edge from Diana because her merchandised style is about safety at all cost.  You can't be safe AND edgy.  You will never hear Diana attempt a standard like How High the Moon because that song requires range and depth.  Diana can croon ballads but will never be the type of singer who can do what Karyn Allison does.  Or what Ernestine Anderson does.  Or what Betty Carter did.  All the other singers mentioned here have stepped out on the edge away from the safety circle.  They sing without the barrier protection that overmiking, overmixing and overmerchandising provide.
0553213105|5.0|Well, I first readthis book last week and I think it's amazing. I saw the video of it last year and I think it is possibly one of the best dramatisations ever. I loved Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth in P&amp;P and this week I am hoping to buy Bridget Jones's Diary (being released here in England on  Saturday). I find this book has a romanticism about it and when you read the book, you feel a longing to be back in the period where men where gallant and women were graceful. The sexual chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy was wonderful; you felt as if you were actually there.<br />If you've already read it, read it again and if you've never read it... well, you've never lived!
B000002UUX|5.0|This is the finest album that Megadeth ever released and probably ever will.  It is one of the top ten heavy metal albums of all time.  Every song a masterpiece except for the boring (...) Dawn Patrol (track 8).  A must buy for any serious listener.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I was turned onto this CD by a very music-savvy individual, who shall remain nameless, and have been enjoying it ever since.  Yes, John Mayer's voice may remind some of you of Dave Matthews, but who cares -it's working for Dave.  As far as I'm concerned, John Mayer is a very talented singer/songwriter and I hope he goes far!  I love this CD & highly recommend it!  (...)
B000000W5F|5.0|Considered by most to be the best, and, in some cases, only really good album the Stones released after the 70s. And indeed, the songs aren't really new, just re-built tunes the band never got around to putting on any album in particular. However, the songs have nothing of the over- or under- produced quality that marred similar ideas such as The Beatles's \\"Let It Be\\". The album starts up with one of the so-called 'trancendent' songs - one of those songs that you say 'Oh, that was *them*?' about, because its huge impact on popular culture seems to place it at a distance from any one band. That song is the phenomenal \\"Start It Up\\", a rocker that is better known by its chorus of 'You make a grown man cry'. From there the album wanders lazily along through a wide phenomena of songs such as \\"Hang Fire\\", a solid, fast-paced rocker whose lyrics sound a tad forced, but, when compared to, say, Paul McCartney's work on his 1980 album \\"McCartney II\\", The Stones seem to restore faith in the aging 60s rockers. The album continues into a long, excellent song, \\"Slave\\", and follows nicely with \\"Little T&A\\", a Keith Richards number, a well done rock number from the bluesy member of the Stones. As usual, a little more open with the profanity ..., while Jagger relies on innuendo to get his point across. The album hits the token country blues number \\"Black Limousine\\", again, the lyrics somewhat forced though with excellent harmonica  and piano chugging along to a steady blues beat. From there, the album travels into Side 2, kicking right off to a much-maligned Stones classic that does take time to grow on you: \\"Worried About You\\", demonstrating the real range of Jagger's voice. The next two tracks, \\"Tops\\" and \\"Heaven\\", are easily forgettable and even more easily skipped. \\"No Use In Crying\\" is, despite critical disregard, a personal favorite. Its mix of reggae with the traditional Stones ballad formula (What obsession do these guys *have* with trains in the station?) adds up to an excellent number, with a wonderful performance by all. \\"Waiting On A Friend\\", despite critical acclaim, is a song I like, but wouldn't call an instant classic. Yes, an actual song about love, that is, the kind of Beatles-love mention-kissing-but-nothing-more that all of us 'dug' back in the 60s with \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" (and that the Stones challenged with \\"Let's Spend The Night Together\\") is back and it's a nice tune, but Jagger's trademark we-are-evil \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\" tone just sounds out of place when he sings about the wonders of friendship with the opposite gender.<br />Overall, a classic, and the last great Stones album. It is a good rocker that'll really make you think: \\"Where has all the good music gone?\\"
B00000J7I3|5.0|If you love the 80's metal bands, then of course you know who Motley Crue is. This is the album to purchase. Especially since it has unreleased tracks on here like &quot;stick to your guns&quot; and &quot;toast of the town&quot; these 2 tracks were not released previously.. they are both awesome songs. Vince's singing on this album is very vibrant and totally shows his young singing capabilities!!  A must for all Crue fans!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|When this movie first came out I had no real desire to see it. All of the publicity was about how violent the movie was and there was not much mention of anything else. I was a bit of a David Fincher fan after The Game and Seven and I really like Edward Norton, who in my opinion is the finest actor of his generation, but I still thought who really wants to see a movie about people knocking lumps out of each other for 133 minutes? I certainly didn't and so weeks went by until one of my favourite UK movie magazines published their top twenty movies of 1999. What was top? You guessed it, Fight Club. But I still wasn't convinced. However, I'd seen everything else that I'd wanted to see and Fight Club was about to leave the theatres and on the basis that every review of the movie in the UK had been five star I felt I had to see it. I didn't expect to enjoy it but I kind of felt that as a supposed film buff it was my duty to watch even if I was going to hate it. I couldn't have been more wrong, I was blown away by this movie. It was nothing like I expected and nothing like the hype. And it's not just a guy movie either, I watched this with my wife and she loved this movie as much as I did and at the end she turned to me and said one word \\"wow\\"! Sure there is some very realistic and gorey fight scenes in this movie but to characterise it as a mindless bloodfest is to do it an enormous disservice. This is an incredibly powerful movie that pulls one surprise after another. It has an incredibly original script, excellent direction and wonderful acting. Not only is the ever fantastic Edward Norton better than he's ever been before (or perhaps ever will be) but he is ably supported by Brad Pitt (who I'm generally not a great fan of) as the charasmatic anarchist and soap salesmen Tyler Durden, the superb Helenah Bonham Carter totally cast against type as Marla (...)(in what should have been a multi-award winning performance) and Meat Loaf. Yeah, Meat Loaf in good film, understated, funny, good acting shock!!! Who would have believed it? Not me but then Fight Club is that kind of movie, it is nothing like you'd imagine.<br />I don't want to give the plot of the movie away in case you haven't already seen it. To my mind the best way to watch a movie (and in particular this movie) is with no prior expectations and an open mind. This movie is a rollercoaster ride that will take you places and directions that no movie has taken you before. How good is it? Well, I read a magazine interview and Edward Norton stated that when he and Brad Pitt watched the movie for the first time, Brad Pitt turned to him and said \\"you know this is the best movie we will ever be in\\" and Edward Norton agreed. That's how good it is! Darkly comic, a visual and verbal assault on the senses, Fight Club is perhaps a movie before its time that has divided (and will continue to divide) audience opinions to the widest of extremes. Does it have a deep and meaningful message? Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't and maybe that's exactly the point, maybe that's how our world is at this particular place and time. Whatever, in my opinion Fight Club beats the hell out of most other movies and fully deserves five stars.ed, funny, good acting shock!!! Who would have believed it?

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I watched this movie at home thinking that is would bre like one of those Disney movie where you know whats gonna happen and it'll be all mushy and corny and &quot;perfect&quot; but it wasnt and thats great. I'm sick of movies like that. This movie will make anyone with a sense of humor laugh. I know that because my dad barely laughs at movies especially PG movies but I tell you that he was laughing which brightened my day. This movie is great and , unique. this is exactly what the movie business needed
0553579908|4.0|This is a very good book, but not as good as the first volume. The plot grows more and more complicated, with turns and twists absolutely impredictable (and this is great!) but it seems to me that the characters act too little: in a thousand pages you would expect a lot of things to happen, instead at the end some of the characters are almost in the same situation as at the beginning of the story. So you wonder if you had to go through so many chapters and find out that nothing had changed (see Bran and Jon most of all). <br />Anyhow, I enjoyed all the chapters because, even if you FEEL as if something SHOULD happen (but it doesn't), they are so well written and the characters so rich, that you go on restlessly.

0060931736|3.0|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie is the story of an eccentric, unorthodox teacher at a private school in Scotland. The story's action centers around the title character's dealings and connivings with six of her favorite students who acquire the collective title &quot;The Brodie Set&quot;. In the story the reader becomes privy to how Miss Brodie deals with these six students collectively and individually, the administration of the school at which she teaches, and her various romantic interests.<BR> The book is a celebrated work, and one has to wonder why this is so. Certainly, the character of Miss Jean Brodie is initially interesting; here we have an opinionated, sexually liberated woman at a stodgy Scottish prep school in the early 20th century. To be sure, Miss Brodie would be much more interesting if the book had been written at the time of its setting, rather than in 1961; a character such as she would be much more likely to exist in the 60's. As the story proceeds, however, she become something of a bore, and that is probably just as well, since the focus of the story eventually shifts from Miss Brodie to a particular student of hers.<BR> Interesting to this reviewer are the passages describing what eventually becomes of Miss Brodie's students. Some of these passages occur quite early in the story, as does the revelation of Miss Bridie's betrayer. Hence, the reader may infer that the author intends for the story to be something other than a whodunit mystery, with the reader trying to figure out who betrayed Miss Brodie and how.<BR> The story lacks tension, and is, therefore, not an exciting read. So, we are not to be blamed for asking why this story is so celebrated. I must admit that, despite all of the shortcomings I have thus far discussed, I enjoyed the book. The prose has a refined and cosmopolitan feel; the sentences are artfully composed, restrained without being cryptic. The book's length makes it an excellent read for a long weekend, when reading withoutdeep involvement is desired. And the storyline, while not exciting, does manage to hold interest. I think that perhaps the most appropriate adjective for this story is &quot;intriguing.&quot; On that basis, I do recommend The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, but time the reading of it for when you simply want to kill time, without really wasting time.

B0000507R0|5.0|I recently purchased my first DVD-Audio player (Toshiba SD5700) and was looking for something to play on it that I might enjoy.  BSS was a favorite of mine when it came out in 1973 while I was in college.  I remember that it was one of the better sounding LP's at the time, so I hoped that the original masters were of high enough quality that a transfer to DVD-Audio would do justice to the new technology.  I'm very happy to report it does.  Simply put, the sound is spectacular.  The use of the surround channels is well done too.<br />In addition to the wonderful sound, each cut is accompanied with a set of pictures, credits, and lyrics that can be viewed on a TV while listening to the music.  It's amusing -grin- to see how what is actually sung doesn't always agree with the printed words.   The liner notes are surprisingly lengthy and interesting.  The DVD also includes five short videos (&quot;low-fi&quot; -grin- &quot;stereo&quot;) filmed no doubt in the 70's.  All and all, this is a highly recommended upgrade to the conventional stereo versions.<br />I'm very much hoping that DVD-Audio will take off.  I have listened carefully to Dolby Digital, DTS, LP, CD stereo, Super Audio DVD stereo, HDCD, and now DVD-Audio.  DVD-Audio is the clear winner; although, Super Audio DVD and HDCD deserve honorable mentions.<br />BTW, if anyone is looking to upgrade their DVD player, take a look at the Toshiba 4700 or 5700.  Both have DVD-Audio.  The 5700 has HDCD too. <br />George
6305165912|5.0|I suppose the thing that sold me for a second viewing was the ash spreading on the cliff.  Watching the ever-so-still Lebowski take it all over the place.  I fell off my seat.  I rented it, then bought it after a few rentals.  Every time I watch the movie, I catch a line or two I hadn't before that makes me lose it.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|The release of The Rainbow Children is significant for several reasons: it's the first album Prince has released since reclaiming his given name after nearly seven years as a symbol, it's at once the most spiritually-minded and least commercially-minded collection he's ever produced (besting 1988's Lovesexy for each of these distinctions) and, most importantly, it's one of the greatest works he's ever created.<br />The album's narrator -- Prince with his voice slowed down so much that he's nearly unintelligible at times -- gets things underway by intoning, &quot;With accurate understanding of God and his law, they went about the work of building a new nation...the Rainbow Children.&quot;<br />Thus begins an epic 70-minute cycle of narrative songs and segues recounting the Rainbow Children's struggles to do &quot;The Work&quot; necessary to destroy the &quot;Digital Garden&quot; that keeps us from God and, instead, birth &quot;The Everlasting Now.&quot; (In a move that seems appropriate, the song titles are dubbed &quot;chapters&quot; and these comprise three of the 14.)<br />The album is unabashed in its Christian theology (&quot;In the name of the Father, in the name of the Son...&quot;), but its clarion calls for love and tolerance can be embraced by listeners of all stripes (&quot;...we need to come together as one&quot;). Still, even those who aren't interested in Prince's soul-full pursuits should give the album a chance because The Rainbow Children is the joyful noise of a master working at the peak of his powers.<br />Obviously recorded live in the studio, the album features some of Prince's most inspired electric guitar playing combined with the amazing drumming of secret ingredient John Blackwell. It's a marvel to behold as the pair effortlessly peels off dense jazz structures, butt-shaking funk, theatrical rock and feathery soul ballads -- all while tackling some pretty heavy issues.<br />Rollicking cut &quot;Family Name&quot; examines the loss of identitysuffered by African-Americans as a result of slavery. Prince lays it out for those who don't understand: &quot;You might say 'what you mad about?' But you've still got your family name.&quot; Along the way he also speaks out for indigenous Americans, challenges money grubbing preachers and ties the whole thing up with a sample of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s most famous call for unity. It's a funk-rock tour-de-force.<br />By the time The Rainbow Children closes with the gorgeous &quot;Last December,&quot; one can't help but wonder if Prince was merely coasting these last few years, waiting for his contentious contracts with Warner Bros. to expire. We'll likely never know, but whatever caused those musical missteps, his ship is now fully righted and sailing toward musical adventures unknown but pregnant with brilliant possibilities.
1587990717|5.0|Dr. Taleb is a financial trader, one who uses math, specifically probability, to improve his results.  He points out flaws in the way we think about probability, and he is oh so right. To get his message we don't need to know any more math than the average 12 year old, if that.  This book will not make you rich, but if you are at all involved in the financial markets you will almost certainly see some mistakes you are making. Certainly I did. You will also learn how to avoid wasting a lot of time on &quot;news&quot;.  Dr. Taleb's stories about his ancestors, historical figures, and his associates are amusing too, and help to make his points. Dr. Taleb himself comes across as an effete intellectual snob, which undoubtedly caused some of the less positive reviews here, but that is part of the fun of the book.
B000002HHB|5.0|I remember when I was 15 when Tigerlily came out and when I bought Tigerlily, I was so head over heels this album.  Two weeks ago, I know that Natalie Merchant has sold 5 million copies of this most successful and overly-criticized album to date.  Some wonderful songs on this album is &quot;Beloved Wife&quot;, an ode to a husband's wife, (written about Natalie's grandfather), Carnival, Wonder (she has tinkled this song so many times in concert and it is magnificently awesome), and Seven Years.  A terrific album all around, and would suggest it to anybody, this album shows inspiration, dedication, and talent.
B00004Z459|1.0|It's a shame that the evil music industry has expanded its reach to nearly every genere of music. They got rap (Master P, Eminem), they got metal (Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach) and they even took out my beloved punk rock (blink-182, Offspring). I think I understand what \\"Hybrid Theory\\" is all about though...they managed to create a hybrid of the unimaginative rap and weak metal and create Linkin Park. Now let's wrap it up and send it out to all the teeney boppers out there in MTV land! Does anyone find it strange that this band has no previous releases? They just got snatched up by some label and thrown out into the market after recording an alblum full of uninspired, weak lyrics and unimpressive guitar riffs. ONE ALBLUM PEOPLE. How good can any band be with only one disc under their belt? At least blink-182 put out some punk rock records before they got big and sold out. Linkin Park just showed up and sold out. This band will soon be forgotten. Twenty years from now, no one will be buying Linkin Park records. They will be long forgotten by whatever metal-heads still remain. However, people will still be buying records by the likes of Rage Against the Machine, Pennywise and NOFX. [...]
0856610798|5.0|I think I have all the guides to the birds of East Africa in the last 30 years, but this most recent by Terry Stevenson and John Fanshawe is certainly the most comprehensive, artistically excellent and usable. Ber van Perlo's Collins Illustrated Checklist &quot;Birds of Eastern Africa&quot; is smaller and lighterweight but no comparison, nor intended to be, in description or plate detail.  This new volume, with a 2002(!) publication date has amongst the best plates and abbreviated descriptions, in my opinion, ever published in a comparable volume on birds.  Artists John Gale and Brian Small are fabulous (Norman Arlott lacks their skills, but does his subjects justice as well). It is a exceedingly worthwhile complement to Dale Zimmerman's larger format &quot;Birds of Kenya and northern Tanzania&quot; and includes all of Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi as well. Don't miss this book!
078062369X|2.0|My thoughts at the beginning of the movie ran along the lines of a confused &quot;ok...&quot;<br />Basically the storyline goes that Blade (Snipes) goes around trying to kill vampires in modern cities. However the vampires seem to be fighting amongst themselves too - one particularly bad vampire named Frost overthrows the other vampires and tries to get himself to become a blood god or somesuch. I really didn't get what was going on with that - and I'm not sure I was meant to either.<br />Anyway this movie offers some handy tips on vampire combat: crosses don't work, garlic and silver do.<br />Snipes performs to his usual average standard of acting and puts up a mediochre performance, except in the fight scenes which turn out pretty well. He fails to display much emotion besides hatred for vampires. However, his outfit in the movie is a plus.<br />A pretty typical storyline and an average cast is offset by decent special FX and some good fightscenes - not worth paying money to watch.
B000002J5K|5.0|When the Blues Brothers movie came out (not the 2000 sequel better left unseen), audiences had known the characters from Saturday Night Live.  The movie today remains immensely popular, in part to the music performed by the amazing cast, both featured and cameo roles.  Aretha Franklin's Think, James Brown's performance as a reverend, Ray Charles' effort Shake Your Tail Feather, Cab Calloway's Minnie the Moocher- all of them are great to listen to with the volume up, and when the Blues Brothers of Dan Ackroyd and John Belushi get going, the rhythm lasts all the way through the CD.  <BR>As a soundtrack, this has to be one of the best ever, and one of the best-selling.  This CD is one of my favorites, and holds its own against any effort put out today by any compilation effort.  Buying this will make you very happy.

0743200748|4.0|If you have read several of Stephen Ambrose's books, you will be reading excerpts from several of them in this short compilation-style book.  There are some new chapters that deal with people Ambrose has been freinds with for several years, but the overall goal of the book is to allow a reader to see the value of bonds of friendship among men in history.  Examples include Dwight and Milton eisenhower, people of Easy Comapny (Band of Brothers), Custer and Sitting Bull, and others.  This moves quickly, since it is not in-depth, and can be read in one evening if really attempted.  The writing is sharp and lyrical, well-done, but readers should not expect a thick, detailed effort more common in all of Ambrose's works.  Call this one the greatest hits, or even the &quot;flashback&quot; book, such as TV shows use to look back on their long run of shows and their favorite moments.
0805047905|5.0|I bought this book in Spanish (I don't believe it gains or loses anything in the translation) before my son was born.  He loves it!

I highly recommend this for young children, as I do many of Eric Carle's books.

B00003CXTG|5.0|This new Movie of Pearl Harbor is one of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time.  I had been hoping it would come out on DVD for Christmas 2001.  I dont mind that it is a three hour movie. Its well worth the time.  The charters are out standing, the sences are great. Ben, Kate and Josh are wonderful together. I dont mind that some men called it a film for women. I give this movie a FIVE STAR rateing.
6304510861|5.0|I found this to be one of Lynch's best movies, and also one of his easiest to understand.  Does that mean I'm more intelligent?  No.  The problem with this movie is people either praise it as an abstract puzzle that makes you think but can never be fully understood, or they hate it because it makes no sense.  This is not an art film, or some abstract jumble of images.  Don't let Amazon's review fool you; there is a plot here, and it's a very intriguing crime/thriller/mystery plot.  You don't need to be an artsy wannabe or a scholar to watch this movie, you just have to pay attention.  One line in this movie explains everything (it's near the beginning).  It doesn't hurt to know what a psychogenic fugue is, though (go look it up).<br />Anyhoo, this is Lynch at his BLUE VELVET best.  The first part of the movie is creepy enough to make anyone pull their blinds and lock their doors.  The second part of the movie is a great crime/thriller story.  This movie is for people who loved BLUE VELVET, MEMENTO, and even SNATCH, and who also saw what WILD AT HEART could have been.  This movie also has one of the best soundtracks ever made.<br />It's got its share of slightly confusing scenes and a metaphor or three thrown in, but even if you ignore those elements, this is still a great movie...just pay attention.
0800141806|5.0|Great movie, great actors. This movie stars acadamy award winner Tom Hanks and NAACP award winner Denzel Washington. Tom Hanks plays a homosexual lawyer and Denzel Washington plays a lawyer who is unsure of his masculinity. This movie is a must see.
B000003TAW|5.0|I love this CD so much! I'll admit that I'm among the &quot;new wave&quot; of Weezer fans... I only pulled the Blue Album out of my collection after I got sick of the Green Album.. but I've found it to be so much better. It's not nearly as poppy as the new CD, and all of the songs on it are great. I find myself singing bits of them throughout the day.<br />My favorite 2 songs on this album are &quot;Undone&quot; (it's so original, and it doesn't sound like anything else Weezer or anyone else has done... plus it's so catchy) and &quot;No One Else&quot; (this one is so much fun to sing along to.. I can't see why no one else likes it.) Some of the other highlights are, of course, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, &quot;The World has Turned and Left Me Here&quot;, and &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot;.<br />Before you judge Weezer's music as good or bad, you have to buy this CD. Get Pinkerton too. They're both a lot better than the Green Album and show the bands musical/songwriting talent.

B000002J27|5.0|The Lyrics and music in this masterpiece seem to come from another world. This is music to listen to and not miss any detail. Since I played this CD I instantly realized it will be with me until the last day of my life. If you miss this album, you will miss the best of Genesis (and music in general) ever. Being in Cuba, years ago, a heard somebody call Genesis &quot;the best band in the world&quot;. Then, I had listened to some Genesis hits in the FM. Someday, somebody sold to me an old tape that he had recorded from an LP. The recording in that tape was &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; by Genesis. When I played the tape I was confused. It was Phil Collins's voice, but it did not sound like Genesis at all. The tape finally failed to play well and I missed the music. When I came to the U.S. and got the CD, then played it in a 200 Watts stereo, it sounded like music from the stars. I highly recommend buying this CD.
052594527X|5.0|After reading &quot;Falling Angels&quot; and totally falling in love with Tracy Chevalier's writing style, I just had to go back and read the best seller &quot;...Pearl Earing.&quot;  I was not disappointed.  I usually stay away from period pieces and cannot usually enjoy reading about any period of time before I was born (maybe it's because I find it hard to identify with it), but these two books were so worth the read.  Pearl Earing takes place in the 1600's (exactly 300 years before I was born, mind you!!) and it is a fictional telling of how Vermeer's famous painting came to be.  The actual painting doesn't take place until nearly the end of the book and then it sort of felt rushed, but as the reader, I didn't feel cheated of anything.  It didn't seem like any part of the puzzle was missing.  I did think the exact ending was a little predictable and neatly wrapped up, but other than that, I thought the book was fantastic.  I anxiously await the next piece of fiction from Ms. Chevelier and thank her for drawing me into stories that take place before I was born.  I can now get a history lesson while I am doing one of my favorite pastimes (reading).  If you enjoy period pieces or modern romances or stories about strong women - A Girl With the Pearl Earing is the book for you.  At less than 250 pages and small in size, it's a breeze of a read - You'll be begging for more and counting the months until Ms. Chevelier publishes her 3rd &amp; next novel!!
B000000JO3|5.0|Timeless. Essential. Classic. Minor Threat blew open the doors and took hardcore to new heights. No one will ever be able to rock as raw, hard, and true as they did. Anyone reading this review should not EVEN question the album's integrity and just buy it. 'Nuff said.
0684853523|5.0|I should begin by saying that this is the only novel by King that I've read.  The subject matter was of interest to me, and since the text had received such promising reviews, I decided to give it a try.  <br />Straight up:  I found the book informative, practical, and entertaining.  And even though I haven't read many, I have to say that this is the only text on the subject that I can recommend to anyone.  &quot;Most&quot; of the time texts on this subject are a waste of hard-earned bills--King's work being the exception.<br />King tells the plain simple truth about writing--there is no easy way around it:  read and write as much as possible.  Along the way he manages to keep the material practical and engaging.<br />I highly recommend this read to anyone interested.
B00005RFAI|5.0|You won't find a single disappointing on here! The best songs in my opinion are M!ssundaztood cuz its the kind of upbeat pop song you listen to at the beach during summer, Just Like a Pill 'cuz  it lets people know how confused she is about her relationships, Respect feat. Scratch from The Roots because it reminds me of the songs on her first album Can't Take me Home with its hyper beat and hardcore feel, Misery feat. Steven Tyler cuz their voices blend very well and sound nice. I think anybody who loves real music, and not teen pop, should get this. Pink has proven herself, she really has.
B0000508U6|5.0|this is an absolute must-have! I don't have a wordy, &quot;music editorial&quot;-esque description for this CD, but instead, I am going to ask you to get this CD, even if it means having to donate a pint or two of blood to save up the cash.

B00005OAJ1|5.0|Why waste more words on deconstructing this album than Tenacious D themselves would? It's hilarious, and the tunes really stick in your head (sometimes to an irritating degree). Appreciate the strings, falsettos, and lyrics in all their mock-cliched glory. This is a funny album, plain and simple.
B000002JNJ|4.0|Those of you that said that this is Pantera's first or debut album are sooo wrong it's not even funny. Ever heard of &quot;Metal Magic&quot; or &quot;Projects In The Jungle&quot;?<br />I didn't think so. And you call yourselves fans.<br />This is a great album but by far not their first. Get your facts straight.
B00003CXXS|1.0|This was so bad. The Acting, The Special Effects, and The Story were all just horrible.<br />Let's Start with The Acting, that is really a real come down from the first two movies. Sam Neil is a great actor but in this movie, he is as bad as the material. He is no where as good as he was in the first film, and unfortunately he character was not that interesting in the first film anyway.( He should be ashamed of himself) William H Macy Is some what decent but he himself becomes Annoying after while. The true horror is Tea Leoni, who plays probably the most Annoying character ever conceived. You yourself would be cheering for the Dinosaurs to kill this woman.<br />The Special Effects are extremely dismal, Even for a Dinosaur film. At one point, The Spino Looks as big rubber puppet (Yes, that bad) and Changes Sizes through out the film. The Island itself looks like it was filmed in a Suburban park. It's nothing like the beauty and the savagery that was in The Lost World, and it's the same island.<br />The Story is probably the most offensive part of the whole movie. There is no logic or common sense to be found in this story. It does not even follow the first two movies, and it's a sequel .The characters are just too stupid for words, and their reasoning for being on the island has to be one of the worse ideas of the history of bad ideas. The end thou is really the most offensive ending ever made because it just ends. It's merciful considering how bad this movie was, but there is no climax. It just ends with out warning, and with out pity. Like the film makers were trying to spare us from the worse thing ever viewed on screen. If they wanted to be merciful, they should have never made this movie. A movie that Spits in the face of every thing that made the first two so great.<br />Not Even worth a rental.
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is the greatest epic ever filmed. Back in the day when religious and historical epics were more abundant, this one stood out above the rest. With the passage of time it's reputation and standing have only increased. It's amazing to think that David Lean could sustain this level of brilliance for three movies in a row. It as a tour de force in every way. The directing is wonderful, the writing, the editing, the acting. There really aren't enough good things to say about this movie. If you have never seen it, you are in for a treat. It is as visually entertaining as you will ever see. It truly is the standard by which all large scale movies should be judged. It takes more than just a big budget to make an epic, you need a larger than life character, great story, and it has to be presented in an interesting way. David Lean and Peter O'Toole bring everything that they have to this movie. A Stunning achievment of the highest level. They're aren't enough stars to give out for this one. See it. You won't regret it.

B00005QCVY|5.0|The quality of the Its A Wonderful Life DVD is crisp and clear. This is my all time favorite movie and gets better with every viewing. The story of everyman George Bailey is one of hope and encouragement. He helps others at his own expense and is beloved in town. It takes an Angel to show George what life would have been like if he had never been born. James Stewart & Donna Reed are wonderful in the roles of the Baileys and are believable as a couple madly in love with each other and life itself. Watch for the cameo of Alfalfa from the OUR GANG comedies!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite animated movies, up qith Antz, Beauty &amp; the Best and Mulan.  I look for movies with strong female characters, or at least strong individuals.  Shrek contains both.<br />Shrek is an unlikely hero, an antisocial [troll ogre] who lives in a swamp away from people.  He doesn't have any friends, but soon his lonely swamp becomes home to dozens of fairytale creatures that have been pushed out of the rest of the world.  Similarly, he is pushed into helping them out, along with the help of a donkey sidekick.  He ends up saving a beautiful princess in a tower.<br />Sounds pretty typical right?  Well, the princess isn't exactly typical.  She likes his sense of humor and seems to be pretty laidback herself - nothing like they'd expect from a princess.  He ends up following in love with her, and vice versa.<br />I don't want to spoil the movie for you, so I won't give you the whole plot.  Let's just say things don't end up how you expect.  I left the theater with a big smile on my face - the movie ended even better than I could have expected.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Being a big fan of Disney, I was skeptical of Shrek at first.  But it took no time for me to change my tune.  This movie will suck you in early and never let go.  The casting could not be better.  Eddie Murphy is the perfect role for the donkey.  The story is a great one with an even better message for children and adults alike!  The music is fantastic (check out the soundtrack) and the special features on this 2 disc set make it an extraordinary value.  Trust me, you and your family will enjoy this DVD over and over and over again.

From the second i listend to it i thought i must have had the wrong cd.  Yeah, in some of the songs she has a good voice, but the is no rythem and the lyrics are horrible.  It is a complete waist of money and people should pay you to listen to it.  DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!
0451204530|4.0|I really think the idea behind this novel is spectacular.  A man wakes up one morning in Washington DC, dressed like a bum, not knowing who he is.  Turns out he is a NASA bigwig, and he has something to do with the apace race.<br />Set in the 40's and 50's, the book is true to its setting, though there are a few mistakes.  This could just be Follet changing history through fiction, so I can let that slide.<br />What makes this book work is the superb characterization and background story that keeps you interested.  Obviously, Follet knows what he is doing, and his strong points definitely overshadow the few mistakes and glitches.<br />If you like this sort of novel, try:<BR>The Sigma Protocol, by Robert Ludlum<BR>Soft Case, by John Misak
B00003CY5I|4.0|The SCORE brings together arguably the best actors from three separate generations. While all are at their peak in this enjoyable movie, Edward Norton steals the show.  I am never shocked but often suprised by the amount of talent that Norton has.  This movie is somewhat of a pattern film, but it is the joining of talent that makes it worthwhile.  Norton's performance alone is enough to make it worthwhile.  Meanwhile, De Niro is the centerpiece of this movie and is brilliant as ever. Finally, as a younger viewer it was great to see Marlon Brando on the Big Screen for the first time.  What a group of actors!
0694524476|5.0|I haven't been so moved by a story of courage and destiny since Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea. This is the type of book that not only adds hope and vision to it's readers, but it also adds hope to the literary world. So many other authors fall short of this type of inspiration in their stories. Coelho has established a new standard among all authors who dare to inspire their readers. It's no wonder why this book is an international best seller.<br />I guarantee your life, as well as your standard for good literature, will change after reading this book.<br />Nate

0345448898|5.0|It is hard to believe that Pullman's trilogy would be classified alongside books dealing with the trials and tribulations of dating and adolescent maturation. Although the protagonist Lyra surely matures throughout the three novels, there is SO MUCH MORE to be gained from reading these remarkable books than I would have dared to fathom had I read them as a &quot;young adult.&quot; To give away the political and religious allegories would be criminal, but suffice to say, these are probably the best books I have read in this genre--equal, if not in some cases surpassing: The Chronicles of Narnia, The Ring Trilogy, and Harry Potter.<br />The second book, the Subtle Knife, is a little less in the way of character development than the Golden Compass, but it was definitely to Pullman's advantage to wait as long as he did to write the Amber Spyglass. Unlike other sequels and series, this conclusion to the trilogy does not disappoint and only makes you wish it wasn't the conclusion.<br />You will inevitably find the character(s) you identify with most and be rooting for that character throughout your reading.  However, be warned: Pullman does not feel it necessary to have happy endings for everyone and every circumstance.  Herein lies the true value of these books...the harshness and elation to be found in reality, in a fantasy context.

0060977264|5.0|As he did with the Alchemist, Coelho once again demonstrates his ability to create ultimately human protagonists struggling with issues of the divine and ethereal.<br />Pilar's sojourn is not foriegn to anyone who has done any kind of soul-searching. Coelho's language is poetic, but always sincere and truthful. This book is for those who recognize struggles as a part of life, but have optimism for the end of the journey.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie Minogue has put out her best and most delicious CD in her newest releese &quot;FEVER&quot;.  Hopefully, the powers that be expose this wonderful CD to the US MARKET. Cant get you out of my head and More, More, More are stand out tracks. But, unlike other Kylie efforts; this CD sounds freash and consistent throughout. This is ONE OF THE Top CD's of 2001. BUY IT !!!!!!!!  <br />Unlike certain fake chested, manufactured, lip singing, former Micky Mouse club singers; the SULTRY and SEXY Minogue is for real.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I saw this movie first in the theaters and I absolutely loved it.  So much so, that I had to buy the special edition.  It is a great movie to own for kids and adults alike.  It is funny and has some adult humor that kids won't get that I loved.  Buy this one if any!
B000000M4M|5.0|This album changed my entire view of music. Most alternative (meaning anything not hair-metal or classic rock) seemed like ugly noise to me back in the late 80's. Then I heard this. What the hell is he doing half-way through 'No Bones'? It is the most raucous, sickening, beautiful thing I've ever heard. I was never the same--thankfully--again. Most would argue that Green Mind is their best. If you like slaved over, polished pop singles then Green Mind is their best. But if you have any sense of the wants, the needs, the lust and loss involved in the human condition, Bug is gonna getcha. Despite length and number of songs, Bug is a better value than any box set. If you want some good sound, check it out.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|This, Adams' second solo effort, is, quite simply, an excellent effort and a nice progression from the inconsistency of Heartbreaker.  It is a tempered set of songs, sometimes rollicking, but more often, soulful and slow, without a weak song among the batch. This record, as with earlier Whiskeytown efforts and Heartbreaker, however, does suffer from some spotty production, with inconsistent volume levels, intruments and vocals lost in the mix, etc. A relatively minor annoyance when compared with the strength of the disc.<br />I have read the other reviews posted here and note the tell-tale backlash from the alt-country police. For those of you unfamiliar with Whiskeytown or Adams, I would recommend that you take negative reviews with a large grain of salt.  Adams was originally touted as the savior of alt-country after Mark Olson left the Jayhawks and Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy split Uncle Tupelo.  Those bands, especially Uncle Tupelo, have many fans who support the defunct band with Dead-head like ardor and will denounce anyone who is compared to the band or its principals as inferior wanna-be's (picture someone with their hands over their ears, humming loudly and saying &quot;I can't hear you&quot;).  They are not exactly open-minded.<br />Get this disc--it won't disappoint.
B00005N83M|3.0|Too much dubbing on this one, to cover a bad voice?  I don't know..but she sounds like the rest of them..Christina, Brittany etc...there's really no originality here..I will give a thumbs up on the remix of I'M REAL..I have to say, when I heard that song, I didn't know it was her, I really liked the song a catchy beat..a pretty song.  When I found out it was Jennifer, I was amazed!
B00005QG9J|5.0|What can i say about Incubus; they've done it again!! &quot;Morning View&quot; is a great cd. They seem to get better every time. My personal favorites on this cd are &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;,&quot;Mexico&quot;, and &quot;Echo&quot;. I highly recommend this album to anyone because off its spectrum of sounds shown throughout the album.
B00005QW9V|5.0|Saw it in the theaters 3 times!!!  This movie will be a cult classic along the lines of &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot;<BR>The acting is very good.  The music is really great even if you are not a huge rock fan.
0780622650|1.0|Utterly tragic. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.<BR>The plot is ridiculous, the characters are weak. Underneath all the eye candy is a rotton apple.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This CD is a sample of the different directions Madonna has taken on her musical career. From the hip-hop of &quot;Human Nature&quot; to the R&amp;B of &quot;Take a bow&quot; to the Techno-country of &quot;Don't tell me&quot;. Each and every song from this album is different from the next; making evident the talent of the most adapting and trend-setting woman in show bussiness today. <BR>Take a look to the music of other so-called divas like Jennifer Lopez o even &quot;Princess&quot; Britney.. they all sound the same, the same beat, vocal style, lyrics. With Madonna there has been the element of surprise, innovation. Every album had a unifying theme. With this CD the theme is the diversity of her choices. If it is the first record you buy or the n-th, this is a must-have. You will experience why 17 years after her first single, she's still on the charts and with no end in sight. Hail to Queen Madonna!
0783240236|5.0|I love having this movie on DVD now!  Lots of nice extras on the disc, and great quality picture! I've always thought the acting in this Hitchcock film was top-notch! There's Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Jessica Tandy, and (one of my favorite actresses) Suzanne Pleshette. All do quite well here.  This movie evidently was very difficult to make [from a special-effects point-of-view], with hundreds of &quot;trick&quot; shots throughout the picture. There are no computer-generated shots in this one, making the viewer appreciate all the more what Hitch was able to accomplish on screen!  He creates a feeling of real tension and apprehension as the film progresses.  My favorite scene is the one set in the town's diner. There are no birds in this scene, but Hitchcock manages to invoke fear in us merely with dialogue during this fascinating scene! Resident &quot;bird expert&quot;, Mrs. Bundy [played by Ethel Griffies], steals this scene, in my opinion, with several authoritative remarks concerning our feathered friends, that serve to increase our anxiety greatly; i.e., &quot;I've never known birds of different species to flock together. Why, if that happened, we wouldn't stand a chance! How could we hope to fight them!?&quot;  The DVD version also treats us to an alternate ending for the picture.  The Birds is another in a long line of Alfred Hitchcock gems. Oh, Hitch, how we miss you!
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is my favorite record released by Tool.  This album is incredible.  It is obvious that every ounce of energy, thought and creativity have been put into this, with fantastic results.  Maynard's voice is amazing.  Danny Carey's drumming is brutal.  Adam Jones is my prediction for best guitarist of the decade unless we get somebody like Hendrix or Corgan in the next ten years.  Justin's bass is an essential part of the music and it interacts with the guitar in a new and fresh way.<br />To listen to this album in it's entirety is a gift from God.  I bought this disc in it's second week out and at first I was so shocked by the diversity of it and how different it was from my then-preferred &quot;modern rock,&quot; I couldn't really conceive it.  But that Saturday, I closed my door, turned the lights out and pushed play.<br />80 minutes later I was transformed.<br />This CD takes you on a journey.  This album is MUSIC, my friends.  REAL MUSIC.  If you're looking for popular angry boys with splitting headaches, or if you're buying a CD to put on display for your Limp Bizkit fantatic friends, perhaps you should do a search on Linkin Park.  If you want to be electricuted with powerful and moving music, if you want to have an experience, if you want to expand your tastes and love for music, I suggest you buy Lateralus.
0345448898|4.0|This is supposed to be a twist on Milton. I can't comment on that, as I've never read Paradise Lost, but it is an interesting work. Catholics appear to be angry at the depiction of the Church, but seem to miss the idea that the Church in this series seems more Calvinist than Catholic, so I'm surprised there hasn't been more Presbyterians up in arms over it. In any case, Christianity hasn't always been the world's greatest influence, and drawing a picture of a Church that controls science will make people who know history think of Galileo and other scientific \\"heretics\\", with heresy of course being defined as going against the doctrine of the Church. I suggest that if you plan on reading this and are deeply religious, examine yourself first to see if you can think about something contradicting your beliefs. Try Job: A Comedy of Justice by Robert Heinlein as a warmup. If you don't have a problem with Heinlein's depiction of God in that book, then you shouldn't have a problem with Pullman's. <br />Feminists are angry that Lyra is such a strong character in book one, and then Will has to help her out in the next two books. Well, if I were to fall through into a completely different world, I think I'd need some coaching on what is safe and what isn't too. Just because Pullman has the characters in his world say that \\"women can't be Scholars\\" and other things, does not mean that he is a misogynist. Lyra could not work as a character had she been raised differently. People, please realize that an author does not have to believe everything he writes. I haven't ever read an interview with Pullman, but I doubt that he holds all the views on women and religion that he has written in this series.<br />To those that say that there is nothing really new in here, I ask you to remember that there are very few works created that do not have the feel or even the influence from other works. I suggest that you do what one reviewer suggested and go and look up those references, as thenyou will have learned something new and have an idea where Pullman got these ideas from. <br />Admittedly, there are some plot holes and some things that sound like quasi-physics. I don't feel like going into them as there are plenty of other reviewers who hated the series to tell you exactly what they are.  <br />To those comparing Pullman with Tolkien and C.S. Lewis--here's a novel idea, he's neither. All of Lewis' fiction is deeply religious, with all of his works having Christian allegory. Don't try to tell me Aslan is not a Christ figure, or that most of the Peralanda trilogy seems to be a retelling of the Adam and Eve story, but with evil not getting a foothold in the world. Tolkien helped set the standard for fantasy, and his world is so well-developed and realized that comparisions against him are often unfair. Tolkien was also deeply religious but it didn't make it into his work in as blatant a manner as Lewis'. It is quite clear that Pullman in the book is unhappy with the power Christianity has in the world. <br />When it comes to the daemons, maybe Pullman could have come up with something better than just using the ae dipthong as a substitue for demon. Nevertheless, a person's daemon is their soul. They also seem to be both a foil and a reflection of that person's characteristics. That's why it makes sense that cutting someone off from their daemon makes them a shadow of who they were and why they die. Get some kid to explain to you what digimon are and then you'll have another idea of what the daemons are like, but without the actual physical and psychological connection. I personally think it could be troublesome to have your soul revealed to the world, but it is still an interesting idea. <br />The story does seem to drag at points, and the marketing of this as a children's book could be questionable, unless the kid was reading the aforementioned Tolkien and Lewis at a young age and as capable of understanding the violence and some of the confusion of the books. If you are a responsible parent, and actually take an active interest in what your child does and sees, better read it first.<br />To those who say the ending is contrived I say to you to go watch Escaflowne (subtitled of course). These kids are supposed to be humanity's great chance to make itself better. The fate of the world resting on a couple people, kids or adults, is a common enough device that you should have run into it somewhere before. Remember, this is supposed to be a twist on Paradise Lost, and the idea is that Adam and Eve (...) it up, but Lyra and Will get it right. It seems to me that the people complaining of this have not had enough exposure to the idea.<br />I love how all these people are saying that \\"it's bad for impressionable children.\\" Remember, when it's Nazism or Communism, it's brainwashing, when it's religion, it's instilling moral values. <br />Bottom line: You'll probably either love or hate this series. The ending indeed could have used some work. Pullman wasn't as tight with his ideas as he needed to be to really make the series work well. But overall, give it a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised.<br />
B000000OR9|4.0|Although you'd never know it from watching any of the Whitesnake videos that dominated much of MTV's programming in the mid-80's, John Sykes was the real genius behind the enormous success of Whitesnake &quot;Whitesnake.&quot; On Blue Murder's self-titled debut album, Sykes' brilliance as a singer, songrwriter and guitar player is all too evident and, in fact, makes you wonder why David Coverdale REALLY wanted him out of the band. <br />All I can say is thank goodness the other members of Blue Murder talked John into taking over all the lead vocal duties. On every track of this album, his voice soars with serious expression and just the right amount of '80's arena rock bravado, showing there's a lot more to him than just a fierce set of fingers. From &quot;Riot&quot; to &quot;Jelly Roll,&quot; Blue Murder roars through this well-written set of songs with all the power, passion, chops and authority you'd expect from an immensely talented power trio. An incredibly underrated album!
B000003BEM|5.0|The weakest song on this album is &quot;Jigsaw Puzzle,&quot; with an extremely wordy, obviously Dylan-derivative lyric that seems to go on forever without really saying much that the Stones don't say much better in elsewhere.  But even &quot;Jigsaw Puzzle&quot; is saved by brilliant playing:  Brian Jones's deliriously grungy slide guitar, which if you listen close is doubled by a piano playing the same notes in somehow the exact same tone.  Play it on headphones and hear how over the course of the song the piano gradually slips out from behind the slide guitar to claim its own licks.<br />The rest of the songs are drop-dead classics.  Dig:  &quot;Sympathy For The Devil.&quot;  Praising this would be gilding the lily, but still, dig that fat bass sound, those wild &quot;ooh-oohs,&quot; the percussion that just won't quit.  It's a classic, epic Stones track, and then you step back and realize just how weird it is.  And then you start dancing again.<br />&quot;Street Fighting Man.&quot;  This album signalled their return to ballsy rock, but listen closely to this and you realize what they gained from their psychedelic experiments.  That sitar-sounding thing droning in and out of the mix, always threatening to break out;  that one-sustained-note saxophone-sounding thing at the end of the song.  It's a very carefully constructed sound, as well as a definitive Stones rocker.<br />&quot;Salt Of The Earth.&quot;  A sentimental glass raised to the working class, gospel choruses and all.  But check out the bridge:  all those common people &quot;don't look real to me.&quot;  Is this song about identification or alienation?<br />&quot;Factory Girl.&quot;  Maybe the most beautiful thing they've ever done, the most feeling, sensitive thing--or maybe it was just tossed off.  Either way, it's perfect.<br />&quot;Stray Cat Blues.&quot;  Check out Mick's nasty little squeal just before the song kicks in.  THAT is the Rolling Stones.<br />It's all here.  This is the Stones we know andlove.  Bet their mamas didn't know they scratched like that.
0684869713|1.0|Ayn Rand was a phenomenal salesperson. If you had a dollar in your pocket, this woman could convince you it was really hers, and make you feel guilty for stealing from her poor orphan mouth.  She employs the magic of literature -- by which the reader identifies with the hero and trustingly enters the author's make-believe universe -- to manipulate, confuse, and recondition her unsuspecting victims. You will walk away from this book a bloodthirsty, heartless vampire -- and think that the world, not you, is warped.<br />The title comes from a line in the book that &quot;man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.&quot; Rand's agenda is to convince you that man, not God, is responsible for human greatness. Furthermore, she stresses that any authority which does not recognize the supremacy of the individual's ego is an evil tyrrany (God being the unidentified exemplar of this dictatorial regime).<br />Howard Roark is an architect. He likes to build really tall towers. The Man has it in for him, wants to oppress his revolutionary genius and prevent him from becoming rich and happy. So Roark thumbs his nose at the System, and blazes his own trail...<br />This is the Satanic Bible that Anton LaVey only wishes he could write. I know that sounds crazy but when you find yourself knifing your friends &quot;for their own good,&quot; you'll know what I mean.
B000056V73|3.0|As a fan of most of Cameron Crowe's other work, I was somewhat disappointed with this movie.  It wasn't terrible or the worst movie of the year as some reviewers here seem to think.  It also wasnt' great or one of the best of the year.  It was good, but I also thought it was very boring.  The acting was outstanding by Crudup, Fugit, Hudson, McDormand, and Seymour Hoffman.  The screenplay was good, I was very happy to see Cameron Crowe finally win an award.  He won the Oscar for best screenplay.<br />The idea of this movie really seemed like a good one to me, and when I first watched the movie, I was pretty happy with the outcome.  Then recently I watched it again and was bored.  I kept saying, did i really like this?  It just seemed so lame and to not be going anywhere.  Maybe it just isn't one of the movies, for me anyway, that I can view repeatedly. The music I could certainly listen to over and over.  The soundtrack is better than the movie.<br />I just thought the story was really not all that interesting or entertaining.  It seemed to drag, and it wasn't particularly funny.  If it was supposed to be, I don't know where I was supposed to laugh.<br />It's certainly worth a look at for the great acting and soundtrack and screenplay.  It's just not all that fun to watch.  I compare it to another Crowe movie, Jerry McGuire.  This movie had so much hype, like Almost, and when I saw it in the theaters, I fell asleep!!! I am a woman, and I love romance comedies.  I didn't think either of these films were much of either but more of a sleep aid.<br />I think Crowe's best work was Singles and Say Anything.  They were both very entertaining comedies.
B000000H6D|5.0|Absolutely this band has a dark and delightful sense of humour, absolutely this band is capable of an awesome heavy, melancholic sound... This is easily my favourite album by Type O Negative - I was quite disappointed with the follow-up album 'October Rust'. I love 'Suspended in Dusk' and the cute, dark and funny 'Black No. 1', but the song that really did it for me (I still wish the band would match it) is the supremely sexy 'Christian Woman'. With a combination of beautiful heavy power, sending up the xtian 'love of jesus', and Pete Steele's awesome voice that goes through you at its most deep and gorgeous, this song is perfect. In my opinion, 'Bloody Kisses' would be worth buying for that track alone, but as it happens, the rest of the album is great too. Beauty, blood, darkness and the occasional interspersing of wicked humour. Sickpretty and divine.
B00005B6NC|1.0|TO ME THIS WAS A WAST OF MONEY . IT IS THE MOST BOREING FILM I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS
B00003CWL6|5.0|At a truly moving film.<br />Look Closer.....<br />At an amazing actor playing an amazing character.<br />Look Closer.....<br />At a flawless performance from Kevin Spacey (as usual)<br />Look Closer.....<br />At a movie that not many people could appreciate.<br />Look Closer.....<br />At American Beauty.
B00000IN5G|5.0|Let me just say that I have already worn out my first Hatebreeder CD so I had to get a new one.  This CD has gone through from &quot;Warhearts&quot; to &quot;Downfall&quot; hundereds of times in my CD player.  CoB brings a lot of young talent to the table.  I have never heard a band so good so young.  Even the best, like Maiden and Death, had to develop their talent over the years to become perfect musicians.  Hatebreeder comes pretty close to perfect and these Finns are only in their early 20s. The combination of death-metal style and three melodic elements make a great, unique, trend-free sound.  Follow the Reaper is cleaner but isnt quite the same package that you get with Hatebreeder. Best songs are Black Widow, Children of Bodom, and Downfall. I am so excited about the future of the Children.  &quot;LET THE METAL FLOW&quot; -CS
6305313687|5.0|Yes, this film was extremely controversial.  Yes, this film is graphic.  I cannot understand how anyone does not like this movie.  Norton is one of my all time favorite actors and his performance as the rehabilitated Derek Vinyard, only bolsters my respect for him.  I suppose that's what a degree in history from Yale gets you----two Oscar nominations, great scripts (Primal Fear/Fight Club, anyone?!?!), and a lot of respect.  This movie tells it like it is.  It's brutally honest, it's emotional, and hopefully, when you see this movie, you will walk away having learned something.  As Daniel Vinyard says, &quot;Hate is Baggage.  Life's too short to be pissed off all the time.  It's just not worth it&quot;.  Well....let me tell you.....it's definitely worth it to see this movie.  I can't believe Norton lost this Oscar to Roberto Benini.  Life Is Beautiful was good, but it can in no way compete with American History X.  Fantastic movie.  See It.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|I think there is a serious debate on what defines a true Prince listener. (I hear that he hates referring to his audience as fans.) One Prince camp is the commercial group that admires his work right up to Purple Rain and it ends there. I think true listeners don't feel Prince has peaked after Purple Rain. They admire him for the musician he is -- a man constantly redefining himself and his work.<BR>The Rainbow Children is an experiment in jazz, gospel and blues. The entire CD demonstrates great versatility. Finally free from the constraints of Warner Brothers, Prince is now truly an &quot;artist&quot; who simply puts out music he believes in. He's not dictated by what the industry defines as popular. <BR>The CD is made up of fourteen chapters. Admittedly, the CD will catch you off-guard in the beginning, because it is so drastically different from previous work. It does draw you in and you quickly appreciate Prince's ability to broaden and redefine his music. You don't have to like the CD to realize that Prince and the NPG are great musicians. The Rainbow Children proves that they can play just about anything.
0380713802|5.0|I shared this book with my father one rainy afternoon and we could not stop laughing. Every few paragraphs he'd erupt into giggles again and share Byson's latest gem. <br />Ok. Some reviewers have complained about rough language, crude descriptions and talk of, well, farts. Relax! Start thinking like a thirteen year old boy and enjoy the book. Xenophobic? Nah, he's poking fun at what we all know is true and yet don't really want to admit. Keep in mind that Byson makes fun of himself, too. Few writer's have been able to make crossing a steet so enjoyable. (See the section on Paris).
0782008372|5.0|I like Connery's character so much that I was disappointed he died but, hey the movie is a great sci-fi fantasy.  Enjoy.  This is the original.  &quot;There can be only one.&quot;
B000002GEY|5.0|I was 3 years old when this album came out, and even back then I loved music.  &quot;But at night when all the world's asleep, the questions run too deep, for such a simple man. Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned? I know it sounds absurd, but please tell me who I am!&quot;  These are not words to a song that somebody wrote just to get a hit.  I am so tired of this attitude people take when something earns mega-success.  All of a sudden it's sub-par to them because so many other people liked it.  What?  Listen to the LOGICAL SONG again and maybe you'll get some logic.  This is a GREAT album of incredible songs that because of their infectious nature sold many many many copies.  Now all of a sudden I can't like it, I can only like their least successful album cause I'm cool.  Sorry about the sarcasm folks.  This is an absolutely brilliant album that I feel shouldn't be compared to any of their other albums, or anybody's album, because it was a stitch in time masterpiece that stands alone.  If you don't agree, then take the long way home.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham has a winner here.  I read the little book in 4 hours.  Stopping only to eat dinner with my family with the book open in front of me. So did I really stop?  Maybe not.  Anyway the Kranks are as real a family as they come.  Their lives have been changed because their daughter Blair is gone for Christmas the first time in her life.<br />Luther Krank, lives up to his name and decideds Christmas just isn't worth it.  Skipping Christmas is a &quot;legal indictment&quot; as any of Grishams other books only this time the jury is Kranks neighbors and the judge is Frosty The Snowman.  I laughed at this book until I hurt in my side when the gavel falls on Mr. Krank.<br />Not going to spoil the book for you just buy it you will love it.  I just ordered 4 more for family and friends for Christmas.  I guess that proves one thing the book didn't teach me anything.  Well maybe next year!<br />The real mccoy.
B000005GYI|5.0|I first heard this incredible masterwork of sonic bliss about 3 years ago.  This is the first CD I've ever heard that contains some of the background music that's played in heaven.  Don't believe me?  Listen to track 11 &quot;Clube da Esquina 2&quot; and the melody might bring you to joyful tears.  The lyrics are of someone who is a deep thinker.  They explore life, love, loss, longing, angst, they just run the gamut of human emotions in this album.  To anyone who has ever listened to Pink Floyd or the Beatles later albums and thought &quot;I get it, I want more&quot; here is the more you asked for.  If you don't speak portuguese you will still understand brilliance when it's smacked in your face.  It's worth learning a whole new language just to understand this cd in my opinion.  The melodies are just haunting.  The musicianship and creativity in the effects boggles the mind.  Every time I listen to this cd I wonder who has come close to touching this kind of mastery of the art of musical storytelling, well maybe Pink Floyd.  But don't let my comparison make you think that Milton Nascimento and Lo Borges ripped anyone off, on the contrary, they were pioneers.  BUY THIS CD AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
0694003611|5.0|As much as I enjoy watching my daughter's response to contemporary toddler culture, it can get a little old after a while.  I've finally found a non-Barney, non-Elmo, non-Rugrats item that my two-year-old loves.  Unfortunately, it hasn't been quite the bedtime story I'd hoped since she now repeats every page.  We simply moved it from the bedroom to the playroom.  This book is a must-have for ANY family.
B000002GEV|5.0|Admit it, this is a great album and you're not going to take anything away from that with the hidden insult of calling them a &quot;pop&quot; band.  Let's get it straight right here.  They were a band with a message, and they had songs that became POPular.  They were a band with meaning, and their songs became POPular.  Every musician's dream is to have their music reach a large number of people, to be POPular.  That doesn't mean that all bands are POP bands.  ABBA was a POP band, and I would never compare them to the socially relevant music of Supertramp.  C'mon, this album actually SAYS something, I can't think of many that do.  If the song School doesn't touch you deep down inside, then burn the rest of your cd's because you don't deserve to be a music fan.  Also remember, just because you don't understand the meaning of a song doesn't mean I don't as well.  The song &quot;Dreamer&quot; is by no means a catchy, happy, pop throwaway.  It is a musical representation of someone taunting someone who dares to dream about great things.  Maybe you have to be a musician to understand this.  I am an accomplished rock/blues musician, by the way.  I know what's it's like to be told that music is a pipe dream and that I'd never make it.  Well here I am.  Dreamer, I'm such a little dreamer.
B000051VWW|4.0|I enjoyed the music and Sade is traditional and refreshing.  The beat was toe stepping.  It was better than expected.  I look forward to hearing more.
B00005RIKD|5.0|After Brand New Day I wasn't sure if Sting had lost some of his magic. All This Time is a great album showing off his true jazz roots. Although some tunes do not really work in changed form (Brand New Day) hearing an acoustic version of 1000 Years among other was more fulfilling. The only other thing is that Mad About You was on the Euro version but not the American. That bugs me...<br />OH YES!!! Cheers to Christian McBride. Glad to see Sting invite him to play. Great bassist.
B0000256VK|5.0|In the many years of listening to it, it has stayed in current play status. I can't believe after this many years i can still love it so much as when i first bought the &quot;album&quot;! Never gets old, even though i have. You can rate the class of individual by their taste in owning this classic. Highly indicative of exquisite taste.
B00005NWRS|4.0|I went from not knowing who Ryan Adams was to singing his praises in just a few weeks. After his appearence on SNL I was interesting, downloaded some songs-loved them, and bought this CD, &quot;Gold.&quot; I was not dissappointed in fact I was totally surprised with how much I liked the album. It didn't leave my CD player for at least a week. Ryan Adams is an amazing talent, he combines rock with blues with country and it works like magic. He's song writing ability is amazing, all of the songs have so much heart in them and show true talent.<BR>Highlights from the album include:<BR>&quot;New York, New York&quot;- perfect timing for this song pushed it's success I'm sure, but it's worthy of it. The fast paced vocals and pure charm of the song has made it one of my favorites.<BR>&quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot;- it's soft and slow and soothing, truly a beautiful song<BR>&quot;The Rescue Blues&quot;- this song is just fun and you can easy relate to it.<BR>&quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot;- this is another fun, sexy, love song with great pace and words.<BR>&quot;Tina Toledo's Street Walkin' Blues&quot;- this song is both funny and sad, it's got upbeat music with fun often painful words.<BR>I recommend this CD to anyone with a wide range of taste in music. It's great! And I can't wait to see where Ryan Adams goes after &quot;Gold.&quot;
B000002L71|5.0|If i had to make an album with all my favorites, i wouldn't need to. This one has all the greatest ones which stay in play through the years on my turntable turned CD player. It never gets old, even though i have. Find this in the CD shelf of a new friend or lover, and you have found a keeper! Excellent taste at least; you can't teach that!
B00000FZ1V|5.0|In this supernatural comedy classic, four guys work as Paranormal Exterminators in NYC, calling themselves the Ghostbusters. They  are played by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. Its` a very funny and entertaining film, in my opinion due to Bill Murray`s cynical, sarcastic performance and a clever script filled with many classic quotable lines, for example:<br />Goezer: Are you a God?<br />Ray: No<br />Goezer: Then... DIE!!!!<br />[Ray is blown backwards through the air]<br />Winston: Ray... when someone asks you if you`re a God, you say YES!<br />There are also excellent performances from the supporting cast - Sigourney Weaver as Murray`s love interest Dana Barret, and Rick Moranis as the wonderfully nerdy accountant Louis.<br />Considering the film is more than 15 years old, the special effects stand up well. The picture quality on the DVD is also superb, after lots of inferior VHS versions.<br />As well as the movie, there are some excellent extra features on offer here  - 10 deleted scenes that didn`t make the final cut (if you find your TV screen is filled with specks when you watch these - don`t worry, its` not your player) an original 1984 featurette and a newer 1999 one, production notes, and a neat video commentary featuring shadows of Ivan Reitman and Harold Ramis watching the film. This shows that Columbia have actually put some thought and care into the presentation of this disc - adding up to a fantastic package. If only every DVD was like this...<br />I really enjoyed this film - if you`re a Ghostbusters fan this DVD is a must buy!
B00000I3JM|5.0|who has ever heard of them, much less bought this album???<BR>Seriously, i have only met one other person in my life that had this CD in their collection, but she and i both appreciate this stylistic, moodful sound. And even Annie Lennox has borrowed their style in the song &quot;Downtown Lights&quot;, on her album &quot;Medusa&quot; a compilation of cover tunes by her which is brilliant, even though i don't normally appreciate covers!
B00004RF9G|3.0|Sometimes what you believe in becomes more real than the actual world in which you live, and isn't there some small part in everyone that's eternally searching for that special place, that world within the world that once discovered becomes the place you want to be in forever?  It's the stuff with which folklore and films are filled, manifested in places like Valhalla, Shangri-la, Xanadu and even Never Never Land.  A place usually found only in the heart and in the mind, but occasionally stumbled upon in the most unlikely of places, which is the case in point here, when two men-- lost in the Highlands of Scotland-- come across a place you'll not find on any map.  A place called \\"Brigadoon.\\"<br /> Directed by Vincente Minnelli and told through the music and songs of Lerner and Loewe, this 1954 musical is the story of New Yorkers Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly) and Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson) who, on a hunting trip to Scotland, become lost in the Highlands and happen upon the village of Brigadoon.  Very quickly they realize that things are somehow different in this place, from the attire and attitude of the locals to the way they're received by them.  But there's something else, something about this place that seems to draw Tommy to it, that makes him feel as if he belongs here.  The cynical Jeff, on the other hand, can't wait to get away.  And while they try to sort it all out-- especially Tommy-- they get caught up in the festivities of the day; a wedding is about to take place, and during the excitement a couple of things happen:  First, Tommy overhears someone mention something about a \\"secret\\" and a \\"miracle.\\"  And then he meets Fiona (Cyd Charisse), and the spell of Brigadoon is upon him.  <br /> Minnelli may have directed this picture, but there's not so much as a footnote to it that bears his signature.  It does, however, have Gene Kelly written all over it from beginning to end.  As the star of the show and the choreographer, everything about it has his style stamped boldly upon it, and it's Kelly's spirit that carries the film, which is far from being one of Lerner and Loewe's greatest achievements.  With the exception of \\"It's Almost Like Being In Love,\\" in fact, the songs are fairly forgettable.  But there's a certain enchantment to the \\"idea\\" of Brigadoon, plus having Kelly aboard to bring it to fruition, that makes this a pleasantly engaging film.  And it's that fairy tale sense of finding the person and place of your heart's desire that makes it so appealing.  Some viewers, jaded by the stark reality of much of today's fare, may find this offering a bit corny; but then again, with the phenomenal success of a film like the recent \\"Harry Potter,\\" it may be indicative of the fact that films like \\"Brigadoon\\" are just what audiences are hungry for, and a film like this just may be a pleasant discovery-- or rediscovery-- for many who are indeed looking for just this kind of entertainment.  Ironically, in the fantasy of it there is something intrinsically down-to-earth about it that many may find attractive and refreshing.<br /> Of course, any vehicle which affords the opportunity of seeing a great artist like Kelly doing what he does best is worth it's weight in gold.  Watching Kelly dance, no matter what the setting or venue, is a transporting experience.  Fred Astaire may be the Crown Prince of those who have danced their way to fame on the silver screen, but Kelly is the King, with a commanding, powerful presence that is without equal.  Quite simply, nobody does it better, and his presence is definitely the strength of this film.  <br /> Cyd Charisse (whom Astaire named as his first choice of all his partners) is at her best here during her numbers with Kelly, but as good as she is-- and she is an extraordinary dancer and performer, arguably one of the screen's best ever-- in retrospect, she may not have been the best choice for this part; someone like Vera-Ellen, perhaps, may have been more able overall to capture the ethereal essence of Fiona, as Charisse is better suited to a more contemporary or modern setting.  Still, there are those who will maintain that Charisse was perfect for this role, and indeed, it is an entirely subjective call.<br /> Van Johnson gives a good performance, but there's something of a fish-out-of-water sense about it, which may have to do with the character he's playing.  Jeff, after all, is the one who remains grounded while Tommy gets swept away with the fantasy in which they find themselves.  And he does get a chance to show off a bit of his ability as a dancer in a brief number alongside Kelly, who very generously seems to tip his hat to Johnson by maintaining a rather reserved presence during their bit together.<br /> The supporting cast includes Elaine Stewart (Jane), Barry Jones (Mr. Lundie), Hugh Laing (Harry), Albert Sharpe (Andrew), Virginia Bosler (Jean), Jimmy Thompson (Charlie), Tudor Owen (Archie), Dee Turnell (Ann), Dodie Heath (Meg), Owen McGiveney (Angus) and Eddie Quillan (Sandy).  Also look for George Chakiris as one of the dancers.  A somewhat minor, but rather charming musical, \\"Brigadoon\\" has a certain universal appeal that will ensure it's place forever among even the most memorable of movie musicals.  It may lack the impact that would give it the stature of a \\"West Side Story,\\" \\"Oklahoma,\\" \\"Carousel\\" or \\"My Fair Lady,\\" but it has a quality all it's own that makes it enjoyable and entertaining to watch.  And that's the magic of the movies.
B00005RIKD|5.0|The man truly understands his music.  Rearranging songs written decades ago into truly contemporary and jazz styles which will blow your mind, and give you renewed pleasure and interest in listening to them.  The man is either one of the greatest musicians ever, or a great marketing genious and we're simply too dumb to recognize it.  Either way, I'm thoroughly enjoying his music!
B000000YWO|5.0|Tour de Force with some of jazz's greatest musicians.  Kenny Burrell, Ray Brown, Bill Evans, Philly Joe Jones.  Plenty of Bill on the keys and Ray on the bass strings. Quintessence sounds slightly like Vince Guaraldi's band but with more force and greater repetoire.  This is a special album and a must for fans of Bill Evans or fans of the other fine musicians present here.
B000002U82|4.0|Some people don't like the album because they accuse it of being dark and depressing.  Well, thats why its so good.  Dark and depressing material is the best forms of entertainment that you can find.  Dark side of the moon dishes out that sence of emptyness and drearyness that makes you want to crawl up in a ball and hide in a dark corner.  <BR>The sounds are good in Dark side of the Moon, but i only gave it 4 stars cause the Wall is so much better and also some of Roger Waters latter stuff is better too.
B00005Q66T|4.0|I think this CD is excellent.  Ok, so maybe it left off a few songs that I much rather hear than say Take a Bow or Don't Cry For Me, but it's a fun CD.  If you're a fan of Madonna you have to own this CD.  NO there aren't any new songs, but that's not what a Greatest Hits Album is for.
B00000DLUO|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful album of terriffic compositions, masterfully played by Evans. His Rhodes electric piano work is delicate yet full of emotion and technical mastery. His acoustic piano is heard with equal weight, also and is great as always. This is a fulfilling album all the way through. &quot;Soiree&quot; is my favorite of the set, easily one of the most beautiful recordings I have ever heard. One slight annoyance is a fairly high level of tape hiss, which must be inherent in the original master recording. Too bad this music was out of print for so many years. I cannot recommend this album highly enough. In a word: Buy it.
B000002BUY|4.0|Listened to it (with the recipient's permission of course). Certain Shade of Green was cool, but overall it's just not my style.<br />The person I gave it too liked it, but I don't know much more than that.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I really love Britneys new album. It has very cool songs like &quot;I love rock &amp; roll&quot; aswell it has touching songs like &quot;Im not a girl not yet a women&quot;. In this album you can hear new sounds.<BR>I think this album is for all ages.
0393317552|3.0|Jared Diamond certainly had a wonderful idea for a book,  something I have wondered about:  Why did the West come to dominate the world?  The answers are in Mr. Diamond's book, which is well written and organized but sometimes tedious.<br />Mr. Diamond tends to mention and make reference to his speciality -- New Guinea -- at every opportunity.  He must think the average reader needs main points reitereated over and over again, which is nice in a textbook but annoying otherwise.  Mr. Diamond's book just needs some pruning:  unnecessary detail sometimes made the book tedious.<br />Worth the cost of the book:  Ultimlately, no.  Worth checking out from the library:  Definitely.
0553260111|4.0|If you read one, you'll read all three.  It's a detailed book so you won't be able to put it down for a week and come back to it without losing track of the characters and story.  Therefore, read it when you have the time to give the book your full attention.  It's a great vacation book.

6304106017|2.0|This film tries to be too many things at once.<BR>It could have been a straight crime thriller<BR>in the Pulp Fiction Tradition or a failed preacher versus<BR>vampires flick...the film starts out VERY strong, in<BR>good Tarantino/Rodriguez fashion.  But when the vampires<BR>start showing up it just doesn't work for me.<BR>...Not that it wasnt amusing/entertaining...especially the &quot;disco ball of death&quot; at the end---but the strength<BR>of Keitel's character and the character development spent<BR>on his children seem like a waste of time.<BR>Cheech Marin provides some comic relief playing 3 separate<BR>characters...and Salma Hayek is too much of a doll-face to be<BR>believable as a evil character...she is drop dead beautiful but doesn't pull off the &quot;bad girl&quot; image at all.  She should stick to playing good-guy characters.  They could have done a lot more with the Tarantino charater's psychosis--which was very interesting/twisted; But again, it seems wasted in the movie.<BR>It seems like this film was rushed to production before Tarantino &amp; Robert Rodriguez could come to agreement on what kind of film to do and they just made a movie out of the parts of a lot of different movies they WANTED to make.  I wish they would've taken their time and just made a separate crime thriller...this movie seems like the rough-draft of what became _The Way of the Gun_.  This movie was disappointing because it could have been so much better.  I'm not remotely interested in any of the sequels.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham has brought home the over-indulgence of our Christmas spirit in a witty tale about a couple skipping out on anything Christmas to take a cruise. He has done in book form what Chevy Chase and Christmas Vacation did on screen. Both provide a hilarlious take on the Christmas season.<br />In this slim volume, Grisham has continued his detour from legal thrillers to capture meaning in his subject in much the same way he did in A Painted House.<br />While the concept of Americans over doing it around Christmas is cliched, Grisham's tale is still a fine original.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Just saw it again ... and it's much worse than I remembered! The visuals are great, some of them even beautiful, but the script and editing are horrible, mundane, plodding, and just plain silly. I thought the Ewoks were bad enough, but this episode is just goofy.<br />And it's not just Jar Jar. Take him out (yeah, dream on) and you've still got a slowish mishmash of unimaginative drivel. Sure, Anakin looks cute when he curls his lip during the pod race, but what of the rest? The best part of the whole movie - the Jedi-Sith duel - is short and not always well photographed.<br />The plot borders on idiotic. You have to see it for yourself (well, don't if you don't have to) to appreciate the understatement I'm using here.<br />It's hard to state just how bad this film really is. I didn't think so before I saw it again on TV. I actually taped it, but promptly reused the tape afterwards to tape the end of a Seinfeld episode (Jerry: \\"What's mine is yours.\\" Kramer: \\"Really?\\").<br />I've heard the DVD features are good, but I can't bring myself to rent it.<br />Just awful.
B00003CXN4|1.0|Soderbergh is without doubt the most laughably overhyped director in the business right now.  &quot;Traffic&quot; tells us absolutely nothing about the &quot;war on drugs&quot; that an intelligent, informed person didn't already know.  Furthermore, Soderbergh's acclaimed filmmaking techniques are all essentially &quot;borrowed&quot; from other directors who have used the same techniques to much better effect.  At it's core, &quot;Traffic&quot; is a completely hollow, completely commercial Hollywood-style movie which the director and studio designed to win the superlatives of the adoring critics and the Oscars committee.  There's nothing artistic or creative about any of Soderbergh's work, except maybe in the most shallow sense.  The cast of the upcoming &quot;Oceans 11&quot; gives his game away anyway:  Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, etc., etc..  Soderbergh's game is the same as Hollywood's - to rake in the cash.  This kind of moviemaking isn't art; this is commerce and marketing, pure and simple.  Hand over the cash.
0060229357|5.0|This book was a childhood favorite of mine and I recently purchased it after being unable to find my original copy. It's an excellent story of a child's imagination and worth reading at any age!
B0000048CX|5.0|You could probably find a better way to spend ($), but as far as compact discs go, this one is worth your money and time.  Fakebook is the kind of CD you can buy for just about any of your friends and/or acquaintances, with an assurance that they will like it, or it will grow on them, or they already have it but it's probably scratched from being played so much. Either way, your reputation for having good taste will be cemented.  Plus, I think \\"The Summer\\" is the all-time greatest song about that great season ever to be penned.  Listen to it on a beach at sunset with your best girl.  Or guy.  You know what I mean.  YLT are a national treasure.  They deserve greatness.  You deserve this disc.  C'mon.
0451204530|2.0|&quot;Code to Zero&quot; is set during the Cold War, and the US/Soviet space race in particular.  It is the story of a group of friends at Harvard who become scientists and spies, spouses and friends.  We begin with Luke, who wakes up in a men's room with no memory of who he is.  Bit by bit, Luke figures things out and events come to a head at the launch of an American satellite.  <br />The story is by no means awful... but based on Follett's earlier, compelling, powerful storytelling, it is a disappointment.  The characters are somewhat flat, the dialog is stilted, and the plot is simplistic.  <br />Follett certainly set himself a high bar with his earlier novels, which I do recommend highly.  I was sorry that Code To Zero didn't meet that same standard. If this were my first Follett novel, I'd probably not pick up another... don't make that mistake, the others are very worthwhile!
B00005QY5Y|4.0|Its hard to believe that Jacksonville, NC born Ryan Adams would become a staple video for the healing of the September 11th tragedies.  Some would even look at the patriotic album cover and title track, &quot;New York, New York&quot; and believe that the album is simply meant to aid the healing process.  <BR>  Actually, Adams sings of a love he spent some time with in the famous Big Apple city, and despite the music industry's desire to make his ballad a tribute to the injured city, Adams simply is an example of coincidence at just the right time.<BR>   The album is filled with Adam's most familiar works.  His sweet sing-song alt-country voice blankets the album with musical genius.  The wonderfully written tunes, from beginning to end, are laden with guitar, sax, and only a sound the frontman from Whiskeytown could acheive.  The album is calm and soothing, but certainly has its pick-me-up tracks as well.  As for the appearance of patriotic support, its mere coincidence, but comes at a time when the people of New York are welcoming to a healing hand.
B00004KD1L|5.0|This CD is simply fabulous! The opening track &quot;Chicago&quot; is a slow ambient song, perfect for relaxing to. Vertigo takes the listener on a trip with slow music (Pre 63), jazz/techno (Dusk You &amp; Me), hip hop (Whatever, Whenever), and Dance hits (If Everybody Looked the Same, and I See you Baby). This CD has something for almost everyone! <br />MY top 5:<BR>5-I See You Baby (Fatboy Slim Mix)<BR>4-Chicago<BR>3-Your Song<BR>2-If Everybody Looked the Same<BR>1-At The River
B00003CX5P|3.0|The DVD for this movie is amazing, but the movie itself lagged. Until someday when they could touch up this movie in the weak spots, I just won't be able to get into this movie. Jar Jar was a waste of space who did nothing but bumble and mess up every scene he was in. I mean look at the Gungan battle, it looks lame compared to the Hoth battle. The space battle in TPM looks even worse compared to the classic attacks on the Death Star. A little 9 year old kid accidentally gets into the control ship and accidentally blows it up and gets out on time, give me a break. The podrace was pretty good, but then again the english speaking podrace announcer had to mess it up with cheap gags and comic relief. Please GL, no more &quot;Ex-squeeze me&quot;, &quot;How rude&quot;, &quot;Yippeee&quot;, and things like that. I wish they could take out Jar Jar's clumsyness and luck in the Gungan battle and the little childish sayings and Anakin's accidental blow up of the ship and the movie would be fine. The lightsaber duel ROCKED!!
B00003CY0V|2.0|I saw this film in the theaters and really wish I could get my money back.  This film was nothing but the producers and directors trying to blow-up as many things as they could.  The dumbest scene in the whole movie is Travolta driving in the car, shooting everything up in his way.  Don't bother with this one.  Save your money and go get lunch.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I love the sumptuous sound of this album. After playing it almost daily for the last two months, it shows no sign of loosing its luster. It's intoxicating.<br />Look elsewhere if you're looking for earthy. Half of the songs are Latin rhythms and half aren't. But all are backed by exquisite orchestral arrangements and done in Krall's trademark elegant vocal and piano style. <br />The sound is crystalline throughout. She is icy-cool yet tender and warm. Her deeper Spanish notes on &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; are stunningly flute-like, sending shivers. Nowhere does the orchestra overpower her. In fact, she sings, boldly, so close to the mic that the effect is almost embarrassingly intimate. For this male at least, these circumstances create arousal, not the sleepiness mentioned in some reviews. <br />Her voice is low and seductive, which tends to cover her mature, lyrical quality. That only makes it more fun to listen over again and peel away the layers. She has an honest delivery that doesn't rely on tricky phrasing, &quot;cool&quot; timing and other artificial stuff that many jazz singers use to portray &quot;soul&quot; --for example, disfiguring perfectly good songs to get some kind of a Picasso of the original.<BR> <BR>Krall can make an otherwise dreary song colorful with the character in her gorgeous voice. I think that helps explain her immense popularity. (I just said the &quot;P word.&quot;)
B00005OWEG|5.0|I saw &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; twice in 1979, during its first theatrical run.  Parts of it impressed me, parts of it seemed incoherent (particularly the final sequence).  I always thought of it as flawed, until I saw this new extended cut.<br />I can't think of a movie I've enjoyed more in the last year --- and I watch a LOT of movies.  The additional footage does improve the film, although the dinner scene could have been trimmed a bit.  Still, so many ideas were tossed around during this part that I'm looking forward to watching it again to soak in every detail of the dialogue.<br />&quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; will never be a movie for all tastes.  There's too much symbolism for some viewers, and to be sure, plenty of violence (what do you expect in a war picture?).  For me, this epic has grown on me over the years and gets better with repeated viewings; the new footage amplifies and enhances it, and some bits make more sense.  I highly recommend it.<br />As to the DVD:  3 hours and 20 minutes is long enough.  I have stacks of others DVDs to watch.  I don't have TIME to listen to a commentary track.  I'd rather rent &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot; or read a book about it (although it would have been a nifty idea to include the documentary in a two-disc set... with a heftier price tag, of course).<br />The remixed Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is excellent.  This is the first time I've seen my dogs dart around the room, trying to figure out where those helicopter sounds at the beginning are coming from.<br />There was some controversy over the original DVD release; apparently the aspect ratio used was different from the theatrical release.  Although the picture was shot in widescreen, it's presented here in 1.85:1; my guess is that the new cut was projected this way and that's why it was transferred like that.  (It is an anamorphic picture.)  In many theaters widescreen films are projected flat because the screens aren't wide enough for the actual film aspect ratio --- even in the theater, you don't always get the &quot;theatrical&quot; aspect ratio...<br />Bottom line:  if you like this movie at all, even part of it, at least rent &quot;Redux&quot; and see more of Coppola' vision of wartime hell.  You won't regret it.- even in the theater, you don't always get the &quot;theatrical&quot; aspect ratio...<br />Bottom line:  if you like this movie at all, even part of it, at least rent &quot;Redux&quot; and see more of Coppola' vision of wartime hell.

B000001EMW|4.0|this cd is better than i thought it would be.  And everyone that doesn't own this album, it adds a whole other side to metallica music.  it compliments some songs tune and melody for example unforgiven and master of puppets.  I would recomend this cd  to anyone who likes metallica to broaden how you look at it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Historically accurate + beautiful filmming + so-so script + wonderfully talented actors = PEARL HARBOR - a film to remember and see! Yes, like many others, I think the love story plot of PEARL HARBOR kind of ripped off the love story plot of TITANIC, but the film is still unique in it's own way. This film helps you remember the time during World War II when the Japanese dropped unexpected bombs on US soil in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (kinda reminds you of the war we're having right now, eh?). It helps you to remember the sacrafices innocent US citizians had to make during that time, as another reviewer pointed out. The love story was supposed to show audiances that this film was not all about the war - but it's central characters revolved around three people. PEARL HARBOR does remind you of TITANIC, but like I mentioned before they are both different. In PEARL HARBOR, a young soldier named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) goes off to war and finds true love in a young beautiful nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale). Then, he is soon reported dead. And his childhood best friend, Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), falls for Evelyn and they both fall in in love. Later on, Rafe returns and that's when things start heating up between the three. The war and bombing sequences are spectacular and a major thrill ride. If you are into romance, then the love sceens probably won't seem as boring to you. The love sceens to me were pretty good, even though I'm not much of a romantic person. I was able to sit through PEARL HARBOR without moaning and groaning. I actually enjoyed it a lot. The acting is just superb, too from the entire cast. And the film is stunningly historically accurate. If you are into films such as TITANIC and ARMAGEDDON, then I highly recommend PEARL HARBOR to you. And, as a bonus, this DVD is supposed to have some really great special features including the music video of &quot;There You'll Be&quot; by Faith Hill (ooh! How I *love* that song!). Go pre-order you DVD copy ofPEARL HARBOR today!
B00000637V|1.0|That's right, pushing boundaries. Comparisons were made between Berlin and Sgt. Pepper because both albums push the boundaries of studio music. These days artists can pretty much reproduce the studio sound live but in the 70s you still had your musical career split in two.<br />As you can imagine Berlin has a dark subject matter, the streets, the drugs, cutting wrists, all the things that give Lou Reed's lyrics that extra bit of realism, the feeling that the artist has personally experienced these things. It would be interesting to compare this album to something modern like Tom McRae's debut. 'The Bed' Reed sweed voices \\"What a feeling\\" and you can consider this kind of singing quite normal on the McRae album but there's no point to it, there's too much indulgence and avoidance on McRae's effort while 'The Bed' is simply about a fateful night where a woman cuts her wrists. It's the simplicity, the daring quality of Lou Reed's lyrics, that carries across the music.<br />The layering is very impressive and it was a brave decision for Reed to release it after the commercially successful Transformer. Berlin is like the complete opposite of Sgt. Pepper's hip wanderings. But never forget that it's just rock and roll.

B00005RDAF|4.0|In reading past reviews of this product, I couldn't help but comment on one issue. Although I realize the title &quot;Britney: The Videos&quot; would suggest that it was a collection of all her videos, did it ever occur to those people who now have buyer's remorse to actually flip the DVD over to see what was on it BEFORE purchasing? Come on now. Let's get a grip.
B000003NA4|1.0|I am not a frequent listener of Jazz and am unfamiliar with many of the contemporary names in the genre, however, the name of Diana Krall came to my attention when I purchased an excellent Jazz ballad cd by a saxaphonist.  I read the reviews concerning the Love Scenes collection and all seemed favorable for a purchase.  I thought I would take a chance on this cd.<br />    Unfortunately, Love Scenes has proved to be a major disappointment.  I was eager to hear a Jazz vocalist explore the subject of love, however, the entire cd is completely lacking in depth lyrically.  It is, at best, transparent.<br />    I also feel that Krall's delivery is vastly too unemotional and detached for the theme of love.  There is no &quot;soul&quot; in her voice and she seems at times to even be uninterested in the music she is singing.  The most convincing vocalists are able to feel the emotions they sing.  Krall fails at this juncture.<br />    Krall's singing is unappealing to me as well.  Surely a good vocalist could resonate a note just a bit.  This surely might have aided her delivery on such songs as I Miss You So where the word &quot;so&quot; lies on a prolonged note.  Unfortunately, she sings it blandly.  Many other such examples could be cited.<br />    Lastly, the vast majority of the songs in the collection are simply unappealing.  Despite her shortcomings, I did enjoy I Miss You So; They Can't Take That Away From Me; and I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You.  The remaining tracks I thought were horrendous - particularly Peel Me a Grape and My Love Is.  Love Scene's greatest fault, however, lies in its lack of depth with regards to the subject of love.<br />    I consider Love Scenes to be among the worst cd's I have ever purchased.  I do not recommend it.
B00005QATY|3.0|I must say I did smile throughout the entire showing of &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;  I am not certain if the smile was amusement, amazement, animosity, or just plain disbelief that I bought the movie, and would now own it forever, rather than simply renting it, at which point I would be able to return it to the rental place, having seen it once, which I must say is enough.<br />The music is TERRIFIC!!  The scenery is beautiful.  The story has great potential.  Clooney is not, perhaps, cut out for a film career, though he sure does look great.  I suggest you RENT this movie.  That way you can tell your friends, &quot;Oh ya, I saw that...the music was great, huh.&quot;, and yet you will not be burdened, my friend, with the ownership of a film such as this.<br />KAYCEYGIRL RENTAL ONLY!!

0790742322|5.0|I Can Watch &quot;BeetleJuice&quot; Again and Again..And Still Laugh &amp; Giggle!!!  Tim Burton has a way of making movies that the audience can watch again and again and again and seemingly never grow tired of watching....BeetleJuice is one of those magic (and creepy) movies that takes you on a rollercoaster ride of imagination (and possibility).  It has characters you love and ones you love to hate.  Of course, Michael Keaton is brilliant and totally disgusting as BeetleJuice.  Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are the perfect &quot;til death us do part&quot; couple...who just happen to die too early. Catherine O'Hara is delightfully stuck-up and an especially unsophisticated socialite while her equally unpleasant husband/developer (played by Jeffrey Jones) is perfectly ill-at-ease in his &quot;nervous-breakdown&quot; required relaxation country setting.  And though I really do not like Winona Ryder in most anything and everything else she has ever done, in this she is PERFECTLY WONDERFUL (rather than perfectly awful as usual).  I also love &quot;Otho&quot;, the scheming self-effacing living-world counterpart to BeetleJuice.  <br />Every time I see the movie, I notice some new little nuance that further denotes Burton's genius...smoke coming from a cut throat, &quot;I didn't even know I could 'Calypso'!&quot; and so many more.  One of my all-time favorites.  <br />A KAYCEYGIRL VIDEO LIBRARY &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; !!
0440236304|5.0|An amazing account of a paratrooper in the screaming eagles. He takes us through  the grinding tedium of training to the fast paced exertion of gruelling combat. His accounts of death in battle are harrowing in the way the mind does not allow compassion under the tight grip of close quarter war for the soldier of World War II. Whether or not you agree with his apparent detachment of both pity or compassion for taking another life he portrays it as simply as it went forth. It is neither an over bearing or soul wrenching account. Just a quiet record of his war. Which makes this, in my eyes, the best account ever written by a regular soldier.
B00005BCPC|4.0|This version of the story is very well concieved and acted -- but set in the wrong place, perhaps. Unfortunately it is not as beautiful of a period piece as I have come to expect since nowadays there are so many exquisite productions to compare it to. The references to the social situation and slavery are very well integrated and I think it's about time someone allowed this aspect to come out of these stories, since Jane Austen does give--albeit hidden--allusions to these issues in the parlor conversation. On the other hand, the excuses given to the oldest son of a spoiled aristocratic family are a bit much. In her books, Jane Austen doesn't judge her characters as much as the screenwriters appear to. In addition, I could not give it 5 stars because I don't completely believe in the actors -- that they really understand the period or even their parts. It is truly a modern re-telling that perhaps might have been better put into a modern setting. I'm keeping my BBC version for now (it's much more like the book).
B0000039PW|5.0|i remember when this first came out.  i lived on the east coast.  more like the mid-west in chicago.  they were bumpin the h**l out of this album.  this is the only B.I.G. album worth pickin up.  biggie has tight flows even though pac gave him the game he still does very well, but there is no comparison between biggie and pac.  pac is the master no one can touch him.  get this if u aint already got it.  its a good album.
B00001ODHF|5.0|Warning: Spoilers<br />Army Of Darkness is the third movie in the Evil Dead series and possibly the last. Whether it's the last or not, it's awesome! The first was a way cool movie, and so was the second, and this didn't disappoint. It's got a pretty good plot that deals with Ash being sent back to the medieval ages where he teams up with Knights to fight Deadites and Skeleton Warriors. Lots of carnage ensues. AOD is not a very scary movie, but it sure is funny at times (like when Ash fights a whole bunch of mini-Evil Ashs') and is so entertaining. Evil Ash was one cool (and nasty) villain and the one-liners are as good as ever (&quot;Good, Bad, I'm The Guy With The Gun&quot;) . Plus, the action scenes are so awesome, like the Ash Vs. Pit Deadites and the finale, wow! What a great finale! The ending scene is cool and is a nice way to wrap up this fantastic trilogy. Bruce Campbell turns in yet another terrific performance as Ash and is only rivaled by his performance in Evil Dead 2. Overall Army Of Darkness is simply an awesome movie that's a great way to wrap up the Evil Dead trilogy and will no doubt provide Horror fans and moviegoers alike loads of fun and entertainment. Buy all three movies, Evil Dead is one of the greatest movie trilogies ever and is right up there with Star Wars!
6305308659|5.0|In &quot;Pleasantville,&quot; Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are suddenly, unpreparedly, magically transported, by an unusual TV remote, from their 90's frazzled-single-parent home, to the mythic, happy wonderland of 50's era sitcoms.  Once there, they are faced with the question of &quot;to be or not to be,&quot; and if it's &quot;to be,&quot; well, what does that mean??  My title is intended to suggest the surreal, spooky, psychological bouleversement that the reality-challenged black and white TV characters experience, when faced with the sexually take-charge attitude of Reese W., and with the sudden, inexplicable introduction of color into their previously humdrum, lackluster lives.<br />Jeff Daniels and Joan Allen almost steal the show, in a beautiful love story that probably started out as sort of a subplot.  They're both fantastic.  I felt really sorry for William Macy's character, whose wife (Joan A.) is suddenly evolving beyond his comprehension, but basically, the intended mood of this movie is just too liberating and exhilarating to be particularly easy on stolid, father figure characters.  He wasn't &quot;the bad guy,&quot; (the late, great J.T. Walsh got that part, to the extent that there can be said to BE a bad guy in this complex film), but he was certainly a &quot;fall guy&quot; from a plotting perspective.  It might have been nice if he somehow acquired the magical TV remote, and made his way into some traditional sitcom or movie where he might have been happier, like &quot;The Waltons&quot; or &quot;The Bob Newhart Show.&quot;<br />The fun of this movie is in watching the high school kids go happily berserk, as they learn about sex, airballs in basketball, and other unsettling topics.  The basic theme is about figuring out who you truly are, in a world that expects you to play a part, and finding a way to live your own life.  Tobey M. and Reese W.'s characters both have unexpected lessons to learn, which I won't reveal here, and it's a lot offun seeing them find their ways...  As the movie goes along, the symbolism is too blatant in places, but I don't care.  It's always fun and interesting.  This is a great movie.  Definitely two thumbs up.
0385505833|3.0|Peace Corps closed its program in Peru in l975, an essential fact that Grisham never bothered to research.  Additionally, Peace Corps Volunteers attend stagings in the U.S. and leave as a group for their assigned countries, where they begin a two to three month training period, living with host families before beginning their assignments.  They aren't escorted to the airport by parents on Thanksgiving weekends nor are they ensconsed in grass huts with coworkers immediately upon arrival.<br />These may seem quibbles, but any journalist will attest to the importance of getting the facts straight to lend authenticity to a piece of work.  Though I'm enjoying the Kranks as I Metro from Silver Spring to Peace Corps headquarters here in D.C., I have a tough time suspending disbelief.
038533348X|5.0|Wow.<BR>P.S. In &quot;Cat's Cradle,&quot; Kurt Vonnegut tells us everything we ever wanted to know, but were afraid to ask, about foma, ice-nine, and Bokononism.  In the telling, he leaves us mesmerized with his sadly warm, warmly sad vision of mankind, and of mankind's pathetic proclivity for trying so hard to believe in known lies, and in unknown truths.<br />The story is told by Jonah, who is researching the life and times of a great physicist, Dr. Hoenikker.  Hoenikker is one of the more prominent fathers of the atomic bomb, yet he has an image of being a childlike, saintly figure who lived his life enraptured by the cerebral, celestial music of the spheres.  He may or may not have been a saint, (this is never fully resolved,) but he definitely was directly responsible, in this book, for at least two devices which are foolproof, sure-fire, results-guaranteed means of totally annihilating all life on this planet.  Doesn't sound much like a saint, you say?!?!?  Well, all I can say is, you need to read this book.<br />As the story unfolds, we meet Hoenikker's scared, lonely, grown children, whose fates are locked together by the terrible secret of ice-nine.  Jonah travels with them to the little-known, Caribbean island republic of San Lorenzo for his research.  Once there, he discovers the bizarrely sensible religion of Bokononism, and his life is changed forever.<br />&quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is crammed with a curiously concatenated cornucopia of consistently compelling creative conundrums.  A word of warning: you may want to wear some kind of metal helmet while reading this book.  Otherwise, you will risk scratching a hole in your skull from scratching your head all the time, trying to understand all the brilliant ideas in this book.  There are just tons of insights into how we interpret reality, how we interpret fiction, and how we sometimes do the second of those activities, when we should be doing the first...  One character is a professional book indexer.  She goes through manuscripts of books for a living, and creates indexes for them.  Sounds like kind of an odd profession, eh?  Well then, how do YOU break down dreams, or reality, to make them easier to cope with?  What's YOUR strategy for this basic human need?  Or, for another example -- another character is one of Dr. Hoenikker's grown sons.  He was called &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; as a child, because he happened to have a few fairly furtive mannerisms.  As an adult, he basically lives a James Bond life, making or breaking kings, and consorting with beautiful women on a lush, island paradise.  Did his dreamlike adult reality grow out of the real nightmare he lived out as a mocked child?  Where did one start, and the other stop?  This is the kind of question that Kurt Vonnegut raises in this book.  Every sentence has meaning.  Just amazing.  An infinite number of thumbs up.
B00005B36H|4.0|Simply put...TOOL. Classic bass and percussion driven songs, with abstract lyrical overlays. The album has a great compliment of songs that just flat out -rock- and songs that lift you up &quot;light as a feather and stiff as a board&quot; and hold you there with chills on the back of your neck until finally letting you gently back down to catch your breath. Everything a complete album should do. I think most of the songs were over 5 minutes which make this a complete &quot;cover to cover&quot; album. One which you can listen to repeatedly without touching a button.<BR>It's good stuff.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|For the first time in many years, I broke down and bought a film score without seeing the movie first, or with any idea whether it would live up to what is required of the material, and I have been absolutely overwhelmed. My only complaint is that there are brief passages of such beauty I want them to be developed at greater length, but then, there are two more films to come, and two more discs (at least, as I'm sure there will be a demand for even more incidental music) so perhaps I will get my desire. I'm not sure this is music for quiet reading (for actually reading Tolkien, I recommend Vaughan Williams) but for experiencing...! I tried to read another book with this in the background, after giving the score my full attention several times, but I broke down sobbing as I overheard &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; coming from the next room and began to visualize the scene. If anything could be as complex, subtle, heroic and heart-breakingly beautiful as Tolkien's masterpiece, it might be this music.
B000002LR6|4.0|Like many folks, this was my first exposure to Ministry. Since then I've had the opportunity to listen to almost everything else they've released, as well as many of the recordings/musicians they influenced (NIN, Skinny Puppy, etc.) This album will always have a warm place in my heart, from the machine-rockin' \\"Just One Fix\\" to the Butthole Surfer vocals on \\"Jesus Built My Hotrod\\" to the ever-dark \\"Scarecrow.\\" They even have a couple of instrumental numbers on this record that are a nice relief from the more typical song structure that is found on a number of this album's tracks. I'm more of a fan of their older work, and while this release is not as much industrial as it is rock, I highly recommend checking it out. And of course, ignore all the hype. Nothing like tons of hype to make a record seem much better/worse than it actually is.
B000002MFN|5.0|This is a great album. I bought it on cassette in 1993 in India and played it all the time. A piece of useless trivia for you : This was the first 'foreign' album released in India whose release date matched that of the US!<br />There are two versions of this album - one with the explicit song 'Did you do it' - which basically is not sung by Madonna at all (the snippets from 'Waiting' are the only Madonna-featured sounds on this track), and one without. The explicit one is perhaps the better bet as its more 'thorough', but I have the edited version and I don't feel like I'm missing anything.<br />My favorite track here is 'Deeper and Deeper' and the much-forgotten 'Secret Garden' - the base on that track is remarkable. Its a pity that most of Madonna's greatest songs were actually on this CD, but people tend to criticize this album more than any other of her's.<br />In any case, if you're looking for a vintage dance album that has a disco-edge to it while sampling some choice electronica (Madonna samples Kool and the Gang on the title song), this is your best bet. I actually like it more than 'Bedtime Stories', which I thought was somewhat pretentious.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005RFQ5|1.0|I have read many reviews preceding mine from a wide range of Prince fans. Old, new, sycophantic and jaded. I consider myself pretty level-headed about Prince, as I am with most of my favorite artists. For the most part I enjoy the whole body of an artist's work, but if they put out a bad album I acknowledge it as such and hope that the next one is better. In terms of Prince, however, I gave up this hope many albums ago, and \\"The Rainbow Children\\" sadly cements the fact that this is not only a completely different man than the one who made great music in the 80's and early 90's, but also a man whose inspiration and musical inventiveness have almost completely left him.<br />I listened to this album once through and knew immediately that additional listening would not help it's chances to impress my ears or my opinion. It is an unmitigated bore, just like Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic was and so many of his previous albums (post-Gold Experience).  (...)  To believe that the music he releases is still \\"great\\" when it is actually far from it means that he will continue to produce that kind of music. Thus \\"Emancipation,\\" \\"New Power Soul,\\" \\"Rave un2 the Joy Fantastic,\\" and \\"Rainbow Children.\\" Case closed.<br />There is nothing on \\"Rainbow\\" that stands out. The songs all blend together in a sort of bland mass of slow jazz, diluted funk, flimsy adult contemporary and various other, un-Princely styles. Since when did Prince make elevator music?<br />By now it's obvious that Prince has become a religious man, which is fine. The real question to be put to Prince is this... Does being a religious man also mean that he has to now put out crappy music? Not cursing or being raunchy is okay, even though it backs over and defiles all of his early (and far better) work, but that's the least of his recent missteps. Putting out a deluge of new music that sounds completely bland and uninteresting is how Prince has truly changed these past few years. Forget about the religious stuff, not cursing, fights with Warner Brothers, etc. The music has simply been poor. That is the bottom line. If Prince wants to make life changes then he should go right ahead. Praise Jesus! But, by all means, don't start putting out bad music! He will be the first one to shift attention (or try to, anyway) to other issues (like his \\"imprisoned\\" master recordings at WB, a newfound love of scripture, how he has \\"real\\" fans--who unconditionally love even his worst output--and \\"fake\\" fans--the ones like me who think he has lost his musical way, etc.) when his music is criticized, but what kind of ARTIST can't take criticism?!<br />
B0000549B2|4.0|Denzel is great as a sultry sax player named Bleek Gilliam. His portrayal of man whose first love is his saxaphone and his second love is divided by Cynda Williams and Joie Lee. Wesley Snipes is great in this movie as Bleek's musical rival. I love the tension is played out between them. There is no question that there is an intense rivalry but when the going gets rough, rivalry gets put down for brotherhood. XLNT. <br />If you like jazz, Denzel and Spike Lee movies, dig in. You are in for a real treat!
0195067142|5.0|This description of the nature of military combat as experienced by the frontline fighter is the best of its kind I have read. The writing is clear, direct, and honest. One can understand how this brief, intense moment in Gene Sledge's life left a searing and indelible impression.<br />The great value of the book is that it strips war of its gloty and romance. Gene saw and understood the necessity of the effort in which he was a part, but regretted that necessity, and he deplored the brutality and horror which characterized it.<br />For those who would understand the nature of close military combat, the price it exacts from those who engage in it, and the debt we owe them, it is required reading.
6305696071|5.0|Julia Roberts hit a home run with this 1990 hit which made her a superstar, when she won an Oscar  and Golden Globe for best actress in a leading role. It's a cross between Pygmalion(My Fair Lady) and Cinderella. This story finds Richard Gere, a cold, emotionless businessman who has become a billionaire tearing apart companies for their assets hiring &quot;Vivian&quot; a prostitute, to accompany him for the week he is doing business in LA.<br /><br />There are cute scenes of Julia learning to dress, buy clothes, use the proper fork. She's not quite as bad as the gal in Pygmalion, but then again, this is an R-rated version, so it's a sexier story, Imagine if Professor Higgins could bed his &quot;student,&quot; Eliza Doolittle<br />As far as the Cinderella side of this, Vivian comes from a tough &quot;hood&quot; that would eat her alive if it could. And yes, Richard Gere does come along and rescue her from the mean members of her &quot;hood&quot; family.<br />Hector Alizondo has a great role, playing the all knowing, always wise hotel manager (think hispanic Yoda&lt;g&gt;) who helps Julia pull herself together.<br />It's fun to see Jason Alexander as a bumbling creep (recently revisited in Shallow Hal.)<br />The thing that puts that magic into this story is the character arcs Julia and Richard go through.<br />Richard goes from an emotionally constricted, greedy financial power czar to become a kinder, more generous guy who cares about the people and the businesses he has been playing Monopoly with, and he (Big surprise) falls for Julia. (who wouldn't? &lt;G&gt;)<br />Julia evolves to become a more self aware, sophisticated, but still playful and simple, honest and straightforward woman (though still a goodhearted &quot;'ho.&quot;) She has this wonderful, playful nature that loaned itself so well to this story line.<br />This is, even after many other roles, still one of Julia's best (along with Notting Hill and Erin Brockovich.)  If you were, not surprisingly, disappointed with  America's Sweetheart, watch this film for a pick-me-up and a reminder of how good Julia can be.<br />The film also won the best film of the year from the People's Choice Awards and Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen from the Writer's Guild of America.

B00002E224|5.0|Ive read most of the reviews here and what has not been mentioned is the content of the dialog in this movie. I dont reccomend it for everybody because it is a very heady movie but if you have the desire to listen to intelligent conversation this is the movie for you. What struck me when I saw it was that thy talked about everything. Life, Love, Politics, Dreams. It is a conversation I picture myself having if I were Celine. And the thoughts and questions they expressed are the same thoughts and questions that I have had. Thats what got me about this movie. That I too have had these same conversations with people and said the same things. I think that this movie speaks to a special group of people... those who dare to think. I have only seen this movie twice.. I am so happy it is now on DVD and cant wait till my copy comes so I can watch it again.. and again.

B00000064G|4.0|&quot;None of you stand so tall / Pink moon gonna get ye all...&quot; as Nick Drake sings in his whispery voice in the title song to this album. But what does it mean? Only one thing gets us all, and that is death. Death came earlier to Nick Drake than to most of us, perhaps by his own hand, one night after years suffering from depression. So if the Pink Moon is death, why pink? Think of the folk belief about a crimson or blood-red moon. A blood-red moon is an omen of violence and death. But to a person who does not fear death, for whom life offers only pain, there is no shocking blood red there. It is a pink moon he calmly awaits, lovely and inviting. &quot;Yes, a pink moon / Pink, pink, pink moon...&quot;
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The review title says it all.. this DVD has got loads of extras which will take you some time to completely explore and enjoy ! It is awesome. Dreamworks has shown that they can give Disney a run for their money in the Animation world. The movie pokes fun at Disney characters like Snow white and some other fairy tale stuff which is the mainstay of Disney movies. Go ahead, take the untrodden path.. and see yourself guffaw like a jackass. By the way, a smart jackass in the movie (voiced by Eddie Murphy) is the funniest thing that happened to animation.
B00005R2M3|5.0|LAUNDRY SERVICE is, by far, the best album that has ever been released.  Never before have I purchased an album that I have loved every song on.  Shakira is amazing.

The contribution that it makes to nearly every genre of music is priceless.

B00001QEE5|5.0|When I was five, I was in love with Peter Pan. I thought I was going to marry him when I got older, and tried jumping out of a window, thinking I could fly. Now, at 14, I moved on to Michael. He's adorable! But..ahem...<br />This classic Disney movie is about Peter Pan, Neverland, the lost buys.... Wendy tells her younger brothers, John and Michael, stories about Peter Pan every night. Peter Pan himself loves these stories, and when he finds out that there will be no more stories because Wendy is moving from the nursery, he takes matters into his owns hands. He teaches the kids how to fly and takes them to Neverland, where the adventure starts. <br />No matter what your age is, if you have any taste, you'll love this movie.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie makes a mockery of what happened on that day. The tragedy suffered, the war it ignited...all of it dumped overboard for glitzy special effects and a bleeding heart love story. If you want to see a GOOD movie on the bombing of Pearl Harbor, go see &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; instead. Both my grandfathers fought in the South Pacific during World War II and I'm sure they are turning over in their graves at this very moment because of this tripe.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I loved Pink's first album, and when I heard this one was nothing like it, I was a little hesitant to buy it.  It is awesome!  It is very different from her original sound, but she is just so talented.  The songs are a lot more up lifting.  I just got it today and I've already listened to it 3 times.  You can hear the influence of Linda Perry, they have good chemistry together.  The sound is hard to describe, a little bit pop-rock, and little blues, and little dance, a little alternative.  It should please a wide audience.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Pearl Harbor, from a history book point of view, is a great, compelling, and tragic story. The movie version is a hollywood-imitized discrace. My first and biggest problem is that the movie is about fighter pilots. That's cool, but what about the sailors? This is their storyline, not two hotshot fighter pilots. I think the movie should have been told from a sailor point of view (Cuba Gooding's 5 minuite part doesn't count). Also, the movie is about 40 minutes too long. If you are going to make a bad movie, at least make it a short bad movie. Don't make us sift through 2 1/2 hours of (...) so we can see twenty minutes of the battle. Unless you are a real war enthusiest or were there for the actual attack, don't even bother with this.

B00005Q66T|5.0|This CD is a sample of the different directions Madonna has taken on her musical career. From the hip-hop of &quot;Human Nature&quot; to the R&amp;B of &quot;Take a bow&quot; to the Techno-country of &quot;Don't tell me&quot;. Each and every song from this album is different from the next; making evident the talent of the most adapting and trend-setting woman in show bussiness today. <BR>Take a look to the music of other so-called divas like Jennifer Lopez o even &quot;Princess&quot; Britney.. they all sound the same, the same beat, vocal style, lyrics. With Madonna there has been the element of surprise, innovation. Every album had a unifying theme. With this CD the theme is the diversity of her choices. If it is the first record you buy or the n-th, this is a must-have. You will experience why 17 years after her first single, she's still on the charts and with no end in sight. Hail to Queen Madonna!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park are one hot group right now. Their debut just passed the 4 million mark after debuting in October of 2000 (that's OVER A YEAR AGO, folks). Back around the beginning of the Summer (if i remember correctly), it rapidly ascended the charts, peaking at number 7 and hovering around there ever since, becoming one of the highest selling albums of the year. There's a reason for that, you know! Hybrid Theory is such an adrenaline-filled roller coaster ride, that when you reach the end you wonder how you survived. In terms of substance or depth of lyrics, they aren't stellar, but the strength of this release lies in 2 areas: its complex, original musical arrangements and the seamless trade-offs between the two vocalists, booming Chester Bennington, whose voice could put an atom bomb to shame, and Mike Shinoda, who raps and rhymes with just enough confidence and finesse to not be COMPLETELY overshadowed by Bennington. Let's hope these guys keep on doing what they are doing long into the future, cause they've given rock and roll a huge boost. Can't wait for their next release, though I know it's a little soon to be thinking of that (man, that one's gonna sell HUGE!)

B0000399WI|5.0|(...)I didn't like it because it was sentimental. I liked it because of it's genious storyline. I love the story line.  It makes you stop and think about what you do, why you do it, you just think about everything. I do agree that the Green Mile is horrible, and no even comparable to this. I enjoyed Morgan Freeman's nice, pleasurable tone on the narration and I think Tim Robbins plays his part masterfully. It is very well directed and, even though it goes at a very mellow and slow rate, you never get bored. The characters are so interesting that you have to know what happens to them. There are lots of twists and turning points in the story, and the last half hour of this film is the most enjoyable half-hour you'll ever see. Go and rent this movie. It isn't for everyone, but it is a remarkable film.

B00005Q66T|5.0|This CD is a sample of the different directions Madonna has taken on her musical career. From the hip-hop of &quot;Human Nature&quot; to the R&amp;B of &quot;Take a bow&quot; to the Techno-country of &quot;Don't tell me&quot;. Each and every song from this album is different from the next; making evident the talent of the most adapting and trend-setting woman in show bussiness today. <BR>Take a look to the music of other so-called divas like Jennifer Lopez o even &quot;Princess&quot; Britney.. they all sound the same, the same beat, vocal style, lyrics. With Madonna there has been the element of surprise, innovation. Every album had a unifying theme. With this CD the theme is the diversity of her choices. If it is the first record you buy or the n-th, this is a must-have. You will experience why 17 years after her first single, she's still on the charts and with no end in sight. Hail to Queen Madonna!

B00004XOWM|1.0|Limp Bizkit is one of ( if not ) the worst bands to mix rock and rap. They try to be like Kid Rock, but they can't come close to anybody! I would even listen to Britney Spears!  Fred Durst has to be the worst person to sing ever.  His annoying voice and stupid lyrics, are just what he is, annoying and stupid!  Hot dog has to be the worst atemptt to be cool by swearing ever. I thought 3 Dollar Bills Y'all was alful, but this is even worst. Redman, DMX And Method Man Have to be crazy if they ever appear on a Limp Bizkit CD again!<BR>In short Limp Bizkit is a bunch of loud jackasses form Jacksonville who aomehow got a record deal.  Never, ever, buy this CD and waste your money because you can do better!<br />Peace Out.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Have u ever heard that thing about an singer's 2nd album will be a huge failure and its up to them to either save their career or fade away? Well luckily Pink, who is very young and talented really avoided that. She put her all into making sure the second album is a really new and fresh experience, and it is. She's got a great voice too. You rock lovers have another confident female who speaks her mind. Gwen Stefani, Alanis, Madonna, and now Pink.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I've had this cd since it first came out, and it's just one of my all time favourites. It does have it warts however, most noticeably Fittier Happier and Electioneering -two tracks I think that sound like poor fillers..... but the rest are just plain really good -good enough for me to overlook those two.  This album is an entire album, and not one that should be listened to one random track at a time.  I liked it the very first time I listened to it, but every subsequent listen I like it even more -and I've listened to it many times now.<br />How some previous reviewers compare them to U2, I just don't know -different band, different style, differing concept and delivery of rock 'n roll.  I'm really, really puzzled about the reviewer who thought OKC was similar to Achtung Baby???  U2 is certainly a talented band, but I think for all their experimentation with Pop, Achtung, etc they are more traditional rock 'n roll compared to this Radiohead offering -and musically I don't think they've reached the heights of OKC.
B00004XQ83|4.0|Soundtracks of recent years have gotten worse and worse.Consisting of outtakes and assorted debris, the soundtracks of late leave one feeling ripped off.Every now and then a keeper like this comes along.The whole album will have you tapping your toes,laughing and smiling from ear to ear.Do thyself a big favor though:Go out and find the originals.A lot of the authentic folk and bluegrass stuff may not immediately strike you.Some may even be an acquired taste,but the search and the exploration of our musical heritage is well worth the time and effort.
0312263120|4.0|This book was recommended to me by David Gerhard, cousin of the author. I really appreciate Dan's work in coming up with a good story. I used to work (indirectly) for the agency he is writing about in this book and I was amazed by some of the reality turned fantasy (excellent job!). This book reads very much like a Hollywood movie with a clearly Hollywood finish. It should be very easy to turn into a screen play. That said, I was impressed with the detail at the beginning. However, I found the Hollywood style ending a bit weak and a bit too easy and unsatisfying.
B000002JKA|5.0|I don't grade that easily, as I wouldn't give even one album a year a five-star rating. Sometimes you stumble across a gem, and that's what happened to me here. I first bought Falling Into Infinity out of curiosity -- knowing absolutely nothing about the group. Occasionally when you do that, you are rewarded. I was intrigued by Falling after listening to it, and so I got their other albums. But there's no way I was prepared for Awake. This album blew me away. It's a rock and roll odyssey unlike any other. Very edgy and yet at the same time very refined -- how did they do that? It's really quite incredible. The vocals are not overbearing or out-of-place, as can happen with many unskilled hard rock bands. Some of these tracks are pure masterpieces.<br />Somehow I feel a rock band that can't play for more than 5 minutes at a time or go off on a 3-minute guitar solo (at least in the modern era) is hiding behind something. Dream Theater lays it all out and keeps a great tune going for 8-9 minutes (sometimes more) with seeming ease. <br />I've had an extensive collection, and have listened to music for 30 years. I enjoy practically all forms of pop and rock, having very diverse tastes. Up until five years ago I'd never heard of Dream Theater. Now they're one of my ten favorite artists ever. My musical tastes are all over the map. My #1 band is Pink Floyd, and I like the Beatles, Rush, BTO, R.E.M., Tangerine Dream, Blue Oyster Cult, Alan Parsons Project, Eagles, and Dream Theater. Those are my all-time favorite groups, but I also like bands like Guadalcanal Diary, Little River Band, Electric Light Orchestra, Fleetwood Mac, Steve Miller Band, Elton John, Chicago . . . <br />Bottom line is I'm not a hard rock fan per se, but the melodic, hard-driving offerings of Dream Theater make me a DT fan. This is a group that is extremely talented, both lyrically and musically. Thank you, Dream Theater, for giving us a unique brand of rock music that defies hard-rock conventions and transcends genre barriers.

Throughout the film Cambell takes a hilarious hiding getting smashed into walls, bookshelves repeatably falling on him and his whole body getting cut up by the evil fingernails of the dead. At one point in the film Bruce is caught under a small chair and is unable to actually lift the thing off himself.Throughout the film there are gruesome puss dripping attacks on Cambell but only does he really scream out in horror when the mirror turns to water which in my opinion would be the least of my worries.  Soon everyone has turned or been cut into several pieces with an axe except for for some unknown reason Bruce Cambell who seems imune to the demonic virus. So he reaches for the shotgun and does the only sensible thing and starts shooting randomly at the windowsthen stands at the open windows to get grabbed and mauled by the undead parasites. After alot of pulling and ripping he pulls off a john wayne style lasoo trick and doesn't really save the day.<BR>     It's horror at it's most gruesome and predictable with Bruce Cambell's facial expressions and stupid girls falling over lots when being chased that bring together a great cult horror film that you have to love in an evil undead kind of way.
B00005RIKD|4.0|Backed by an excellent band sting reworks a few of his old hits.  This album would have been better were it not for the circumstances surrounding the date of its recording but still it is worth picking up if just for some of the beautiful, evocative tracks like &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;A Thousand Years&quot;, &quot;Perfect Love... Gone Wrong&quot;, the old Police hits &quot;Don't Stand So Close To Me&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot;.  Unfortunately for US/Canada &quot;Mad About You&quot;, perhaps the band's best (and most fun) performance, has been left out.  <br />Could have been better but all in all still an exceedingly worthy album

When she tries to be surprising, I just find myself irritated.  The overall feel of this book is that of an amateur playing with someone else's characters - you read it but dismiss it as arbitrary and temporary.  Every few sentences she remembers she's supposed to be sounding poetic and throws in a sentence like 'She said his name like cinnamon on her tongue' (I'm paraphrasing here.)  I ask you!

B00000IAU3|2.0|If you are ever in any doubt as to the musical genius of Eminem, you have only to see how he took Dido's 'Thankyou', a twee and complacent slice of folkfluff, and hurled it into the most savage and frightening nightmare in modern music, completely transforming it into a kind of emotional ghost in a machine overloading with fury, murder, obsession, consuming hopes and desperate loneliness.<br />Such extreme emotions will not be found on 'No Angel'.  Extremes are anathema to Dido, whose warm and reassuring songs smooth over all life's rough edges, bathing them in a samey wash.  For all the modishness of the production, its nods to hip-hop, trip-hop, R'n'B, Massive Attack etc., this album reminded me of two not very modern forms of music - hazy Celtic muzak, such as The Corrs, Enya, Mary Black and Delores Keane; and 1980s yuppie soul, such as Sade.  These songs, none of which seem any different from its neighbour, have the annoying habit of lodging themselves immovably in your brain, like an unforgiving migraine.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Music is critically important in films where the world is magical and based in fantasy. Music helps create these worlds, and Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings score is so evocative that I can see Middle-Earth as it plays. The music is breathtaking, and I can't fathom how much it will add to the drama of the film. Although it waxes the Hollywood's conventional strings-and-percussion arrangements a bit, Shore diversifies with magnificent, gothic choirs and a very &quot;dark&quot; feel. Sometimes the compositions take you soaring through the skies: one particular theme plays through the album frequently, and it flows with a good feeling of heroism. The pounding &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; also raises your spirits but also employs a sense of tension in the quivering layers of strings. The mid-section of &quot;A Journey in the Dark&quot; is positively inspiring (although it gets back to a sinister feeling quick). &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; is the ultimate &quot;village song,&quot; with lively melodies and a nice bucolic feel. Many tracks, however, possess an incredible sense of menace that bodes well for the movie's &quot;dark &amp; misty&quot; look. &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot; and &quot;The Treason of Isengard&quot; come to mind. Enya's contributions (&quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; and &quot;May It Be&quot;) are beautiful, and representative of her work. The wordless melodies of &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; are very pretty with a limpid musical background. The whole warmth of the vibe is very &quot;elf-like.&quot; The opener, &quot;Prophecy,&quot; is paralyzing in its shadowy splendor. One thing of note: rarely do the songs rely on one mood...they are mostly extremely dynamic compositions shifting through different symphonic textures to alter the tone appropriately. Fans of Lord of the Rings have probably already bought this, but if you like epic movie soundtracks (with choirs!), don't miss out.
B00004SCX6|1.0|She has been turned in to the great T/A show.  All of this and Spears is a huge marketing engine of her body with what may be a few tolerable pop songs with the rest a bunch of mainly sex-sounds and weak music.  This girl probably has some talent but its a shame that its come to be only T/A show that will soon come to an end.
B00005Q66T|2.0|There is no way that GHV2 could have topped the Immaculate Collection.  Her later albums are more &quot;event&quot; albums, and do not meld together well like the first four did.  That aside, this compilation could have been better.  First of all, I know that a chronological order of the tracks might have been boring, but it would have made more sense to me in this case.  Second, she shortchanged us on the good songs.  Why isn't the Don't Cry For Me Argentina remix on here, instead of the regular track? What happened to Nothing Really Matters, Fever, American Pie, and You'll See?  The Power of Good-Bye is a nice song, but it wasn't a very successful single, and could have been taken off to make room for a better track.  <br />Final analysis:  Madonna must want us fans to make our own compilations from MP3 files, or she would have treated us to a better compilation, with a new single or two!
B000002B7O|5.0|While \\" Blizzard Of Oz \\" is the most famous of the two Rhoads albums, this one is his masterpiece. In fact this is so good this is the 3rd Best Album ever, and I mean ever!!! Only Ride The Lightning And Master Of Puppets are better. If it was Randy Rhoad's destiny to die young, like he sadly did, he certainly went out with a bang. The thing that sets this apart from \\" Blizzard Of Oz \\" is that the lyrics are for the most part better on this one and this album has a darker mood. For every song on \\" Blizzard \\" there is a equal or better counterpart on this one. While \\" Revelation (Mother Earth) \\" is his best ballad and nothing will ever top it, he has 3 excellent ones on \\" Diary \\" and the rockin' songs are better on here than on \\" Blizzard \\" except for the immortal \\" Mr. Crowley \\" These songs also have some of the best choruses I've ever heard. No disappointing sappy song like \\" Goodbye To Romance \\" either. Besides I always thought \\" Crazy Train \\" was a smidge overated. Anyway here's my grades.<br />                                       Song Grades<br />1. Over The Mountain-one of the best hard rockin' songs I have ever heard. Classic guitar solo and anthemic chorus. How could anybody not like this emotional chorus, \\" I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now, I told them I had ridden shooting stars and said I'd show them how \\" One of the best moments in rock.<br />     Final Grade-A+<br />2. Flying High Again-The radio classic off this one and for a good reason. One of the best songs you could play while at a party and another great anthemic chorus.<br />     Final Grade-A<br />3. You Can't Kill Rock N' Roll-One of the best songs I have ever heard. Great guitar playing and chorus. Must be heard to be believed. This is a song the Beatles would have made if they played metal.<br />     Final Grade-A+<br />4. Believer-This song is the only song on the CD that falls below the high standards set by most of these songs. All the other songs are great while thisone is only above average, but if they had a contest for best \\" filler \\" ever, this would be neck in neck with Metallica's \\" Trapped Under Ice \\" from RTL.<br />     Final Grade-B<br />5. Little Dolls-One of Ozzy's most underated songs ever. This song deserves to get more play. It's a slow grinder like Metallica's \\" The Thing That Should Not Be \\"<br />     Final Grade-B+<br />6. Tonight-This is a pretty good ballad, but not the best on this album. Better than the overated \\" Goodbye To Romance \\" Pretty good atmospheric song.<br />     Final Grade-B<br />7. S.A.T.O.-The hardest rocking song on this album with awesome guitar from the master Rhoads. This sounds like \\" No Bone Movies \\" but with better lyrics.<br />     Final Grade-B+<br />8. Diary Of A Madman-Ozzy's second best ballad behind \\" Revelation \\", the guitar has got to be heard to be believed. It is amazing with a capital A. Pretty haunting lyrics on this tune. The amazing thing is that it's only his second best title track behind \\" No More Tears \\" Still one of the best album endings ever and third A+ on this album.<br />     Final Grade-A+<br />What are you waiting for, buy this classic album.
B00005J9ZB|4.0|Arjen Anthony Lucassen has put together quite a project here. Into the Electric Castle is 100+ minute &quot;space opera&quot; that tells the story of eight people plucked up from different places in time to face the challenges of the electric castle. A narrator guides the characters (and the listener) with verbose phrases like, &quot;You have entered the cranial vistas of psychogenesis.&quot; One of the most impressive qualities of this album is how every character is represented by a different vocalist. Some of the high-profile folks are Fish (ex-Marillion) as the Highlander, Anneke van Giersbergen (The Gathering) as the Egyptian, and Damian Wilson as the Knight. Other, less well-known vocalists play, err, _sing_ the other characters, with Lucassen himself playing the Hippie.<br />The first few tracks being with the characters assessing their surroundings. Different characters, based on their backgrounds, interpret their situation differently. The Knight thinks he has discovered the mystical island of Avalon. The Roman thinks they've been plunged into the Underworld. The Egyptian's reaction is similar, as she thinks they have been chosen to enter the realms of her gods. Musically, Lucassen begins by building his music around the characters. The Highlander is treated to soft acoustic guitars, the Egyptian is accompanied with middle-eastern chords, and the Barbarian takes on straight-ahead rock n' roll. As the story progresses, each song becomes a different challenge presented by the electric castle. By the end, most of the characters are killed by one trap or another.<br />It's all pretty campy, but musically the Ayreon project is brilliant. Tons of musical styles are explored: melodic prog rock (&quot;The Decision Tree,&quot; &quot;Tunnel of Light&quot;), soft acoustic balladry (&quot;The Valley of the Queens&quot;), even some metal. I should stress, however, that the metal isn't threatening, or even really that heavy. It's just that there's some heavier riffs to convey particular scenes (like &quot;Across the Rainbow Bridge&quot;) with a bit more intensity and power. Even the &quot;death metal&quot; section is integrated tastefully. This occurs when the character called Death (performed with death, growly vox) kills the Indian. Still, it's weird -- you'd think this album was recorded to be a metal album. Although it's full of range and clarity, the recording is thick and bass-heavy, more fitting to metal than something lighter. Other styles of music here are classical (a requisite prog staple), some jazz, and some psychedelic rock.<br />I don't have a problem with the cheesy story, but I found that sometimes the music didn't fit particular scenes. In the case of the &quot;The Decision Tree,&quot; the cast must decide who among them must die before they can move on. Mainly, the Highlander and the Barbarian argue over their individual merits and why they should stay. The group seems to take this event well, or at least the music suggests that they do...it's surprisingly upbeat and peppy. Fortunately, the music most often fits the action well. Really! &quot;The Mirror Maze&quot; is pretty gloomy and mysterious; &quot;Death's Grunt&quot; is a dark, evil piece; and the spacey, atmospheric &quot;Time Beyond Time.&quot;<br />It's not perfect, but forgive its faults and admire it.

B00005R23S|5.0|I can't say enough about this DVD! I had previously owned the CD and watched the HBO telecast. I wondered why they had declined to show such treasures as Bruce singing Jungleland and Ramrod, live. Imagine the thrill of being able to watch a non-bootleg performance of Thunder Road, If I should Fall Behind, and his newest classic, Land of Hope and Dreams.<br />I've read some reviews complaining that he dragged out the classics too long. I have to respectfully disagree! This version of Tenth Avenue Freeze Out was the greatest! Watching Bruce pay homage to both Rock and Roll and the individual accomplishments of the beloved E Street Band, was a highlight of the show. Who would want to miss the look on &quot;Little Steven&quot; Van Zandt's face when Bruce included in his intro, &quot;Star of the Sopranos television show&quot;, and wife Patti Scalfia's look of should I kiss him or hit him as Bruce falls to his knees in front of her and calls her &quot;the first lady of love on guitar and vocals.&quot;<br />I've read reviews saying this production was too slick. I didn't see that. Instead, I reveled in hearing Bruce and the E Street Band play the songs that touch your heart and soul; Promised Land and the reworked Mansion on the Hill, just two examples that immediately spring to mind. The latter changed the theme of wanting what you can never hope to achieve, into a song where the protagonist shares his dreams for &quot;moving up&quot; in the world with his one true love, wife Patti. Her vocals carry the once, in my opinion, nondescript song, into a entirely new stratosphere.<br />This is simply Bruce at his best. His strong social consciousness is ever present, for example, Forty One Shots, a controversial song that has already been debated ad naseaum. But the majority of the show is full of the Joie de Vrie that is unique to the E Street Band and the Jersey Shore, think, Out in the Street, Prove it all Night, and Don't Look Back!<br />Bottom line, must have for any Bruce fan, and for the casual observer, has the potential to make a lifelong fan out of them!e fan, and for the casual observer, has the potential to make a lifelong fan out of them!

0425170349|1.0|Tom Clancy's books have gone steadily downhill.  Hopefully, this is rock bottom.  I received this book as a gift, but I have never been able to get past the first 200 pages in two attempts to read it.  This is from someone who was a huge Clancy fan after his first four or five books.  <br />The problem with the book for me is that I just cannot get interested in the characters or the story line.  Summary of the first 200 pages.  There is a new super-duper top secret multi-national anti-terrorist outfit headed up by Mr. Clark.  They effortlessly blow away a bunch of terrorists in a couple of incidents that were set up by the real bad guys to fail.  Meanwhile, some other real bad guys (or perhaps the same ones) are working on a really nasty biological weapon with the goal of wiping out most of the people on the face of the planet except for themselves of course.  They appear to be environmentally motivated.  Bet you can fill in the rest of the story from here.<br />Summary of character development in the first 200 pages:  The bad guys are bad.  The anti-terrorist unit trains really hard and worries about losing its edge.  <br />If you are new to Clancy start with Red October or Red Storm Rising.  The Cold War setting is now dated, but they are riveting stories that show Clancy at his best.

0790743507|5.0|Singin in the Rain is perhaps the greatest movie musical ever made. I absolutely just love this film. It combines music, dance and a really witty script to make the most magnificent of MGM's musicals.  The story goes like this: Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the toast of 1920's Hollywood. Then The Jazz Singer comes out and all hell breaks loose when they realize that talkies are going to be the next big thing.  Unfortunately, Lina has a voice that could shatter a mirror and caaaiiint seem to get anything done when a microphone is present. Don't worry though; Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) saves the day and knocks Don right off his feet. She promises to dub over Lina's voice and stay at the back of the cameras. Of course while Lina believes the press that Don and her are an item, Don is falling in love with the beautiful Kathy.<BR>All of the stars put in brilliant performances, especially Donald O'Connor, his `Make em Laugh' scene has to be one of the best-choreographed displays ever. Jean Hagen's portrayal of the shrill blond bombshell is absolutely hilarious, which won her a Best Supporting Actress nomination that year. And of course the multi-talented Gene Kelly: he can act, sing, and dance... the triple threat.  It still amazes me how Gene Kelly was also able to choreograph and co-direct while taking on the role of the main character.  Debbie Reynolds is great too, but in my opinion she plays second fiddle to Ms. Hagen. <BR>My favorite bit would have to be the trademark Singin in the Rain scene.  Just watching Gene Kelly sing and dance around in the streets while it is pouring rain is just wonderful.  This is a great film and I recommend it to everybody.  If you haven't seen Singin in the Rain then you must go see it, if you already have seen it then watch it again, and for those who don't think highly of musicals; this one is a must for you guys cause it will change the way you view musicals.
B00005O5CM|4.0|I purchased this DVD and everyone enjoyed it. It's a cute movie. If you liked &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; with Drew Barrymore, then you should really enjoy this one.
0385474547|5.0|This book is beautiful, both in the way it is written, as well as the story it tells. For anyone who has any doubts of the horrors that resulted from colonization, this book should clear up any misconceptions. Achebe tells the story with little or no bias whatsoever, and for the discerning reader who can distance him or herself enough from practices which seem almost barbaric in our new world, the overall meaning shines through!
B00000637V|5.0|I bought BERLIN after reading Victor Bockris's brutal biography of Reed, TRANSFORMER. It was hailed as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; throughout the book, and having been a big fan of Reed and VU for years, AND since it had just been re-issued on CD, I snatched it up. I had no idea what a surprise I was in for. Having heard many of the VU versions of these songs, and based on my other Reed discs, I was completely stunned by the theatrical-German-tavern orchestration, and the blatant violence (particularly misogyny) in the lyrics. None of this turned me off of the album, as I was determined to see it as a testament of a certain state of mind, which was discussed at length in TRANSFORMER. And according to the book the recording of this album was a catastrophe, what with Reed's increasing dependence on speed, and his emotional state. Knowing this, it is amazing that the album turned out as well as it did. But like so many other &quot;masterpieces&quot; it wasn't hailed as such until much, much later, when it could be listened to within its own context, and not just as the follow-up to the album TRANSFORMER. This leads me to my calling it an &quot;accidental masterpiece,&quot; as obviously Reed's vocals aren't up to par, there's nary a Reed-guitar crunch in sight, and much of the orchestration is close to being absurdly overwrought. However, my reason for giving it five stars is that it IS a perfect testament to Reed's state of mind/being at that particular time, flaws and all. Not many albums achieve this. One last thing, I wish people would stop with the: &quot;I like the VU version of this-or-that song better.&quot; I happen to like Reed's later takes on those songs, and in this case think that the BERLIN version of &quot;Sad Song&quot; is much more powerful than the original.
B000002KM6|5.0|If VH albums were jewels, this one would be the hope diamond.  &quot;Mean Street&quot; features Dave's most insightful social commentary.  A song about the ghottos of America, whose lyrics such as, &quot;The poor folks play for keeps down here, they're the living dead&quot;, are wrought of experience.  Listen to the way Eddie's solo bristles with the anger and insanity of the place.  Searing is the best way to describe the guitar on, &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;.  Too great a song to recieve so little airplay.  Check out the sustained guitar on the chorus.  Unbelievable tone!  The more rhythmic second guitar layer sounds like some sci-fi insect transforming itself into full size.  Classic VH sleeze about sex, &quot;Come see baby now&quot;.  What a phat song!<br />Check out the flanged opening to &quot;Hear About It Later&quot;.  A great early example of the 80's rock sound.  &quot;But I ain't home tonight! Whoahhhhh&quot; - Dave's howl with the sound of the band - like a bomb into the solo.  Shred-a-rama.  Listen to the last great riff @ 3:45 into the song.  Awesome power.  The song ends like some olympic gymnist's finnale.  The secret to the smokin' sound of &quot;Unchained&quot;, are the string slides Ed layers over the main riff.  Considering the mediocrity of the breakdown, it's an overrated song, but the main riff is hands down the best EVH riff ever.  &quot;Come on Dave, give me a break&quot; - It sounds like he's lighting something on fire.  Unique for VH, &quot;Push Comes To Shove&quot;, features a swinging reggae beat.  Easily the best extended guitar solo of the album, maybe Ed's best ever.<br />At 31 minutes it's their shortest album, but with such sonic dynamite you won't feel cheated.  It's the ultra-concentrated VH album.
0385505833|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have read all of the Grisham books.  He is a wonderful writer.  I await with great anticipation for his next legal thriller.  However, while in waiting I LOVED THIS BOOK!<br />It was a quick read, I was done within hours, and as usual you become very attached to the characters and you begin to feel what they are going thru.  Skipping Christmas always seems like a good idea, at least the part of the running around between shopping and holiday parties, the feeling of having so much to do and that time is running out til the big day!<br />This book really put all of these feelings into perspective, addressed them, yet ultimately reminds you what the holidays are all about.  You get all this, plus some pretty good laughs.
0385505833|4.0|This would make a super funny Christmas show for TV.Raymond Barone would HAVE TO be Luther, the husband!!! Our Town,USA is getting decorated for Christmas .....and I mean DECORATED to the hilt. Luther decides not to do the normal Christmas blow-out and opts for a cruise with his wife since their daughter joined the Peace Corps and went out of the country. It's a very, very funny story that will make you laugh out loud while reading because you'll probably &quot;see&quot; a neighbor-----or maybe yourself-----in these hilarious situations.<br />Goodness, the book is less than 180 pages and the book is small in size....so by all means, read this book. You'll laugh at yourself, you'll laugh at some of the memories this might shake loose, and you'll laugh at Nora in the tanning bed. Every time I'll see a Frosty during the holidays, I will most definitely think of this book and probably chuckle.<br />Very fun read....add this to your holiday collection.....
0399236201|5.0|This tale of espionage is especially well written and exciting. There are some \\"scary\\" sequences, but that's part of what makes this such a good story.<br />The young hero has to assume tremendous responsibility in a time of loss, but learns that he does have the resources to take care of himself and take risks to help others.  The writing is intelligent and fast paced, with a good use of vocabulary, challenging and encouraging kids to read at a higher level. The theme of finding out what is special about yourself, and discovering the \\"hero\\" inside will appeal to kids who loved the wizard Harry Potter and the detectives Frank and Joe Hardy.
B000002OG5|3.0|There is a very broad chasm between what I WANT to say about this film score and what I HAVE to say about this film score.  What I WANT to say is that you MUST buy it; it is a perfect album for a perfect score; no film score collection is complete without it.  Instead, what I HAVE to say is that the music in the film IS perfect, but the music on the album is so ignorantly assembled that it makes the purchase nearly worthless.  So, there you have it.  Anyone who has seen the film has undoubtedly fallen in love with Nino Rota's amazing score, thematically beautiful and with more than a hint of his Italian roots.  Every praise that one can distribute to such an achievement is well deserved; however, it is nearly impossible to determine this based on the album offered to the consuming public.<br />So what is the problem?  Just this: The Godfather CD has a healthy number of tracks, however not a one is longer than three minutes, not only making for a short album, but also for disjointed excerpts that are far too brief to ever give a sufficient amount of the feeling displayed in the film and never allowing the themes to develop.  Moreover, what is offered on the CD is so incredibly redundant that you can justify NOT purchasing this album by acquiring a mere suite from some compilation disc.  This CD, however, offers only glimpses of what the REAL film music was, sometimes even fading out with no cause and no transition!--surely no film score should ever result to such a despicable convention.<br />But, as much as I hate the CD, one cannot deny that the music is a simply phenomenal creation.  Melodies that you'll be humming for days after, a concluding choral track that excels beyond every other excerpt, and even a risky--though intriguing--organ track all effectively reveal the magic that was to be experienced in the theatre.  Unfortunately with this album, it was BETTER experienced in the theatre.  Because the music held so much promise and because the film is such a pivotal addition to cinema and because the entire Godfather series is a phenomenon of itself, one would have hoped that the producers of this album could have successfully translated an inspiring score onto a CD.  Unfortunately, they have not; and so the consumer suffers by having to make a choice that no person should be forced to make: purchase a bad CD or neglect one of cinema's greatest musical achievements.  The choice is yours...
B00005QIPH|4.0|I bought this album because of the hype and critical acclaim by itself, which is enough to convince me to buy an album.  I didnt like it at first, but once the melodies of the songs start to sink in its a wonderful CD.  Its alot like Weezer- nothing too special, good, short, rock songs, and somehow it works.  The standout tracks to me are numbers 3, 6, and 7.  Their new song that I saw on MTV2 after i purchased the album is a catchy song you'll find yourself singing for days.  It has a great melody, and takes us back to the style of the 70's.  This whole album sounds a bit like a 70's druggie album, actually.  And that could be a good thing.  With all this nu metal, death metal, alternative rap stuff thats out now, its great to have just a good, lo-fi, organic rock band.  Its all up to them to save rock.  Its a big task, but I think they'll be able to do it.  Last Nite has just made top 20 on the Modern Rock charts, and I see it being a big hit.  Definately buy this.

0425074811|5.0|I first came across this book when a coworker was reading it.. she had an ancient copy that her father bought in 1973.  I read a few pages of it, and loved it.  I immediately got my own copy.  My view ont his subject was mainly shaped by skeptics (most notably the essays of Isaac Asimov, who felt, until his dying day, that there was absolutely no proof of any alien cultures ever existing... I would have loved to see a head on debate between Asimov and Mr. Von Daniken.)  It blew me away.  It introduced me to quite believeable proof that aliens have been periodically visiting us, possibly for millions of years.<br />The book is slightly outdated (such as a quote from NASA saying we'll &quot;definately&quot; land a person on Mars no later than 1986.)  And his guesses at how fast technology would advance were quite off.  (He expected us to have space crafts capable of travelling at 99% the speed of light by 1991, as well as having 'hover belts' and some scanning technology we aren't even close to developing yet.)  However, once he gets to the facts, the book becomes fascinating.  A spaceport in the Andes?  An unknown 4,000 year old metal alloy we can't identify?  (That won't rust or react to phosphate and sulphur.)  They found the remains of a millenia old electrical battery in Iraq.  Incredible.  This book floored me.  The only part I feel is dubious is that early &quot;gods&quot; (by which he means alien visitors) cross bred with early humans.  (Not homo sapiens exclusively, but earlier steps in evolution.. homo erectus, neanderthal, etc.)  I feel he was right when he said they may've helped the strong specimens evolve, while allowing the weaker ones to die, along with killing off the 'freaks'.  (such as what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah.)<br />Overall, a most excellent book.. highly reccomended for anyone to read, even the sceptics who don't believe in such stuff.<br />My only question is.. what'll happen if the aliens come back?  Surely, if their technology was far beyond anything we have now, it'll be so much ahead of us now we won't be able to comprehend most of it.. what kind of wonders will they show us?  Or will they deem us unworthy and anniliate most of our species, like they may've very well done in the past?
B00005Q66T|5.0|Only the best of the best is on the cd. The cover tekst is well written, and tells alot about the Queen of pop. It's a must own cd...
B00005J6T1|5.0|I loved this CD.It takes me back to when Madonna made her debut. It's also reminiscent of real performers who were one in a million. This CD is a great mix of Funk,Techno,and Club mix.My faveorite song is &quot;Everybody!&quot;  If the CD stank I would tell whoever is considering buying this item. But, it doesn't. It captures a type of music that transcends every race,sexual preference, and etc...
B00003CXXI|4.0|I truly watching this movie with my family.  There was something it it for everyone, and the music is great!
B000001FQI|5.0|This is Tears For Fears third album. It is quite a departure from their first two albums, which were typical, but better than average, new wave pop from the early eighties. This album has a much more mature, rich and complex sound. It mixes soul, pop, jazz and straight ahead rock with bits of psychodelia thrown in.<br />For this album, the duo actually expands to a trio with the addition of Oleta Adams. She adds just as much to the sound as Orzabal and Smith. Her song writing, singing and keyboard playing are phenomenal. <br />Many critics and fans complained that it took too long for this third album to come out, and that it sounded too much like the Beatles. In concert, Curt Smith would introduce Sowing the Seeds of Love, with &quot;It took us 4 years to make a new album and all we could come up with is this&quot;. After the song, they would break into All You Need Is Love. <br />This is one of those albums where every track is fantastic, except one. Advice for the Young At Heart is a horrible, sappy song. Even the title is painful to hear.  Alot of people consider the break up Smith and Orzabal as the reason for the band to drop off in popularity. But, it was ill considered decision to release Advice For The Young At Heart as the second single from this album that caused the band to drop out of the limelight. When the single was released, album sales dropped like a rock. It's unfortunate that this songs sits in the track 4 position, and interrupts the flow of the album. <br />Note, the track order listed here is incorrect.
0316779237|4.0|This year there are no shortage of Christmas books on this site or in your local book shop to fill you with all the images of the holiday season: snow crested fields, roaring fireplaces, carolers, holly and ivy- you get the picture. There are newcomers like Grisham's \\"Skipping Christmas\\" and Mary and Carol Higgins Clark's \\"He Sees You While You're Sleeping\\" and \\"The Mitford Snowmen\\". Booksellers pile them right next to classics like Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\\"  \\"The Polar Express,\\" and Dr. Seuess' \\"The Grinch that Stole Christmas\\". Just like the annual search for the perfect tree, the search for the perfect holiday book is no less daunting.<br />So while browsing for my holiday selection, I was directed to a small paperback volume in David Sedaris' \\"Holidays on Ice\\".  It's been out for a few years, but I missed this one (after reading it, I think I missed it because the Christmas police must have ordered it off the shelves for fear of causing a national laughing epidemic). Forget the antisocial behavior of the Grinch, he's just an out of work elf compared to Sedaris. Nothing, absolutely nothing about Christmas is immune from the sarcasm and cynicism displayed in the collection of short stories that make up this small volume. After reading this book on my train ride to Rockefeller Center to watch the annual lighting of the Christmas tree, I don't think that I'll ever be the same. Imagine that Santa's `Ho, Ho, Ho' greeting is really his egg nog induced shout to a streetwalker; or that Macy's dresses ex-cons and thugs as its Christmas elves; ever receive a Christmas letter from a cousin inside the annual holiday card only to have him recount his indictment for murder and invite your family to his bail hearing; or what about a contest with the neighbors over who can donate more blood to show the spirit of giving.   Like I said, I'll never be the same.<br />If you like to laugh and can appreciate the acerbic wit of someone whom must have gotten too much coal in his stocking as a child to come up with this collection of irreverences, then this one's for you.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I WENT TO GO SEE THIS MOVIE WITH MY MUM AND MY AUNT AND WE LOVED IT! THE ONLY THING I COULDN'T STAND WAS THAT THE OTHER KIDS WERE ALWAYS PICKING ON THE GRINCH. EVER SINCE I SAW IT LAST YEAR, I'VE BEEN A GRINCH FAN. I THINK THIS MOVIE IS BETTER THAN THE CARTOON IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. JIM CARREY HAS DELIVERD HIS BEST PREFORMANCE SINCE DUMB AND DUMBER. THE SCENE WHERE THE GRINCH IS SITTING IN HIS CAVE EATING A BEER BOTTLE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENES IN THE FILM.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I had to see this movie a few times before I liked it but I fell in love with the soundtrack immediately! It was reminiscent of the &quot;mountain music&quot; my grandparents used to play and brought back memories of such happy times. <BR> The collection is kind of a combination of old time country, bluegrass and gospel, basically a &quot;down-home&quot; mix but the results are magic. They must be to make this rock fan want to fall so far from the tree so to speak.
0385721234|5.0|Laura Esquivel did her good launching her first successful master piece, Como Agua Para Chocolate.  This novel let us see by Tita (main character) her repressive hard-to-die mother, a sister who brokes all cultural laws and another who becomes her adversary for the love of Pedro (main character).  With the warm atmosphere of a kitchen, hard-to-achieve love, passion, more recipes and characters external and internal fights this novel is a must to have.  Language is very simple but don't low the quality of the context.  For spanish learners is ideal not just for spanish literature but get familiar with our culture.
0062502182|4.0|Even as I write this, I'm havign trouble justifying doing so to myself.  I feel that this book should be handed from person to person, not bought.  I first read it when a special aunt of mine loaned it to me the summer after my freshman year in high school.  I loved it then, but forgot its title later.  <BR>Somehow, I forget the exacts, I remembered it was The Alchemist ths spring.<BR>I read it again, I am now a junior in college, in september.  I've loaned it out to lots of friends since.  Re reading this book was a magical experiance for me.  The simplicity of it is wonderful.  I know that there are lots of criticisms that could be made about it, but it is a truely beautiful story.  Buy it, read it, loan it to those you love, or even leave it on a park bench for some stranger to find and enjoy.  Become a part of the magic.
B00005N83O|1.0|I bought this album just to try to understand wats the hype about J.Lo lately.Well,I was rather disappointed.The songs are nothing fantastic,and the voice makes it worse.\\"Im Real\\" sounds a bit like Mariah Carey \\"Loverboy\\",although the beat is nice.\\"Aint it funny\\" fails to imitate Madonna \\"La Isla Bonita\\",although the chorus is catchy.\\"Play\\" is such a (...),low-class version of Madonna \\"Music\\". Madonna and Janet may not have good voices too,but at least they sound sexy and divine respectively.<BR>What can I say, but J.Lo is far off when compared to Madonna and Janet Jackson.One thing I must admit is that, she looks good on MTV. (...)
0783225903|5.0|One thing you can be sure of, when seeing a Terry Gilliam movie: beautiful art direction, complex and dark sets, tongue in cheek humour, often in the details. A bewildering strain of events in an ever more intrigueing story.<BR>See how Sam Lowry, a humble but efficient public servant, tries to find the woman he's fallen in love with in the maze of a Kafka-esque and 1984-like society. Deeply unsettling notions of Big Brother government style are mixed with hilarious scenes (&quot;there was a slight complication of the complication&quot;). And finally, it's a very moving story too: just like a modern Oedipus, Sam Lowry only wants to do good and thereby conjures up the demons of doom to ruin and destroy his own life and that of others.<BR>One of the best movies ever - because it's dramatic, hilarious, well shot, impressive, thought provoking. And still it's great entertainment.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is the best! Nothing more can be said, other than it has been said that he almost rivles SRV on the guitar. He is often compared to DMB but in my oppinion (...) it is inapropreate for him to be compared. Well to the cd! The songs are uplifting to the sperit, eaven the slower ones (...) The layout of the CD is well thaught out, moving from the more upbeat no such thing to the slower St. Patric's day about lovers finding an excuse to stay together. BUY THIS CD YOU WILL LOVE IT, John WILL make it big in a short matter of time! Get it before it is trendy, impress your friends, and let John impress you! im serious but it, listen to it, and you uont be able to take it out of your cd player, it is that good!
B00004SZWB|5.0|I purchased this album when it first came out(many years ago). Hotter Than July has been a main stay for years with me I never seem to tire of it. Great back up vocals, great instruments and Stevie just belt them out with as much feeling as ever, an amazing man.<BR>Give it a listen I garantee you will end up with it in your collection.
B00005KFUM|4.0|When this band landed a year or so ago it was with acclaim and criticism, in equal measure. Their sound was harsh, abrasive and yet strangely addictive. They were labelled Radiohead wannabes and rock poseurs, but at least they didn't hide it. Muse have moved on from all that. One listen to this follow-up cd and some words come to mind immediately. Grandiose. Manic. Ambitious, with perhaps a touch of pretentiousness? Maybe, but this is good stuff. Matt Bellamy's voice carries the whole thing, a space-age melding of razor-sharp guitar riffs and spine-tingling synth arrangements. When he takes a large gulp of air, you know you're in for something special. Often the relentless wail of guitars can be too much, and some of the songs are fairly uninspired, but these are nothing when held up to the album's shining moments. &quot;New Born&quot; is broken up into operatic-like acts making for a six-minute assault where Bellamy's voice changes pitch more times than I can remember. Add to that the mad distorted riff-fest of &quot;Hyper Music&quot; and this is one album without an identity crisis; &quot;Origin&quot; is true rock with pomp and flair. Think of Queen, and more recently, the Smashing Pumpkins and you'll arrive at Muse, who just keep getting better.
0446608955|3.0|I'll admit that this book made me cry and Sparks succeeded in bringing Landon and Jamie's characters to life. It was, however, incredibly predictable and overly mushy. Even the supposedly unusual ending was obvious. I gave it 3 stars because it was well-written and evoked emotion, but it was kind of cliched and not really very exciting to read. It's a good book to read in the winter when you're sitting by the fire and have an hour or two to spare, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone over the age of 25. Also, it's definitely not a book that a guy would enjoy.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD is really good, and in my opinion it started the really good Limp Bizkit, Three Dollar Bill Y'all was to much heavy metal. Let's get started with the review:<br />Intro:5/5 It's hard to rate an intro, but it's important to the outro.<BR>Just Like This:5/5 Great song to kick the CD off with, upbeat and addictive.<BR>Nookie:5/5 This is a good song, thats all I can really say, so just listen to it.<BR>Break Stuff:5/5 This song has lyrics that don't make sense. BUT THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON THE CD! Fred must have been extreamly (...) when he wrote it. It has great music to it and swears like crazy.<BR>Re-arranged:5/5 A mellow song with lyrics that don't quit, great voice, nice edge to it and very important parts for DJ Lethal.<BR>I'm Broke:5/5 This is a cool song. I hadn't heard it before I got the CD, and now I love it.<BR>Nobody Like You:2/5 This song is nothing special.<BR>Don't Go Off Wandering:3/5 This song's Okay, basically it's Fred singing about misery.<BR>9 Teen 90 Nine:2/5 Igggh, no real reason to like it.<BR>N 2 Gether Now: When Fred Raps, this song is good. When Method Man Raps, things go down the Toilet. This song is also funny. The chorus consists of \\"Shut the F*** up\\" over and over.<BR>Trust?:2/5 This is one of the more heavy songs, and isn't to great.<BR>No Sex:5/5 This song is actually really good. It is slightly perverted, but not as bad as Korn or anything. It is mellow with grat guitar and singing. It also features Staind in the Chorus and a few verses.<BR>Show me What You Got:4/5 Kind of a weird song. Fred lists differnt famous Cities in the USA and sings about what he did in them. Then he thanks people who made appearances or helped in the album.<BR>A Lesson Learned:1/5 ???This is Fred singing by himself. In a weird voice. Not really a point to it.<BR>Outro:5/5 DJ Lethal says entertaining things in a electronically altered voice.(Slowing it down) After that, on the intro to track 16(which isn't anything) one of Fred's friends goes crazy. About 30 seconds later, (I think it is) his brother says some weird things.<br />This CD is a must if you don't already have it, so go out and buy it!
B000002I99|5.0|The motive of nightmares, psychos and black humor are well known in Cooper albums during the early 70's, but still, &quot;Welcome to my nightmare&quot; is one of his best ever. The cover is inspired by &quot;Clockwork orange&quot;, and the CD sounds good. Late Vincent Price is still scary as the mad scientist in &quot;Black widow&quot;,&quot;Steven&quot; stands above all, while &quot;Only women bleed&quot; that surprised all Alice fans when the album was released, does'nt do much today. I think that these were Cooper best days in his career. Later he repeated himself, tried to do something else in &quot;Lace and Whiskey&quot; and turned to be irrelevant.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD is my most prized one in my collection. If you have heard the rumors about DJ Lethal and Wes Borland leaving the band, then I'll tell you now that they are true. That is even more of a reason to buy their CD's and treasure them. Okay, enough chat, here's the review:<br />Intro:5/5 I'm not really sure how to rate an intro, but it's important to listen to for the outro.<BR>Hot Dog:5/5 Okay, okay, they do say [...] 48 times in this song, but you have to hand it to Fred Durst to think up a song with \\"that word\\" in it so many times. It is an addictive and likable song. Kids: don't listen to this amazon track if you parents are nearby<BR>My Generation:5/5 This is a great song, good everything.<BR>Full Nelson:4/5 This song is pretty good, Fred must of wrote it when he was pissed off.<BR>My Way:5/5 This song is so good! It has great singing and soul behind it. It has mellow lyrics and and a heavier chorus, which has proven to be a great combination.<BR>Rollin':5/5 This is the better Rollin' of the 2. It is kind of a song to get the crowd going, so the lyrics don't make much sence. BUT, this is my favorite song on the CD and is one of the best songs Limp Bizkit plays.<BR>Livin it up:5/5 This is a kind of rappy song with lyrics that don't make sense, but I love it anyway and it is always on my list of songs to play if I'm on a short car ride or somthing.<BR>The One:4/5 This song proves that Fred isn't just a big dork who shouts swears into a microphone while trying to beat someone up. It is a mellow song with pwerful lyrics and good edge.<BR>Getcha' Groove On:1/5 Ugggh, X-zibit totally [...]!<BR>Take a Look Around:5/5 This is the M:I 2 theme, but it is more than that. This is undoubtedly one of the best songs on the CD.<BR>It'll be OK:3/5 This song is fairly good. Good lyrics, but the song isn't something to write home about.<BR>Boiler:4/5 This is a good song. Fred sings the first set of verses in a sad way, then bring out his anger in the next verse.(But not with a dumptruck load of swears)<BR>Hold On:2/5 Fred proves again that he's no just some thug, but it's too much of a wossie song for me.<BR>Rollin':3/5 This version of Rollin' is much more of a rappy hip-hop song featuring DMX, Method Man and Red Man. I don't like any of them, but Freds rapping is good. It is much longer than the first Rollin'<BR>Outro:5/5 This track has a funny interview with Ben Stiller, and then has messages from Fred's answering machine.<br />This CD is an absolute must. Fred has an amazing voice, Wes(Borland) is my favorite guitar player out there. John(Otto) is a great drummer and has good fills and beats. Sam(Rivers) plays really good bass, and you can actually distinguish him from all the other sounds in the songs. DJ Lethal has some important parts, but not as important as his parts in Significant Other. Get this CD, you won't regret it!
B00004Z459|4.0|Ok, I know you're not reading this because it's at the end of 700 reviews but I'm going to say this anyway. Don't hate on linkin park. Yes, you can technically classify them as \\"rap-core\\", \\"nu-metal\\", \\"rap-rock\\", and whatever other names you can come up with, but LP stands out for a number of reasons. They have heavy guitar, a DJ, an MC... all the typical ingredients for a band of their \\"genre\\". What makes them stand out is the fact that they put it all together. (Which many bands today fail to do.) But they have something else. A vocalist who can actually sing. LP manages to put all together quite nicely. Every song has its moments and the only songs that get old are \\"One Step Closer\\"(really fast) and \\"Points of Authority\\"; which lack the harmonious elements that the other songs have. [...]
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is a really good band, one of the best and most original out there right now. There are 0 swears in this CD, not even minor ones. Here is a list of all the tracks that stand out, and all of them deserve 5/5 stars<BR>#1 Papercut<BR>#2 One step Closer<BR>#4 Points of Authority<BR>#5 Crawling<BR>#6 Runaway<BR>#8 In the End<BR>#9 A Place For My Head<BR>#11 A Cure For The Itch<BR> <BR>This is an original CD with extreamly talented band members. If you don't have it, get it.
B00005QG9J|5.0|After Incubus' last album, &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, I didn't think they could get much better.  They did.  They've drastically matured with &quot;Morning View&quot;.  Their lyrics have so much meaning in them; they're interlaced with moving sounds that flow perfectly.  Incubus has reached deep inside and pulled out a masterpiece from their soul.  There is not a bad song on the album.  It is at one moment good-old, fast-paced Incubus (Under My Umbrella, Blood on the Ground, Circles), and yet can be mellow and thoughtful the next (Mexico, 11 AM, Echo).  The songs that are best combnine these two elements; Wish You Were Here, Warning, Just a Phase, and Have You Ever make the most of this.  It's hard to pick a favorite, so I won't.  I'll just recommend this to anyone who likes original, and meaningful music.
B00000J7JO|4.0|When I listen to the radio, it's not uncommon to hear a Red Hot Chili Peppers song. When I went to amazon to look at the CD's, I noticed all the ones I liked were on this CD.<br />Let me start by saying the first 6 tracks are all good, and (I think) the rest are just there to make a CD.<BR>Track 1, Around the World, is an upbeat song with great rythem and lyrics, and the singing is really good, too. It is kind of rappy in the verses, but the chorus is awesome and saves you from that, if you don't like rap.<BR>Track 2, Parallel Universe, is a song I had to grow to like, but now it's a good song.<BR>Track 3, Scar Tissue, is a slow song with powerful lyrics, but don't listen to it too much when you get the CD, it can get boreing.<BR>Track 4, Otherside, is the best song on the CD in my opinion, it sonds like it's going to be quiet, but it turns into a great song with well planed singing, really good instumentation, and lyrics that suck you right up. This song is amazing.<BR>Track 5, Get on Top, is a little repetative, but it's the most upbeat song on the CD. The lyrics arn't that impressive, but the singing is. Once again, good instrumentation that is appropriate to the different points in the song.<BR>Track 6, Californication, is another slow song, but I think that it is better than Scar Tissue.<BR>Tracks 7-15: not that impressive, it is the weak side to the CD.<br />This CD is worth buying with six good songs on the CD. You hardly ever find a CD where every or almost every song is good, so this CD is definetely not a waste of you money and time.
0792846710|5.0|I am a huge fan of movies, I've seen most of them, and I have to say this is my favorite horror flick of all time. I never really noticed clowns until this movie! I love the curly straws and acid pies...this is definatley a classic. Watch and beware! Klowns know where you live, they know where you go to make out...
B000002BBY|4.0|Oasis is a good band, so if you don't have this CD yet, I'd recommend it. Track 3, Wonderwall, is a really good song with great music, singing and lyrics. Track 10, Morning Glory is a good song, with a faster pace than the other songs, and it is a song you can listen to over and over again. A lot of people like &quot;Don't Look Back In Anger&quot; but I didn't find it to be that impressive. You might like it though, and even if you don't, you should buy this CD.
0871137380|5.0|This book will go down in history as one of the finest battle accounts ever written.  Though Herodotus and Thucydides are pretty good too, this book takes on modern warfare and gives you 200 pages of the most &quot;you are there&quot; writing you could imagine.  I could NOT put it down and read it in several hours nonstop.  O'Brien's The Things They Carried (short stories on Vietnam) is the closest I can recall that gives the absolute horror of real injuries, loss of limbs, loss of intestines, etc...  The reality of war is that it's not at all romantic -- it's blood guts and suffering.<br />You'll be amazed at how resistant the Somalies were and how the Americans' lack of sensitivity in the months before the battle caused lots of the problems. I like the way the author presents a balanced view of the battle that makes us consider both sides of the coin and decide for ourselves who was at fault.  Well written, well-paced and well-researched.  Excellent.

B00005Q66T|5.0|After recently hearing the entire collection via an Internet only broadcast, this was an easy buy.  I don't listen to pop radio or watch music television programs and therefore have not been inundated with these songs over the past 10 years or so. <br />We did see &quot;Evita&quot; though, loved it, and am glad for the inclusion of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; in this package. As a greatest hits collection, there are many highlights here from the work of this great artist who we so casually refer to as Madonna.<br />I'm thoroughly enjoying this CD and have found it motivating music to work by, do homework by, write programs by. Having said that, I'm surprised so many people are writing to say it offers nothing new. I understood this to be implied by the title &quot;Greatest Hits Vol.2&quot;.<br />This collection is a welcome addition to our CD library, the other Madonna CD we own being the wonderful compilation &quot;Something to Remember&quot;.
0385505833|1.0|I just want to know why on earth John Grisham has started to write bull like this. The Brethren was his last good novel. He should go back the legal thrillers that made him a famous comtemporary writer. Now he is just using his name to sell the crap that he writes. Personally, I want to old John Grisham back.
B00005QXXO|4.0|This is for all those disillusioned fans that like Radiohead, like their new stuff, blah, blag, blah.  They have seen Radiohead live and say that this is a mediocre live performance at best.<br />A RECORDING of a live performance does not come even CLOSE to actually seeing the same live performance in person.  The two are completely different.  Obviously, the volume is taken down.  The rush of hearing those clean-cut guitars blasting through a live audience is lost in the recording process.  They have none of the benefits of mixing and producing like they do in the studio, but if you are there live, it's often so loud that a slight BUZZ begins to surround the music.  In essence, it could be a TERRIBLE live performance and may sound good to you regardless.  The exception is the vocals.  You can usually tell if the singer is performing well or not, even at a live show, but even THAT is not the same as a recording of the same performance.  So those that say \\"I saw Radiohead live, man, and it was like so surreal and amazing and I was all stoked and (...) to hear the new live record and it's crappy compared to the real thing.\\"  (...) Being at a live preformance includes feeling the rush of adoring fans around you, screams, sweat, and VOLUME that basically masks HOW the performance would sound if it was recorded to tape.<br />Lastly, if you DON'T like the new Radiohead, then don't buy the (...) record.  Stop complaining about wanting \\"The Bends II.\\"  It's annoying.  Buy Coldplay or something.
B000021YQV|1.0|and when i say this i dont mean it to be used as entertainment or for enjoyment. when i first heard chop suey i thought the band would be worth a shot. when i popped in the cd i thought my dad was yelling at me, but it was only the music.  the album is nothing like chop suey, only one other song is remotely good #8 i think. i like bands like offspring greenday ect., even rob zombie &amp; limp bizkit. so if u like that kind of music then dont waste your money on this recording of rythmless shouting. and when i say the album has one use, it makes a nice frisbee
6304994540|5.0|Can anyone think of a funier movie with more genuine quotes than &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;? The characters in the movie are just pure genius, from the Dude to Jesus there has never been a more entertaining combination of eccentric characters.  The brothers also use there incredible skill as directors in a few memorable dream/drug sequences. A must see for anyone who just wants to have fun.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I was moved to write this because (...) this fabulous film that has been one of the great influences in my life.  Unfortunately, many people look at a this film, and many foreign films in general, and assume it's just a bunch of hype by critics because they don't get it.  Fellini doesn't hand you what he wants to say on a platter, that's just not going to happen with any of his films.  If you want that, well then go see The Rock or Armegeddon or other such movies.  This is more than a movie, Smokey and the Bandit is a \\"movie\\".  This is a film.  And a work of art.  <BR>I am proud to have an understanding of Mr. Fellini's films for this understanding has brought me so much.  What it has given me mostly was the ability to discern a great work from a mediocre one.<BR>A note to those who just don't get it.  Perhaps you should watch a few other Fellini films before seeing 8 1/2 then you would understand how autobiographical and immense this film is.  I would start with La Strada and The Nights of Cabiria.  Then, if 8 1/2 still seems overrated and undecipherable, so be it.
0060920084|2.0|In recounting his journeys through small-town U.S.A., Bryson provides some hilarious episodes and some insights - particularly about the over-commercialization of the landscape and careless destruction of natural and historical treasures.  But this book is marred by too many complaints about bad food and lodging as well as careless generalizations, especially about the South.  He also appears to have made almost no meaningful contacts with the locals in his travels.  Compare this book to William Least Heat Moon's &quot;Blue Highways,&quot; and you will see that Moon is much, much better.
6304806434|1.0|Lots and lots of things being blown up.  That's about all I really got out of this flick.  Things that are noticeably absent here: a plot and decent acting.  I guess the producers figured they could cover up the bad script with cheap Hollywood stunts and gimmicks.  If you have nothing better to do for two hours than be entertained by explosions and cheap thrills, then this film is for you.  However, if you are in search of an intelligent film, or anything even remotely intelligent, look elsewhere.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I am really glad that Robert Wise and company decided to go back and put in the new special effects and new scenes that were left out in the rushed 1979 release of &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. This is among one of the absolute best &quot;Star Trek&quot; films ever made because you get to see what happens to Kirk, Spock, and crew after their famous 5-year mission in the original series. And plus, you get to see a new side of the U.S.S. Enterprise when they transformed it from a smaller ship (original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series) to an even bigger ship! And also, you get to see a couple of new faces, including Stephen Collins as Commander Will Decker and the late Persis Khambatta as Lieutenant Ilia. Some of my favorite improvements of &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; are as follows:<br />A.) The overture and main title sequences<BR>B.) The color of the sky on the planet Vulcan, Spock's home<BR>C.) Starfleet Headquarters in the future San Francisco<BR>D.) The Enterprise's warp speed sequences<BR>E.) Shots of the Enterprise's warp nacelles inside the officer's lounge<BR>F.) The improved Red Alert sounds<BR>G.) A full shot of V'Ger heading toward Earth<BR>H.) Shots of Kirk, Spock, Dr. McCoy, Decker, and Ilia outside of the Enterprise as they were heading toward V'Ger's source<br />This &quot;Star Trek&quot; film has pretty much everything that you'd expect from a &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, such as action, a great storyline, and new and improved special effects! And you also get a little romance thanks to Decker and Ilia. This is truly one of the greatest &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies ever made, alongside the other 8 Trek films. And like &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, there will be no other film like &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;...maybe someday.
B00004XQP4|3.0|I was very disappointed with this cd! I just could not get into it the way I did with Dookie(which I think is their best album!) I think they have matured, not sold out like so many people have said. Bands are supposed to grow and change musically, but they just don't have the same fun energy they used to have and thats what I think made Green Day great! So if you are looking for something more mellow this album is for you, if you want the same Fun energy they used to have, then you will be very dissappointed with this album, like I have been.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|When I first listened to this soundtrack, I was somewhat disappointed in it. However, after seeing the movie, I really enjoy it. I have listened to it while reading the next two books, and it fits the story very nicely. I especially like it now that I can play out scenes in my head from the movie and also experience the scenes from The Two Towers and The Return of the King with this soundtrack in the background. I love it, and I love the legend. Frodo lives!! :)
B00005NNU4|4.0|It's been a long time. Over six years ago, Terence released TTD's Vibrator to major critical kudos, but oddly declining sales. In April we were privy to a few of the new tracks included here, delivered free by the man himself over the internet for all to hear. Firstly, it has to be said that this album is fundamentally flawed. Almost predictably, it is even further out there than the more spacious tracks on the last album, especially lyrically. Since Vibrator, Terence has changed his identity to become Sananda Matreiya, and with his name, the in-fashion sheen to his previous hit-laden albums has also vanished. The albums strong tracks, of which there are many, include the perfect 60's pop of 'O Divina' and the expertly crafted singles in waiting 'The Inner Scream', 'Suga Free' and 'Ev'rythang'. Yet even these sound inherently out-of-touch with the modern day, which will have the inverse effect required in recruiting a new, younger fanbase. What makes this record so disappointing is the material not included. The exquisite 'Paradise Postponed' and 'Girl' were pulled at the last minute, in favour of the vacuous 'Benediction', '...And They Will Never Know' and 'Reflecting'. This misguided substitution renders the last half of the album somewhat underpar and unexceptional. Nevertheless, as one has come to expect from Terence (Sananda to his friends), there is enough here of value to make purchasing a necessity for fans. After all, if it hadn't been six years, this offering would have been far more than adequate.
B000059GEH|5.0|...it was the FIRST film 20th Century Fox made in Cinemascope.<br />Then they made \\"The Robe\\" and released that first...using the<br />splashy \\"How to Marry a Millionaire\\" as a sales tool for the<br />new wide screen process.  That is the real reason for the<br />symphony orchestra (conducted by Alfred Neuman)...and the<br />panoramic views of New York. But, even though it will not pass<br />muster with feminists, it is a slick and saucy entertainment.<br />Sadly it is Betty Grable's last film before she and Fox parted,<br />but she turns in a great performance.  Everyone connected with<br />this film is really good...and it is still a pleasure to watch.<br />I hope that the dvd is a big success, then maybe Fox will let<br />us have some of Betty Grable's classic films on dvd. (...)<br />So enjoy \\"How to Marry a Millionaire\\" and hope that Fox will<br />bring us more of Betty on dvd in the near future.
B00005QK3W|1.0|As any Beatle fan, I bought the last paul's album, expecting much of it. paul's recent live performances (Paul is live)were pretty good&lt;.<BR>This Heather album is just no good at all. Not a song capturing your attention and not any melody you can whistle after the second listening. Paul is sad because he lost Linda, he is happy because he found Heather. So what ? Where is the artist's creation ? Even the lyrics are poor, though usually they can be amazing.<BR>I do not recommend this album.<BR>JCK
B00005NOOH|5.0|It is inexcusable for Warner NOT to include subtitle for this otherwise excellent edition. There are too many names of places and historical figures mentioned in each part of the program. It is incomprehensible for someone to look up or do further research when these names are not spelled out on the subtitle.<br />I was so excited to hear the news that the whole &quot;World at War&quot; set is coming to DVD. I couldn't wait to order my very own set. However, once I read the detail and found out that the box set doesn't come with subtitle, I decided against to order it. I always thought Warner was the best company when they come to including subtitles for all their DVD releases. All their movies come with at least three subtitles (English, French and Spanish). For this box set, English subtitle is a minimum must to make it complete.<br />Sorry, Warner, I am not going to buy this wonderful set. What a shame, Warner, dropped the ball, big time.<br />Bottom line, 5-star for the program &amp; 2-star for the missing English subtitle. (Once Warner goes back and release a new set with at least English subtitle, I will buy one at that time.)
0394800184|1.0|This story is really not appropriate for young children. The premise is very frightening. A little bird spends the entire book searching for his mother and comes face to face with a pretty scary \\"snort\\". He does end up reunited with his mom in the end, but the main storyline plants the seeds for plenty of nightmares and anxiety. There are many better children's books out there.
B000002UB6|5.0|The final album by the Fab Four, originally a mess of recordings abandoned before Paul asked George Martin to make Abbey Road for them, and salvaged by Phil Spector,  As Malcolm McDowell said in his narration of The Compleat Beatles documentary, this album was what it was meant to be--the Beatles' swansong.<br />Simplistic without any of the studio tricks of Sgt Peppers, Let It Be is a more mellower album, as if the Beatles have gone back to their rock roots.  &quot;Two Of Us&quot; features Paul and John on lead together.  At least they were still barely able to work together.<br />The whistling at the end is the same as the &quot;hello helloa&quot; at the end of &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;<br />Plain old rock-and-roll tunes include &quot;I Dig A Pony&quot;, &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, which seems to be just George and Ringo plus Phil Spector's sounds (love that electric guitar!), and one of the Beatles' earliest songs from the Quarrymen days, &quot;One After 909&quot;.<br />Paul's contributions here rank as among the best--the three here being the title track, &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot;, and &quot;I Got A Feeling.&quot;<br />The opening piano, George's guitar solo, Phil Spector's added electric organ and brass, and the way Ringo's drumming is mixed with echo makes &quot;Let It Be&quot; a perennial favorite.<br />&quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; is one of those tearjerkers with that symphonic Phil Spector wall of sound.  Comparing this with the version on Paul McCartney's Give My Regards To Broadstreet soundtrack, I don't know--I like both, although this would have been a better album closer than &quot;Get Back&quot;.<br />&quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot;, shows that Paul's rock vocal is still blistering with power.  John's &quot;everybody had a hard year&quot;, which seems to refer to the whole group, seems to have been added later, and I wouldn't have been surprised if Paul did his bit first and John came along with his vocals and Spector melded them together.<br />George Harrison's &quot;For You Blue&quot; is a nice blues tune, with him complimenting John Lennon's guitar playing over Elmore James.<br />At the end of &quot;Get Back&quot;, which is the live, sung on the Apple rooftop version, John can be heard saying, &quot;I'd like to say 'thank you' on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hoped we passed the audition.&quot;  Poignant and true.  Well, you guys passed with flying colours.<br />In the end, the Beatles more or less realized that their time had come and it was time to &quot;let it be.&quot; so they could &quot;shine on till tomorrow.&quot;.<br />George Harrison's &quot;For You Blue&quot; is a nice blues tune, with him complimenting John Lennon's guitar playing over Elmore James.<br />At the end of &quot;Get Back&quot;, which is the live, sung on the Apple rooftop version, John can be heard saying, &quot;I'd like to say 'thank you' on behalf of the group and ourselves and I hoped we passed the audition.&quot;  Poignant and true.

B00005OM4N|5.0|This album is much better than Britney's previous two. It really shows growth, and the songs that she wrote happen to be more of my favorites! I really love every single track on this album. Too bad the songs she recorded with BT didn't make the cut because of some legality issues. The songs she wrote and produced with BT are amazing. They mix House and Techn-clug beats. They are called &quot;Before The Goodbye&quot; and &quot;I Run Away&quot;. I suggest them to anybody, even if you aren't a fan of her music, you might like these two. Buy the album, it's awesome!
B000002LHX|5.0|OK, Commissioner Gordon--here's my report on Prince's 11th album, a.k.a. the Batman Soundtrack.<br />Thers is something well, quirky about this CD.  Don't get me wrong, this ranks among one of Prince's best efforts.  It's just that it sounds like he cranked this one out in three/four weeks compared to the material he spends more time on.  The Batman soundtrack is still worthy.<br />In each song, he lists the lead vocal as one of the main characters from the movie:  Batman, the Joker, Vicki Vale, and Bruce Wayne.  There's also a character called Gemini, half of him representing good, the other half representing evil, who makes his only appearance in (...) \\"Batdance\\", but it's a significant appearance.<br />Holy Frozen Smile!  The best lead vocalist here is the Joker.  \\"Electric Chair\\", \\"Partyman\\", and \\"Trust\\".  The thumping bass and rough guitar on \\"Electric Chair\\" is comparable to the Joker's dark side.  The latter two are just fun, reflecting the villain's playful side.  I mean face it, who was the more interesting character in the movie?  When the villain steals the show from the hero, there's gotta be something wrong, right?  Or is it just Jack Nicholson's superiority as an actor compared to Michael Keaton?<br />\\"The Arms Of Orion\\" is his second vocal collaboration with Sheena Easton and both parties got the best with this wonderful ballad.<br />\\"Lemon Crush\\" has a little bit of the funk reminiscent of The Time.  \\"Scandalous\\" is another lovely ballad done in his falsetto voice.  It has the dishonor of being played over the closing credits of the movie, at which time the stop button is pressed on the VCR or DVD.<br />The raucous guitar and techno beat of \\"Batdance\\" is a summary of the movie, both in movie soundbites and to some extent of some of the earlier songs, such as \\"The Future\\" and \\"Electric Chair\\".  The song explodes with chaos and violence at the end until Prince himself says \\"Stop\\", ending the song abruptly.  Genius of the man!<br />Well, back to the Bat... er Review Cave.  End of Report.
630460291X|4.0|I mean... huh? Who comes up with the idea of splitting the movie on a DVD. I mean it's not a Laser Disc, where you couldn't get more than 60 minutes per side. I love this movie ever since I first saw it, but I think this lousy edition won't really let me enjoy it whenever I want it. Yeah, it's got trailers and it is a widescreen version but the movie's running time is less than 150 minutes... so I don't get the reason to divide it, if you get Magnolia, The Green Mile, The Abyss, ID4, Armageddon, Aliens, Heat or Braveheart in a single sided disc, all of them over 160 minutes long.<br />Whatever happened to animated menus, director's commentary, bloopers, outtakes, deleted scenes, music video, screen tests, some kind of documentary about the legendary prince of thieves and stuff like that? I think there's a new edition coming on mid-2002. I hope so. (...)
B00005B36H|5.0|It makes me almost come to tears.  To hear such passion, thought, effort, etc.  Why must we compare things to their predecessors?  This is the logical progression.  Come along and study this album.  Quit worrying about what Maynard is wearing and go inside yourself.  Gain experience, re-evaluate, etc.  The album is superb.  Own it.
B000002UJQ|4.0|At a first listen, OK Computer is a complete bore and headache enducing experience. I didn't quite get the whole concept of the album until my 5th listen to it. Before I widened my musical horizons I listened to mostly Hip-hop and R&amp;B. This is one of the albums that allowed me to advance even more into music and label the certain styles of rock music I like. I first experience Radiohead while watching MTV2 earlier this year when the brilliant Pyramid Song came on. This song hit something inside of me for some reason and I began to cry. I don't know, maybe it was the bleakness of Thom York's voice or the mellow and fantasy dream like groove of the song. The other single I heard was Knives Out which I thought was pretty good as well.Based off these two singles I figured Radiohead were some kind of jazz/mellow rock band (very different from the cheesy hip-hop inspired metal and the soulless,tasteless, monotonous whiny screaming hardcore metal the white kids around my surroundings are hooked on these days). Since OK Computer was herald as the band's greatest work I quitly ran out and bought it. I tried listening to this album in a vast majority of ways in order to catch on to it. 1st I tried listening to it straight through but all the songs gave me headache except for 'paranoid adroid' so I put it way for the day, the next day I tried to listening to it again but I fell asleep on it after 'paranoid android'. I then decided that the OK Computer was overrated and a waste of 14 bucks. I then tried it half sleep, almost sleep, and on the edge sleep. I don't know maybe sleepiness helped me to help accept this album. The songs on this piece are truly well done. I had no idea this was supposed to a concept album until someone told me and when I actually listen to it straight through, I could finally understand what the songs were about and I began to like it a lot. My favorite songs are Exit Music to A Film, Climbing Up the Wall, Lucky, and The Tourist.<BR>Not the best album in the world like some of these kids claim but very good nonetheless.<BR>Highly Recommended.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Dr. Seuss was trying to protest the commercialization of the holiday season with &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas,&quot; but nobody got the joke; after working retail during Christmas 1999, I can certainly understand Ted Geisel's original sentiment.  This film manages to convey that message by expanding on the original story: Whoville's population is obsessed with partying and presents to the point where sentiment is ignored or mocked--unfortunately with Delta House-at-the-homecoming-parade-style results when a young Grinch becomes the recipient of their barbs.  But the subtle cruelty theme is offset with Jim Carrey's usual insane buffoonery, like mocking his own echo, being proud of his heart shrinking, and playing movie director when prepping his dog Max for looting all of Whoville's presents.
630170648X|5.0|If there is any film in the history of cinema that is utterly without flaw, it is this one. The camera work is perfect, Lombard and Benny are perfect, the script is perfect. There is not one step even slightly out of rhythm, not one note off by even a 32nd, not by even a 64th.<br />This is the story of a Polish repertory troupe, the members of which become undercover operators for the Polish Resistance when Hitler's Germany invades.<br />This film was made in 1942, so it took great risks that are difficult to appreciate now-- when the film premiered, no one knew how the war would turn out, who would win. And the premise, which seems such a bleak subject, is given a comic treatment. Audiences in 1942 failed to see what was so funny and the critics panned it. Fortunately later audiences have rediscovered it.<br />Black comedy was not a recognized genre at the time, and film historians credit To Be or Not to Be with creating the genre. This film spawned M*A*S*H, Dr. Strangelove, Heathers and so many other films.<br />But you don't need to watch it for its historical importance. Watch it because you will enjoy it. You will.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's &quot;Room for Squares&quot; has plenty of pop hooks (check the chorus of track 2 &quot;Why Georgia&quot;), but his lyrical insight is what makes this album keep giving after many weeks in my CD player.  He also has a nack for drawing out the words of his songs to play off the melodies and rhythm.  The range of sounds is varied and, though he comes off ocassionally on the &quot;lite&quot; side of the musical spectrum, his down beat moments and soft pop are soulful. In fact, I think there is a mellow old soul in this young and talented musician.
0553274503|5.0|Flowers for Algernon is an awesome book! The way Daniel Keyes wrote like Charly would write before turning into a genius was interesting. Changing from retarded to a genius in a matter of two weeks is amazing. I like the way Mr. Keyes went in depth in describing the way Charly felt about his teacher, Ms. Kinnian. (...) It was extremely compelling.<BR>I loved this book, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|This is truly a fun video, for the features others have mentioned. I am just the wrong kind of Metallica fan. I would prefer more pre-Black(brown?) album stuff. Why is it so hard for them to acknowledge the mastery of ...And Justice for All? I have this and Cunning Stunts and only 2 songs from Justice...aand they're both One! How about Harvester of Sorrow? Shortest Straw? Blackened, for God's sake!<BR>Well, enough ranting. This is a fine DVD, as is Cunning Stunts, with a fair amount of Old School.
B00005Q66T|3.0|This CD would rate 5 starts if it weren't for the odd exclusion of legitimate Top 40 hits such as &quot;This Used To Be My Playground,&quot; &quot;You'll See,&quot; &quot;You Must Love Me,&quot; and &quot;American Pie&quot; in favor of the flopped singles &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; and &quot;Human Nature.&quot;<br />Most puzzling of all is the use of the BALLAD version of &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; rather than her disco version, which was a top ten hit!  That above all else lowers this to a 3 star rating.
B00005U18E|5.0|When I heard about this movie, I had thought it was going to be another formula Hollywood comedy with a lot of double entendre's and sight gags, but instead I was truly delighted.<br />Bridget Jones' diary, is about your typical urban single girl getting beyond the point when her relatives think she should be married.  She has suffered through the ghastly fix ups and the constant inquiries into her love life to the point an affair with the office snake seems appealing.<br />This show is different with its British based sense of humor, so it is fresh in that respect.  Renee Zellwenger, put on some weight to more truthfully represent the average woman.  She also has the average woman's friends; all quite odd and suffering together.  Renee does a marvelous job at sticking her foot in her mouth as Bridget and often, no always says the wrong thing.  In other words, a portrayal of a real human being.  Her lipsynch with the song: &quot;All by myself&quot; alone in her room is one we can all sympathize with.<br />The story focuses on a time in her life where everything kicks in: Potential relationships, family problems and job dilemmas.  All the typical stuff the rest of us deal with, and as usual, all go down the drain at the same time.<br />Viewers of the old &quot;Life and Times of Molly Dodd&quot; TV series will particularly like this movie.  It reminded me very much of that.<br />A great movie, once again, Ms. Zellwenger, shows her wonderful comic talent.
0156711427|3.0|I had to read this book as a recommendation by my tenth grade English teacher for an Independent Study project. I was excited about reading it; everyone says it's good and I think India is interesting. However, having read the book thoroughly, even the confusing first half, I am not sure what the focus was supposed to be. Other reviewers said it was a look at the culture of India, my English teacher said it was a portrayal of different kinds of people, some people say it's the mystery of the trial concerned with racism and prejudice... I am not sure what I am supposed to be left feeling at the end of the book.<br />This was not a &quot;bad&quot; book - I am glad I read it and I would recommend it to others. It doesn't have an exciting plot or particularly likeable characters, but Forster has good insight into society and what makes people make and break friendships. I was left feeling confused on almost every level from this book, but in some ways it was an eye-opener. It should not be read to learn about India, since Forster seems to mention customs and interesting places offhandly and as a matter of course; it should neither be read as an investigation into what makes people tick. If you want to save yourself confusion, don't read it at all. <br />However, I liked the book because it was puzzling. I had to really think to figure out why there were such problems between Aziz and his English friend Fielding. I finished this book last night, and it has helped me understand something, though I can't yet put my finger on what.
B00005RIKD|2.0|After a couple of listens, this strikes me as awfully lightweight. I can understand Sting was probably subdued given that the show was recorded on 9/11 but there's just not much here that demands future plays. The recording itself is excellent, and the song selection acceptable.  However, in retrospect, Sting should have rescheduled this recording date for a time when the 9/11 tragedy was not so fresh, and likely to effect his performance.  It's certainly interesting to contrast this with his earlier live album recorded after Dream of the Blue Turtles, which was far more upbeat. However, this performance just lacks the passion of his earlier works.  I've been a Sting fan since early in his Police days and have seen him live 4 or 5 times, but this performance disappoints.  This CD just seems to be another step in Sting's progression from an innovative &quot;new wave&quot; rocker to being a strictly adult-contempory artist.
0385491026|3.0|This was a wonderful read about the growing pains that most young women go through and the way that we learn to become functioning adults.  I remember girls from my childhood that acted very much like Cordelia and Elaine.   I think this would be a great book for girls in high school to read to give insight into their own world.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|This is his best work since Sign of the Times. I see in the reviews that a lot of people don't like the narrator or lyrics, but it's about the music, which is simply brilliant! This is classic Prince, who finally is trying not to be hip-hop or rap, but his true self. I am a die hard prince fan and I have all his material, and it's good to finally praise an album rather than bash them like I've done for the past 4 albums. Contrary to belief, true Prince fans are his worst critics, but that's because we know the brilliance he is capable of, and he captured it in this album!!
B000059QY2|5.0|I love this film and have watched it at least a dozen times.  I'm delighted to see that it is finally out on DVD (the VHS version has been out of print for several years).  Everything is topnotch, and I have never seen Pavarotti looking more comfortable in performance.  He brings a comic/sinister twist to the part of the Duke, which suits it perfectly.  If you have friends who think they don't like opera, do them a favor and give them this DVD for Christmas.  (Incidentally, this film is based on an actual production which is still occasionally seen on the stages of Europe; I caught it in Dusseldorf around 1996.)
B000003TSP|5.0|Within its genre, Dummy was a great album. But this, much darker and more complex, record packs a far greater punch and simply transcends its predecessor. In years to come, this will be the one you are reaching for...
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Does anyone need to be convinced that Walt Disney's Snow White is a masterpiece animation that has a place in every home library?  I doubt it.  The real question is which version to purchase.  <br />This DVD version is certainly a top contender.  Whereas many \\"special\\" editions contain the feature, the trailers, and an interview or two, this one - actually there are two DVD's - is packed full of  production information, historical information, children's activities, features that help explain how an animated film is created, and a short clip featuring Adriana Caselotti, the lady who gave the speaking and singing voice to Snow White. The commentary on the special features is informative (often educational), but short enough to fit young attention spans.<br />Among my favorite features are Barbra Streisand singing \\"Some day my Prince will come\\" as a series of frames from the movie pass across the screen; the abandoned concepts section that includes sketches of scenes that were considered, but never developed for the movie; audio containing the rehearsal and taping of a song that was cut from the film; and an English translation of the Grimm's Fairy Tale that a parent can read aloud to a child or an adult can use to compare with the final Disney version.<br />My absolute favorite feature is the \\"Princess Fashion Boutique\\" a computerized paper-doll with a closet full of possible outfits.  OK, I admit it, I'm not a little girl, but I can imagine if I were, this would really be fun.<br />At first, navigation may seem a little confusing, but after a few wrong turns, it becomes easy.
B00005R87Q|1.0|I really tried to take this movie at face value (i.e. &quot;it's a street rod racing film with low-grade actors..don't expect much&quot;) but even with that mind-set, this was awful.<br />Ok, Vin Diesel, cool guy, but his character in this is so cliche it almost hurts to watch him try to breathe any life into it. <br />And that plot ? Hello..did we all miss Point Break so badly, and need to see street racing so much that we had to remake that film ? Point Break was a fun film, but The Fast and The Furious was an awful take on the same concept.<br />And the cars ? They weren't even that good/cool. The racing sequences were a joke. They were mostly shot on a bluescreen, as can be attested to by how so many shots are done inside the car, and the streets are always a &quot;Star Trek Warp Speed&quot; blur. <br />I thought &quot;maybe I'm just not enough of a racing fan to enjoy this&quot;, but even my friend, who lives and dies by any kind of speed freak racing was unimpressed with this movie.<br />And hey..there was only one semi-attractive woman in the whole thing !
0767803434|3.0|This movie has an interesting, action-filled plot as well as a good, but it fizzles, perhaps because the screen time lavished on the action scenes robs screen time that could have been spent on character development.  <br />Even so, in the small screen time they get, Glenn Close is convincing as the tight-jawed Vice President and Wendy Crewson scores points as a dignified First Lady, compassionate mother and loving wife.  Harrison Ford, appealingly macho as ever, occasionally distances himself from his character with a lapse into tongue-in-cheek line-readings or facial expression.  Otherwise, he is properly presidential.  As the first daughter, Liesel Matthews displays a range of emotion that many of the more seasoned supporting actors lack.  <br />One viewing will probably be enough for most people.
B00005NW02|5.0|These guys are from another planet.....crazy and brilliant at the same time....Serj proves he can sing, scream, whisper, and croon with the best of them....Daron comes off as a musical savant type who's guitar lines are sometimes weird but make sense after a few listenings...a lot of people i know blow these guy off because they're too weird sounding and their music is just chaos..well, it's structure and brilliance from chaos on this album.

B000002X2B|5.0|I own the original vinyl and saw them preform it in L.A.,side two is a obscure classic little known outside Airplane fans,and actually includes several songs presented as a suite. they include Sunrise,Hijack, Home, Have you seen the stars tonight, XM and Starship. the depth of the ideas proposed in this are as revolutionary as  the music. Mostly a Paul Kantner effort, along with Grace's soaring backup and excellent piano are standouts as well as Garcia's excellent guitar. The music on this was such a tight symbiosis of talent and the story line make this my all time favorite.
0671634062|1.0|I was very disappointed with this audio cassette. The one-hour cassette has limited information and is not worth the money. I have a library of audio tapes filled with great information. This is not one of them. I found the narrator voice very annoying to listen to. The tape reminded me of a college professor lecture. I will never buy another tape without checking your reader reviews. I want my money back!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I rented this the other night, and I was -impressed- by the new FX.  Folks have already stated some of the new additions, etc.  But there are also 'small' differences.<br />1)  The torpedo effects (Klingon, Enterprise, and V'ger) have been cleaned up.  The Klingon torpedo is brighter then the original, using the current CGI technology.  It actually looks like a Star Trek torpedo.  Same with the Enterprise's.  Doing a step-by-step with your DVD-remote when this is fired will show you how it's been re-done.  V'Ger's torpedoes are smoother, and they added a lens-flare effect.<br />2)  On the subject of V'Ger's torpedoes, I know I'm not in the same boat when it comes to dissapointment on it's attack on the Enterprise.  The first torpedo is fine, but the 2nd one speeds towards the viewscreen, sorta jitters and wobbles, and then just &quot;vanishes&quot; while the sound of it's approach remains.  That was redone.  Right after Spock starts transmission, the scene changes to an outside angle of the 1701 with the torpedo coming close, and then vanishing.  I was so glad they redid that.<br />3)  The wormhole itself wasn't redone, but the explosion of the asteroid was.  Instead of just an explosion, the camera shifts to a view of the Enterprise from the AFT, and it's then you see an explosion and the wormhole itself fading out into nothingness.<br />4)  The new shot of V'Ger's cloud dematerializing and the ship emerging was just awesome beyond belief.  Along with the re-done shots of V'Ger's greenish-color &quot;planet-killer&quot; probes.  In the original, the cloud is still there and the probes are fired from the top.  In this version, you see a starfield and the probes are fired from below.<br />5) In the original, when V'Ger vanishes, the Enterprise just emerges from a supernova-like blast.  Whoopee.  Well now, you see the small V'Ger vessel brighten, expand, then contract and explode out to make that effect, and that was also something to be seen.<br />6)  The stairs from the Enterprise to the Voyager 6 probe.  ..It was the director's original idea, and it was done for this.  You have to see it to believe it.<br />7)  And finally, on Disk 2, someone on here wrote about the deleted scene with Kirk's exit of the airlock, and when the camera shifted out a distance you could see the set.  ..Well, seeing it is an understatement, the set DOMINATED this shot.  Scaffolding, lights, etc.  It made the final cut into the original, too.  Talk about the editor sleeping on the job.  Once you see this, look to the extreme right, and you'll see..  what's that?  Why yes.  It's a moving ARM!  Yes, a worker on the set was on a platform watching the scene being shot, and it appears he raised his arm to either get it out of the shot or to pick his nose.  They should've had a credit for him as &quot;Unrecognizeable arm&quot;.  A friend of mine made a joke about the shot, for when Kirk came out he says:  &quot;I've spotted him!&quot;  And my friend commented:  &quot;He's over by the food table!&quot;<br />You'll love this DVD.  Trust me.  :)the Enterprise to the Voyager 6 probe.  ..It was the director's original idea, and it was done for this.

B00005NB0H|5.0|The Who's Live At Leeds shows why the band is among a handful of the most powerful live bands in the history of rock. The original album only contained six songs, but it was a forceful assertion of the band's power. The remastered cd reissue contains the entire show and it gives the listen the complete picture of what a Who show sounded like in 1969. Songs like &quot;I Can't Explain&quot;, &quot;Tattoo&quot;, &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;, &quot;I'm A Boy&quot;, &quot;Substitute&quot; and &quot;Happy Jack&quot; have a fire and passion that explodes out of your speakers. The closing one-two punch of &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Magic Bus&quot; is full, kick out the jams rock and the band shows that they could and would rock harder than anyone else on the scene.  Disk two is the complete performance of the rock opera Tommy which was brand new at the time.  Even though it is broken out from the flow of the actual concert, it is interesting to hear these war horses when they fresh and new.
B000009ROK|5.0|I've been a fan of Latin(boleros) and French(Piaf, Aznavour, etc.) music since the 60's. Never have I experienced such pleasure in listening as with Luis Miguel. This man inteprets lyrics in such a way as to make them his very own. His blending of smoothness with emotional content is extraordinary. When he sings, I believe every word and feel the impact in the deepest parts of my soul. Whether it be the pain or hope of love, his presentation is so intimate and personal that one feels as if he's telling his own stories. A truly great singer-Viva El Rey!
B000021Y77|4.0|lets get this straight this is a great movie<BR>I first went to see this film at a special screening at our universities cinema and i did have some doubts about it before hand.<BR>But it was the definate highlight of the night.<BR>I won't say anything about the plot as 1. a lot has already been said by other reviewers.<BR>2. I think its best to watch this film without any preconceptions about what is going to happen.<br />The DVD itself is a good package and the extras are quite good particulaly the music video!! (especialy compared to the british edition of the film)<br />However one word of warning<br />Please Please do not watch this film in the dubbed american.<BR>For goodness sake leave it in its original german format and read the subtitles. unless you want to be overcome with either laughter or extreme rage at how the dubbing has spoiled the original dialogue/monologues<br />reading the subtitles really does not detract from the films brilliance<BR>and in fact i belive that it enhances the experiance<br />finally it can only be said BUY this film!!! IT IS GOOD
0553712837|4.0|This book is light reading, very enjoyable and good for some laughs.  It highlights the competition of neighbors trying to &quot;out do&quot; each other in their holiday festivities, how every organization comes alive for their annual collection and, in all, how commercial the season of Christmas has become.  The end has a twist and in it, reveals the true meaning of Christmas present under all the decorations, festivities and commercialism.  I would recommend this book - I enjoyed it.
B000056NX5|5.0|I am a huge Jesus Christ Superstar fan. I absolutely love it. I instantly fell in love with the original cast concept recording (Ian Gillan, Murray Head) and loved every minute of it. I had seen the original 70's movie and was a little disapointed. The sound quality was terrible and Ted Neeley (Jesus) had an annoying voice that he hardly ever took risks with. So when a firend told me that another one was out, naturally I was jazzed to see it. When I first saw it, I thought it was good but not great. I mean, I thought others could have pulled off the same thing better. But then I started watching it again and again and I realized how brilliant it was. It was absolutely marvelous. I mean, every single character is wonderfully placed! At first I thought that Judas had a bad voice and Zubin Varla (played Judas in 1996) would have done better. But as I listened, Varla always seemed mad in the recording. Jerome Pradon pulls off the character of Judas brilliantly. I think his acting pays off greatly as apposed to his singing. I aslo thought Glenn Carter was weak. But as I watched again and again, he is absolutely marvelous in that he captures what I think Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice wanted out of Jesus. Through Judas' eyes, Jesus was exactly what he was in this film. (for those of you who don't know it, JCS was written about the last days through JUDAS' eyes). Tony Vincent also pulls off the best portrayal of Simon I have seen along with his spectacular voice. I have introduced this film to many people all of which loved it. Anyway, I simply think it's a masterpiece.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I don't get why there are people here that doesn't like this movie. And aslo Shrek is two film that are must own and I own them both. And Jim Carrey is the Grinch, (which for all the film that we don't see his face, but how do we believe that is Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup). And this has Jeffer Tambor (from Muppets From Space).<br />And it brings a new actress to the movies. And as the movie opens, we learn that all the who's down in whoville love Christmas. But the Grinch who lives norh of Whoville on a mountaintop doesnot not like Christmas. And makes fun of all the who's including a child named Cindy Lou Who (newcomer Taylor Momsen).<br />And his only true friend is a dog named Max (Kelly).

067144901X|5.0|I am reading this book to my 3 month old who is already responding to the bright pages and silly sounds. This is my 3rd child and my older ones are 10yrs and 8yrs-they still love the book. It was one of the first they actually learned to read. Our next favorite is &quot;But Not the Hippopotamus!&quot; I buy this for all my friends with new babies.

B00004WEJZ|4.0|This DVD release is unusual in that it has no &quot;extras&quot; other than a Theatrical Trailer, but that's OK, because Sean Connery is back as Bond. Though not an &quot;Official&quot; Bond movie, and doesn't have the familar James Bond &quot;Music&quot;, this movie is just fun entertainment. Connery looks better than Roger Moore did at this stage, and can still deliver the lines...<br />Fatima Blush: &quot;How clumsy of me, I've made you all wet.&quot;<br />Bond: &quot;Yes, but my Martini is still dry...&quot;<br />The print is good, and the sound quality is good for it's age. Hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|First off I would just like to say that I ABSOLUTLY LOATHE MUSICALS! Nothing against the whole plot line or theme of Moulin Rouge it's just that I liked it the first time when it was called TITANIC! Jesus people in Hollywood PLEASE get a new idea for a movie because I think I've seen the same one 20 times now! Nicole Kidman was good in the movie but sweet Jesus THE SINGING! Oh it burned like a 1000 suns to hear singing over and over and over again. Seriously I didn't think it was a musical when I went to go see it but when the third song came on in the first 20 minutes I almost walked out.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I've had this only for a few days, and am still exploring it. It is truly an amazing piece that Disney has put out. The clarity, color and sound of the restored movie is outstanding. The extras on these discs though, is the main reason I bought the DVD. This is what DVD's are all about. Disney Pioneered the animation field with this movie, and are trying to do the same with this DVD. There are literally over 25 hours of entertainment on this set, and many, many interesting behind the scenes segments, and &quot;How'd they do that?&quot; features on the making of the movie, and the history of the Snow White story. This is a limited edition, so I would say grab it up while you can. I am eagerly looking forward to the Disney DVD release of the Mickey Mouse cartoons. I will be buying that, and along with this Snow White DVD, these are my first purchases made with my future children in mind. (I have none now, and none on the way, but these timeless family items will keep  for many years, and Disney also offers a replacement plan for DVD's that get damaged.)
B000056K04|1.0|Ok.. where do I start.. This could quite possibly be the worst production I have ever seen.  The band has turned into a teeny boppin concert, and their music shows it.  If you know dave, you know that his past cd's have been good, sometimes amazing, however this cd is the epitomy of horrible.  I honestly believe this could mark the end of Dave, and maybe a new beginning with N'SYNC.
0671024256|5.0|Most of my writing takes place within the context of conservative Catholic commentary or canon law.  Therefore, when I picked up Stephen King's memoirs on the craft, it was mainly due to boredom in the airport as I waited for my flight.  By the time I reached my destination, I had finished it.  This work proves King truly crosses genres when he puts his mind, as well as his pen, to it.  I enjoyed this work tremendously, and found it helpful in my own writing.  There is good advice for all writers here, whether one is breaking out in the craft or a veteran, whether one writes fiction or non-fiction.<br />In the past, I have occasionally dabbled in fiction, but never with much success. Yet following King's advice, my fiction has greatly improved.  For example: at the instigation of my English professors, I tended to over-plot my work.  King advises against plotting, stating a story reads much better when it unfolds as the writer sits at the keyboard.  If the author does not know how the story will end, King speculates, neither is the reader likely to do so either.  This creates suspense.  I tried putting this into practice with my own writing, and found it much more exciting as a result.<br />King offers many other points for improving one's writing, most of which I found both practical and successful.  Therefore, I recommend this book to anyone interested in the craft of writing.
B00005K3O4|3.0|The Chiodo (kee-O-doh) brothers' Killer Klowns from Outer Space is one of my guilty pleasures. It's not a great movie...it may not even be a very good movie...but it's still the ultimate clowns-as-monsters movie. The Killer Klowns' spaceship is a circus tent. They wrap people in cotton candy cocoons. They track down victims with a balloon bloodhound. You get the idea.<br />MGM recognized the mixed appeal of this flick with a brand new Special Edition DVD containing a commentary track, early films of the Chiodo brothers and a pristine widescreen print (...).

No new mother should be without this touching story!
0767802659|5.0|Yes, the film bears weak resemblance to the novel.  Yes, the time it takes for an asteroid to travel across the galaxy is enough to allow our sun to collapse.  Yes, asteroids cannot be simply taken care of with a couple missiles (because it creates many smaller asteroids that will probably not disintegrate in our atmosphere).  But God, can't anyone just have fun with a film like this?  I mean, even I, a hardcore sci-fi action buff, hated \\"Red Planet\\" and \\"Battlefield Earth.\\"  Let me tell you, \\"Starship Troopers\\" is infinitely more enjoyable.  It features incredible battle sequences, outstanding special effects, and a somewhat disturbing but enlightening look at a Neo-Nazi Fascist society where violence does solve anything and everything.<BR>     <BR>The shower scene is not meant to exploit anyone.  It's just a good metaphor for the belief that everyone is equal in every way during those times.  Jesus, most everyone who writes a bad review of this film (not movie) merely says that it was stupid.  They never say why, and these are the type of people (...) who don't like anything.  Just kick back, watch several awesome fights, experience the incredible effects, and enjoy the cast, especially the veteran favorite of mine, Michael Ironside.

B000059PPN|4.0|To read some of the previous reviews, I guess one must know the body of work by Fulci to &quot;get&quot; anything out of this film. Well, I never heard of Fulci. I do, however, like trashy horror flicks and this one did not entirely disappoint.The acting was bad enough to amuse me, special effects were non-existant (tho sound effects were VERY good), the plot was idiotic (as it should be) and the DVD version I got was dirt cheap. I enjoyed it. I was, however, very impressed with the crisp, moody photography (in a WIDE letterbox) and, all in all, I think I made a good investment. One thing that often bothered me about dubbed, Italian films of this period is that they are often boring, relying only on gore. There certainly was plenty of that, but my attention was held quite well considering the idiot plot. I guess the best thing about this film is that it makes me want to see more by this Fulci guy.
0440539811|3.0|No this isn't as intriguing as Umberto Eco or as insightful as Pynchon.  It isn't as funny as Douglas Adams.  It doesn't preach like Ayn Rand.  It's not good literature.  It won't stretch your mind like Hofstadter's &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot;.  It isn't as well written as any of those.  It's not meant to be.  It's meant to poke you in your gizzard and be sort of &quot;neato&quot; whilst doing so.  What it will do is disturb and irritate you.  Take note of where it disturbs and irritates you, those are your faults and weaknesses.  The funny parts are where it is poking at some other reader and you (oh so wisely) get to see this and laugh from your own superior perspective.  Good, fun airplane book for those who view Grisholm, Clancy, typical NYT best-sellers, etc, as the Doritos of literature, but aren't currently looking for a truly nourishing read.  Doesn't matter much if you lose your place.  Long and clever like the worlds largest limmerick.  A bible for freshmen dystopians, it may seem incredibly profound if you're just getting into social and cultural critiques that wax philosophical.<br />Read Daniel Quinn's &quot;Ishmael&quot; instead.
0694003611|1.0|I cannot believe the number of positive reviews about this book. This is a case of nobody being able to see that the emperor is naked except the little boy.  This book was so obviously poorly written and illustrated.  Most authors of children's' books have a special talent.  I think most anyone could have written this one.  It's even a little creepy.
B00005OWIU|4.0|This CD is very enjoyable, but the theme is played over and over. Most of the songs sound exactly the same, but it is still a satisfactory CD. I'm glad I bought it and I will continue to listen to it.
0385505833|1.0|While the first third of this book is reasonably engaging, the story begins to repeat itself. The book grows redundant. The same point is made again and again. Things are said over and over. Buy the book for more.<br />Boredom is an art; absolute boredom is an achievement. I hereby tip my hat.
0679745653|5.0|I confess I bought this book because Cosmopolitan recommended it, but I was drawn in quickly by the sophisticated, elegant writing style.  I'd never read Capote before and it took a little while to get used to the subtleties and the absence of action, which is a great strength of Breakfast at Tiffany's.  The following short stories are also very well done and I picked up the book every chance I got.
B000056HE9|5.0|I have been watching this movie for the last 30 years and it still makes me laugh out loud and my eyes well up with tears. Forget &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; (although it is a great movie too), nothing compares to Cary Grant, David Niven, and Loretta Young in &quot;The Bishop's Wife&quot;. Once you have seen it you will be hooked. It is one of my favorite movies of all time!
B00003CX9E|5.0|If you only had the chance to watch one single movie in your lifetime, this would be the movie to see. It's the Sistine Chapel of cinematography, and Welles' 20th century genius is a fitting complement to the great artistic masters of the past. But the lesson that Citizen Kane teaches us at the movie's finale hits with greater force than any works painted on canvas or chisled in stone ever could: the affluence and power so many Americans strive for is indeed attainable, but only at a cost that no one can afford.
B00005214X|5.0|Sunrise doesn't last all morning, a cloudburst doesn't last all day. Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning, But it's not always going to be this grey. All things must pass, all things must pass away. Sunset doesn't last all evening, a mind can blow those clouds away. After all this my love is up and must be leaving. It has not always been this grey. All things must pass, all things must pass away. All things must pass, none of life's strings can last. So I must be on my way and face another day. Now the darkness only stays at nighttime, in the morning it will fade away. Daylight is good at arriving at the right time. It's not always going to be this grey. All things must pass, all things must pass away. All things must pass, all things must pass away.  - George Harrison, 1970
630245333X|5.0|I personally am not a big horror moviegoer. Not that my stomach is queasy but just that they don't interest me that much anymore. The Blob on the other hand I,ve been watching many time since I was a kid and unlike many horror movies this one has held up well and is my all time favorite horror move.<br />This movie is about a malignant life form from outer space that feeds on anything that moves, women, children, men, you name it, even animals.<br />I can still recall when I once was afraid of the dark because no other horror movie scared me like this one did when I was younger. Today at 19 this movie still is a frightening masterpiece, far surpassing the 1958 version. The special effects and the scene of where the man was pulled down the drain leaves this movie forever written into the photographic cells of my memory. I will love this movie for many years to come.<br />For those qho have queasy stomachs, stay away from this movie but for those who want some horror, this is an essential movie. I recommend it.<br />Bravo for the greatest horror movie ever.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney gives it her all on the awesome album. She got lots of praise and some critiques on this album. Her first single &quot;I'm a slave 4 u&quot; was just the beginning. The singles include &quot;Not a girl, not yet a woman&quot;, which is brilliantly sung, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, an uptempo dance track that really shows how Britney feels, and &quot;Boys&quot;, a spicy track that will keep you dancing and asking for more. She made her mark with this album selling 1,000,000 albums in 2 weeks! I suggest for you not to listen to the criticism on the album, you must decide. This album is the best album from the year 2001! The &quot;Dream within a dream&quot; tour, which I saw, was amazing! She sings most of her new songs, and some old. She did a wonderful job. So, I hope you buy Britney's album 'Britney' now and enjoy it! Another gold Britney, great job!!!!
B0000062GE|5.0|I can honestly say that this is one of their best albums. It was the first one that I had bought and the one I always played. Stabbing Westward is a very underrated band that has talent that will move you in ways you won't understand. <BR>The lyrics are filled with pain, anger and depression. One minute lyrics are talking about suicide, the next they are talking about love and the pain it comes with. I personally found this album to be amazing. It really changed the way I look at things.  If you don't like dark music then this group isn't for you. But I recommend trying them out. Stabbing Westward has a way of grabbing a audience with powerful lyrics. It pretty poetic if you read the words. The best thing is that you don't have to say a word about feelings, because Stabbing Westward pretty much said it all. I now have all of their albums and do wish to get the Bsides and the rare songs. I also look forward to a hopeful new album.
B00005QFF1|5.0|If I could have 4 wishes...<br />1) I would write stories that would stay with people forever.<BR>2) Zhang Yimou would be the director.<BR>3) Zhang Ziyi or an actress her caliber would star.<BR>4) San Bao would write the soundtracks.<br />I knew I would like this movie when I saw the trailer, especially of the funeral procession in the snow. <br />It had all the right ingredients...<BR>*A young (illiterate) woman in a remote village who lives with her blind mother in a place with no indoor plumbing<BR>*A new teacher who has no idea what's in store for him<BR>*Symbolic gestures and icons of love.  <BR>*An unimaginable series of separations that would test anyone's resolve, especially someone who invested so much of herself in someone else.<br />Zhang Yimou knows exactly what matters and sets his and our focus on these things. He has become a director whose movies I'll watch on virtue of his name alone. <br />This movie was about someone who operated from her heart. On the teacher's first absence, Zhao Di takes it upon herself to make small repairs to the classroom. This scene captures the essence of &quot;The Road Home.&quot; I also really enjoyed how the story brings together a young, illiterate woman and a teacher from the nearby city thanks to random choices. I'm sure during the &quot;happily ever after&quot; part of their lives together, he would have made her his oldest student. <br />I enjoyed how the film portrayed that Zhao Di's determination never left her, even as an older, wiser person. It was almost hard to not chuckle at her single-minded determination to wait on the road in spite of her fever...especially after her mother's reaction. (She also pulled a slightly different version of this &quot;bonehead scheme&quot; scene perfectly in &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot;) I also enjoyed when Zhao Di put herself into her weaving to temporarily forget things.<br />Zhang Ziyi has an almost unnatural talent for making us realize that there's a lot more going on in hercharacter's head and for making her characters authentic. She is one of the most effective communicators on the big screen of any age or era. <br />People from my generation need to see more movies that portray romance this way. Zhao Di and the teacher hardly ever make contact, yet their interactions are more powerful than any I've seen from Hollywood. How we spend our time and with whom is the most important investment we'll ever make. <br />This is the kind of movie that you don't want to wash away with anything else for a while. The soundtrack will ensure that never happens.
B00005Q66T|4.0|There's been a lot of grumbling about the song selection for La M's second greatest hits package. Her output in the 90's gives us  quite a bit to choose from and we all have our favorites. I would have included &quot;You'll See&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Where Life Begins&quot; and &quot;Secret Garden&quot; to name a few of my favorites.  However, forget all the rubbish about reinvention and self-promotion. The key to Madonna's long term success and her continued growth as an artist, is her slavish faithfullnes to her own artistic vision.  Pay attention!  We are going along for the ride with this ever so disciplined, smart and creative arbiter of all things cool and hip.  At this stage of the game, 20 years into her music career, she is still pushing forward, more aggressively tuning into her own sonic leanings.  If we're smart, we will ride the wave with her.
0385334206|5.0|In this book, Kurt Vonnegut creates one of the best anti-heroes, anti-materialist semi-biographical sketches of all time. Kilgore Trout, the man who first appears lost with no direction, actually has more direction than most in that he consciously relfects upon the machine-like states of numerous biologically functioning humans in modern society. He realizes the muck run awash from environmental degradation, money corrupting one's rational sense of decision-making, the tearing apart of relationship factors to hollowly artificial replacement products and excesses.<br />Kilgore Trout, the disaffecting roaming nomad lost in the confusion of bureaucratic machinery. Dwayne Hoover the careless, heartless spendthrift of a millionaire. Wayne Hobler, the out of prison, miseducated, schizofrenically confused trounsed upon carpet mat. All these are stereotypical American representations, but the thing that Vonnegut makes so great is that he reveals these characteristics not by blatantly pointing them out, but by putting us in their place as he has done with his alter-ego Kilgore Trout, and making possible to visualize the lunacy that abounds amoung these out-of-balance &quot;chemical machines.&quot;<br />Truly, a great read to poke fun at the zombie-like characteristics of modern day daily life. Puts a dose of satirical humanity onto the inhumane confusion and languishings of modern society.
B00005QZWI|4.0|It's a dark orchestral music, sometimes reminds me that of Dracula by Coppola. But it has a special thing, that makes the difference between both albums, as you listen to it, you will discover that there is light between the darkness of all the themes, i.e. the hobbits song, those fantastic songs by Enya and the elven voices that you can hear through all the album and more.<BR>You will see the strenght of a few rays of light, a bright hope in the night. The more you hear it, the more you like it.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|Hey, don't buy this one. Click around and buy Sgt. Pepper, or Revolver, or Abbey Road, or Magical Mystery Tour, or Rubber Soul, or The &quot;White Album&quot;. If you want a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album, buy &quot;Past Master Vol.II&quot; This collection is not their best songs, it is merely the songs that went to number one on the charts. This is not the way the Beatles were meant to be heard. Do yourself a favor, and buy any other album. DON'T give this album as a gift, either. If you're a parent looking to get the young ones interested in the Beatles, and at the same time recall the music of your youth, put Revolver on for them. Otherwise, I highly reccomend the Glitter soundtrack as an alternative to The Beatles.
B0000013G9|5.0|This is by far not only the best LP by TLC, but the best album in all of popular music! You may disagree, but I think it's excellent! Every song is really outstanding (except for \\"Let's Do It Again\\", which I avoid listening to during the day). If you don't own this album, buy it! Even if you don't like R&B and Rap, you can start here, then you'll change your mind if you know what's good for you. You may have heard \\"Creep\\", \\"Redlight Special\\", \\"Waterfalls\\", and \\"Diggin' On You\\" which were all hits, especially Waterfalls, which receives heavy airplay. Each girl has a cool unique look and style, Left Eye's my favorite. This is when her voice was really high-pitched, it seemed to mature when FanMail came out, or did just decide to rap in a lower voice? I like her younger sounding voice better, I wish I could make my voice sound like hers, but it's just too unique! T-boz has that deep, sexy and scratchy voice that will get your head bobbing, and Chilli's high soulful voice chokes you up in songs like \\"Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes\\" and \\"Take Our Time.\\" My favorite track is \\"Switch\\", which I'll play over and over again, can't get enough of it. Left Eye also has an excellent rap in this song, listen closely and you'll hear her sample \\"Hotel, Motel, Holiday Inn...\\" from Sugarhill Gang's \\"Rappa's Delight\\". This album is from the mid-90s, back when music was at its best. There's no wonder why this album is 10x platinum. Can someone please tell me what \\"Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes\\" is about? *I just recently received tragic news of the loss of the wonderful Lisa Lopes. The pain is not with her who made an early transition to a better place but the people she is loved by, including myself. I am still in shock and tears*. Luv ya Lisa!
B00004SU5J|5.0|This is one of the best CDs I've ever had the chance to listen.<BR>Listen to &quot;So Flute&quot; and &quot;Pont des Arts&quot; on Amazon, and you'll be hooked immediately.<BR>Diverse enough for jazz fans, and fairly upbeat and dynamic for electronic music fans.<BR>Beware! Never lend you CD! The other person may like it too much, and will never turn it back.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Well if you listen to her new one, Missundaztood and then this, you'll find that this is boring compared to it. She stuck to 100% R&amp;B songs, much in the same flavor as Destiny's child and Monica. It worked well but you'll never see her go back to such formulaic, standard stuff. Pink likes to shock people and blur stereotype lines, and she does so much of that on Missundaztood that it makes this one seem kinda... vanilla. But it's a delicious, tasty vanilla, an alternative to those who find the multi-textured and diverse rainbow sherbert flavor of her new album to be too different.
0446677450|1.0|This book is a complete dissapointment.  No real information on investment/wealth building.  Full of &quot;great&quot; advice such as &quot;Sign up for seminars&quot;, &quot;Stay out of debt&quot;. Duh.  The narrative style is odd, he keeps refering to some presumably fictionalized rich dad. Terrible.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink is an amazing artist! And she's so young, can you imagine what she'll be like in 5 years?! Just listen to &quot;My vietnam&quot; and you'll realize she's got some lyrics underneath her sleeve. Plus she throws in really fun and perky dance songs for the &quot;other&quot; crowd. &quot;Get the party started&quot; is the best one. If you are really sick and tired of Britney spears and Christina and want some GOOD music, I suggest this. It is one of my favorites of 2001.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I virtually stopped listening to Dylan after &quot;Blood on the Tracks,&quot; (OK, I did catch a few of his more compelling tunes after 1975, i.e., Hurricane, Jokerman, even (I hate to admit it) Gotta Serve Somebody).  I didn't really understand all the fuss over &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, but did give it a go.   Then came &quot;Love and Theft.&quot;  At first, I thought it was in the same category as &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; (it is), so I was less than enthusiastic, but found many tunes enjoyable.  Then I went to the latest Dylan concert, and now I cannot stop listening to both &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; or &quot;Love and Theft.&quot;  It wasn't just hearing Dylan live that excited me so (or the fact that he could appeal to folks from 10 to 70!), it was really listening to these albums as poetry (which is why I originally listen to Dylan!) that made me a HUGH fan AGAIN.  There is a wide variety of moods and musical riffs on each album.  Something for everyone -- and every emotion. This re-birth, I'm all for.  Keep at it Bob --you've found it again!
6302794331|4.0|Anyone who knows anything about Jim Henson's Muppets, needs no introduction to &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot;. Your favorite muppet characters retell the story of Charles Dickens' enduring Christmas tale of redemption with Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchitt, Ms. Piggy as Mrs. Cratchitt, Fozzy the Bear as Mr. Fezziwig and the rest of the Muppet Family. Michael Caine as Ebenezer Scrooge, plays delightfully off the touching and humorous Muppet family.  It's funny and joyous and will surely make a treasured addition to any VHS family library.
B000000WA4|5.0|I am not a fan of double albums. Usually when a band attempts to put together a 2 disk set, some of the songs are good, and the rest were only put on to fill up space. But the pumpkins pulled it off nicely. Every song on this album is melodic and beautiful in its own way, with the exception of &quot;tales of a scorched earth&quot;, the overly-distorted vocals on this track were its downfall, without the angry vocals, this song would have the potential of &quot;everlasting gaze&quot;.my favorite songs on the album are &quot;stumbleine&quot;, &quot;an ode to no one&quot;, &quot;here is no why&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;,&quot;XYU&quot;, &quot;galapagos&quot;, &quot;thru the eyes of ruby&quot;, and of course &quot;:bullet with butterfly wings&quot;. the only other doulbe cd that i have respect for is &quot;the wall&quot;, which is in my opinion, a masterpiece. this album is worth the cash. My favorite song on the album is &quot;stumbleine&quot;. if you like disarm or spaceboy then you will enjoy that tune as well.
0679720200|5.0|This is the haunting story of a young man mindlessly going through life.  He seems neither happy nor sad, just pleased to live another day.  The protaganist, Meursault, goes about his everyday life in a kind of haze.  Even when his Mother dies, he simply accepts it.  All the characters around him have a purpose and he drifts along with them until one day he finds himself killing a man.<br />Even as he sits in prison, he lives a life of happenstance, to him all life leads toward death it doesn't matter whether the journey is long or short, it all ends the same so why not make the best of each day.  Simplistic as this seems, the writer, Albert Camus, pulls  you into the mind of such an ordinary man in an extraordinary and absurd situation. <br />This is by far, the best novel I have ever read and it's only 123 pages.
0811826848|5.0|This book was awesome! Their stories and their experiences from THEIR mouths (with one or two naughty stories thrown in).<BR>The pictures! So many that it must have taken me as long to study them all as it did to actually read the book. <BR>This is a must have for anyone who is as big a Beatle-freak as I am.<BR>Not to mention, Amazon's price (incl. shipping) is cheaper than any store I've seen.
B00005QZWI|4.0|The best I can say of Shore's score is that, while listening to it, it becomes easy to envision the sequence in your mind without having seen the upcoming film. The music alone tells a story, and that is rare. All the same, it is a bit hit-and-miss. Certain tracks are everything that they should be and perhaps more (&quot;Lothlorien,&quot; &quot;The Ring Goes South,&quot; &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum,&quot; and the &quot;Council of Elrond,&quot; for example). However, I cannot help but feel an opportunity was missed with &quot;The Shadow of the Past&quot; and &quot;The Prophecy&quot; (which will presumably open the film). These tracks are rather bland and unoriginal. But like the story itself, it gets better and better as it progresses. Shore was even thoughtful enough to hire Enya's beautiful vocal talents for certain pieces (all of which shine brightest in the compilation). Also, kudos to Shore for the hard-edged gothic sound of &quot;Khazad Dum,&quot; complete with Dwarven chants and a heart-wrenching prologue that hints at profound loss (won't spoil it). Whenever possible, Tolkien's languages are used to grand effect -including the aforementioned Dwarvish, two forms of Elvish, and the Black Speech - and provide a haunting but enchanting sound. I am rather surprised, actually, that most of Shore's score is so dark and/or tragic, with only a very few &quot;happy bits&quot; for the Shire sequences. If the soundtrack is any indication, it seems that Jackson may be taking our beloved epic as seriously as he should. The soundtrack alone could frighten your children.
B000002WYT|1.0|I simply cannot believe that this group still exists, let alone ever made it onto the radio.  First of all, none of its members can sing; their voices sound like nails across a chalkboard.  And the songs that they have written are complete nonsense that do not sound good at all.  As a musician and lifetime appreciator of music, I find it insulting that anyone would support a group that sounds as awful as Dave Matthews Band.  This proves that anyone can throw together a bunch of [...] and not put any thought or effort into it, and it will sell.  Come on America, we are not that ignorant!!!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I can't believe that it says 60th anniversary commemorative edition.  How absolutely insulting.  This is action film/sappy love story (...) and nothing more.  It is not a war picture.  If it were true that Michael Bay used the events to tell a love story, they would not have put that stupid line on the cover.<br />I guess it doesn't matter if you get the facts right in a historical story, or have good dialog or character development.  In Hollywood, it only matters that the actors look pretty.
B00005RFAI|5.0|This Cd is awesome, if you don't have it you should go out and buy it now.  It's different from her last album but it is still a very good cd. There is someone who reviewed it and gave it one star that person knows who they are. They are just hatin on Pink because she is so talented and they are not. But on the real the album is very very good and if you don't have it already then go out and get it. I've already bought it 3 times.
B00003CXTF|1.0|Are there any clichs left which this film didn't make use of? In fact, in time it may be considered to be `clicking over' to be so bad it's entertaining. But I won't give it any stars for that.
0671027344|5.0|(...) once i started it i could not put it down and read the only thing in one night.  it is unconventionally beautiful, whatever that means....
B00005KHL5|5.0|It's not too often I run across a movie that depicts the pre-Christian pagan lifestyle, except it's set in modern times. Often when you watch a movie dealing with paganism, witchcraft, or the occult, it's rather sensationalized depicting a rather inaccurate account of the lifestyle, making pagans to look bad or evil. The Wicker Man depicts a community on an imaginary island in Scotland called Summerisle (which was really filmed on the Scottish mainland, when you look at an atlas, you won't be able to find Summerisle anywhere) in which its inhabitants continue to practice the old Celtic pagan religion including the fire and fertility rites. A Christian police officer by the name of Sgt. Neal Howie was called to Summerisle to search for a missing 12 year old girl (Rowan Morrison). None of the inhabitants want to help the guy since they want to lure him to a wicker man for sacrifice because of their failed harvest the previous summer. In other words, this movie portrays neither Christianity nor Paganism in a favorable light, but it's great to see that the makers of the film put much more than a superficial attempt to portray the pagan lifestyle, even if they end up sacrificing a human in the end (real life pagans, luckily, don't sacrifice living beings, be it humans, or livestock). The music is folk, but often in modernized form, some of the songs are &quot;Corn Rigs&quot; (written by Robert Burns), &quot;Willow's Song&quot;, &quot;Fire Season&quot;, and one of my favorite, the Maypole Song. Some of it is great, some really cheesy (I think &quot;Landlord's Daughter is awful, since the people singing it sounded drunk, but it was supposed to since it was set in the inn). I hear how much this movie was butchered, but there isn't much more I can add on that others hadn't said already. If you're looking for a great movie with pagan themes, look no further than the Wicker Man.
0790737345|5.0|This movie is the most interesting movie that I've ever seen. It's funny how there aren't that many lines in it. Compared to other movies, though. The end is perfect<BR>Recomended to ANYONE!! GOOD MOVIE!!
0671027344|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in recent months! Yes, it is a coming-of-age story--but it is so much more. It is sad, hopeful, and ultimately very satisfying.<br />I thought I was so &quot;cutting-edge&quot; to be reading this, only to find over 100 reviewers have already written about it!<br />I adored Charlie, the narrator of the story--he is so good, kind, loving, and loyal. He relates his thoughts and feeling so beautifully in letters to an unknown person. I feel that he is a fairly typical teenager, full of doubts and worries, but compounded, in his case, by depression brought on by his (falsely) blaming himself for the death of a beloved aunt.<br />The book is so realistic and down-to-earth -- Chobsky manages to portray all of the insecurities of these early teen years without ever resorting to angst. We follow Charlie's first year of high school, with all its tribulations, lovingly rendered by this gifted author. We see the influence one caring teacher can have on a student. We hear about Charlie's depression in his own words and take an emotional journey through his life.<br />Chobsky beautifully handles many touchy subjects that teens must deal with: suicide, pregnancy, depression, drugs, drinking, and romance. I would recommend this book to mature teens and to the parents of any teen.
B00005QG9J|4.0|This album is a good follow up to their Make Yourself release. Its not as heavy but still has its kick. I dont know why everyone is saying that they sold out. Theyve been a band for almost 10 years they have matured down the line.
B00005NOOH|5.0|This work is simply one of the best documentaries about World War II (albeit from a British point-of-view).  I bought this to replace my aging VHS tapes (recorded off a commercial station).  The quality is, well, DVD quality.  If you have never seen this documentary, then either buy or rent this set (it is over 30 hours in length).  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a spectacularly mastered DVD which everyone should own.  Russell Crowe is a great actor who delivers an excellent performance as Maximus.  The part where he dies at the end is very emotional.  I would recommend this movie to anyone....
B00003CXDD|5.0|First off I never had seen this movie, but decided to buy the dvd because of the price the store had at at about sixteen dollars and was very supurised how much i liked it. The movie is exciting and willow is very likeable and VAl Kilmer even did a better job then he usaully does anybody BatMan forever. The actaual dvd is better then most with a few featurettes inluding the one from the time the movie came out which was intreasting and a new one which I am going to watch after i finish this reveiw, there are trailers and tv spots as well as a still gallery with about fifty pictures. If you still arent ready to buy this it also has the best dolby digital sound mix i have ever heard better then eposide one and a very good tranfer a lot better then the horrible godfather dvd set and as good if not better then some new movies such as leggally blonde which i thought was a little grainy.The only thing that I wish they would have done is had ron howard or george lucas join warrwick davis on the commentery group commentries are always better. my advice if you like harry potter, star wars, the mummy, tomb raider etc go ahead and buy this dvd you will like it.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|The Rainbow Children is not your typical Pop album.<br />I consider it comparable to The Secret Life of Plants by Stevie Wonder. I know musically the styles are really different, but the concept behind them is nearly the same. Prince, with this album is sharing with all of us something that is deeply personal to him. The battle between the flesh and the spirit have been an integral part of his music. However the time has come whe the spirit has sort of won over the fleshy side of his music.<BR>The Jazz and funk element also make it quite a departure for him musically.<br />When Stevie Wonder's Materpiece the Secret life of Plants came out, people thought that he had lost his mind. How could such a succesful artist just throw down everything and start again and pay a musical homage to the way plants grow. The point is that he made it and it is a brilliant and gutsy thing to do.<br />Artists are not slaves to their Fans nor to their record companies. Just as each of us is free to choose the way we lead our lives, an artist should have the capability to produce and create something unique whenever their spirit chooses to inspire.<br />Prince has done this very successfully on this album and the results show. How many artist today are bold enough to declare their spirituality. In a music environment saturated by the Bling Bling, hip hop chick fratenizing one dimensional (...)songs, a taste of religion and god should not sour our appetites.<br />The songs on this album have Prince in fine vocal form. His Guitar playing would put alot of so called guitarists to shame. He easily shifts genres and styles.<br />Maybe alot of people will not embrace this album. Maybe because we are so much used to the past that we are burdened by it. <BR>Although, dig if you will the picture of a young boy or girl putting this cd in and discovering for the first time that music can tell a story, make a political statement, and make you talk and want to share it with all your friends. That isthe beauty of the Rainbow Children.
0345404475|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, more than its inspired movie Blade Runner.  The film was so visually strong that a lot of plot and conversation passed right by me.  I do recommend reading the book first-by first seeing the film, I found myself being distracted by comparisons and contrasts.<BR> I recommend this book to even the most nave reader to the world of cyberpunk.  I think the main reason I found it enjoyable was that the book maintains a constant flow-not necessarily an easy read, but not cluttered by computer lingo that can be confusing to the layperson.  The interactions between humans and androids were much more intricate than that in previous books I have read, for example, Deckard and Rachel's relationship.  Rather than being cluttered with a bunch of cybersex talk, they engage in very emotional conversation.  If you are timid about jumping into the genre of cyberpunk, this book would be a good place to start.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Nice to see the industry finally figure out why we buy DVDs: extras! Tons of them in this 2-disc set, most of them great.<br />As a movie, lots of fun and with a message that's close to the heart of those of us who aren't fairy-tale pretty. Like &quot;Antz,&quot; however, there's a bit too much of an insistence on NOT being like Disney. This mostly works for them, but you sense they're looking over their shoulders and yelling, &quot;Take THAT, Walt!&quot; at times.
B000001ESF|5.0|Arguably Rush's signature work in a long, distinguished career that continues today, 2112 has a littany of musical and lyrical  reasons for standing out in Rush's catalogue.<br />But by far the best reason to buy it now (or again) is the sound quality on this digitally remastered release.  Those of us who bought the album, and then the first-pressed CD's as soon as they came out, listened to both through an unbelievable amount of analog hiss from the original recording.  Indeed, the first sound a listener heard WAS the hiss before the introduction's eerie synth beginning.<br />Mercifully, the tape noise has been virtually eliminated, making this as good a recording as it is a musical work.

Martin does makes you feel like you are reading our world history, were the &quot;good guys&quot; aren't always good and the &quot;bad guys&quot; aren't always bad.  People say tolkien is the best, but I have to disagree.  He is certainly the MOST important of all the fantasy writers because he showed everyone how it is to be done, but I found his stories wanting, and a little boring, almost kiddy like.  And I certainly don't love his characters.  His books are for children, Martin writes for adults. For me,  I like the sense of reality, which isn't always nice and clean, but mostly grim and grey.  I would say that tolkien is on the &quot;nice&quot; end of the spectrum and Martin is on the &quot;not so nice&quot; end of the spectrum in terms of violence and adult like themes. (Robert Jordan kind of fits right in the middle there and he is a great writer also!!) If you like for all the &quot;good charecters&quot; to live happily ever efter than this is not for you.

B00005NWM3|1.0|Do you ever buy a cd and there's only one good song on the entire thing? It usually ends up being used for a coaster or a frisbee. This is one of those cd's. I almost didn't buy this cd just for the picture on the back, I should've gone with my gut. These guys are stuck in 91. It's just a bunch of repetitive (...). The songs all sound the same and there's only one that's worth listening to. Do yourself a favor and buy the single if you can't download it.
0684869713|5.0|The fountainhead.  Simply put, this is a book obviously about the self exhaltation of mankind and the very nature of happiness in its whole.  This book brought out all I had all ready known about myself and mankind that I had not the words or the ability to articulate.  To put it bluntly, it said what I felt.  This book was written in a very, enthralling manner that helped to drive home the well thought out and methodic plotline.  The author drew you in from the first comment with her striking picture of a man nake at a cliff-edge, then drove you deeper as she gives this man character and breathes life into him.  You begin to wonder what makes him tick, and, throughout the book, she explains slowly, and with great care, Howard Roark, Architect.  This book,has been a guiding in my life.  I have takent he lessons learned about how you can never achieve happiness through the eyes of others and that true success lies not in the merits your achievements get, but in the achiements themselves.  I hope that everyone can get something from this great piece of literature and that it isn't just another book droned over by ellitist second-hander's.
0784010188|5.0|Well, after a very good first movie, a sequel faces a challenge of measurng up to the original.  This one pulls it off VERY well to the point where it kllls the original!  This one presents a more philosophic view on human life and nuclear war and had more action than the first one.  Plus the effects are much better because of the T-1000's liquid metal form.  <br />Recommended for sci-fi fans

It's just one of those movies that a bunch of frineds can sit down, and watch while eating a pizza.  The comedy is not to be missed.  This &quot;Rockumentary&quot; follows a band on tour.  You get to become one with the band.  The special features on this DVD are not to be missed.  From Music videos to deleted scenes, this DVD has it all.  Never before have I seen a DVD that has such amazing and entertaining menus are one that had me on the floor laughing.  I strongly reccommend this DVD to anybody that wants to laugh.
B00003CXDD|3.0|I'm rating the movie in the middle, since I haven't seen it.  I am more concerened about the advertisement on TV for this movie.  They should be sued!  Their ad goes something along the lines of &quot;Before there were hobbits...&quot; That is a downright lie.  This movie came from teh mind of George Lucas.  I highly doubt that Lucas came up with this BEFORE Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.  Tolkien wrote those books about 60 years ago!  How dare they try to pass off Tolkien's masterpiece as a play on Willow!  That is outrageous!
B00005OM4N|4.0|The title of that song says it all.  Brit is at that in between stage as a entertainer and as a person.  I find the lyriucs more person in such songs as that and Overprotected which I like the sond and the lyrics.  I  of course love I'm a Slave for it's sexy urban dance beat and Boys is a totally flirty club song.  I played it for friends of mine I know don't even like her as an artist and they loved that song.  It is worth the buy and a must have for the Britany fan!
6300214419|2.0|Meryl and Robert are excellent in this film and do the best they can with what they're given.... which leads to the MAJOR complaint.... editing or obscure screenplay? We see how Roberts wife finds out/reacts, but never how Meryls husband does/reacts.  We must read between the lines to find out Meryl is free also near the end when they meet again, but never sure if she's seperated or divorced!  At one point, it almosts sounds like she's going to say &quot;seperated&quot; but doesn't. Even the end is a let-down!  View from a rental store and save your money for &quot;She-devil&quot;or &quot;The French Lieutenants Woman&quot; for a Meryl fix. Even &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; was better than this &quot;decide for yourself what happens off camera&quot; tripe.

B000001IPL|5.0|This CD is by far Offspring's best. Though it was made in 1994, it simoply had the most feeling, and meaning behind it. The songs are filled with anarchy and anger but somehow fill in the cracks our dialy lives are missing. Offspring in this CD speaks the truth, they say everything everybody else is afraid to. This CD is without a doubt the best CD I own. I highly reccomend it.

B00003W8NM|5.0|The first time I saw FIGHT CLUB I was kinda like, &quot;Was this not the stupidest movie ever?&quot; But the second viewing you understand it better, and that makes the story go smoother. I think, (as we <BR>probably all did), that FIGHT CLUB was going to be non-stop action, great acting, and maybe little, (if any) storyline. But boy was I wrong! Once you get the plot, it seems like the action scenes are more enjoyable and the film don't seem to drag on.<br />The story is about a insomiac, (Edward Norton), who is looking for relief. So he joins this cancer club, where everyone comes together to tell their stories to one another. This &quot;brutal honesty&quot; as Norton puts it, help him release all his feelings, and can rest. Then he meets a soap salesman, named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on an airplane. But once he gets back from his business trip, he finds that someone has committed arson, and his condo is ruined by a fire. This is when Tyler comes in the picture. As they start to fight, (not because of any problems, they just want to beat the hell out of each other!), they realize more and more, that other men want to fight as well. Thus begins FIGHT CLUB. With performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, and Helena Bohnam-Carter, (which are Oscar caliber, or they atleast deserved a nomination), FIGHT CLUB is a brilliant film, with a really superb DVD.<br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:<br />* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>* Closed-captioned, THX<BR>* Commentary by director David Fincher<BR>* Commentary by Brad Pitt<BR>* Commentary by Composers<BR>* Commentary by Helena Bonham Carter<BR>* Commentary by Edward Norton<BR>* Production notes<BR>* Theatrical trailer(s)<BR>* Five Deleted Scenes and Outtakes<BR>* Still Galleries: Set Design Stills, Costume Stills, Original sketches, Oil paintings, Storyboards, Publicity stills, Lobby cards &amp; Production Stills<BR>* 17 behind-the-scenes vignettes<BR>* Making-Of Fight Club<BR>* THX Optimode<BR>* Widescreen anamorphic format (2:35:1)<BR>* Number of discs: 2
B000002UJQ|5.0|Breaking from the traditional guitar rock sound that followed from Radiohead's first two releases, Pablo Honey and The Bends, OK Computer is a beautiful and dark commentary on the sterility of computer technology and modern life.  From airbags saving lives to alien abductions, to election politics, to plane crashes, this disturbing conceptual album will change the way you look at contemporary music, and will undoubtedly join the canon of 90's classics.
B0000542DH|5.0|I have to say that I love most of Oliver Stone's work. I think he's really exceptional. He's defintely one of my favorite directors. I loved JFK (*****), Wallstreet (*****), Any Given Sunday (****), and of course Born on the Fourth of July (*****).<BR>But as far as vision, I think that NBK is the best. Not because of the violence, but the storyline. The media does influence people. (Look at the last case against NBK's director Oliver Stone. Two young kids killed a bunch of people at a convient<BR>mart, all because they seen NBK). I mean, is the media responsible? Some would say yes, I defintely say yes. But should the media be charged with the crime when someone commits a crime?<BR>Of course not. People have free will and make the decisions they want to make. The media is part responsible for making it, but people know what their doing. Anyways, this movie is more that violence. Its the camera work. They used handheld cameras, psychadelic special effects, and gritty quality. (Even on the DVD, which I purchased today). I loved this film, I mostly bought it for the movie, but a lot of the persuasion was the fact of all the special features. Some are really good, others are not. The deleted scenes are really a joke. (With the exception of the Ashley Judd courtroom scene). The alternate ending was pathedic. (However Oliver Stone said it could pave the way for a sequel, in which Micky (Harrelson) and Mallorey (Lewis) get the passion for killing again and embark on another &quot;Death Fest&quot;.<br />This story is about two young lovers, Micky (Woody Harrelson, White Men Can't Jump) and Mallorey (Juliette Lewis, Kalifornia), who go on a killing spree. Killing anyone, and almost everyone. (With exception of the one who will tell the tale of Micky and Mallorey). After they are finally apprehended, they must deal with a cop who wants them to fry, (Tom Sizemore, Saving Private Ryan), a Warden (Tommy Lee Jones, Volcano), who is less than pleased that their in his prison and aT.V Journalist (Robert Downy Jr., Ally McBeal) who wants to find out more.<br />The DVD seems to be loaded, but don't be fooled. But if you want it for the movie, its exceptional, and will stand out from all the rest.<br />DVD SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDED:<br />* Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only)<BR>* Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen, Dolby<BR>* Commentary by Oliver Stone<BR>* Theatrical trailer<BR>* Documentary Chaos Rising: The Storm Around Natural Born Killers<BR>* Deleted Scenes and Alternate Ending<BR>* Widescreen anamorphic format (1:85:1)
B000002NZO|5.0|Back in the 70's and 80's, I was just getting interested in progressive rock, and already quite burned out on pop rock.  I had heard the mainstream songs from Genesis all over the radio.  I never even knew, at the time, who Peter Gabriel was, or that he'd even been in the band.  And I didn't really care that much for Genesis.<br />In 1985, an acquaintence introduced me to &quot;old&quot; Genesis, trying to convince me it was better than the new stuff.  I was quite skeptical, but allowed him to play his &quot;Foxtrot&quot; album.  I was indeed, impressed.  Very different, and even interesting.  Later, I discovered The Lamb, which made a full fledged believer / fan of this older group.  I have since bought Nursey Cryme, and now, this album.  I don't yet have all albums of the Gabriel era, but I have to say, if Trespass isn't better than The Lamb, it is a close second, from what I've heard so far.  The music is beautiful, and contains a sense of &quot;air&quot; not present in the rest of the albums I've heard.  Very spellbounding.  Consequently, I attribute Phil Collins' contribution as a heavier, driving force.  This makes for a fuller sound in the later albums and the band really did reach its full potential with the Lamb in Broadway album; however, Trespass has become my second favorite album of this group, from the sheer beauty and magic accomplished.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|see this movie!!! It is so cool! You got a guy who's looking for his wife's rapist and murderer but he can't retain new memories for more than 10 minutes! This makes for some real strange and sometimes quite humorous situations as he goes about doing this. At first I was apprehensive about the movie because I had heard about how complicated it was, but then I just relaxed and realized it's not rocket science-it's just a movie! So what if you don't know everything that happened before and after to our hero Leonard Shelby-no movie gives you an entire biography of a person. I was caught up in the here and now of it as he races about frantically following up clues he's had tattooed on his body and taken snapshots of. I found myself really identifying with this poor guy. I really found many poignant moments in the movie, such as when he says about his wife-&quot;I can't remember to forget you&quot;. The star of the movie-Guy Pearce does a really good job playing Leonard Shelby. When someone told me this is the same guy who played the geek cop in L.A. Confidential I couldn't believe it, I mean he really gets lost in his movie roles. That's the sign of a good actor. All in all this movie rocked!!!!
B00005Q66T|4.0|I think that the track list is great, the only obvious exception (and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is the lack of any new material.  It is truly a recap of not just her hits (obviously not comprehensive, but a good sampling), but also songs that, while not hits in their own right, display the level of growth that she experienced artistically and vocally in the last decade.  Other reviews have commented that certain songs like You'll See or This Used To Be My Playground didn't make the cut.  Well, if her career has taught us anything, it is that Madonna is anything but redundant.  These songs appeared on her Something To Remember album, so to bring them over to another Greatest Hits album isn't really necessary.  And, to take all the hits from all her recent albums would not only be impossible to cram into one disc, but also dilute the importance of each individual album.<br />Immaculate Collection, Something To Remember, and GHV2 together form a career-spanning collection of music that, while not covering every hit, covers her range of talent and artistry perfectly.
B00003CXE7|1.0|This is the best movie of 2000? Nothing but gore, and more gore. The acting was horrible-Russell Crowe has two expressions, angry and stoic. This is a Ben-Hur wannabe but it fell far far short of that great movie. Sad that this pitiful excuse for a Best Picture will go down as an Oscar Winner.
B0000028RR|5.0|to the people who maintain that Wake up is derivitive of Kashmir, you are idiots, keep drinking your beer and watching Survivor and try not to toss around song names unless you know what youre talking about. Morons.
B000007OY0|5.0|I first watched this movie when i was 14 and even then i realized how incredible a story it was. Without getting into plot, i'm going to say this was the greatest movies of the 90's, if not ever. The story is powerful and the charaters fit it perfectly. The ending is a true masterpeice, and the revenge is sweet. Stephen king is truely a great writer
B00005631D|5.0|I had this album on vinyl over twenty years ago and I still remember how good the music made me feel.  I Spoke with the guy who turned me on to this album and explained how I had been looking for years with no success in finding this album. The music from this album describes me and where I want to be to the point that I have come up with words and or scats for some of the songs.  I thank amazon.com for being astute to such extraordinary music from a phenomenal artist,I can't wait for my recently ordered CD of Love Island to arrive and would have paid double the price.  Once you take the journey into the sunrise of &quot;Love Island&quot; and visit the &quot;Tahiti Hut&quot;  and &quot;Whistle Bump&quot; you will relaxingly flow into the San Juan Sunset.
B00005U18E|5.0|I could watch this over and over again! Renee Zellweger was fantastic! It was flawlessly easy to forget she's American! She was completely believable, which is impossible for most American actresses! The humiliations Bridget found herself enduring were  hysterical! <BR>    <BR>   Colin Firth was magnificent as the understated, uptight, Mark Darcy. The way he keeps meeting Bridget after their inital wacky introduction is priceless! His surprisingly &quot;Hunky&quot; ending is not to be missed! I'd never seen him before, but I will again!  <BR>    <BR>   Hugh Grant's completely believable sleazy, British, upperclass, playboy boss Daniel Cleaver will leave you booing, hissing, and trying to shake his sleaze from your mind long after the movie's ended. <BR>    <BR>   Every actor on this film has something to be proud of. Bridget's wacky friends, her bizzarre parents, as well as coworkers and others are all wonderful individual characters in their own right.  It was a pleasure!<BR>    <BR>   The script was a gem.  Each scene is charming.  Situations and dialogue.  The  upbeat narration fills in any gaps, sets the tone, and moves the story along at a nice pace. Just as you think the climax of the film can't go any higher, along comes another twist that takes you on another loop of the ride.  <BR>   <BR>   Well chosen music also adds to the emotional punch of the situations.  Bridget's last gutsy conversation with Daniel in the office and the subsequent musical choice of &quot;R-E-S-P-E-C-T&quot; by Aretha Franklin as she leaves, will have you rolling on the floor with laughter! An inspired choice!<BR>   <BR>   Her diary in the title is the record of her year of self improvement leading to her happiness and almost destruction, and the source of her narration. Don't miss this!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is quite easily the funniest movie of all time. Now, I have rented this about thirty billiion times, and let me tell you-its a movie youn watch and laugh at until your eyeballs pop out of your head.  If you like the simpsons, imagine the funniest epiosde youve ever sen-ythen multiply it by a million some odd.  This movie has it all, frenchies, british guys, sorcrereer named tim, and best of all-A KILLER BUNNY!!!
067101756X|3.0|I really don't know what to think about this book.  If it's true,  then it's probably the most important book in the world, even more so than the Bible.  If it's not--and I must admit this is the more likely scenario--then it's just a sci-fi novel in the guise of non-fiction.<br />Then again, if I had to prove this was a pack of lies, I'd have a hard time doing it.  I don't know.  I guess I'm just going to wait for the government to come out with the truth before I make up my mind about Corso (I know, and then people in hell will be enjoying tall, cool beverages).
B00005QK3W|2.0|Paul McCartney's solo efforts can be defined by one word: mediocre.  The composer known for such classics as 'Yesterday', 'Hey Jude', 'Let it Be', and 'Band on the Run' has turned in another subpar effort with 'Driving Rain'. While this CD does not rank as the worst effort of his solo carrer (see 'Wings Wild Life' or 'Pipes of Peace') it is far from his best. The lyrics throughout this CD are weak, uninteresting, and lacking of any depth. The melodies are catchy and the bass playing superb, but that is about it. The standouts are 'Freedom', 'Your Loving Flame', 'Driving Rain' and 'Lonely Road'. <br />Macca finds will find this CD pleasing, safe, and catchy, but not anywhere near as appealing as his last release of original songs 'Flaming Pie'.
B00003CXDU|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, I must tell you now that you're missing out on one of the funniest movies ever made! The year 1999 has had some of my favorite movies, including &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;October Sky&quot;. &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is in that list.<BR> <BR>There was a TV series called &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; which is the story of the NSEA Protector and it's crew - &quot;Commander Peter Quincy Taggart&quot; played by Jason Nesmith (played by Timm Allen), &quot;Lt. Tawny Madison&quot; by Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), &quot;Dr. Lazarus&quot; by Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman), &quot;Tech Sergeant Chen&quot; by Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), and &quot;Lieutenant Trek Laredo&quot; by Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell). But after four years, the show was cancelled, leaving the actors and actresses without any jobs. Twenty years later, at a convention center, they meet up with aliens Commander Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), Teb (Jed Rees), Quellek (Patrick Breen), and Laliari (Missi Pyle). They are from the alien race Thermians (or Termites! (you'll have to watch the movie to understand!)) and having mistaken the Galaxy Quest TV show for 'historical documents', they request the 'crew' to help them negotiate the terms with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs). But of course, things don't go they way they seem since the actors are now playing for their lives! And with the help of Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), if you could call him 'help', and Galaxy Quest fan Brandon (Justin Long), they set out to save the universe.<br />Witty and funny, this movie will keep you in stiches throughout the whole 1 hour and 42 minutes of it! Acting is marvelous with Tim Allen as the 'raving ego-maniac', Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Gwen (watching her you won't be able to believe that she's in her 50's!!), and Alan Rickman as the serious English actor. <br />Though there's nothing bad about this movie, there are some innuendos and some bad language henceforth the PG rating. But notonly that I don't think kids will really understand it or even get most of the jokes. More likely teenagers and adults will enjoy this movie much more. I'm most certain by the time you've watched this movie a couple of times, you'll be reciting all of the funny lines from the movie (my family does all of the time!)
B000002UCN|4.0|Harrison came into his own as a solo artist with &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; and for hard-core fans, this collection will fall short. For most, this gathering is indeed the most economical and best of Harrison's output before, during, or after his Fab Four tenure. &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot; &quot;Taxman,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;What Is Life&quot; are all here, and one might quibble about the omission of his silvery guitar solo masterpiece from Ringo Starr's &quot;It Don't Come Easy,&quot; or his 80's hit &quot;Set On You,&quot; but for initiates, this is plenty.
0786867973|5.0|I had to laugh when I read the review demanding to know if there were any driven young career woman out there who enjoy cooking. I am one of those women, and so - thank heavens - is Nigella Lawson. A breath of fresh air in a subject that either prompts professional-level feats of accomplishment or no-fat, food-is-bad self-flagellation, Lawson has a wicked sense of humour, a casual approach and best of all an appreciation for eating. Lots. (In the UK, she's famous for actually tasting her cooking as she goes and taking great pleasure in doing so.) <br />For Lawson, techniques are worth cultivating when they don't require Cordon Bleu levels of practice yet still yield measurably better results. She meanders pleasurably between classic recipes, 'borrowed' ones and those to which she's added her own unmistakable touch. The result is like flipping through Nigella's own recipe files, packed with favourites, hand-me-downs and personal observations. Rather than Superwoman, she is Everywoman...an Everywoman blessed with humour, style and intelligence. Not to mention a hearty appetite!<br />Although I am an avid buyer &amp; user of cookbooks (after I get home from my full-time job, I must point out), it's the ones by Nigella Lawson that have the battered, stained and dog-eared look that marks a truly great cookbook. <br />And by the way, the profiteroles are FAB. Enjoy!
B000000WA4|4.0|This was the first C.D I ever bought. I think I was 13 or so when I did and I was definitly satisfied. The tracks range from soft piano music to harder rock.. A WONDERFUL S.P C.D.          This is the C.D that made me thier permanent fan!
B00005OWEG|3.0|The problem I had with this version of the movie is that every added scence doesn't seem to have anything to do with the general story. Which is a solider on a mission to assassinate an American Col. who has apparently gone crazy. This version makes the film too long and at times boring. During the French Plantation scene I couldn't keep my eyes open. The scence had nothing to do with the movie. This version moves at a slow pace where as the original moves at a faster pace. A necessary pace. I'm sure a lot of you won't agree with this review. But I'm just gonna stick to the original.
B000005J08|5.0|This is a good mixure of jazz, country, and rock. Perfectly plastered together. This is like Fantomas-Director's cut. But this not as heavy and fast, more like jazz-rock, mixed. Very easy to listen to. This is a choice of Mike Patton's standards.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I can't tell you how many people have told me this is a great movie. How much milege can we get from cliches and then the ridicule of cliches. True love? The music doesn't fit at all, (Hey now your an all star... in the opening credits, come on.)Mike Myers with an inconsistent Scottish accent which he already sold us in Austin Powers.It also is prejudiced against short people. All the DVD extras can't hide the fact that this is an insulting movie for adults and kids. Hollwood has finally killed all sense of taste and originality. I'll take disney (minus the musical numbers) any day.
B000005H40|5.0|............ever after the ten thousandth listen. Magic!
B000001Y2U|5.0|This Cd has to be one of the greatest I own. The rythm, riffs, lyrics and more are all original. I just like it alot. Did I mention it's against Jesus? I like that part too.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|either you get it or you don't. the d is accessible to those who've followed them for years. from their t.v. show, to appearances on mr. show, to seeing them tear up the club scene for the last 5 years...either you're in or your out. it is, what it is. if you're new to the game, and sharp enough for the humor - props to you. if you think the humor is inane or tasteless, or what have you - go put on some emo prog. rock or whatever you listen to. all of these songs are gems from their live sets, and it's great to hear them re-working these classics. i literally wet myself everytime i hear the wit in &quot;tribute&quot;, or insanity of &quot;inward singing&quot;. if you don't laugh yourself silly when you hear &quot;f$*k her gently&quot;, check your pulse.<br />p.s. - jack black is funny and can actually play, sing, and write witty melodies. unlike some other comedic actors turned musicians...cough*adam sandler*cough
B00005NWRS|5.0|This is a really good record.  There are a couple of knockouts, but about half of the songs on the record are pretty slow and soulful. Not to say they aren't good, it just took me seven or eight listens to get a bite into the slower stuff. Bought a Whiskeytown album, and the same thing. He's got a great voice, writes good songs, he just needs someone to light a fire under his back side, because when he rocks, it is indeed Gold. You gotta want to be patient to like the slower stuff, but I have slowly acquired a liking for this record. It really is a very, very good record, I just wish he would pick up the pace and rock a little more.  Highly recommend that you get the limited edition with the extra disc which includes six great, rollicking songs (a great disc on it's own).
B00000J7SO|4.0|Far from being Bob Dylan's best album, but it is interesting for several reasons, and sort of a rarity in his catalog. A transition album in one sense, Street Legal came on the heels of Desire and the Rolling Thunder Revue, this is the one and only studio album on which Dylan employs a big, slick backing band (complete with Steve Douglas's saxophone and several female backing vocalists.) It is also, in respect, a sort of pre-requisite to his subsequent &quot;born again&quot; phase and his &quot;Christian trilogy&quot; of albums, from the subject matter on certain songs to individual quotes (&quot;I'm exiled, but you can't convert me&quot;), to song titles (Changing of The Guards), right down to the name of the album itself. And also, while Blood On The Tracks is commonly known as Dylan's &quot;divorce album&quot; (along with the closing track, Sara, on Desire), Street Legal, in a way, deals more with it in actuality; as, in fact, the majority of the songs (titles and all) deal with a &quot;coming down to earth&quot; view of love and romantic disillusionment. Standout tracks include the ackwnoledged master tracks, Changing of The Guards and Senor (Tales of Yankee Power), and another major track in my mind is the vastly underrated No Time To Think. This is one of Dylan's most amazingly constructed songs - chock full of highly dense verses with blistering internal rhyme schemes - as well as having a fantastic backing. Is Your Love In Vain?, True Love Tends To Forget, and the frenetic closing song, Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat) are notable songs as well. Some people complain that this album's musical backing, atmosphere, and production are too suffocating and glossy (especially when compared, of course, to earlier Dylan material), but I find it has its own charms. No other album in the Dylan catalog sounds this way - it builds on the already big sound of the Desire album - and, while such overbearing theatrics make it hard to focus on the lyrics attimes, it also puts them in a special context. The female backing vocalists manage to avoid sounding corny most of the time and actually sweeten some of the songs with excellent vocal harmonies; whereas Dylan himself turns in some great vocal performances himself (I'd actually say this is one of his best albums singing wise; Love In Vain and True Love are both very well done), and the horns lend a nice air to several tracks. As for the lyrics, they are some of the most dense that Dylan has ever written (one chorus begins, &quot;I was down in the reeds without any oxygen...&quot;); featuring unprecedented amounts of internal rhyming and truly innovative and clever rhyme schemes on such songs as Senor. These techniques may seem more showy than emotionally true at times, but they just add to the tone of excess that already runs through the album. While I certainly don't reccommend this as one of your first Dylan albums, I think you should definately get it if you are a fan - it has several classics and he's not done anything like it since.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This sound track is the best 18 beautiful composed tracks. The sound is enchanting with orchastra Gregorian chants. When I listen to the soundtrack I get the felling that I'm in the book with the charaters. Buy this CD for all those hobbit fans out there!
6300182282|5.0|This is taken from a Noel-Coward like play about a married and a married woman who meet every year for a weekend for adultery. Like Brief Encounter, the couple seems both innocent and guilty about their affair. Unlike that play, however, the encounter is repeated annually for years and the relationship is more physical. There is some good age make-up, although Ellen Burstyn doesn't convince when she's at her youngest. The action does seem rather obviously adapted from a play, with scenes of the outside tacked on but redundant, and I feel it would be better to have just acknowledged the story's origins by keeping the action in the interior location. The music by Marvin Hamlisch is one of his best, and is used sparingly throughout the film.

0385505833|1.0|This is about an empty nest couple who decide to opt out of the Christmas commerciality that has consumed this holiday:  no gifts, no lights, no tree, no parties, etc. I like the idea.  However, the amount of hostility they receive from their neighbors and friends seems unrealistic.  Reading this was frustrating, and at times, boring.
0767812646|5.0|I saw this movie last Wednesday and I definently thought it was wonderful! The songs were funny and fun, and I loved the &quot;Artful Dodger&quot; who the actor was John Wilde.<br />This movie is about the orphan Oliver Twist who went to London to make his fortune. There, he meets the &quot;Artful Dodger&quot; (John  Wilde) and Dodger brings Oliver to see the thief and cheater Fagin (Ron Moody) and other boys who steals for Fagin. Of course, Dodger is a thief too. Oliver, not knowing this, makes friends with them. To add-up the excitement, there's also a murderer and a thief named Bill Sikes (Carol Reed)<br />I won't tell you anymore; you'll have to watch the movie! Some parts are scary so young children might get scared. But I still LOVED it!
078322687X|5.0|THE BREAKFAST CLUB is one of my all-time favorite films, though I've only seen it once. It takes place in the '80s when Saturday detentions were popular punishments in high schools. The film is about five very different high school students who all wind up in Saturday detention for different reasons. They at first hate each other, because they feel as though they've got nothing in common. There's the &quot;nerd&quot; (Anthony Michael Hall), the &quot;jock&quot; (Emilio Estevez), the &quot;princess&quot; (Molly Ringwald), the &quot;metalhead&quot; (Judd Nelson), and the &quot;weirdo&quot; (Ally Sheedy). But at the end, they pour out their hearts and souls to each other and what they really feel, and also learn how to have fun together even while in Saturday detention, which helps them to form what is known as the &quot;breakfast club&quot;. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb. I am a high school student so I can really relate to the film - all of the teen agony the characters have in  the film. The storyline, plot, and script are truly amazing, and the directing is well done. Kundos to John Hughes for making a great, wonderous film! THE BREAKFAST CLUB goes on my list of top 10 all-time favorite films. And, if you enjoyed THE BREAKFAST CLUB, then I strongly recommend DEAD POETS SOCIETY, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, STAND BY ME, and THE KARATE KID films! This DVD is a must, even though not many special features were added onto it, which was kind of a disappointment, especially to those who love buying DVDs because of all the great extra special features the DVD has instead of the VHS. But the film alone is worth the price. THE BREAKFAST CLUB is a must see and must own!
0812550706|5.0|I have never been a fan of cyberpunk literature, but Ender's Game was fantastic.  Not only does it have complex characters, but there is plenty of action as well.  As you follow Andrew Wiggen (Ender) through his childhood, you see how he excels in school, overcomes great obstacles, and eventually meets his greatest challenge.<BR> This book offers a great deal of issues that are both interesting and entertaining.  For example, should the government have the power to regulate the size of families?  Should one disobey orders for the good of the group?  And why fight wars at all?<BR>Do they really solve anything?<BR> It is this writer's opinion that Ender's Game is written for the high school/college age group.  Anyone can enjoy it, however is it somewhat complex and may not be good for a young reader.<BR> Overall, this is a great novel for not only cyberpunk readers, but just about everyone.  It's fast paced and futuristic plot will keep anyone reading.
B00000FZ1V|4.0|However, the word &quot;bust&quot; isn't a verb. Anyhow, Ray Parker jr. song lyrics aside, this is my all time, numero uno, favorite film of all time. I was enchanted with it as a small child, I had the toys, all that stuff, i watched the movie daily, and such. I really just liked the ghosts and action and stuff. So anyhow, a few years have passed...about...12, and I still love this movie. I purchased the movie for nostaligia purposes, and it was good. I loved it. I love the commentary, I love seeing it in widescreen for the first time, I love the higher picture quality it brings. <BR>As I have aged, I have also picked up on the humor much more than I had as a child, its all superb. Anyhow, from the sound of it, I must really, really, love this film. Why 4 stars? Because the Deleted Scenes segment doesnt play. Perhaps I just have a flawed DVD, but it was REALLY disappointing.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I like this cd.  It doesn't have thoughtful, meaningful lyrics.  It doesn't have great vocals.  Sure, it's cheesy.  But I like it...Okay.. i know that Britney dressed nastly, and doesn't really sing at her concerts, but i honestly like her music This CD is fun, its catchy, its easy to sing along to.  The slow songs kinda are stupid, but its some strange way they are really comforting to listen to.  I'm sorry i like Oops.(...)
B00005JKHP|4.0|I was too young to see this film in the theater and understand it to it's entirety (I felt this way about Star Wars IV as well.)  But, this new Director's cut is simply awesome!  I love the new touches to the effects.  The film feels newer than 1979-era and seems to have almost Next Gen crew interaction.  I would HIGHLY recommend buying this DVD.  It's a great movie with simply wonderful music and effects.  The warp effect obviously inspired Next Gen as did the score.
B00005QXXO|4.0|I'd heard much about this record (I won't call it an album, no an EP) and was interested to hear exactly how much radiohead changed their sound in a live arena, having never seen them live myself.<BR>Quite simply, without knowing what the concert actually feels or looks like, I have a glimpse at least what it sounds like and MY GOD do I want them to come to Australia so I can actually witness the beauty that exists on this release.<BR>Rather than a distraction between 'proper' albums, this disc complements both &quot;Kidd A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; in the way that the latter complemented the former. 'The National Anthem' is a fantastic with Thom's vocal tricks over the opening and completely different with the absence of the jazz-fusion freakout at the end. '...Spinning Plates' is mind blowing - what I feel was one of the best tracks on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; gets a fantastic workover with piano to exist in an almost completely new dimension, independent of the orginal track. You can almost imagine Johnny on stage taking the piss out of Thom in 'Everything In It's Right Place' as he loops and distorts the singers voice and 'True Love Waits' should take all those &quot;Oh, I don't like radiohead anymore because they don't play guitars like they used to&quot; whingers to task - as beautiful as anything.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and it blew me away.  Never have I enjoyed a movie that was based on history more than I have this one.  I realize some parts are embellished but for the most part, this movie is so real.  I never fully understood the impact of Pearl Harber before I watched this film.  I would recommend it to anyone!  It was even better than Titanic!  Ben, Josh, and Kate did superb acting jobs in this film and deserve awards for their performances.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this CD as Greatest Hits albums usually have nothing to offer to one who has purchased the albums. To my delight, however, this wasn't just a simple rehash + a bonus track one would expect.  Not only are the songs remastered, some are completely remixed and blended beautifully together just like the albums, creating not only a retrospective of Cretu's Enigma project but also an entirely new listening experience.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I don't really know why i like this CD or Britney Spears but i can't stop listening.  I realize that Britney isn't a very strong vocalist but her songs are catching and fun.  And even the songs like I'm not a girl, not yet a woman, that I originally didn't like have grown on me.  Its kinda unexplainable, but the music just makes me feel happy.  Its not depressing it's just fun.  If you are one of those people who can only like a song if it is depressing or really thoughtful, or has really meaningful lyrics don't buy this cd.  If you like fun music and and if you like pop i would recommend Britney.
B00005R1N3|3.0|The film is a classic...but this is just to note that this version of the DVD is apparently the EXACT same disc as the Canadian import that is available, just re-distributed. It was reported months ago that this would be a widescreen presentation release from Music Video Distributors, but sadly, it is not. Hopefully this film will one day get the release on DVD it deserves.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Great story, fantastic looking dvd, what more could you want? My only gripe is with the language tracks. Where's the cantonese or english dub? The only tracks available are mandarin and french? FRENCH? Not even cantonese subtitles! You may have guessed I'm Chinese/Cantonese. The picture looks excellent with rich colours and no scratches and the sound is very good too.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Although Hitchcock listed this as one of his 2 favorite films, I had once viewed it as &quot;closet drama&quot; because of the limited set, conventional bad guy, passive good guy.  The voyeuristic angle was interesting, even provocative to a point, but insufficient to save the movie from its sense of claustrophobic one-dimensionality.<br />That was before I viewed the film through the eyes of Grace Kelly.  In one respect, the critical, pivotal moment in the movie is not when Kelly puts herself at risk in Raymond Burr's apartment, nor is it the film's climax with James Stewart fending off the murderer with his camera's flash bulbs.  Rather, it's the moment when Hitchcock's camera (not Stewart's) shows Kelly's eyes suddenly open wide and come alive when she, too, becomes interested in the scenes being played out on the other side of the court yard.<br />At this point, within the first half of the film, Kelley drops her high society, fashion-model airs and her constant mothering of Stewart.  She now spectates with greater curiosity and imagination than Stewart, and even though she questions these &quot;rear window ethics&quot; and characterizes her behavior as &quot;ghoulish,&quot; it's clear she has become a major player, fully participating in the game of voyeurism, scopophilia, and fetishism that is normally assigned only to men who fail to emerge from an obsessively narcissistic and hedonistic childhood.<br />For the past 20 years feminist academics have been applying &quot;male gaze theory&quot; to just about every film in sight, and invariably to the discredit of the male.  He is the subject; she's the object; he's the one who sees; she's the one who is seen; he owns the gaze in all of his power, pleasure, and guilt; she can only helplessly follow the gaze, experiencing a kind of masochistic pleasure at best.<br />In &quot;Rear Window&quot; Hitchcock, frequently depicted by feminist critics as a mother-obsessed misogynist, turns gaze theory on its head.  Grace Kelly demonstrates that a woman can get as much pleasure from looking as do men--an irony of collossal proportions when we consider that as a high fashion model her role, if not job, is to be looked at and photographed.<br />But Hitchcock's film manages to liberate its central heroine's vision while preserving the &quot;institutions&quot; of marriage, motherhood, and femininity.  What is the object of Kelly's pursuit while playing the game at its most intense moment?  A wedding ring, which she flashes before the probing telescopic lens of Stewart.  And at the end of the film, the camera makes clear that, pending his recovery from double castration (both legs are now broken), he will no longer go off on adventures without Kelly at his side.  But then, of course, Hitch has his final little joke when, once Stewart goes to sleep, Kelly (now wearing pants) puts away her mountain-climbing magazine and replaces it with a high fashion title.  Still, a radical film for Hitchcock and, for that matter, most other filmmakers.<br />The DVD makes it all the more possible to read the visual dynamics of the film, permitting razor sharp stills of the principals' faces and eyes, disclosing the act of seeing to a degree never before possible.Kelly demonstrates that a woman can get as much pleasure from looking as do men--an irony of collossal proportions when we consider that as a high fashion model her role, if not job, is to be looked at and photographed.<br />But Hitchcock's film manages to liberate its central heroine's vision while preserving the &quot;institutions&quot; of marriage, motherhood, and femininity.

B00005R87Q|5.0|Wow....you need to see this movie to beleive it! The races are incredible and ferverishly fast! All the camerawork is artistic and has an intense coolness to it. The only thing is that this movie plays rice rocketz like they're world (they are) but the Asian characters are the bad rival gang. Pshaw... Anyway, the cinematography is the best in it's genre and the acting's suprisingly fresh. But the races, just plain AMAZING! Blazing fast cars and camera work with incredible car dynamics and stunts. You will see some of the nicest, most powerful cars in this movie too. Only try to see it in surround sound (preferable DTS 6 channel) as the roars of the engines, squealing tires, everything needs to be heard (loudly) all around you for a movie like this. The only other movie that comes close in comparison is the HK (hong kong) racer flick by Andrew Lau: &quot;The Legend of Speed&quot; starring Ekin Cheng. Definetly check it out if you like F&amp;F!
B00003CXRM|1.0|in this film the crustations play the brombones and are the main actors.  Their acting in the scene about the liver/meatloaf pate is damaging to all life forms other than the rare speccies of over grown grub larva, mainly the mammoth grub larva GRUBINICO GUTSERICHITY

B00003CXTF|1.0|I was interested to read other reviews of this movie as I found it the most disappointing movie I saw this year. The love story (stories?) did nothing to endear the main characters to you (if you could even believe that such events transpired) and the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was, sadly, only a small slice of the film. The action scenes were well constructed but it wasn't enough to save this movie.<br />Also - I don't really think personal attacks on someone who writes a review is necessary. There is room for everyone's opinion on this page, &amp; no one logs in to read your opinion on another reviewer, just on the movie, thanks.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I am refering to the All Region DVD that is now available, but only if you look hard enough. This movie is great, but DVD is the only way to view it. Widescreen, with crisp DTS or Dolby Digital sound (TIE fighters zooming overhead, Sweeet!!) This movie is great, and the new scenes are pretty cool in the original, but they mess the whole movie up in Return of the Jedi (Jabba's place at the beggining resembles an episode of Barney the Dinosaur). The original and ESB are great with the new scenes. (...)
B000002LQR|5.0|&quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; shows the Red Hot Chili Peppers at peak talent, peak form. Everything on this album is perfect from drums to guitar to bass to vocals it works phenomenally together here. Every song on this album is good but the Standouts are : Breaking the Girl, Suck My Kiss, Give it Away, Under the Bridge, Naked in the Rain, Apache Rose Peacock, and Sir Pyscho Sexy. If I had to narrow it down to one song thatr was my favorite it would be Give it Away, I love the rap that oozes from the song it has rock sounds with rap lyrics and delivery, same with Suck My Kiss. Under the Bridge is without a doubt the most popular song on this album it has become a Chili Peppers Staple, thier most popular song. I can't reccommend this album enough it is a truly phenomenal piece of work.
B000001FS6|5.0|Very well meaning. Nice to listen all these songs.
0064407667|5.0|This is a story with bite! It's sarcastic, it's witty, it's sad, it's funny. (The funniest thing is the description of the author at the back.) This author doesn't write \\"down\\" to kids. I kept thinking, as one horrible thing after another happened to these kids, that the book was too strong, violent, and scary for kids. But then I remembered how violent fairy tales are, how sad and scary \\"Bambi\\" and \\"The Lion King\\" were. Kids can take it -- in fact, they love it! I can't wait to read the rest of the series of unfortunate events.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I was one of the first people to see the movie (on opening day) -- it's one of my all-time favorites -- and I must be one of the last people to hear this CD (great birthday present!). The only good thing about T-Bone Burnette's lack of success as a singer-songwriter (check out my review of the criminally deleted THE CRIMINAL UNDER MY OWN HAT from 1992) is that he has plenty of time to produce great records like this one!<br /><br /> It's a prime example of the &#34;fabrication of authenticity,&#34; carefully selecting songs and musicians to recreate Depression-era America for the movie.  One complaint -- with all the versions of &#34;I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow&#34; included here (2 vocal and 2 instrumental), it's a shame the Stanley Brothers version couldn't be one of them -- it was one of their signature tunes, and Ralph's for more years still.  But Dan Tyminski is excellent, and Ralph Stanley sings a haunting acappella &#34;O Death.&#34;  Some of my other favorites include Chris Thomas on &#34;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues,&#34; which goes with the Robert Johnson character in the movie, and &#34;Big Rock Candy Mountain&#34; in its original version by the Wobbly, Harry &#34;Haywire&#34; McClintock, with the classic line &#34;where they hung the jerk that invented work&#34;!  The fiddle &#34;Indian War Whoop&#34; by the recently departed John Hartford is unbelievable too.  And the closing numbers by the gospel group the Fairfield Four and the Stanley Brothers go together in a way that couldn't be improved on.<br /><br /> I uncovered a little-known fact about T-Bone & the Coens' sources -- the Soggy Bottom Boys are based on the real-life career breakthrough of the King of Country Music, Roy Acuff!  Acuff played the Grand Ole Opry in 1938 for an audition, and was hired permanently, with a band that dressed up to look like exaggerated hillbillies.  The Opry had Acuff change the band's name -- to the Smoky Mountain Boys.  There's a photo of this band in the book COUNTRY MUSIC: FABRICATING AUTHENTICITY by the sociologist Richard Peterson, and guess what -- the Soggy Bottom Boys look surprisingly like the Smoky Mountain Boys!!NG AUTHENTICITY by the sociologist Richard Peterson, and guess what -- the Soggy Bottom Boys look surprisingly like the Smoky Mountain Boys!!
6305736650|3.0|Why is this DVD not in anamorphic format? Was the original 4:3? Its depressing to watch such an excellent movie distorted on a 16:9 screen. WB blew it. This applies to the other WB classics as well.
B00005QIPH|4.0|Bunch of sorry saps want cred for knowing the bands that came before this one and that one.  Please, take it to your local used vinyl shop.  The nosering dude behind the counter might care, i definitely don't. <br />Strokes debut is taut, edgy, and LISTENABLE.  Don't take my word. Check it out.  Too bad for you musical luddites if you wanted another &lt;insert band with cred here&gt;.  Too bad that YOUR sad and derivative attempt at making indie music is never going to get past your basement four-track for the rest of us to laugh at.  <br />Too bad for you that new bands are going to keep on appearing, and new songs are going to be written and sung while you will be hopelessly clinging to your record collection shouting &quot;but they were here first!&quot;  Have fun with that.
B00005214X|5.0|I write this review just moments after learning that George has departed this world. Through the immense sadness, I wish to say thank you George. Your inspiration as a spiritual being, innovative guitarist and brilliant songwriter has shed much light on this often dark world. You will always be loved and remembered by the millions who admire both you and your work. You were truly one of a kind.<br />When originally released in 1970, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; stunned many with not only its sheer volume of music (a three record-set), but also with the incredible quality of the songwriting. Toiling in the immense shadow of John and Paul during the Beatle years, George had built up quite a backlog of unreleased songs, many of which appeared on this masterpiece. Mega-hits &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What is Life&quot; attracted a worldwide following with undeniable hooks and inspirational lyrics which examined the deeper meaning of life. However, great as those songs were, they only scratched the surface of the themes George explored on &quot;Isn't it a Pity&quot;, &quot;Art of Dying&quot; and the title tune. A practioner of Eastern philosophy, George brilliantly fused his music with his beliefs of love, life, death and reincarnation. That he was able to do so without clobbering his fans with heavy-handed lecturing is a credit to his astute songwriting skill. The soaring &quot;Isn't a Pity&quot;, a seven-minute epic which builds to dramatic climax a la &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, is quite possibly the strongest of the set. Other standouts are the beautiful &quot;I'd Have You Anytime&quot; and &quot;Let it Down&quot;, a powerful ballad that would fit perfectly alongside Abbey Road's &quot;Something&quot;. The spell of seriousness is broken with the uproarious &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot;, a lighthearted poke at the throngs of obsessive fans who literally camped out at the Beatles' Apple Corps office in London.<br />As for the remastering -- it's terrific and provides a huge sonic improvement over the previous CD version which sounded lifeless and boxy. The acoustic guitars and percussion which drive so many of the songs really cut through the mix. Best of all is the clear presence of George's pleasantly raspy voice. While others have expressed disappointment with the bonus tracks, I find them to be quite good. The outstanding &quot;I Live For You&quot;, an outtake, should have made the original album. The acoustic demos of &quot;Let it Down&quot; and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; stand out in their stark naked form. I even like the new version of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot;. Admittedly, it takes a few listens to get used to, but once it settles in your head, it's hard to forget! <br />&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; will probably be remembered as George's finest solo accomplishment. Overall, it is a beautiful artistic statement which no doubt ranks among the upper echelon of solo Beatle albums. Thank you George for this fantastic gift to the world. Thanks for all your music: from &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; to &quot;Something&quot; to &quot;Bangla Desh&quot; to the Traveling Wilbury's. You were a friend to all of us. May you rest in peace.
B000002UCN|5.0|George Harrison may not have been the most popular Beatle, but he is an awesome singer/songwriter. &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; is the best song ever written besides &quot;While my Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; all songs by George. So who cares if the songs were hits while he was a Beatle, the music is still the Best of George Harrison. He wrote it, he sung it. George is the best!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have had this cd for over a month and I have not skipped a track yet.  This is a masterpiece of an album.  Starting with &quot;Nice to Know you,&quot; all the way until the beautiful hushness of &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; the listener goes on a journey with Incubus.  This album is full of emotion, so if you were looking for SCIENCE 2 then you will be dissapointed other than &quot;Blood on the ground,&quot; &quot;Have you Ever,&quot; and &quot;Under my umbrella.&quot;  But if you were hoping for an album that improved on the high points of Make Yourself then Morning View is the album that does it.  I am not going to rate these songs because quite honestly all of them are tens!  This album reminds me of the great albums of Pink Floyd which blow you away with how beautiful they are as a whole.  This is a masterpiece with great songs.  This album has great lyrics to all the songs.  Every song can be felt on some personal level.  Just try this album.  Sorry Mr. Bob Dylan you made a great album in 'Love and Theft,' but Incubus' Morning View is my album of the year without a doubt.

B00000DC7J|5.0|This is a great CD.  Piazzolla's words (&quot;We gave our souls to this record&quot;) ring true.  Miss it at your own peril.  This record has a soulful quality to it that is unparalleled.  Every musician is top-notch, and the music is excellent.
0553712837|4.0|My two favorite things in the world - Grisham and Christmas came together. This is a darling book that I purchased rather than checking out from the library or borrowing from a friend. It is nicely written, hilarious and endearing. The only reason I gave it four instead of 5 stars is because I had wished it was longer. I love these new Grisham novels! Painted House will be a classic!
B000000OU6|3.0|I love Slash's guitar playing, he is my idol etc.  Now then, this first offering from the Snakepit is so-so.  First off, Slash's guitaring is jaw-dropping as you'd expect and most of the songs are fantastic.  However, the main (huge) dissapointment of this disc is Eric Dover's singing.  It does not fit in right with Slash at all, he just seems to squeal out the lyrics and after a few songs it really does get annoying. <BR>All in all, good but not great.  I really do recomend Ain't Life Grand, Snakepit's second album.  It is a masterpiece, a totally new Snakepit with a trully amazing singer!  Buy that instead.  Rock ain't dead!
B00004U8P9|5.0|The greatest musical of all time is, in my opinion, Moulin Rouge, but this one seems to give it a bit of a run for its money!  I'm one of those strange types who enjoys the movie WITHOUT having to go to an audience participation event, (we don't have many around here) and this movie has some of the greatest musical numbers in any movie!  Dammit Janet, The Time Warp, Sweet Transvestite, Hot Patootie, Eddie, and, of course, the solo of those mesmerizing lips in Science Fiction Double Feature are all beautiful!<br />This DVD truly does the film justice!  The lips greet you at the menu, quoting the movie throughout, and a pair of disembodied, fishnet-clad legs dance around while you make your selections.  The film is presented in widescreen format only, but you have the option of viewing the film with the traditional mono soundtrack or the remixed dolby 5.1 soundtrack.  You also have the option of viewing the US version or the UK version, the only difference being that the UK version contains the Superheroes musical number, which was removed from the US version because it was considered too much of a &quot;downer.&quot;  There's also a commentary track by Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn, an audience participation track, (which is quite funny when you can understand it) a &quot;multi-view theater experience&quot; which allows you to view people performing along with musical numbers at showings of the RHPS, and too many other special features to mention!!!!!!<br />Buy this DVD if you like the Rocky Horror Picture Show!  Don't buy it if you hate the movie or are a homophobe. (in which case, trust me, this movie will creep the hell out of you!)<br />Pros:<BR>+Great movie<BR>+excellent sound and video quality<BR>+inclusion of UK version<BR>+buttload of extra features<br />Cons:<BR>-Not for everyone<BR>-Still not quite the same as a real theatrical experience<BR>-If you choose to try and duplicate a real theatrical experience, be prepared to clean up afterwards!
B00004RF97|5.0|Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart, wonderful story.<br />Philadelphia Story is a CLASSIC!, just rent it you won't be disappointed.<br />Well written, produced and directed Hepburn knew what she was doing when she put her own monies into this.
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard is one of my all time favorite groups and they were definitely the best band out of all the mid to late 80's metal/pop bands (Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, etc.).  This compilation showcases some of their best songs, among them &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;, &quot;Photograph&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Armageddon It&quot;, &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, and &quot;Bringin' On The Heartbreak&quot;.  As with all &quot;Hits&quot; or &quot;Best Of&quot; compilations, there are always a few questionable song choices.  In this case, I felt the only weak songs on this cd were &quot;Miss You In A Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;When Love and Hate Collide&quot;.  If it was up to me, I would have much preferred to see &quot;Make Love Like A Man&quot; and &quot;Rock Rock (Till You Drop)&quot; included instead.  Despite the two weak tracks, it is a very well put together compilation.
B00003CXXS|2.0|At least they have Sam Neill in this one!<br />The only wonderful scene was when the flying pteraodon turned his head in full close-up at the humans.  The special effects in that scene were amazing, looking so real.<br />Actually the flying pteraodons were the stars in this movie.  However this movie left me wanting more.  The plot was really no plot, the movie was short, basically it was throw some dinosaurs in, some screaming, a hero, [and a love story] and again Hollywood ruins it again.<br />Fun for rentable fare other than that 3 times is NOT a charm.
B000005ITX|1.0|Please, spend a few extra dollars and get the new Rhino edition.  I was unfortunate enough to buy this version only one month before the new one was released.  The sound quality on this is atrocious.  I repeat, do not buy this version!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Star Wars:Episode 1 is a okay movie.  The fault is in the casting.  The little Luke Skywalker is awful as an actor, what Lucas was thinking, I just don't know.<br />The special effects are so computerized that you know they are computerized, they look cartoonish, and painted.<br />The movie is interesting on a Star Wars point of view, the highlight is Natalie Portman as the Queen, well acted and great make-up and costume! other than that this movie is really a bust.<br />Samuel L. Jackson in this movie is so misplaced.  He looks like Samuel L. Jackson in costume on a Star Wars set.  Liam Neeson is also miscast, Ewan MacGregor is good however.<br />The movie is just a mish-mash that goes toooooo long with the race sequence involving young Luke, and the battle with those robots-...well what can I say, the special effects are really bad, they look painted on they don't look real.<br />Episode 1 is not a special effects marvel, nor a acting marvel and they killed the villian OFF! NEVER KILL THE VILLAIN OFF WITH 'DARTH' IN THE NAME!<br />Once Darth was gone it just destroyed the movie, besides the likes of Jar Jar Binks who was NOT cute and was absolutely annoying.<br />Lucas is just getting toooo old for this.  Give me Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher anyday!<br />Now we have the likes of &quot;Episode II&quot; coming soon with Samuel L. Jackson too!...won't they ever learn to quit while their ahead.<br />Should of ended with &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, end of story.
B000005RHR|5.0|What more can I say, except that XTAL is probably one of the most incredible journeys you will ever experience... I recommend this CD to everyone, it's changed my life and the way I see everything.. Richard D james is a genius... A cd that compiles work between 85-92, noting that Richard was only 14 when he did his first tracks of the album. Will say no more!
0385040253|5.0|Excellent from the beggining to the end. Suitable boath for kids and adults. It gives the reader how and why for every of 3854 knots listed. Only the size of this book is umpractical, and knowing why it is so, just gives you more pleasure before every further reading.
0897500482|5.0|Simply, this book is incredible. Bruce Lee is able to articulate his knowledge and wisdom like no one I have ever read, and I have read alot of books like this.<br />I am a martial artist who has studied classical martial arts for a long long time. As soon as I read this book I went out and found a JKD instructor. This book combines what was already known in some styles with what was known in other styles and combines it into, quite frankly, the perfect system. Everything that is practiced in this art can be used, none of it is in anyway just for looks, which is the weakness of many styles including, but not limited to, Choy Li Fut kung fu, Dragon kung fu, monkey style kung fu, Tae Kwon Do, Tai Ji Quan (although this is a different type of martial art and not nessecarily designed for combat), many karate styles including Shotokan and especially Shorinryu. The ideas of fluidity are prevenelant in many martial arts but very very few actually practice this. In Jeet Kune Do fluidity is everything, movement is everything. After I began taking Jeet Kune Do and read all of Bruce Lee's books I found myself immediately becomming a better martial artist and my other instructors thought so as well. If you are a martial artist this book is an absolute MUST HAVE. If you arent its meaning is decreased but it is still incredibly helpful and insightful.<br />This book is definately the best martial arts book you can buy.

0767903862|4.0|In some of his previous books Bryson tended toward mocking, snotty humor (snotty humor does have its place, but it was a bit overdone).  In this Australian travel book he is more gracious, but still observant and witty. <br />All in all, I think that he is growing up.
0441172717|5.0|From 1979 to 1984 I read this SF classic three times. Now sixteen years later I've read it for the fourth time. Frank Herbert's novel was published in 1965 and is considered to be one of the greatest science fiction works of all time. Herbert wrote a series of six Dune novels before his death in 1986. This book, the first and greatest in the series, is a tale of political intrigue and revenge set on the desert planet of Arrakis, commonly known as Dune. The story encompasses religious and ecological themes as well as social upheaval. The wealth of the planet is the geriatric spice known as melange, and Dune is the sole source of the spice. The prescient powers of the spice allow for space travel. The hero of the story, Paul Atreides, son of the Duke Leto Atreides, is caught up in a far-reaching tale of a feud between House Atreides and House Harkonnen, and a centuries-old scheme of the Bene Gesserit sisterhood to secretly breed a being with mental powers able to bridge space and time.<br />In 1984 David Lynch brought Dune to the big screen with a mixed degree of success. Naturally he had to do some serious trimming of the sprawling novel in order to encapsulate it in a movie. He also made some marked changes to the story. I read this novel again for three reasons: 1) Because it's a favorite of mine; 2) as a precursor to watching the Sci-Fi Channel's six-hour Dune mini-series; and 3) Frank Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, in collaboration with seasoned writer Kevin J. Anderson, has written a trilogy of prequels to the Dune saga and I want to have the story fresh in my mind when I read the first of them, DUNE: HOUSE ATREIDES.<br />I have read five of the six Dune novels in Frank Herbert's series. The second, DUNE MESSIAH continues the story of Paul Atreides, but is otherwise unremarkable. The third, CHILDREN OF DUNE, is a tale with Paul's children as the protagonists. The fourth is GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE, and was my least favorite, as it was heavy on philosophy and short onaction. The fifth is HERETICS OF DUNE which I barely remember and it is set thousands of years after the events of the first three books. Some liken HERETICS to the style of the first book and I plan on reading it again. The sixth book in the series is called CHAPTERHOUSE: DUNE and purportedly picks up where HERETICS leaves off. I'll read it after I finish re-reading HERETICS OF DUNE.<br />A note from the official Dune Novels site: &quot;Shortly before his death, Frank Herbert had begun work on DUNE 7, and he had discussed writing possible future DUNE projects with Brian. Because of the beautiful and moving dedication to Beverly Herbert, Brian's mother, in CHAPTERHOUSE, for ten years Brian felt that the story should stop there, even though the last novel ends on a cliffhanger. In 1996, though, two safe deposit boxes were discovered that Frank Herbert had sealed before his death. Inside those boxes, Brian discovered the full and complete outline for DUNE 7, the final DUNE novel Frank Herbert had intended to write, which wraps up all the story threads from the previous six books.<br />Brian and Kevin do intend to write DUNE 7, but it will not be the next project in line. Due to the complexity of the outline, many things need to be established in earlier novels, and it also seems fitting that DUNE 7 should be the last Dune novel published.&quot;
B000002WE9|4.0|Great performance by Elvis.The only downfall is this is not the entire concert,RCA must have deleted some songs due to lack of room on the album.Hopefull in this day of cd and dvd they will release the entire concert.Great concert and Elvis never sounded better.
B00003CXDD|2.0|I have now seen Willow one and a half times.  The first time was when it came to home video back in like 1989.  I fell asleep 30 minutes in.  So, giving it a second chance on DVD I can say that I did manage to stay awake although I was yawning quite a bit.  Folks, this film is about as entertaining as both Ewok TV movies and that's as good as it gets.<br />Warrick Davis, the dwarf who played Wicket the Ewok in Return of the Jedi and the two silly Ewok movies is the star of our film.  I actually enjoy watching the dwarves in this film.  My problem stems from Lucas' inability to write a sophisticated script.  The plot is rehashed from every fantasy film conceived (Lord of the Rings, anyone?).  How many times have we seen a newborn child prophesized to destroy an empire and the baby is sent floating downstream in a basket?  Sounds like the story of Moses?  Uh huh.  But here's where the biggest problem in the film lies; the &quot;Brownies&quot;.  Lucas gives us two Gulliver-sized sidekicks that are our Abott and Costello comic relief (think a really annoying inch-sized C-3PO and R2-D2).  And look... it's stand-up comedian Kevin Pollack!  On a subtextual level, the &quot;Brownies&quot; can only refer to something that I will appropriately leave to your imagination.  If I had managed to stay awake back when I first saw this, it should have given me a heads up on what Lucas had in mind for Star Wars: Episode I (specifically Jar Jar Binks).<br />The other problem; the &quot;talking&quot; animals, or should I say, Raziel the sorceress who was transformed into a muskrat by a hideous curse.  Willow attempts several times to transform her back but she ends up turning into a duck and then a goat with a baaaaaaaaahhhhhhddddd accent.  Speaking of tuning into a talking animal, this was just like the movie Krull which came out back in 1983.  Remember Ergo the Magnificent, the magician who turned himself into a cute, loveable puppy for the boy he befriended, then kept getting stuck as different animals because he forgot the spells to turn himself back?  Hmmmmmmmm.  Krull is a MUCH better film than Willow and features one of James Horner's best scores.  In Willow, Horner is in his lazy rehash mode recycling his old Aliens themes again with the exception of  the main overture which is really quite good I must point out, unfortunately the action is not as adventurous or shwashbuckling enough to merit a such a great orchestral overture.<br />Then we have our cliched &quot;scoundrel&quot; Madmartigan.  He's our manly hero and Val Kilmer is quite good at it.  Unfortunately not even Madmartigan can save this film from such embarassment.  He falls for Sorsha (his real-life ex-wife Joanne Whalley) and it is amusing to see how their on-screen romance comes off knowing they were married back then.  Later, Sorsha stares dumfoundedly in awe at our manly Madmartigan as he impresses her with his brute display of swordplay while he battles the &quot;Darthly&quot; General Kael and his evil minions.  Eeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwww!<br />And of course we have our cliched dual between Good and Evil, in this case it's two old hags trying to show up each other's magical prowess.  Fire and Ice are the best they have to come up with, how original.  I was yearning to watch Merlin and Morganna rivaling for the secret of making in Excalibur.  The Queen in this film is not much of a villainess.  I was more terrified as a child by the Wicked Queen in Snow White.  The ending is lifted from Lucas' own Return of the Jedi only this time substitute Evil Queen for Evil Emperor.<br />This film is a pretentious bore.  I'm sure there are plenty of people that enjoy this film.  I recommend many other well-made family oriented fantasy films than this.  The Dark Crystal comes to mind.  Fortunately Lord of the Rings will open in just a few weeks and should show up Lucas on how to make a &quot;proper&quot; fantasy film.  Step aside Lucas.ing stuck as different animals because he forgot the spells to turn himself back?  Hmmmmmmmm.

B000002UCN|5.0|How can you beat a Harrison album with his early solo hits along with his best Beatle songs? You can't.
B00004STPT|5.0|Sometimes Hans Zimmer does something to you that just feels like a smack in the face, a kick in the pants, that just makes you wonder where the guy has been keeping some of this music.  Despite some mild diversions from the action score realm with such films as Nine Months and As Good As It Gets, Zimmer has been mostly regarded as the composer for action films, however to date he has never done anything that I have found to be completely majestic, heroic, grand, and yet still incorporate a deep sense of emotion; so, with the release of Gladiator Zimmer drops a bombshell that secures him as one of the greatest living film composers.<br />To begin, every track is a delight.  The stirring choral tracks with light woodwind instruments are pretty and sanguine enough to capture everyone's spirit; the deep orchestra of the track Patricide is perhaps Zimmer's most emotional work to date; The Might of Rome track is regal and perfectly personifies the Roman Empire; and Zimmer's action music--admittedly typical in sound, though with a less flagrant appearance--creates a well-rounded album that never focuses to heavily on one aspect of this diverse score.  Moreover, still other tracks are simple and magical listens by themselves: Sorrow is an interesting and magnificent piece, To Zucchabar is an ethnic masterpiece, and last--certainly not least--is Strength an Honor, a modest yet truly inspiring inclusion into this fabulous album.  What's more, every track offers a completely new sound, new experience, yet oddly enough never betrays the uniformity of the piece and utterly creates an album that is oddly united yet ranges spectacularly across a multitude of styles and instruments, never seeming disjointed or inappropriate.  To take everything to an even greater extent, it is fun, all of it, every moment, every second; from beginning to end, this score takes a revered place among the list of CD's I own which can be listened to over and over, front to back without pause and certainly without boredom.<br />If there is one conclusion I can come to in reviewing this CD, it is that there is absolutely no way that it should have been passed over for the Oscar for best musical score; it is leaps and bounds beyond the competition, certainly beyond Tan Dun's work for Crouching Tiger, which was the victor.  If there is but one complaint I can offer, it is directed towards the CD and not the music itself; too many tracks blend into each other, making it difficult for someone to create a compilation disc without hindering the flow of the music.  But still, this is not a work to be segmented and selected; it is far too beautiful in its entirety to pass over any of the superbly composed individual elements that form into a seamless whole.  It is an awe-inspiring, magical step into a much more advanced region of music for Zimmer, one that creates a host of moods to accompany a diverse and superb film.  It easily takes the cake as my favorite Zimmer score, and it will no doubt accrue a similar position in your collection.  That is film scoring at its absolute greatest, perpetually entertaining, uniform yet never repetitive, every sound a pleasure to the senses and a new experience to be cherished as a musical gift.  After hearing this score, I anticipate everything Zimmer chances to offer; I know he is capable; this score is proof of his genius.
B000002V1D|3.0|Of the Duran albums I own, this is not exactly my favorite. I feel this may have been a transitional peice through the 90's. BUT There are some songs I just adore on this very album! Ordinary World, love voodoo, and Come Undone. Breath after breath is passible and romantic. Many of the other songs such as shotgun, lets face it, I dont even remember how they even go! As I listen to this album I find myself hitting the skip button. Picking the choicest fruit from the tree. If you want the good stuff buy the album called &quot;greatest&quot; you won't be dissapointed.
6304432461|4.0|Perhaps the father of the modern action film, Die Hard will probably be remembered long into the future as an unorthodox classic of contemporary film.  And in many cases, it rightly deserves to be distinguished thus.  Perhaps the film's greatest redeeming attribute is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  There can be no greater method of reducing the credibility of a film than to make every story, every character, every act so unbearably dark and sinister as to create a film that caves in on itself.  Die Hard treads a very thin line, not bordering the dark and sinister on either side, but by perfectly treading the vague distance between action film and spoof.  <br />And, ultimately it succeeds because of that.  This borderline spoof is best exemplified in the lackluster motivations of the Deputy Police Chief and FBI agents, not to mention a musical score that is phenomenal, excelling beyond the norm for a very peculiar though admittedly awe-inspiring use of Beethoven's Ode to Joy--perhaps the best use of this theme in cinematic history (if you can't appreciate the rest of the film, you still have to admire the audacity and direction the film takes as the villains open the vault).  Moreover, action sequences are generally well staged and there is a well thought out use of the architecture's intricate design aspects, ducts and stairwells, shafts and nooks.  Performance wise, the saving grace comes from Alan Rickman's villain who defies the action film mold by NOT going over-the-top with the outrageous performance that generally defines and ruins a film villain (A humorous side note:  from a 21st century perspective, one can observe an almost uncanny resemblance between Rickman and Tom Green at his first meeting with Bruce Willis; If it weren't for the voice, I wouldn't have known who I was watching).<br />The film is not without its flaws, however.  Little evidence is provided to support the exit of Rickman's character from the political organization of which he was previously affiliated, which would be of little consequence if the filmmakers had omitted his origin entirely.  Dialogue is generally good, never feebly trying to be too intelligent as preys most action films, though Willis seems to have accrued the bulk of the films failed one-liners.  Finally, and perhaps to the greatest detriment of viewing pleasure, is the climax that comes perhaps too quickly and with too little urgency.  By the time the villain has been slain, and the good guy has survived and rescued the distressed damsel, one wonders where the concluding showdown has escaped to.  I do consider it to be a letdown, though a mild one at that and with ultimately little impact on one's concluding perception of the film.<br />So, the film remains a pinnacle of the Hollywood action film that knows where to take liberties and where to cut the corners off of the showiness that too easily outdoes itself and plunges the film into a disastrous whirlpool of its own elevated severity.  Die Hard has become a template for action cinema, a how-to model by which others are created; unfortunately, its success has never been recreated by movies that try to cash in on its success.  Therefore, it remains a film that can be credited as inspiring a bulk of today's trash, but also exceeding it by observing the boundaries of entertainment and never surpassing them in favor of the absurd excess by which filmmaking is currently dictated.  Relish what inspired a genre and teased the limits of the well-rounded film: Die Hard is not to be missed.
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is infamous for its violence and its connection with the John Hinkley attempt on Reagan. Its also famous for starring a young Jodie Foster as a prostitute. However, the real driving force in all of this is one man's loneliness and alienation. Travis Bickle is a young frustrated alienated man. At the beginning of the film Travis is lonely, then when he meets Betsy (gorgeous young Cybil Shepherd) he feels that there is hope for him. One memorable quote is: &quot;I believe one should become like other people&quot;. He's probably thinking that he can have a significant relationship with Betsy, marriage family perhaps. Unfortunately all that is destroyed when Travis takes Betsy to a porno movie on their first date. Travis is so socially clueless that he has no idea that this is offensive to a girl like Betsy. Afterwards he tries to make up with calls and flowers which are all ignored. That starts Travis' madness. At first his plan is to assasinate the political candidate that Betsy is working for, in an attempt to perhaps get back at Betsy. WIth that plan gone awry Travis turns to saving teen hooker Iris(Foster) from her pimps. A bloody gory battle that is an incredible climax. So potential policitical assasin Travis turns into heroic vigilante who frees teen victim. The movie can easily be interpreted as a violent nonsensical film by people who don't understand what it is to be lonely. But for the millions out there who do understand, Taxi Driver is an incredible unforgettable film.
0812550706|5.0|________Ender's Game is a book with a back cover that hardly does it justice.  Whether you like to read or not this book would not be a waste of time.  I was reluctant at first to read the book, when it was recommended to me by a friend, but once I got around to starting it, I finished the book in two sittings.  It is the kind of book that you sit down to read for one hour, then one hour turns to three, then five, and then you wish you hadn't finished so much of it because you don't want it to end.<BR>________This book, while it may seem like a typical sci-fi book from its appearance, is far from it.  While many sci-fi books are action based, Ender's game took an approach that explored the characters much more than most other books I have read.  The way Card presents the story lets readers know what the characters are thinking when they need to know it, instead of making the reader wait until the character speaks in order to learn something about them.<BR>________Parts of the plot may be slightly unoriginal (Earth is in trouble because of a race of aggressive aliens), but Card focuses much more on the story of Ender, a very young boy genius who happens to be the Earth's only hope for winning the war with the &quot;buggers&quot;.  This book deals with the trials that Ender is put through by the government in their attempt to prepare him to command the entire military effort against the aliens, and it also contains an ending that will both surprise and appease even the most skeptic of readers.  The plot is simple, but the progression of it is complex and enjoyable.  I would recommend this book to anyone who knows how to read, and yes... it is that good.
B00003CXXI|1.0|I got this for my kids because everyone raved about how great it was. I was horrified that this movie was marketed for kids. It was crass and gross, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Our entire family loves this movie!  Our four year old thinks it is great!  We have already watched it many times and it is still fun to see.  Jim Carrey is a great grinch.  It is a good kids movie that parents can also enjoy, since you will have to watch it over and over with your children.
B000002H97|3.0|Well it's a nice album.But not as good as their albums like &quot;Ride the lightening&quot;,&quot;...And Justice for all&quot; or &quot;Master of puppets&quot;.Well some people may argue this one is better than any of their others.But there r only some songs which come to one's mind like &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;(one of my fav met songs) and also &quot;Nothing else matters&quot;.&quot;Enter sandman&quot; the opening song is good.&quot;The Struggle Within&quot; is a kinda faster song.&quot;Sad but true&quot; is good too.But the rest of the songs dont come to one's mind.I wont say this album is bad but it is not met's best effort.Try ride and justice then goto this album.Well this a little mixed review.
B00004R99K|5.0|This has got to be the best Disney story ever! Even though the story was written by Lewis Carrol, I still think that Disney's interpretation of the story was grand. The illistrations were soo cute. Not to put down the original Tenniel illistrations of course. I just think it's good that Disney can make an animated film that doesn't have to do with a princess. (=
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is, simply, one of my all-time favorite films.  Each aspect of the film clicks brilliantly, and the result is a film that is both unforgettable and an instant classic.  Nominated for seven academy awards, including best picture and actor it is a story that takes place in the 1940's about a young banker named Andy Dufrane(Tim Robbins) who is falsely accused of murdering his wife and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison.  Andy's manner is quiet, patient and seemingly emotionless.  He's not the type to wear his heart on his sleeve, or to cry in public.  He leads his life by his own way and knows how to live it.  Unlike Andy, his best friend Red(Morgan Freeman) has a more pessimistic outlook in life and is embraced by Andy's character.  This movie shows you hope and inspiration can lie even in the darkest of times.  Surprizingly enough the story was a novella by Stephen King called Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.
B00000K19E|5.0|The movie was incredible. The plot was complete with a sappy but enchanting love story, breathtaking action and fighting sequences, and an edge-of-your-seat climax of twists that led to an orgasmic conclusion of events. The story line had seemingly endless depth that seemed simple to put together, but upon close scrutiny, was a cover for various subplots (some intentional, some are haphazardly conjured up by passionate Matrix freaks like myself). The parallels wih the story of Jesus, for example, seem irrefutable. The cast played their characters to the utmost. Even middle-aged Lawrence Fishburn's (Morpheus) karate scenes were unsettlingly believable. Keanu Reeves (Neo)demonstrated superior martial arts technique (with the help of digitization and wires of course) as well. The screenplay was absolutely riveting. The breakthrough visual effects, like Neo dodging bullets in detailed slow-motion, or the (now hackneyed) &quot;jump-and-remain-in-the-air-while-the-camera-does-a-360 degree-turn-around-the-action&quot; effect, all leave the viewer in a visual and mental bliss. In my honest opinion, the Matrix is the greatest movie of the decade...(yes, its better than that movie too...whatever it was you were thinking isn't nearly as great, trust me). It's one of those movies you watch 50 times and still be able to find some new, integral piece of the story. The best part of the movie is the fact that it is going to be a trilogy. Star Wars eat your heart out.
0375703861|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read this year. It was very enjoyable to read about the immigrant experience in England, and what is really amazing is the way in which the writer effortlessly glides between different cultural contexts. Highly recommended.
B00003CY5J|2.0|Robert De Niro should retire. Edward Norton is pretty good, but both of them looked fake. The story was very plain in the first half, then it went into the tried and tried formula of excitment----who is cheating who? It was nicely executed, but had not much new elements to it, which made the movie boring. By the way, Robert De Niro is too fat to be a super thief.
B000000WIG|3.0|There is no doubt Gary Moore can play guitar. His attempts at the blues have merit also. Somehow though, he misses the mark. I loved some of 'Still got the blues'. Same here. Unfortunately he likes to clutter the some tracks with background horns which rather spoil the potiential of those tracks. Still, some songs are worth listening to, but generally the album is less likable than 'still got the blues'.
0553108034|4.0|Yes you heard me...this is what reading A song of Ice and Fire is like...reading a medieval epic poem. This is beyond high fantasy, this series( or saga) is told like a quasi-historical drama that reads like an epic poem  ala the norse and germanic tales of Egil's Saga, Beowulf, Niebelunglied , Volsungs et all.<BR>With that said...this is what sets this story apart from so many fantasy series...its not driven by the same old cliche of an all encompassing prophecy, with a central 'big baddie', nor is it soaked to the gils in magic..this story, like epic poetry, like history, is a HUMAN story...fate/providence/prophecy does not decide what happens so much as the characters themselve, their decisions, desires, wisdom and blunders.I mean there are moments in history or in an epic poem where you think to yourself'if only they would have done this instead...'  thats what reading Matin does to the reader....make you truly hope the characters make the right decision..b/c in this series, blunders have fatal consequences, for the minor and major character alike.   Also, like epic poetry..the characterization is more fleshed out in this series than in any other I have read. Now granted, I have not read many authors( only Goodkind and Jordan) but still, I have seen Martin avoid simple two dimensional characters- the ultra pious and honorable good guy and the unredeemably bad, bad guy.  Martin's characters, like many in epic poems, and certainly thru medieval history, are more flavored than that..some are honorable, yet can be ruthless...some are ruthless and cruel, yet have a scrap of honor on some points.  Again...this is a HUMAN story(saga)  and no human is one sided.<br />On the other side, lets not forget that Martin bases his story on our medieval world..a time that was NOT pc by any means.  So, in the story we have graphic violence, sex, mention of whoring, foul language, and adult themes...many reviewers have complained about this, all I can say is....have any of you read your history?? or your medieval lit?  Need I remind you that the most vaulted medieval/renaisance writer in history(Shakespeare) had more scenes of butchery and bawdiness in his whole cannon than in this book?  I mean..come on people..this is not sanitized disneyized fantasy here...its realistic. and if you examine the period this is 'set' in or the literature of that period...u will see that sex and violence was very much a part of that time period( as it is now) . If you just dont like that sort of thing in your fantasy, fine, but dont complain of excessiveness..If you think this is excessive, read Titus, or Song of Roland, of the Niebelunglied( a queen slew her own child to try and kill her brothers) and tell me which  is more gory.<br />Now, to the book itself, lol..Martin, simply put ,is a genius at narrative.  The reason why he eclipses epic poetry in my book is b/c he gives every chapter thru a pov of a character, which, simply put, manipulates the reader. Never have I ever had my loyalties to characters questioned as much as with this book...he simply does not let the reader polarize anyone in the book, or at least, not very many.  Also, like Jordan, Martin is THE master of political machinations..and if you think the schemeing is excessive, read some medieval british history...that stuff is better than any cheasy soap, more so b/c it truly happened. The plots are so masterfully interwoven, its like watching a tapestry be spun right in front of you.  Also on that note, b/c the narration is episodic( like epic poetry and history) rather than linear, Martin avoids the traps that befall other authors( Jordan); that being repetative narrative prose. An economy of well phrased words keeps the story moving and the pace very brisk. I moved thru Martin's 900 pagees in what seemed like no time at all..I cant say the same for 600 pages of Jordan.<br />So basically it comes down to this..If you like and I mean like the medieval time period- read this book.<br />If you like political fantasy-read this book<br />If you like realism, and dont mind adult themes- read this book<br />If you are tired of the same cliches..i.e'boy is plucked from obscurity, discovers latent magic, gets magic sword, falls in love with queen/princess..fights the evil dark lord and saves the day'- read this<br />IF you like minimal magic with maximum impact, by all means read this book<br />otherwise...im afraid you wont have much to look forward to.-A.N.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|When I first listened to this CD, my first impressions were of a little discomfort. However, I thought Prince &quot;doing&quot; Jazz was interesting. Then I committed myself to give it another 3 or 4 listens due to the fact I love most of what he's done over the years and wanted to make sure I gave it a good/fair listen before I made up my mind. After about 4 or 5 listens, it crept up on me. First I was amazed with the blend of Jazz and Funk. Then, it all just clicked for some reason. Suddenly, the only word that stuck in my mind was &quot;Genius.&quot; This is a FANTASTIC record, but you have to give it a little time to absorb as you do will all great records. It also is much better listening to it all instead of a few singles here and there. It's more of an entire experience. I love this CD and I hope others give it the chance it so ROYALLY deserves. For those who've panned the CD, listen a few more times and IT will be revealed.
B00000DFSK|4.0|U2's first anthology disc is filled with memorable songs that made the band a world class act. This is a great disc for anyone becoming familiar with U2 or those who have enjoyed their music from the beginning. Yet why isn't the &quot;October&quot; album represented here? Where's &quot;Gloria&quot;? The disc includes the throwaway single &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; while the upbeat hit &quot;Gloria&quot; is omitted. What's up with that? A four star rating instead of five. Rock on!
0385505833|5.0|I liked this book so much that I had to tell my husband about it. He doesnt have time to read so I review the books I read to him. Usually he doesnt really seem interested but he actually was laughing when I was telling him about Luther.<br />I have 3 teenagers and I plan to read this book to them while school is out for xmas break. I think it will make for a very nice family time nightly and something for them to look forward to in the future. With a family that runs every which way most of the time, some enjoyable family time with something they all can enjoy should be nice for a change. I will probably have some resistence to the idea at first but after they get introduced to the Kranks Im sure they will anticipate the time together to finish the book! Hope I have given others an idea for a diff way to spend some quality time with family.
B000001EAQ|2.0|There are some great tracks on this disc including &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Last Night On Earth&quot;. Overall though there are more than a few forgetable moments that make this one of the band's most uneven recordings. <br />Another in the line of 90's studio wizardry experiments which included &quot;Zooropa&quot;, this collection disappointed more than a few fans at its release. The problem is it sounds like U2 is trying so hard to cut tracks in the vein of the master craftsmen of electronica. You can't blame them for trying, it's important for any band to branch out and expore their art. <br />Yet U2 is a rock band, one of the greatest ever. Their most satisfying collections yield powerful recordings when they get back to basics and do what they do best. As the slower and more serious songs that comprise most of the CD are the stand outs here, the CD moves slowly and is difficult to listen to all the way through. A shame as the last three songs are all very good. Some of the more notable recordings here might prove better eventually on a compilation disc mixed in with more upbeat material.
6305064490|5.0|Frank Capra's &quot;It's A Wondeful Life&quot; is a holiday masterpiece. One to be enjoyed by all across the world! There are only a few films I can think of right now than manage to swell up the feeling of emotion that this film does. I think it's actually safe to say that nearly every single person has seen this movie at least once in their lifetime, and with that, I feel there is no need for me to go into detail about the plot. All I want to say is that, if there ever was a time for families to sit down and enjoy this film, now is the time. I've always come away with something whenever I've watched this film. It makes me think more about my family and loved-ones, and how at times I may avoid them, or say harsh things. &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;, after now, just over 50 years, still has the power to do that to me! If that alone is not enough to call this a great film, well, then there's James Stewart's performances. How at the time of release this film did not manage to sweep the Oscars is beyond. If Stewart doesn't get you to pull for him by the very end of the film, then I'm just the biggest fool walking around. You actually honestly start to care not only about him, but his family as well. If someone can tell me, they don't get a little misty at the end, when everyone comes to George Bailey's house with the money the town has collected, then you just have no heart. In this time we are living in right now, I honestly feel we need more film like this. Films that tell us to help each other out, stay close to your family and loved-ones, and always do the best YOU can do to make YOURSELF a better person. &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; will always have a firm place in my heart and has someone once said, it's just not Christmas without this movie. God bless, and Happy Holidays to all!
B000003TA4|5.0|At first I wasn't very fond of Nirvana but when I got this album my favourit band immediately became Nirvana. This album is absolutely amazing! This is without a doubt the greatest Nirvana album and in my view the greatest album of all time.Years after the realease millions of copies are still being sold.Songs such as the legendary &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; who could forget the first melodic chords of teen spirit.Or even the classic &quot;come as you are&quot; This album is a definite buy,if you haven't got this album make sure this is number one on your album's list because this album contains everything that is great about Rock.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|I really have enjoyed listening to &quot;The Rainbow Children.&quot; Musically, it is top-notch. Others have criticized the production for being too slick. I disagree. IMO this is the closest Prince has come to an organic sound in many, many years. After about the tenth time through, I finally forgave Prince for the narration (which initially was completely annoying). Now, I'm not focusing on it, and a much better musical experience is being had. I'm glad that Prince has found this new religious fervor, but it gets a little tired at times. I may be way off base here, but I get some anti-semitic sentiments out of the lyrics. And, the role of women in his new religion seems to be a subserviant one. These two points make me wary. What exactly is he advocating in the lyrics? The final song is a unification song, but earlier he makes a few statements that seem to be meant to exclude certain people (races or sexes). I'd like some interviewer to pose these questions to Prince. I'd like to hear what he has to say. I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but he has a couple of conflicting messages interwoven into the narration. The first time I listened to it, I had lyric sheet in hand. Now when I listen to it, I keep the lyric sheet far away- so I can't dig too deep. I'm giving it four stars for the music which is his best in years, but the lyrical content diminishes this review by one star and I'm being rather generous. I'd like to say that Prince is back, instead I believe he's back with a purpose. And I don't think he wants to party like it's 1999 anymore or like it's 2001 for that matter. His love of God is admirable, but I miss the diminuative freak that made some of the most interesting and boundary-bending music of the 80's and early 90's. I think he's still got it in him. Somebody just needs to set him straight.
0790732521|3.0|\\"Michael Collins\\" was a financial disaster and aesthetically left much to be desired.  Cinematographer Chris Menges may have admirably put together a beautiful looking film, but the overall quality is less than a typical made for TV production. Neil Jordan was not up to the task as the movie's director, and it seems that he lacks the background to tackle a serious historical project. I say this as an admirer of some of Jordan's other superb efforts. Liam Neeson did an adequate job as Collins, but mostly the talents of Alan Rickman, Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts, and Stephen Rea were unable to overcome the weaknesses of a mediocre script.<br />Why would any rational and decent person consider Michel Collins to be an Irish national hero? My most serious criticism deals with the less than frank handling of his career as a terrorist. Far too much time was spent on his later peacemaking efforts. Unfortunately, Collins will primarily go down in history for furthering the terrorist mindset that threatens modern day civilization.  Many terrorists throughout the world studied the work of Collins.  He is one of their Messiahs.  We should never forget that Collins murdered innocent people to achieve his political aims. Previous to Collins and a few others in the early part of the twentieth century, such activity was considered monstrous and unthinkable.<br />Why did the makers of \\"Michael Collins\\" downplay the terrorist aspects of his past?  This question demands an answer especially after the horror of September 11.  The movie deserves only three stars.  Those who might wish to learn a bit more about terrorism might find \\"Michael Collins\\" worthy enough to invest a few hours of their time. If anything, this movie speaks volumes about those who desire to pretend that Collins was something other than a monster.
B00005OM4N|5.0|(...) I don't really turn to this CD for spiritual enlightenment. I turn to this CD for jammin pop music that is undenyably fun! And isn't that what music should be about, fun! In this respect, Brintey truly is the queen of pop! If I am looking for deep, spiritual enlightenment, I turn to Dostoevsky, not Britney. But is you are looking to have fun then I would recommend this CD immediately. I have noticed in my high school that the happypeople enjoy Britney music while the mopey, sad ones can't stand her. I'm sure there are plenty of people reading this who would love to start up an argument with me, but it wouldn't really be worth it - now would it. I am completely satisfied as a Brintey fan because I love the music, and it isn't anyone's place to say that I am superficial or immature because of it!
B000002JS0|5.0|This band exploded  &amp; challenged all the charged rock of Led Zepplin yet still maintained a melodic  rock  sound, lyrics and stage   presence   without  going heavy metal. Delicious         memories  for anyone  over 35 today.
B000059WH0|5.0|I was a big fan of Toto in the '80s, but like with so many of these bands lost track of them in the '90s until redisovering them on the Internet. I have gone back and purchased all of their albums of the past 10 years--including the last one \\"Mindfields\\" on the day it came out in the states. Not until a few months ago did I pick up \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" (from Amazon.com). My oh my what I was missing out on! This is the most rocking Toto album ever!<br />Steve Lukather is most well-known in this band for his amazing guitar work and his beautiful lead singing on Toto ballads. But for sure, on this effort--on which he does all of the lead singing--he is remarkable on all tempos of songs. Rockers like the lead-off track \\"Gypsy Train\\" , \\"Never Enough\\", and \\"She Knows The Devil\\" showcase that Steve is more than a ballad singer. \\"Don't Chain My Heart\\" is a fantastic anthem of sorts--one of the best this band has ever done. And of course there are a few great ballads on here. I will mention in particular track number 8--a song called \\"The Other Side\\". Of all the great Toto ballads I have heard over the years, this ranks right up there amoung the best--with its soulful vocals and yearning, heartfelt message.<br />All in all, however, the focus on this album is ROCK. This is one of the better obscure finds of the past decade from a once-popular band. This album should have been huge--it is truly one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. (I'm sure the record company (...) them on promotion of this album at the time--with grunge taking over the world at that time...I didn't know this album existed until at least a couple of years after it was out.) To me this is a must-purchase in the melodic rock arena. Wish I had supported it 9 years earlier when it actually came out. For sure, better late than never!
0060925000|5.0|I've just completed my 2nd reading of A Suitable Boy, and it's amazing how many different things I got out of it this time.  What appeals to me most is the feeling of total immersion in the rich, diverse culture of India.  Each of the characters is finely drawn, but my favorite is Maan, who undergoes a complete transformation in the course of the novel.  Seth's got a gift for  style; E. M. Forster comes to mind as a model for his writing.  And he is a wonderful and clever poet, too.  Note that the dedication and Table of Contents are sonnets (in the manner of his wonderful The Golden Gate).  Not everyone will want to spend the time, but if you do, it's well worth it.
B000003BDJ|5.0|Here's a surprise: this greatest hits collection actually offers a great look at what the Rolling Stones were all about.  Most greatest hits collections have left me starving for the studio albums, but this album really brims with energy and most importantly, excellent songs.  <BR>The Stones wrote some great singles, and here they are for all of you out there who don't care to hear their blues covers and &quot;in-between hits&quot; songs on the albums.  Not that they had bad albums, &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; and others attest to the fact that the Stones could produce albums of great music.<BR>What makes this collection so great is the amount of music contained on it.  I'm listening on vinyl and every side offers something new.  The great rockers like &quot;19th Nervous Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, along with the slower songs like &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;Time is On My Side,&quot; blend together very nicely, making for an interesting and totally fun listen.  <BR>I'm not really a Rolling Stones fan, or a fan of Greatest Hits collections, but this album is one of my favorites.
B0000025DT|5.0|If you have never heard this CD--buy it--its one of the best albums of all time--from beginning to end---Tightrope is a masterpiece of music that is absolutely incredible---the cd continues on and on with one great song after another---if you only put one cd of elo's in your library-make it this one---its FABULOUS !
6305282927|5.0|This video is ageless in its appeal to young and old. It typifies the golden age of Hollywood musicals, with its catchy songs and incredible dance scenes. No matter how many times I watch it, it never fails to create a sense of enjoyment and satisfaction. It stars Shirley Jones and Gordon Macrae as young  lovers in the turn-of-the-century territory of Oklahoma. They represent the best of the American spirit-strong, passionate and willing to take chances for what matters most to them. This  movie is among the best of Rogers and Hammerstein's work, and will remain a timeless classic for many generations to come!
0385505833|4.0|Skipping Christmas was a light and enjoyable read.  Grisham succeeds in portraying a crazy, hectic Christmas rush that almost overshadows the purpose of the season.  The ending makes reading about all of the annoyances that abound during the Christmas-time craziness worthwhile and warms the heart.

B00003CY0V|3.0|There is not much of redeeming value here; the movie's biggest shot is a huge explosion early in the show that, except for the bad guys, kills almost everyone else within range (including cops trying to save a female hostage). The main plot? Hacking the US government out of 9.5 billion bucks for the &quot;antiterrorist&quot; hero (antagonist?) played by John Travolta. If you pay taxes, you won't be amused...then the hacker played by Hugh Jackman &quot;hacks&quot; by playing with geometric images on a fancy computer screen. Is this what hacking means?  <BR>There are some good things beyond Halle Berry's naked chest; the actors played their one dimensional roles quite well. It takes some talent to make such roles believable to action fans. Travlota, Berry, Jackman and others did that well and I got through the show without daydreaming. 3 stars...

B000002MZ6|1.0|It is not surprising to see that the overwhelmingly positive reviews this cd has received generates, in the main, from sci-fi<BR>fans (who listen to the cd as illustrative of Clarke's fiction) or from listeners who have little to no experience with Oldfield's back catalog. It is gratifying to find that so many listeners find great pleasure from this cd, but, speaking for myself (and likely for many other MO fans) I suggest that those<BR>listeners who had their first intro to Oldfield with this music and who DIDNT like it, should try TB II or QE 2 before dismissing<BR>Oldfield's music. Relative to most of Mike's earlier music, this<BR>cd is bombastic, new age-easy listening fluff.
B000003S0Z|5.0|If you come to this disc immediately after listening to Another Green World you will be struck by the vastly different sounds being explored. Before and After Science could be called Before and After Rhythm. Its said that Eno was responsible for turning Talking Heads onto some of the interesting rhythms they used on More Songs about Building and Food, that rhythmic sense is alive here on some of these songs as well. The first track,&quot;No One Receiving&quot;, actually almost sounds like Station to Station(though of course with major modifications) era Bowie with its cool  white funk groove. And &quot;Kurt's Rejoinder&quot; also has a funk groove and African beat thing flowing through it. Of course Bowie and Eno were right in the middle of their collaborative period in 77 which would culminate with 1979's Lodger which has Eno's rythmic experiments taking more steps ahead and even further down the road was more Heads experiments and the Byrne/Eno's '82 My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Anyway its fun to trace the influences when you own enough 70's discs.  &quot;Kings Lead  Hat&quot; as others have noted is a talking heads encouragement song, but what a fun song&quot;...it will come it will come it will surely come&quot;. Success I suppose. Of course if Eno leant out Fripp and Manzanera who both play on the track it might come even sooner. I used to have this on vinyl and as others have mentioned the altered track order on the disc does take some getting used to, but if you've never owned an old copy that won't be a concern. The most striking difference between this and Another Green World is that on the earlier AGW Eno creates and populates a whole new world with his very organic synthesizers which often sound like they are foraging around much in the same way we do. His organic synthesizer world seems a very pleasing one and every track melds so well into the next. The sound and feel of AGW still feels as different and as new listening to it now as it did when I first heard it. Before and After Science is a little more dated. Enos voice sounds like Alan Parsons on occasion, as in &quot;Julie With...&quot;but only a little bit, and that is an otherwise beautiful song. The words and the quiet guitar part make that perhaps the most memorable track. Little bit of a borrowed melody perhaps, as many of Enos melodys seem to be.Perhaps the post-mod thing makes that &quot;appropriating&quot; perfectly acceptible. &quot;By this River&quot; is equally beautiful. The instrumental tracks are very powerful for being so simple. They don't have the sweep and grandeur of AGW instrumentals but thats not to say one approach is preferable. Just they each produce their own distinct kind of effect. A very different sound than AGW. &quot;Through Hollow Lands&quot; and &quot;Spider and I&quot; are early Ambient numbers that would fit well on those records, though that second one does have words, and may remind some of the closer on Tiger Mountain, called, appropriatley enough, Tiger Mountain. Eno is some kind of master, of what I am not certain, but a master at some arcane art. I almost forgot &quot;Energy Fools the Magician&quot; which is a sort of self contained instrumental sounding nothing like anything else on the disc but a very aptly titled number that.t heard it.

6304602979|5.0|True Romance is one of those great films that was rather unfairly and bizarrely largely ignored on it's original theatrical release but it's really hard to know why. It's not because of the script/screenplay, that was written by the great Quentin Tarantino, with all the trademark flourishes you'd expect, with witty dialogue and great set-pieces that leave you quoting them for weeks. It's not because it's got a poor cast or poor acting. Apart from the leads, Christian Slater and the wonderful Patricia Arquette (in undoubtedly their greatest screen performances), this movie has a cast list like a whose who of great screen actors; Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman and Christopher Walken. It also boasts a great cameo performance from Brad Pitt and a superb supporting performance from (the then not so famous) James Gandolfino. Val Kilmer and Samuel L. Jackson even turn up too in blink and you'll miss it performances.<br />This is a great movie, a cool movie, a funny movie and an action movie. Directed by Tony Scott, one of  the best (if not the best) action movie directors around, True Romance is the story of Alabama (Arquette) and Clarence (Slater) young newlywed lovers on the run with a stolen suitcase full of $5m worth of the mafia's coke, which they intend to sell. But as the old saying goes, the path to true love never runs smooth and a battle of wits ensues between Clarence, the police and the mob leading to a classic finale in this action packed film. As a whole, this movie works beautifully but on DVD it's even better because you can access all your favourite classic scenes that unmistakeably bare Tarantino's hallmark again and again. Such as the opening scene where the heterosexual Clarence (Slater) states that he'd sleep with Elvis if he were still alive, or the showdown between Clarence and dreadlocked gangster (Oldman). Or the showdown between the mob boss (Walken) and Clarence's Dad (Hopper). Classic scenes indeed, particularly the one with Walken and Hopper. It's hard to believe this movie was made back in 1993 because it's still as fresh, still as cool and still looks as enjoyable as it was back then. I just love this movie and if you haven't seen it yet I hope you will too.hard to believe this movie was made back in 1993 because it's still as fresh, still as cool and still looks as enjoyable as it was back then.

B000003TAB|5.0|I just bought a new copy of this disc and noticed the awesome linear notes had been removed from the booklet, its now just a four panel with the pictures/song info in the inner two pages. Im guessing that all recent pressing of Incesticide are like this. Just wanted to let you folks know. If you want to read those notes I bet there somewhere on the net, or you could always find a used copy as well. None the less... Buy this album, its one of the greatest!
0790743507|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is one musical that even all musical haters cannot ignore. This musical I feel has everything that a musical should have. The great songs \\"Good Morning,\\" \\"You are my lucky Star\\" and of course the title track are forever timeless classics. The film is about Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont who are big movie stars of the silent era. Thank goodness for the film called The Jazz Singer because the silent movie world is all about to change. The Jazz Singer is a \\"talkie\\" and the silent movie actors find themselves undergoing singing and speech lessons so they can make their \\"talkie\\" movie. Don Lockwood passes but Lina Lamont cannot be a successful talkie actress. This film also shows us a romantic side of Lockwood and a showgirl named Kathy Seldon. Kathy pretends that she does not know who he is or anything about him, but we later find out that she knows everything about Don. Kathy and Don end up falling in love with each other. Later on Lockwood sees Kathy as a strong chorus girl who can overdue Lamont's voice, but Lamont tries her best to break them up. This films humor is hilarious but at times a bit cruel. A lot of it is at the expense of Lamont, because of her annoying voice and inability to sing and dance she is ridiculed throughout this film. Singin' in the Rain features some extraordinary dances ever filmed. One of my favorites would be during the Make `Em Laugh scene which is performed by Cosmo Brown. This number is a reason alone to see this film. The dances choreographed by Gene Kelley are very entertaining. The film also contains plenty of humor, especially where Don is talking about his early movie career to the press as having everything, while we see images of his past that are not really glamorous at all, as Cosmo and Don are being rejected just about anywhere. This film has a rather sweet ending as Don is singing \\"You are my lucky Star\\" to Kathy in front of hundreds of movie fans. It shows his love for Kathy is so strong. I would recommendthis film to anyone whether they are a musical fan or not. If you are ever in the mood for a fun and entertaining musical  I would recommend you rent Singin' in the Rain.
B00005QEO2|5.0|This is a great collection of aerosmith's songs! It has everything from their older days to more recent songs and       b-sides and unreleased songs which all sound great! Some of the songs are acoustical and live so variety is added to the CD. I bought this CD for my dad because he has been a huge Aerosmith fan from the beginning and he loves this CD. I always listened to Aerosmith to and I have to say this CD is awesome and if you're a veteran Aerosmith fan you HAVE to own this. If you're a new fan then you will enjoy this very much to.
B000002TQV|4.0|I am not an obsessive Radiohead fan, although I like the band, along with many others of the 90s. This is the only Radiohead album I own right now, although I am planning on buying &quot;OK Computer&quot; soon.<br />Anyway, the album is pretty good with beautiful music and thoughtful lyrics. The only problem here is that some songs are very bland and unoriginal; in other words, some of the tracks couuld have just as easily appeared on an R.E.M. album.<br />I'll try to &quot;group&quot; the songs together based on similarities.<br />The first track, &quot;Planet Telex,&quot; is unlike any of the other tracks. It's interesting and fun to listen to, but it's not a serious piece of music. In fact, Thom has said that the band came back from a bar and recorded this song drunk, and that he was lying on the floor in the studio singing the vocals. The lyrics don't make sense, but the music is good.<br />The second track, &quot;The Bends,&quot; fits into a category with &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;Black Star.&quot; These songs sound like typical Brit-pop songs musically at the surface, but there are some detailed sound effects added in to add to the enjoyment. They don't sound anything like stuff off of &quot;OK Computer;&quot; in fact, they sound more like The Beatles than Radiohead's later works! I like &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;Just&quot; quite a bit, while I think &quot;Black Star&quot; is pretty boring.<br />The acoustic songs that made single status include &quot;High and Dry&quot; and &quot;Fake Plastic Trees,&quot; both of which are highlights on the album. &quot;High and Dry&quot; has wonderfully simplistic music, and Thom's voice is perfect for the song. The only annoyance is that his voice seems a little off-key on this track, which really takes away from an otherwise incredible song. &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; is a very sad song about lost relationships and imaginary love. It's a great piece of music, but kind of depressing.<br />&quot;Bones,&quot; trackfive, is one of the worst songs on the album. It sounds like a late-80s alternative song combining the musical styles of R.E.M. and The B-52s. It's very annoying in its unoriginality.<br />&quot;Nice Dream&quot; is one of my very favorite tracks because of its atmospheric music. Like some songs on &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Kid A,&quot; this song seems to take you to another world, except rather than the depressing themes of those albums, this is a very positive-sounding song.<br />&quot;My Iron Lung&quot; is a mediocre song about how they hated their success with &quot;Creep,&quot; their hit from 1993, which I really enjoy. I don't really like their attitude that a good rock song like &quot;Creep&quot; has to be bad because teenagers liked it, but I guess this song isn't too bad.<br />&quot;Bullet Proof&quot; is very soft, and although some listeners will love it, it fails to really grab my attention.<br />Finally, &quot;Sulk&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot; close the CD off. &quot;Sulk&quot; is a nice sounding atmospheric song much like &quot;(Nice Dream),&quot; while &quot;Street Spirit&quot; is a brilliant closer with a much more negative tone musically.<br />As I said before, this album missed one star beacuse of the complete unoriginality of songs like &quot;Bones&quot; and &quot;Black Star.&quot; But if you ignore the few problems with this CD, you will find that this album changes tones often and makes you think, which is what Radiohead is best at. It may not be quite as melodic and original as &quot;OK Computer,&quot; but it IS far better than the new experimental stuff like &quot;Amnesiac,&quot; which features self-indulgent stuff that is far from entertaining.<br />Go ahead and buy this CD, but to fully appreciate the band, get &quot;OK Computer&quot; too (I have heard enough songs off that to know it's amazing). This great period from 1995-1997 was a period of maturity after &quot;Pablo Honey,&quot; but before the guys got cocky and overly artistic with &quot;Kid A.&quot;
6304765789|3.0|This is one interesting, thrilling film. It's definitley one of those films that you'll think about afterwards. Michael Douglas stars as a rich man(again?!), who is having his birthday. He's now at the age his father was when he comitted suicide. Sean Penn pops up as his brother, who offers him an interesting birthday present that needs him to play 'the game'. Before Michael knows it, the game is on and he doesn't know what's going on, what to do, or where to go. Along the way he hooks up with a waitress(Deborah Unger)who gets involved with him and this serious 'game'. There are twists and turns in this movie that are set up and executed very, very well. There are things that the audience won't expect. Douglas is very good when he gets to play icy millionaires. You can thank &quot;Wall Street&quot; for that. He is at his best here. Sean Penn does what he can with a pretty small role. Director David Fincher brings a moody, captivating presence to the film. This is a very good movie that will grab hold of your attention and not let it go until the very end.

If you have the time and patience to study a serious work of art, then this might be just the book for you.<br />I have to say that it took a lecture from one of my college professors at UNC-Chapel Hill to get me to like this book.  Until I fully understood the unique style Woolf uses to write this novel, I didn't appreciate it fully.  <br />If you take your time with this book (and you don't let yourself get frustrated), then you might fall in love with it as I have.
B00005O5JV|1.0|From the flip title which should offend people with or without visual impairment, to the interminable male-bashing, to the gratuitous overuse of four-letter words, this &quot;dumb blonde who's really smart&quot; mess of a movie stands out as one of the poorest big-name efforts in years. Even in the most surreal, over-the-top comedies there has to some grounding in reality and some cohesiveness in storytelling and character development. <BR>This picture needs to be re-edited so as to make it a satire of the kind of militant feminism which seeks to emasculate men and glorify women way beyond necessity. Reese Witherspoon's performance provides enough nuance for such a reworking.
0441008356|5.0|Reynold's first novel is a good start.  The language is well crafted, the ideas are unique, and the characters are intriguing.  Revelation Space, despite it's shortcomings, deserves to be on the Hugo ballot this year.
0441172717|5.0|But of course you have heard that this book is one of the greatest novels are imagined.  The truth is...it probably is one of the greatest novels are created in the twentieth century.  Only a few authors come to mind that could create their own worlds so stunningly, namely J.R.R Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, etc. <br />The story basically revolves around the boy Paul Atreides and his fight to achieve revenge for his father, Leto I.  Not only does his retribution include the despised Harkonnens, but also the Imperial family, the Corrinos.  The intricate plot line is further convoluted by the introduction of the principles of the major political parties in the story.  The Bene Gesserit, the Spacing Guild, etc. all have their own motives to secure a stake in the plantet of Arrakis.  The Fremen are another interesting group of people that have an elaborate cultural identity finely honed by their oppressive enviroment.  These are fierce warriors and stand up to the best soldiers in the galaxy.  Paul and his mother Jessica's introduction to them only go to make them a stronger race of people.  As loyalties change and the numerous characters are introduced it seems as though the plot line has too many tangents, but somehow Herbert deftly maneuvers them into an outstanding conclusion.  The novel is brillant in its complexity.  The only other book to my limited knowledge that emerges so adroitly is the classic Lord of the Rings.  <br />Herbert is a very skilled and imaginative writer, his writing style, while complex, enraptures the reader and makes the book pass with relative ease.  His scenic descriptions are excellent and his characterizations are no less than incredible.  Everything about this book rings classic, something no one should miss out on.  Excellent read, superb.
6300216209|5.0|Love Story was the 1st film I ever saw.  It was 1970, I was 6, and my parents took us to the drive in.  That may be one reason I like it so much, but I've seen it many times since and it's one of the few films I don't ever get bored watching.  The great soundtrack sets the atmosphere for the relation between Oliver and Jenny, 2 sophisticates at Harvard and Radcliffe who fall in love in the wintertime.  The ending set in New York City strikes an especially relevant chord post-Sept. 11th, when so many faced similar, but even worse circumstances.<br />  The general feel of the film is one of emotional intensity, and a slice of reality from 1970 in Manhattan and Massachusetts.
B000059ZLH|4.0|I have never seen these guys live, so this was the main reason why I purchased this dvd last night. I was blown away by just how great of musicians these guys are. John, Jordan, Myung, and Rudess are just godly. My favorite has to be John P. because even though the other guys are great, John steals the show with his technically blazing riffs and his mind-shattering solos. All the guys on one stage just blows the mind. The power and energy these guys create will never ever be recreated by any band. Oops... I almost forgot to mention James Labrie. He sounds great in this concert (unlike Once in a Livetime). He hits all his high notes with ease, and his vocals seem pretty strong and consistent throughout the entire three and a half hour show. The only complaint I have about the dvd is that the silly movie inserts during parts of the songs seem cheesy and just plain dumb. I would much rather be seeing the band play, rather than watching some losers who can't act. Anyways, at least we do get to see the band majority of the time. This dvd also includes over an hour of additional songs(not to mention the whole Scenes from a Memory album!). We get to see &quot;A Change of Seasons&quot; in its entire 25 minutes, which is just too awesome to explain. I give the dvd footage, sound, and the band 5 stars, but I have to take 1 star away due to the stupid movie clips. My advice is to drive to your local music store and purchase one of the greatest live videos ever!
B00000IOSU|5.0|At last, Sarah McLachlan has presented fans with a compilation of her (arguably) greatest works.  Recorded from a live concert, &quot;Mirrorball,&quot; comprises the artist's most well-known and recent songs (practically all of &quot;Surfacing&quot; can be found on the collection).  Surprisingly, some songs are better than her former recordings, such is the case with &quot;Building a Mystery,&quot; &quot;Hold On,&quot; and &quot;Fumbling Towards Ectasy.&quot;  Another sweet, and obviously heartfelt, addition is Ms. McLachlan's duet with her drummer and husband, Ashwin Sood, on &quot;Ice Cream.&quot;  However, noticingly missing are some of her more underrated classics, such as the songs from &quot;Touch&quot; and &quot;Solace&quot; - only the latter's &quot;Path of Thorns&quot; appears here.  But, if one does happen to be a fan of these tunes, the &quot;Mirrorball&quot; DVD could be for you, as it includes some of these songs, as well as some from the &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot; album.  But ultimately, from the opening to the end, listeners can join Sarah and her audience, both reminiscing like old friends over her stunning music, while anticipating the future tunes which this talented angel of music will choose to present to us mortals.

B000002B7M|5.0|Blizzard of Ozz is Ozzy's first solo release after the tension between him and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi hit the breaking point. Ozzy, down on his luck and devastated, moved on with the help of his future manager and wife, Sharon. Now, even 20 years later, the truth is this: Ozzy's decision to stay in music was perhaps the greatest decision anyone could make. Ever.<br />This album sees Ozzy kinda stepping out of the deep and gloomy sounds of Black Sabbath and entering into his own kind of musical form: faster, clearer and maybe even better. One of the things that makes this album special is the work of one Randy Rhoads, formerly of Quiet Riot. His guitar work his fast, his delivery is astounding and his ability is breathtaking. From the licks of &quot;Crazy Train&quot; to the classical sounds of the very excellent &quot;Revelation (Mother Earth)&quot; Rhoads never lets up.<br />The album starts with &quot;I Don't Know&quot; and &quot;Crazy Train&quot; which are good upbeat songs. Then, the album slows down with the beautiful &quot;Goodbye To Romance&quot;, which is Ozzy's goodbye to his life in Sabbath. Next comes &quot;Dee&quot; which is a short bit of Randy Rhoads simply playing guitar. Soft and very nice. The next three tracks, &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;, &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot;, and &quot;No Bone Movies&quot; are like the first two, demonstrating that Ozzy's vocals and Randy's guitar is was a match made in heaven. One of the most diverse songs he has done, &quot;Revelation (Mother Earth)&quot; is perhaps the best song on the album. Randy Rhoad's classical sound give the song an odd vibe, as if the the lyrics and the way Ozzy's sings them isn't enough. The album ends with &quot;Steal Away (The Night)&quot; which again, is an upbeat and rocking song.<br />If you are an Ozzy fan and you don't have this, it is a very good album and you will not be disappointed. If you are a metal fan looking into vintage metal, this is the album for you. But his second release &quot;Diary Of A Madman&quot; would be another good bet. If you, for whatever reason, do not like Ozzy, I pity you.
B000002WUD|5.0|The difference between Elvis'music of the seventies as opposed to his fifties/sixties work is the emotional scarring you hear in his seventies work.  This actually translates into a polished sound that cries out that, while he started the decade on track and with purpose, his life was unravelling again.  Priscilla had left him, he was touring Vegas again, and while that worked for him for a while, it soon became something he had to do more than he wanted to do.  Everything Elvis ever recorded sounded like he was singing just for you, but you can really hear the pain in his life on these tracks.  Walk A Mile In My Shoes proves wrong the argument that Elvis' seventies music lacked the importance or depth his previous work had.  He always connects when he sings, but this work is spectacular.  This is a &quot;must own&quot; for any Elvis fan who wants the complete picture of The King of Rock &amp; Roll.
B000002LRX|5.0|After probably a hundred listens to this album, it still amazes me everytime I hear it. I got this CD about a year and half ago and it's almost never left my player. I only wish that all the Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, and Linkin Park fans would give this record and spin and realize how amazing music can be. What's so great about it? It's the very mood that music creates. The brilliant lyrics and conhesiveness of the songs make this album probably the best rock album of the 90s for me. To call this rock is even an injustice. This record is beyond, simply beyond.
1878424319|1.0|My boss loaned me this book as a way of teaching me to be &quot;more professional&quot; on the job. I skimmed it and quickly settled on chapter 3: The Second Agreement, because my boss had referred to the principle of 'not taking things personally' so many times in our exchanges.<br />After closely reading just a few pages of this chapter, I was really quite appalled. How could someone touting wisdom (that word is even part of the book's subtitle) recommend that, &quot;Whatever people do, think, feel, or say, don't take it personally.&quot; Ruiz elaborates on this when he writes, &quot;...if you get mad at me, I know you are dealing with yourself.&quot;<br />Does the author mean for his readers to believe that whenever someone expresses displeasure regarding another person's behavior, it's really just old-fashioned 'projection'? If so, when I walk up to you and punch you in the face unexpectedly, your anger at my actions is really you &quot;dealing with yourself.&quot; <br />This is the kind of psycho-babble crap that encourages victimized people to remain in dysfunctional relationships OR, conversely, convinces arrogant or aggressive people to carry on without compassion or any regard for other people's feelings, because, as Ruiz puts it, nothing anyone says is &quot;because of you.&quot;<br />I'm glad that the world Ruiz describes is not part of my reality. A place where we have absolutely no effect on each other sounds very lonely and pointless to me.<br />Thanks for reading this review.
0743420373|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door does an excellent job of getting into the minds of millionaires. Upon finishing the novel, I found myself wondering about the affluence of people I know in different settings: my neighborhood, my place of employment, my temple, even my friends' families. If there was one thing I learned from the novel, it is that millionaires do not spend their money casually. \\"They live well bellow their means.\\" (10) They don't drive European luxury cars, wear Rolex's or even live in the biggest and most extravagant houses. They are smart with their money, living comfortably rather excessively. Millionaires often  choose to focus on putting their money towards investments and careful financial planning.<BR> This book offers many insights into how to become a millionaire. The strategies and understandings the authors provide hold much truth and make sense. I found \\"The Seven Factors,\\" listed on page 4-5, to be particularly insightful. Number seven states, \\"They chose the right occupation.\\" This was the factor I was particularly most interested in. What is that \\"right\\" occupation? What I have found through my reading, is that most millionaires have started from the bottom up. They are entrepreneurs who have started empires: drycleaners, contractors, owners of mobile-home parks. They are smart businessmen who are disciplined and make smart sacrifices. Overall, this novel is smart and interesting and easy to read and enjoy
B00004BZ0N|5.0|A strong case can me made that this is the greatest musical work ever. London Calling is a classic that will be played for generations to come along with the works of Wagner, Bach and Dylan.
B000002G7G|5.0|In the early 90's, I was in a tiny record shop, when I heard some very spare acoustic music over the shop's speakers.I inquired to the shop's clerk about, who was playing these beautiful solem songs. The clerk held up the cover to The Velvet Underground's self-titled album and it was the beginning of a wonderful discovery. Since that day, I have collected just about every piece of Velvet Underground music, I could get my hands on. I'm a little bias, because I am now of the personal opinion that the Velvets are probably one of the greatest rock n' roll bands, ever. No, they might not have sold a lot of albums during the sixties, but they are definitley, what the spirit of rock n'roll is all about. The self-titled album that, I first heard remains to this day, my all time favorite Velvets album.They certainly have other great albums. The album &quot;Loaded&quot; might have the pop hits and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; is full of punk energy. But to me, their mostly acoustic self-titled album is full of soul. This album is best played at 3am on a night you can't sleep and you feel like your the only person in the world awake. It is in these moments, that it is so comforting to hear spare songs like &quot;Candy Says&quot;, &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; or the brilliant intoning of the song &quot;Jesus&quot;. The more energetic rock songs are also fantastic, including &quot;What goes On&quot; and &quot;Beginning to See the Light&quot;. I epecially like drummer, Moe Tucker's humourus and innocous reading of the song &quot;After Hours&quot;, which is sort of a little night cap before you go off to bed. Buy this album! It will be one of the best pieces of rock n' roll in your music collection!
B0000025JT|5.0|Barbra's voice on this album reminds us that no matter what others Diva comes along such as Whitney,Mariah,Celine,Madonna and Britney just don't have the capability to inject and a unique kind of projection of singing style of Barbra. She is just simply the best there is, no comparisons whatsoever. The music and lyrics on this wonderful album is just mesmerising indeeed!. She is the true DIVA of all divas. She holds the record for being the highest female recording artist ever. Bravo Barbra for making music that makes us happy and so much inspirations. THANK YOU
B000035P7X|5.0|When we look back at the sixties, we understand that the important things that happened in that decade had very little to do with music. It was the artists who were important. The effectiveness of mass media, television and movies made it possible for artists to reach a whole world of fans - not only with their music, but with their attitudes and thoughts.  Bob Dylan new this, and he was one of the first artist to really take the full advantage of it. His arrogant attitude, his clothes, his style, his songs which he knew that millions of fans were listening to - all that were instruments or weapons he could use to express his opinions in a time of political scandals and cheap entertainment. - This move is one of the most interesting documents from the sixties, and also an entertaining study of the most important artist in the sixties: Dylan. As a bonus, there are in fact a couple of great musical performances by Dylan here, too. I just love the man and his music! [...]
B000002UCQ|5.0|When I awoke to the news that George Harrison died yesterday(11/29/01)I felt compelled to pull out both Beatles albums as well as George's solo albums.  Of course, this collection-his first major solo effort-All Things Must Pass-still stands as a true classic today with it's timeless songs.  What a body of work this man has left behind-whether as a musician, movie producer or humanitarian.  For anyone that has yet to catch onto George's solo music-this set is a great way to get started.  Very highly recommended.
B00002SWEM|4.0|It's great to hear Ry Cooder with such fresh and real musicians as on this music documentary. The performances are mostly improvised, and there are moments of magic here. However, as a documentary I don't like the chopped up story and sometimes random order of scenes. The lack of a real, interesting story is evident. OK, we follow the Buena Vista Social Club on their way to stardom, but we do not really get as close to them as we would like. The documentary would have needed a better script. But I'm grateful that this valuable music project has been documented, and seing and hearing Ry Cooder and his talented son (on drums) is great! [...]
0385505833|5.0|This is a well crafted movie script disguised as a book.  Grisham is terrific in this one from start to finish.  I couldnt put this book down.  It has real meaning to me and it rightly illustrates the cynicism in many of us about the Holidays.  To me it asks the question &quot;Why do we celebrate Christmas?&quot;.  Is it about the rituals (some mind numbingly stupid, some actually fun), the spoiled kids, Christ's Birthday?.  I like the message:  Forgoe your own self interests and make somebodys world a brighter place.  I am going to try to do that myself this year.  Thanks Mr. Grisham for your sermon.
B00005LB9O|5.0|This Scottish CD hit #1 on The UK album chart..and they have places several singles in the Top 20 over there as well..they have only gained exposure on college and some modern rock stations here in the US ..its a shame and injustice that they have not been as successful here in the states ..they make such good pop songs with a lush ,melconholy feel to them..I was surprised to see their video &quot;Side&quot; fr their current CD on VH-1 over the Thanksgiving weekend but it was like 5 am when they aired it..I almost started crying while listening the Cd recently because the songs are so beautifully crafted and felt grateful to be a witness of such great pop music..!! Buy the CD u will not be disappointed(well depending your musical taste)
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is a one of a kind. All her albums are beautiful, her music takes you to magical places. Just when you thought you had a favorite enya cd, she comes out with &quot;a day without rain&quot; and blows her fans away. She must have her wings well hidden because she must surely be an angel.
B00005N9CV|1.0|OK, I admit it. I bought the album for its cover. For insomniacs this is great therapy. Diana almost seems bored on these tracks, and the highlights come from the accompanying orchestration. Because of other reviews, I am going to buy some of her earlier works &amp; give it a listen. If she was not a looker, would you buy this cd?
B00005QIPH|4.0|It isn't difficult for critics to dub a band one of the next great things to happen in music when the band sounds like something that's already worked before.  The Stroke's album, &quot;Is this it?&quot; is very reminiscent of early Velvet Underground (i.e. White Light White Heat and The Velvet Underground and Nico), early Iggy Pop, and a great deal of underproduced glam rock.  That's quite obvious and has already been well noted. This isn't to say however that the album they've made isn't wonderful.  It is. The Strokes seem to have no qualms about wearing their influences on their shoulders.  They don't try to tweek things to make them sound new and original.  They just rock out on the album's eleven tracks and focus on making good music.  From the first track to the last the songwriting is impeccable; the bass lines are tight; the guitar riffs are catchy; and the lyrics will stay in your head for days.  This is a pop record in the grungiest sense of the word and definitley well worth listening too, but don't expect innovation, expect to feel transported back in time to an age where music was excellent.
0060926317|3.0|Mutant Message Down Under is a book of many facets.  Regardless of how much is true, (and which, by the way, I feel is not the point of the book) the message has a universal approach and one that should be read with an open mind.<br />Author Marlo Morgan's story of her journey across the Australian Outback seems unbelievable at first.  Why would a tribe of Aborigines specifically select Ms. Morgan for this journey?  What makes her so special?  Also, it is hard to imagine a woman from a large U.S. city, dressed to the nines and getting excited for what she thinks is an award presentation for her civic work with half-breed Aborigines, then realizing her &quot;award&quot; is a 4-month long walkabout with The Real People -- and accepting this fate so readily!!  Eating bugs and tadpoles seems second nature to Marlo Morgan -- Survivor contestants would have nothing on her!<br />But Mutant Message is more than just this outrageous walk across the desert.  The Real People have something to say, and they have chosen Marlo Morgan as their vehicle to spread the word.  While I'm not sure if I agree with everything these Aborigines have said, there are several things that make good sense, regardless of how much into the controversy a person is.  Living life simply, but honestly; not putting too much importance into material things; harboring bad feelings or grudges instead of just closing the circle and moving on -- these are all wonderful life lessons that would make us all better people if only we could do them.<br />In my opinion, Mutant Message is not a full-on masterpiece; the writing mostly reads like a National Geographic article.  However, peel away the scientificness and controversy, as well as all the things that seems unreal or fiction, and what you would have left is this beautiful message about life, all living things, and how we are all one people.  Certainly this message needs to be heard.
6304698542|4.0|This film is a masterpiece of modern musical theatre film.  Fosse's work from camera angles to lighting and choreography is simply perfection.  Minnelli, Grey and York are all excellent in their roles, and Kander and Ebb's songs add so much to each plot development, unlike other movie musicals, where the songs just seemed tacked on as an excuse for some singing and dancing.<br />The DVD contains a mini-documentary on the making of the film as well as the original theatrical trailer and interviews with all the stars, producers and staff involved (except Fosse).  The remastering of the film is beautiful..the colors look better than ever and the sound is excellent.<br />Unfortunately, Fosse died in 1987 and somehow, without his commentary the DVD extras seem to be missing something.  More time should have been spent in the extras on his life and his thoughts on the film.  I've read several Fosse biographies and there's plenty of material out there that could been placed on the DVD.<br />This was my first ever DVD, and while I am happy with the quality of the picture itself, the extras seem a bit tacked on and not incredibly illuminating.  Just scratching the surface of DVD potential really.
B000002UAF|5.0|At a time when just about every pop star of the moment was starring in a movie, The Beatles appeared in a film that was not only genuinely good, but was filled with some of the best pop music of the day.  This album represents the latter.<br />A HARD DAY'S NIGHT also marks the first time The Beatles released an album made up entirely of original material.  It didn't hurt that the songs included were some of their best up to that point.<br />Paul McCartney's romanticism was used to what is arguably its best-ever effect on &quot;And I Love Her&quot; and &quot;Things We Said Today&quot;, both of which appear on this album.  Likewise, John Lennon turns in similarly sincere performances with &quot;If I Fell&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;.  There are no weak tracks at all on this album, in fact.<br />The general mood of this record is jubilant, from the opening chord of the title track, through such songs as &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;.  For music to lift the spirits, this is definitely the Beatles album of choice.<br />Get the DVD of the movie, too.
0812550706|5.0|Before reading Ender's Game I had heard quite a lot of great things about it.  So much that it would be hard for any book to live up to the expectations I had set.  Nonetheless, the book was all I had heard and more.  The characters were very well developed, which is something that is not easily found in the science fiction genre, and the story was so fascinating that I couldn't put the book down.  A brief overview of the plot doesn't do the book any justice; there are so many little events that keep the plot flowing and exciting that are more important.  The way that Ender interacts and deals with problems is remarkable, and takes the story away from being too science fiction-y.  The book depicts how people can be manipulated into roles that they don't necessarily want to be in.  I was worried more about Ender's moral attitude and decisions than I was about the aliens that were going to kill the human race.<BR>     I recommend this book to anyone who likes the ideas of science fiction, but doesn't like the whole plot of the book to revolve around those ideas.  The futuristic setting, alien battles, and space-age technology found in Ender's Game only accent a really brilliant character driven story.  Definitely read this book.
B000002UAI|5.0|As others have pointed out, the mood on this album is not as upbeat as it had been previously.  However, the music was continuing to evolve.<br />The opening track, &quot;No Reply&quot;, is the highlight of the whole album for me personally.  Musically, it is interesting, but it is through the lyrics that I am most touched.  The rhyme scheme is more complex than anything that I am aware of in pop music up to that point (November, 1964).  There are couplets followed by rhymes that do not resolve until the next verse (&quot;This happened once before/When I came to your door/No reply.&quot; in the first verse and &quot;I tried to telephone/They said you were not home/That's a lie.&quot; in the second).  Meaty stuff.<br />The other originals are also good, with John Lennon's darker material dominating the album.  Other highlights include &quot;I Don't Want to Spoil the Party&quot;, &quot;Baby's in Black&quot;, &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;, &quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot;, and &quot;I'm a Loser&quot;.  <br />Don't overlook this one.
B000002UA9|5.0|This is the one that launched the recording careers of four young men from Liverpool.  It was recorded and mixed in a single session early in 1963 because EMI Records lacked the confidence in the group to spend more money on session time.  That was never to be the case again.<br />The recording is, even compared to others of the time, raw.  However, that is part of its charm.  The determination to do what they do before they were idolized by millions around the world is evident and, in its own way, exciting.<br />The songs are good, although certainly not their best (it really is almost impossible to review this album independent of those that followed it).  &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and the title track (already out as a single when the album was released) are, for my money, the best in the lot.  <br />This is not only a good album, but provides an interesting perspective on four guys who, within just a few years, would literally change the world, although no one knew it at the time.
B000002UAC|5.0|With this album, their second, The Beatles adopted a practice that they would revisit time and again throughout their career.  They released the LP with no advance single (in fact, the single released simultaneously with the LP, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, was not to appear on a British LP for three years).  This not only showed a respect for their audience, but a certain degree of confidence in their material.<br />In fact, this album is much more polished than its predecessor and contains far more interesting material.  Songs such as &quot;All My Loving&quot;, &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;, and &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot; (the first-ever recording of a George Harrison composition) establish this as a great album not only for its day and give very definite signs of the level of greatness that the group would later enjoy.<br />It is worth noting that between the release of PLEASE PLEASE ME and WITH THE BEATLES (in the spring and fall of 1963, respectively) that The Beatles released two other original singles (&quot;From Me To You&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;), both of which went to Number One.  Quality and quantity were becoming their hallmarks even at this early stage.<br />Great cover photo, too.
B00004XPP0|5.0|Baby Boomers gotta have the Box Set.  Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, Yoda, Obi Wan, Han, everbody looks much better digitally remastered.  It is part of &quot;Our Generation.&quot;  You simply must own this set.  It is a part of our heritage.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I just can't say enough about this DVD. The sound is utterly incredible, and the filming is beautifully done.<br />I couldn't imagine how anyone would not enjoy this Talking Heads' DVD. The energy from all the musicians is obvious, and their love of playing is what transcends the Talking Heads from just a good band to a great live ensemble of performers. It's obvious that they enjoy entertaining the audience. I absolutely love this DVD.<br />It's infectious. I found myself watching this DVD three times in just one week. That's not something I typically do, but, the energy is so invigorating, I'm drawn back to it.<br />Stop Making Sense is an absolute must have for any music lover.
B000002UCN|4.0|To start, today is the day George Harrison dies, (...)He will be missed.<br />(...)<br />Now on to this album review. A number of reviewers have complained about the slew of Beatles songs on this collection. I guess they felt he had enough material to warrant a retrospective of his solo material back in 1976. Me, I'm too young to remember the early seventies as I was born a year after the Beatles broke up, but the way I see it, this is a great collection. I know of no great pre-1976 Harrison songs that did not make this collection and really most of the great Beatles Harrison songs are on it as well. In fact, it's nearly a perfect pre-1976 Harrison collection for my money. For the casual fan, I think you'll be very pleased with this collection.
0753107058|5.0|I do despise the whole concept of books on audio, primarily because the reader almost never matches my concept of a book's narrative voice.  (Elliott Gould's comatose renderings of Phillip Marlowe, as an extreme example, make me want to &quot;hurl my lunch over the fence,&quot; to borrow a phrase from Raymond Chandler.)<br />And so I was in no way prepared for William Dufris' reading of Hammett's grossly underrated &quot;Red Harvest&quot;; Dufris caught me completely by surprise with his sure sense of pacing as well as his deftness in shifting from character to character in his voicings without resorting to caricature.<br />Most importantly, however, there's the sheer insightfulness he brings to his reading: For all the times I've reread this novel, I had never been quite able to figure out the Continental Op's true motivation behind his instigation of what leads to wholesale carnage.  Dufris, in his delivery of one key line in the first third of the story, crystallizes the man's motive. (And no, I'm not going to tell you the line; listen to this superb reading for yourself.)<br />So yes, I hate books on audio . . .  but here's one I'll readily listen to time and again.  I definitely recommend it, particularly to anyone who has previously read the novel.  It's an eye (and ear) opener!
B00005QXXO|5.0|beautiful. radiohead live is a costly and moving experience. for people who were not fortunate enough to snag tickets to the recent tour or for those who want to relive some of the magic, like myself, this is a good ep to pick up. <br />radiohead put their best, new live songs on this album. now i would say old classics like paranopid android and talk show host are the best live songs, but out of the new ones from kid a and amnesiac, radiohead has chosen the best. <br />the inclusion of the live version of spinning plates was a genius move, as usual, by thom and the group. a weaker track on the amnesiac studio album, this song is brought to light in its full potential as a beautiful piano ballad. also included on this album is the first official release of true love waits. though it is not a studio track, it is a nice live rendition of this fan favorite. true love waits is a great way to end the album with thom saying &quot;good night.&quot;<br />dollars and cents is also a track overlooked a lot of amnesiac, but thom seems to bring people around by whipping out &quot;crack your little souls&quot; and showing the true energy of this song. national anthem did a great job kicking off the shows on this years tour with high energy and continues to serve that purpose on this album. morning bell is also a little gem that just sounds so tight and refreshing on this album and idioteque proves itself as one of the most popular live songs. <br />well worth the money, this album is a must have for radiohead fans.
0060934913|5.0|While my death row menu would include blood sausage, sauteed sweetbreads and steak tartare, you don't have too to be a food freak to enjoy this book.

B00005QZWJ|2.0|The music is only fair, a tad bit uninspired in a few places at best.  The majesty and archaic grandeur of Tolkien's masterpiece has been sucked dry by this all too average musical rendering.<BR>    A far better choice for the music for this film would have been the German rock band Blind Guardian, who are notorious for basing their music upon all of Tolkien's works, not just &quot;The Lord Of The Rings.&quot;  Take for instance some songs: &quot;Journey Through The Dark,&quot; (same subject as the comparable track on this disc), &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; (would have made a great opening sequence, based around the little poem inscripted on the Ring), and countless other tunes.<BR>    The director and all the publicity folks for this flick goofed up big-time.
B00000064G|5.0|I know that's an oxymoron, but don't harmonious contradictions make life so interesting?  Nick Drake's &quot;Pink Moon&quot; is pleasantly melancholy, perfect for a lonely rainy day, when you have time to reflect on your own life and feel sadness and joy at the same time.  Mr. Drake not only teaches you to feel two counter emotions at the same time, but he also teaches you to enjoy it.
0783114893|5.0|I never saw this DVD, but I watch this movie in the Cinema. The movie is simple but effective! Rutger Hauer was superb. Unfortunetly this actor appears in few good movies like Blade Runner and this one. This is a great actor but not well credited. Unfortunetly he's getting old. (Not 4 years life span).
B00003CXZ4|5.0|you rent a DVD, and then wish you would have saved your money, bought the DVD, and were able to watch it more than once?  To go back to it, savor it, catch all the nuances and the beauty of the performances (or in the case of Memento, the editing!) and truly experience the film.<br />Well, Memento is one of &quot;those&quot;.  80% of the movie is being caught up in trying to figure out what is going on, so I won't give any more details about the sad fate of Leonard (&quot;Please don't call me Lenny&quot;) Shelby, an insurance investigator, who needs to use all his investigative and intellectual skills to survive after a brutal tragedy claims the life of his wife.<br />Beautifully filmed and written, with a fine performance by Guy Pearce, and a great supporting actor role by a Polaroid camera...<br />(seriously, a terrific job by Joey &quot;Pants&quot; as a sleazy sidekick; you'll loathe him even more than in the Sopranos)!  The movie is an intense experience in filmmaking and film watching!  Special features on the DVD are also more than worth a review, and, as another reviewer advised, the film is best to watch with a group of people who will take it apart after the incredibly well-done ending.<br />See it over and over, if you wish.  Buy the DVD!!!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I admit that The Motion Picture is not the best offering of the classic Trek movies.  However, it did relauch the franchise.  I was thrilled by the alterations in the audio (adding echoing to certain scenes, reworking certain ship sounds, replacing the obnoxious mechinical computer voice for red alerts and announcements over the PA) and new visual scenes.  When the Enterprise blows up the asteroid in the worm hole, you get a whole new view, as well many others.  Also, the video looks to have been enhanced to bring out more detail.  I've heard that Paramount is considering reworking all of the clasic Trek films with similar upgrades.  I sincerely hope they do so.  Just as this movie relauched the franchise, this DVD relaunches this movie.  I'll watch it more often now.  Hope you will too.
B00003CXTF|3.0|This film is not historically correct and too patriotic in my view, but has some nice special effects.
B00005214X|5.0|A fitting title for a somber day.  I've been a Beatles fan my entire life, but the solo careers of the ex-Beatles always seemed very spotty.  I'd been wanting to buy this album for years, especially since every critic claims it to be the best post-Beatles album.  Well, they're right.  I bought it last night in honor of George's passing (it seemed the best thing I could do).  I must say, I was thoroughly unprepared for the epic greatness of this album.  But I suppose it makes sense.  For years, George had been relegated to junior member of the Beatles, with two songs an album.  Released the following year of the breakup, All Things Must Pass is the product of Georges talents come to a boiling point through the Beatle years and now bubbling over in a 3 LP album.  The only thing more striking than the wealth of material is the astounding quality.  I have no problem saying that every song on this long album is a winner.  I think you're hard pressed to make such a statement over one of John, Paul, or Ringo's solo efforts.  Sure, John and Paul's first solo efforts are probably their best, but they still contain a few stinkers.  All Things Must Pass does not succumb to the same fate.  This re-mastered version is a must have for all Beatles fans who never picked up the album like me.  It is like stumbling on a wealth of new high quality songs.  Many are holdovers from as far back as the White album sessions.  The band George assembled for this project is no more than a supergroup, and the tight playing shows, especially in the four original jams which comprise the end third of the album.  As a Beatles fan, I was always a littled bummed that there are hardly any long instrumental solos or jams on any Beatles records.  Here, you get almost 40 minutes of some of the tightest, rocking instrumental jam sessions you will ever hear, and the crisp re-mixing surely does these instrumental workouts extreme justice.  This is truly the best post Beatles album by an ex Beatle, and anyone mourning George's passing would do him or herself well by purchasing it and experiencing George's vision of peace, love, and the search for spirituality.  While playing the the album last night, I found great happiness knowing I was not alone in listening to such brilliance.
0375703764|5.0|I can't stand it when people dismiss the House of Leaves as a mere novel, or an unconventional plot/approach to story telling, or nothing more than incoherent scraps thrown together and labeled a book.  The House of Leaves is eons ahead of our time. <br />The book is a work of genius.  Sure, the surface is composed of squigly lines, hopping storylines, and unconventionally printed pages, but this book requires a deeper understanding.  Despite what everyone says about random thoughts thrown in here and there, I really believe that Danielewski wrote his book with the principle of logographic neccessity in mind...or that principle in which every word is in its right place, at the right time, in the right way.<br />Is it fair for one to write off a book as a waste of time, because things just dont seem to fit?  I dont think so. House of Leaves is not an easy read.  In order to fully comprehend its scope, and the amazing talent of Danielewski, it's imperative that it be studied.  I guess that sounds pretty ridiculous, considering how this book is meant as a means of entertainment...but the book raises serious issues,like perspectives on things, the nature of things (ie, the house, the characters, the text), and the purpose of it all.<br />Read this book. Study It. Make it your bible. Danielewski has great things to say.
0345451325|4.0|This book is one of the best books I have read.  It's got everything that a great sci-fi book needs, action, adventure, struggle, and that one hero who steps up to face the odds.<br />The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because it reminds me too much of Ender's Game (my all-time favorite book).  The one boy carried away from his life, trained to fight and command, this person to save the human race from an insect-like alien race bent on destroying them.  Even the A.I., Cortana, is like Ender's Game's Jane, not just merely a computer program, but something more.  But that's not a bad thing.  That's what made Ender's Game so enjoyable.  Minus 1 star for either MINOR unoriginality or MINOR coincidence.  Wither way, it's one book you shouldn't miss.

B000000H4V|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Sepultura or even death metal for that fact.  I only know of a few bands because a couple of my friends are into the harder thrash stuff.  I've heard some of Sepultura's stuff and I particularly disliked them mainly for their cover of Black Sabbath's Symptom Of The Universe.  It was ok for how they did it but I just couldnt seem to dig it.  And I'm not one of them people who think a cover should sound like the original, then it wouldnt be really a cover.  But anyway, we were playing the Xbox and on the soundtrack I heard The Hunt.  I really enjoyed the song.  The vocals and the music had an interesting mix and I thought that it was rather inovative.  Not a lot of bands could mix the growley vocals with hard music with the exception of Pantera.  I'm not going to say that this cd got me hooked on Sepultura but it did make me like them and it showed me that they know what they're doing.  Tracks to look for are Biotech is Godzilla, The Hunt and Refuse Resist.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|Ryan Adams' newest album &quot;Gold&quot; shows many signs of unpresidented genius. There are songs on this album that will touch your heart, raise your eyebrows and have you coming back for seconds and thirds.  There is a addictive element inherent in his music that is almost hypnotic, but the album as a whole is entirely inconsistant.<BR>There are 16 songs on this album and it is about 7 songs to many. I like an album to flow, I like to be able to listen to an album in its entirety without skipping song after song. Unfortunately, this is not possible on &quot;Gold.&quot; In many of his anthems, song lyrics become redundant, whiney, and drag on far to long.<BR>If Adams were to eliminate 7 tracks from this album(8-12 &amp; 14-15), it would surely be a 4 star album and a worthy choice for album of the year.  I just find it strange how sometimes talented singers dont know when to stop. Instead of polishing albums off, Adams is pounding albums out. Over the course of two years he has made 3 albums(One with Whiskeytown). At some point you would think quality would be more important then quantity and until Ryan Adams learns this lesson, he will never be among the elite. <BR>Overall, I would purchase this album for its masterpieces, such as, &quot;Firecracker&quot;, &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot;, &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot;, and &quot;Harder Now That Its Over.&quot;
B000002KFJ|5.0|When I picked up the cassette I had only heard stuff from Black Sabbath, Paranoid, and Master Of Reality.  So when I first popped it in the opening riff to Hole In The Sky blew me a way.  The lyrics are top rate for this album and the music is the heaviest sounding with Ozzy.  The first 3 songs really kick you into this album.  Starting with Hole In The Sky then going into a great yet too short instumental Dont Start Too Late, then going right into the classic Symptom Of The Universe.  Everything on the album is agressive and solid and Ozzy's vocals round up the sound and really are what brings it all together.  To point out the bad points of the album besides the cover would have to be the song Am I Going Insane?  Now dont get me wrong, this is a great song, but it's like one of the songs that Sabbath did then that make you say to yourself 'what the hell were they thinking?'  A good example is FX on Vol. 4.  But overall this is Sabbath at it's peak with Ozzy and the best they material the band would record until Heaven And Hell (post Ozzy).  I recoment this to anyone and everyone.  If your a Sabbath fan and you dont have this album for some odd reason then get it right now, you wont be disappointed.
0140185232|4.0|...how does your garden grow? For me, the book is about peace, or more specifically inner peace, and how different people choose to approach their ideas of inner peace and equilibrium. I think it's interesting how Maugham concludes by saying that all of the characters achieved a sort of happiness in their own ways. But wow... the diverse ways they did so! I thought it was really innovative how Maugham included himself in the story, as the ubiquitous confidante.<br />Of course, Larry is the pivot, the hinge character. Everyone has to come to one or another conclusion about Larry... but he is not obligated to do so in return. He is indifferent to the pursuits of others, yet everyone is concerned with Larry's pursuits. Isn't it interesting how that while everyone seems to be so involved in evaluating Larry's stability and sanity, he remains the most stable and sane of them all? While lives are undulating... Larry has, for the most part, spent the decade on an even keel. Others are gasping, he is sighing. And nothing seems to sway Larry's convictions about what is really important in life. I think this is the quality that makes him admirable. Success or failure will not determine Larry's sense of purpose and meaning. (Larry himself admits in his final talk with the narrator that he really hasn't found the ultimate ANSWER to his original quest of unravelling the nature of evil in the world. No, in the end he concludes basically that perhaps &quot;the values we cherish in the world can only exist in combination with evil.&quot; Perhaps all we can really do is &quot;make the best of it.&quot;) Rather than actually &quot;changing the world&quot; he thinks that he may be at least able to create &quot;a ripple effect&quot; like a stone thrown into the water. The true GREATNESS of Larry is his strength of inner conviction and achievement of peace regardless of outward cost and opinion of others in the process.<br />At any rate... I have one question that I believe we as readers can ask ourselves that will point out our true reaction to meeting Maugham's Larry in The Razor's Edge, and the question is this: If dear darling Isabel were our niece, or our daughter... how would we counsel her, if she were faced with the option of marrying either Larry or Gray? (knowing what we knew of each of these characters in the earlier part of the book). I think it's a good question. Would we encourage her to consider the man who was perhaps less earthly ambitious, but who was asking the BIG questions of his world... or would we encourage her to &quot;go for the money&quot; and latch onto the man who seemed to have nowhere's to go but UP... especially when we were conscious of the fact that her own heart's desire, indeed, her true love, was for the former man! I haven't read any other books by Maugham but this one inspires me to do so. I appreciated his straightforward style.s can ask ourselves that will point out our true reaction to meeting Maugham's Larry in The Razor's Edge, and the question is this: If dear darling Isabel were our niece, or our daughter... how would we counsel her, if she were faced with the option of marrying either Larry or Gray?

We have all been caught many times wandering around mumbling, -&quot;Is your mama a llama?&quot; I asked my friend Dave.- in a singsongy rhythm.  I just wish the author and illustrator would get together again and write more books, because their work together is a beautiful marriage of art in both the visual and written mediums.

6302293553|5.0|I'm trying not to gush here. I know I've said that before, but I am a girl with a thing for dead parrots. (...) I think that anyone who doesn't like the film must have something wrong with them. Who cares about the plot? It's the Pythons, for heaven's sake, of course it won't make sense! For fans only! Hah! I was weaned from Saturday Night Live on this stuff! This film is the reason I became a fan! I can't really review the plot here, as the film's really not got one. It's supposed to be about King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Then it becomes somewhat of a cross between a Python episode, and T.H. White's \\"the Once and Future King\\". Funny, yet, all the same, staying true to its theme of King Arthur and the Knights of the round table. \\"Between our quests, we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable\\"...
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is a brilliant film made for an unbelieveably small amount of money.  Now the Pythons have spent a bit more money to make it much more enjoyable.  If you should tire of the movie after the first million playings, just pop in the extras DVD.  One mistake I made was purchasing the wrong edition, and from looking at other reviews, I was not the only one. Make sure it is the Special Edition.  Not only do you get all of the wonderful extras, the quality of both the film itself and the audio are quite worth the couple extra bucks.  The only complaint I have (and it is a minor one) is that they don't use a map to show you where they are while they take you on a tour of the castles used in the film.  Otherwise, there is plenty to keep even the most casual fan of Monty Python happy for hours.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Okay- First, this movie was surpassed by its own hype machine. People expected so much out of it because of all the pre-release hype. That said, this movie does not live up to all expectations, but it is an enjoyable look at the Jedi in their prime. The 2-Disc set with exclusive Episode 2 footage is well worth the purchase price. If only you could delete Jar-Jar or see the final Duel un-cut.
B00005CDNK|5.0|The Visitors is Abba's final album, enhanced in this edition with some of their last recordings from 1982. It did not follow Abba The Album as previously written by someone (The Album was released in late 77; Abba released their disco-LP Voulez-Vous in 1979 and their masterpiece Super Trouper in 1980 before The Visitors saw the light of day in Decembre 1981). So The Visitors is the last complete album before the band fell apart. You can tell that from the sleeve picture (which doesn't especially show a sense of unity) and also from the fact that for the very first time in Abba's history, every song had solo parts clearly given to a specific band member. Those who expect to find the joyous sound of Dancing Queen will be disappointed : the overall atmosphere is quite dark, the style of the album hesitates between electronic new wave (a style even more obvious on the 1982 recordings) and a classical style which shows the direction for Benny &amp; Bjrn's carreer as musical composers (Chess was released in 1984). It contains some of the lesser known singles of the group : The Visitors, When All Is Said And Done (with lyrics hinting at Frida &amp; Benny's recent divorce), The Day Before You Came (their very last recording) : all are masterpieces in my opinion. About the bonus tracks : Should I Laugh Or Cry is from 1981, an excellent song then only released as a 7&quot; B-side. The others are taken from the two late-1982 singles. To be complete, the CD should have included You Owe Me One (the B-side to Under Attack, Bjrn &amp; Benny reportedly hate the song), I Am The City (recorded in 82, unreleased until it was included on More Abba Gold in 93) and also Just Like That - which Bjrn &amp; Benny unfairly consider as an unfinished song (it was eventually changed and given to the B&amp;B produced project Gemini in 1985).

B00005QZWI|5.0|I have to admit, I have high expectations of a soundtrack for a movie based on such a literary treasure.  I was also a bit dissapointed that John Williams wasn't doing the score for this movie-at first.  Fortunately I was more than pleasantly surprised by this soundtrack.  Not only does the music live up to Tolkien's great story, but Shore convinced me that Williams isn't the only amazing soundtrack creator out there.  To me a good soundtrack not only flows along with the story, but it compliments the story itself.  Both of these elements were true throughout the score.  As I listened to the music, even the first time, I knew who/what/when/where the different pieces and themes referred to. The vocals were very powerful, with elven lyrics based on Tolkien's linguistic creations and poetry.  I found Enya's ethereal, magical voice the perfect accompaniment for this fantasy score.  The CD came with a beautiful collectible photo card, there were several versions to chose from including Frodo, Arwen, Bilbo, Saruman, Gandalf, Aragorn, and Merry/Pippin/Frodo/Sam together and an insert listing lyrics and translations. Overall this has become one of my all time favorite soundtracks.  Its an essential for any collection and just plain enjoyable to listen to!
B000002UZ1|5.0|The Beatles 2nd half of their phenomenal career are represented here with their hits from the experimental late 60's and their final songs prior to their 1970 breakup. Notably, George Harrison's work really surfaced just prior to The Breakup....While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Old Brown Shoe, Here Comes The Sun, and my favorite....Something. John Lennon and George Harrison are gone now, but the Fab 4's music will endure for eternity....they still are the greatest band in history!
B00005QDW5|5.0|I've noticed a number of people complaining about this album, but would like to say something. Before this album I had barely heard anything by Pink Floyd. I got this album three weeks ago.<BR>If you don't know if you like a band you don't want to just pick one album from one period of their development to sample. You need a broad overview to show you what they are and what they were. This album is a fantastic way to introduce the band to a whole new generation. I don't know what all the old fans are moaning about, because surely they have all this music anyway. Since buying this album I have also got 'Animals' 'The Wall' 'Wish you were here' 'Momentary lapse of reason' 'Divison Bell' and 'Delicate sound of thunder'. This was one of the greatest bands of all time, and buying 'Echoes' has changed my life (I know that sounds corny!). So anyone who is feeling like maybe giving Pink Floyd a chance, don't be put off by what you may read or hear, this album is a great place to start. But trust me, if you're anything like me you won't be able to stop with just this one album!!!

B00004RYZT|5.0|First off, this is a great DVD for any Rammstein fan.  It captures the excitement of the band live, which I can say is quite similar to the real experience.  I would like to correct a couple of statements in earlier reviews.  Du hast is not &quot;you hate&quot; it is &quot;you have&quot; and it is a song about choosing between friends or a woman.  Also heirate mich is marry me, in which the lyrics plead with a girl to marry.  Awesome pyrotechnics!
B00005NWM3|1.0|Don't buy this or any other CD by Nickelback. They are a horrible band with horrible songs, horrible 'music', and trite lyrics. You'd be better off dousing your head in acid then listening to this (Nickel)(...).

B00005MIZ5|5.0|This is the second installment of Thelonious Monk on Blue Note, recorded 4 years after Genius of Modern Music Volume 1.  Though it doesn't feature as many of the pianist's most famous compositions as Volume 1, it has several things going for it.  The sidemen are much, much better here -- Monk and vibraphonist Milt Jackson play very well together, while Sahib Shihab and Art  Blakey &quot;get&quot; Monk's ideas much better than they did on Volume 1.  (Listen to Blakey's rim shots on the intro to &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot; -- awesome!)  The second half of the CD features Max Roach and two up-and-coming stars -- alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson and underrated trumpeter Kenny Dorham.  The compositions aren't Monk's most popular (except for &quot;Straight No Chaser&quot;), but contain quite a few lost classics: &quot;Criss Cross&quot;, &quot;Four in One&quot;, &quot;Eronel&quot;, and &quot;Skippy&quot;.  There's also a beautiful reading of the standard &quot;Willow Weep for Me&quot;.  I actually prefer The Thelonious Monk Trio (on Prestige/Fantasy) over this CD, but this is still classic early Monk.  And if you like this music, get the RVG remaster of Volume 1 too.<br />By the way, there's a mistake in the CD case track listing and consequently on this site: track 7 is not &quot;Nice Work if You Can Get It&quot; but rather an alternate take of &quot;Four in One&quot;.
B00004Z459|4.0|I'm not really big into the hard rock/rap hybrid genre and probably never would have bought this CD if I hadn't seen Linkin Park on the Family Values Tour.  They really stold the show!  They were energetic and fresh and really had their own unique spin on the type of music they produce.  So I bought the CD and was happy I did.  They actually have talent and the songs have thought behind them - lyrically and musically - and the record is well produced.  I definitely think they have some staying power.

The plot is so captivating and the characters so lovable that after reading River God you will want to immediately buy The Seventh Scroll and Warlock to finish the series.
6305609721|5.0|For many fans, even my mom and I, this is a good entry in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies! It is very entertaining, and the crew of the Enterprise bring out some good laughs with this movie! Within the 23rd century, Earth falls under attack by an alien probe that is trying to find information about the extinct species called humpback whales. With time sort of running out Admiral Kirk and his crew time-travel back to the late 20th century to save the 2 known living humpbacks (George and Gracie) and bring them back to save the future. At the time of this movie, the humpback species were indeed on the verge of extinction by whalers, but in a way this movie played a big part in helping to speak out about it. By my understanding the species is still alive, and well, and indeed will prosper hopefully into the 23rd century. Great special effects, good story, and great characters, Star Trek does indeed prosper for all to see.

B00003CXXS|1.0|I loved the original Jurassic Park.  Jurassic Park II was not quite the blockbuster as the original, but it was still good.  Jurassic Park III is an embarrassment.  I can't believe that Steven Spielberg, whom I consider to be one of the most innovative and talented producers/directors around, would put out this movie.  And, I have heard that Michael Crichton retains some control over all projects that he is associated with.  I have read Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain and most of Crichton's novels and have always been entertained/impressed with his killer, innovative plots and fast-paced stories.  Did he actually approve this sequel?  Neither Spielberg nor Crichton could conceivably need money so badly to associate themselves with this movie...  It did make a good trailer, and probably could be cut to a good short, but does not make it as a full length film.<br />All of the Jurassic Park plots were simplistic but involved the viewer with their great character development -- and the special effects.  Those characters were 3 dimensional, you empathized with them, you felt their frustrations, their fears.  But Jurassic Park III had \\"cardboard\\", 2 dimensional characters.  You could not identify with them. (In fact, remember the character that played the mother searching for her son?  She was so uninspired and annoying that I was hoping that a TRex or velicoraptor would take her out early in the film so I wouldn't have to hear her whine any more.)  So, without any real character development and with a simplistic plot, all you are left with are the special effects.  And, while these are good, we have seen them in the other Jurassic Park movies... George Lucas' Star Wars movies, the Star Trek movie series, the James Bond movies -- all remain viable because all sequels managed to retain those features, those strengths, that made them popular in the first place.  Jurassic Park III does not do this.  Am I being overly critical?  I think not.  The proof will be that there willnever be a Jurassic Park IV.
B000001Y79|5.0|Tragic Kindom is amazing! Though it's strongly ska influenced, it has a good variety of ska, punk, rock, pop... you name it! Tracks like Spiderwebs, Don't Speak, Excuse Me Mr., Just a Girl, and Sunday Morning are all very catchy. If your someone who can't stand having a song stuck in your head, then don't buy this cd. (jk! Buy it anyway!)It has good lyrics, too. Songs like The Climb are very inspirational. Some of my personal favorite tracks on the album are End It On This, Sunday Morning, Excuse Me Mr, &amp; Happy Now. <BR>If you like this CD, you might also like No Doubt (self titled), Return of Saturn, The Becon St. Collection, and be sure to buy Rock Steady when it comes out on Dec. 11th!
B00005RFQ5|3.0|Prince, like Earth Wind &amp; Fire, has produced a ton of very interesting, enjoyable music.  But he seems lost on this record.  A very uneven recording.  There is a spiritual component to music, and he seems to be wandering.  He doesn't seem to be in love, like Van Morrison in Astral Weeks, or angry, like Miles Davis, or happy like Cannonball Adderly.  Perhaps if he made a 100% instrumental record, it would challenge him more.  Maybe he should travel, and figure out what to do with his prodigious talents.  But making records that frustrate his loving fans is like having a TV special with Mark Spitz treading water.  Mr. Nelson is thoroughbred race horse, and he should run baby run, not goof around.
B000002J09|4.0|I think this album is a great continuence to the three before it.  In my oppinion it is not their greatest, but lets put it this way, if I were stranded on an island with a batery powered tape player, it would be among my top five albums.  I like the layout of songs in this album.  I don't think you could start with a better song than &quot;Black Dog&quot;, nor end with a better song than &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.  <BR>   If you love Led Zepplin, or you love music, this a great album to have.
B00005QZWJ|2.0|I have bought this soundtrack hopefully,but...COnan the Barbarian is still much more better....nothing special, all the tracks are similar, the new song performed by Enya is nothing compared to Book of Days or Orinoco Flow....<BR>Bad soundtrack
B0000028UK|3.0|Pearl Jam's Vs. is for three different masses: Pearl Jam hard-core fans, grunge fanatics, and heritage rock fanatics. If you like these but you don't consider them the BEST, you may be like me, and think there's a good-and-bad deal with Vs. This is beter than No Code, like what has been said. Even that still has a few good songs, but each PJ album has a minimum of 3-4 good songs. This is one that I could not stomach the first time, but any PJ fan isn't likely to agree with me here. We all know &quot;Daughter&quot; and &quot;Dissident&quot;, but I think that more talent is used on songs like the first two, &quot;Go&quot; and &quot;Animal&quot; (very angry song). The album begins excellent, but then there are songs later in the album that I don't like as much. I know it's a cliche by now, but I least like &quot;WMA&quot; and &quot;Rats&quot;, but that's my opinion. Many songs I only consider &quot;OK&quot;. This includes &quot;Dissident&quot; and &quot;Indifference&quot;. I think better starts are Yield and Ten, and you'll someday find out why. However, another good song I didn't mention is my favorite, &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;. Everyone should like this one, because it's so memorable. And don't take everything personal that's been said, as it's not bad at all for the collector.
6300269639|5.0|I've always loved this movie.  I think it's a great movie.  It's always been entertaining, and you really have to rate it according to when it was made (the early 80's).<br />But I have to say one thing:  What ever happened to just sitting down and allowing yourself to be entertained?  There are so many people who feel they need to psycho-analyze every little thing about a flick.  If everything was so real, it wouldn't make much of a movie.  And please don't listen to Leonard Maltin (as if anything this critic had to say had any value).  I say, just sit down, shutup, and relax.  This is classic Eastwood, and fun to watch.  (Note to Leonard Maltin:  Stuff it.  No one's interested in your dribble).
B000002AZ8|4.0|People criticise this album way too much. It's just that it was where PJ proved to be experimential. I can see where you'd hate this, but I like it better than Vs., though not quite as much as Ten. This album has hit songs like &quot;Better Man&quot; along with the other greats like &quot;Whipping&quot; and &quot;Stupid Mop&quot;. It shows Pearl Jam at different heights, as do their other albums. I think that if Creed was good to you that you should think this is EXCELLENT! I like it a lot, even though not everyone does.
B00003CXXI|5.0|The vocalizations really make this movie.  Being a rabid Mike Myers fan I think he did an awesome job with Shrek, but Eddie Murphy really stole the show with Donkey.  Especially his spiel about Parfaits.  You can see the actors characteristics coming out in the animation also, especially Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona.<br />Shrek must leave his swamp and rescue Princess Fiona from her imprisonment in a Dragon guarded castle, and take her to Lord Farquaad so that he can have his swamp back again.  He winds out with Donkey as his companion on his quest, and to sum it up, it is laugh after laugh.<br />Just lighten up and don't expect great art, and remember that The English Patient in all it's painful and anesthetizing duration actually won awards for boring audiences to death.  Shrek is a hilarious movie never intended to send an important message, it just silly and fun.  The Karaoke tune at the very end is a riot!!<br />Besides, a good fart joke is fun, because farts are funny.  My favorite line?  &quot;Was that you Shrek?  Man!  You gotta warn me before you just crack one off like that!  My mouth was open and everything!&quot;
B000009QPE|5.0|I have been a Slayer fan since 'Seasons', and went back for this classic as I was compelled by their brutal style and their amazingly precise delivery of guitars and drums.  This stuff is far beyond the 'headbanging' stuff I grew up with (Maiden, Priest, Accept, etc), and believe me, it rips your head right off from the first minute!  Mind you, I do NOT think that thrash is the be-all-to-end-all when it comes to metal, however any fan of metal MUST check this out!!!<br />I LOVE the intensity of Araya's vocals and the pummelling delivery of guitars by Hanneman and Co. - they have been doing this for years now, however these guys had the vision and power very early on.  It seems the only thing they are criticized of these days are 'how come it isn't as good as REIGNS, dude?'.<BR>Well, heck, even the best thrashers have to find new ways to express themselves, or maybe it has been all played out - who knows...better than going the 'Mustaine' way, eh?<br />Slayer have kept true to form - we all know that - and if you want to listen to the CD 'where it all began', this is IT. REIGN does not sound dated - it is full of intensity, power and full-on metal that most recordings today would love to achieve.  A great CD to get if you already have this gem is 'South of Heaven', which shows a new side of this band beyond the straight 30 minute delivery of *pure* thrash that is REIGN IN BLOOD.
B00004XMTH|3.0|The stage-to-video version of CATS neatly captures the effect of the London and New York stage versions. The performers are expert, the music occasionally memorable, the choreography and costumes exceptional, the scenic designs are pretty nifty too--but ultimately how much you like CATS will depend on how much you like variety shows. For CATS is exactly that: one long variety show, no plot, no story, just one musical number after another. Your reaction to the film--will rather depends on how much you like variety shows.  Simple as that.
B000002UCN|5.0|George Harrison, throghout his life,has been a very underrated performer, hardly able to write and record whole groups of songs while being overshadowed by Lennon and McCartney. What did come out, however, has truly been among the best music I have ever heard. In fact, my favorite Beatles song ever is &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; because of its positive view of the future. Much of the solo works Harrison has done has had its unique and memorable imprint on rock and roll history. This is a great album to remember the spiritual &quot;Dark Horse,&quot; who has gone to a better place. As Harrison said in his lyrics &quot;I really want to see you, I really want to be with you, My Sweet Lord,&quot; Well, he's gotten that wish. God speed.
0783240503|3.0|Adults will be less enthusiatic about this stage-to-video production than their kids, but even the most cynical will have to admit that the video is extremely well done: Osmond and company give enjoyable performances, the designs are very clever, and the music has a sing-along feel that every one will enjoy.
B00005214X|5.0|I didn't buy much music when I was younger, but I wanted to have anything that was good by Bob Dylan, so I bought the Concert for Bangladesh, which had five Dylan songs and four of the songs from this album, with Leon Russell singing part of &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; like he was trying to give everybody the creeps.  I didn't think that I had to have everything, particularly where the Beatles were concerned, because I knew enough people that had record collections (one of my cousins had the original &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; 3-LP set in Boulder, Colorado) and I loved to surprise them with how much I liked to hear my own personal favorite songs, which might not be particularly popular.  On this album, it was &quot;I Dig Love,&quot; which shows up as Selection 6 on CD2 in this collection.  I remember it being the first song on a side of one of the records, and once the needle was in contact with the record, I could feel that song coming like a strange form of magnetism.  As the years passed, I acquired more of these songs on a concert set from Japan, and I noticed that &quot;Isn't it a Pity&quot; is such a great song that more than one version would be even better than just having one.  This new CD set has the perfect combination: CD1 Selection 4 &quot;Isn't It a Pity&quot; is a glorious 7:08 long, and CD2 Selection 8 &quot;Isn't It a Pity (Version Two) is 4:45, long enough to get it right all over again.  There is even a song by Bob Dylan, &quot;If Not for You,&quot; which is one kind of greatness, but the greatest thing about this album is the guys playing guitar.  When I bought the Concert for Bangladesh, I knew Eric Clapton would be playing the guitar solo in &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; because I had seen it in the movie.  A lot of people were playing guitar in that movie, and until this year, I failed to appreciate how much this album was made the same way.  With four or more kinds of guitar, in addition to the bass guitar, on the songs on&quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; and Phil Collins playing congas on `The Art of Dying,' according to George's note in this set, a lot of us still needed to know that on this album it was that old friend, Eric Clapton, who &quot;hasn't had a credit for thirty years.&quot;  There is so much stuff here, asking people to listen to the whole thing seems like a lot to ask, but there is so much that is good on both CDs that you have to hear it all to appreciate what you are getting.  Some people have a skip button on the remote for albums like this, but that's not the way I listen to it.
B000051VWW|1.0|Am i the only one that is disturbed by the annoying guitar fret changing noise??&gt;?<BR>I can't seem to hear anything else.<br />Pass on this one.  Sade should be embarrassed at the poor recording quality!!
0679879269|5.0|This book and the whole series was excellent.  What i dont understand is how everyone is compareing philip pullman with j.k rowling and harry potter.  'his dark materials' series is soooo much better than harry potter will ever be.  dont get me wrong i like harry potter but it does get a tad redundant. 'his dark materials' is much darker and more complicated and more diverse. it just really got under my skin that on the cover of this book is a comment from a critic compareing to harry potter. the amber spyglass was very sad and was only the second book to bring me to tears.
B00005OM4N|3.0|well fisrt of all, i am NOT A BRITNEY FAN but wish to say that i do think the beats to her music is catchy. her voice is shocking and i am sure i am not the only person to think this. if so many people continually say this than really, britney does not have a voice nor does she have talent. her sound has improved. not a terrible cd but not a pleasant one either. lyrics are still very immature and teeny!!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I can honestly say that I bought this DVD for my daughter and my husband and I enjoy watching it more than she does.  I have always been one that quotes movie lines to people, but my husband would always screw them up when he tried.  This has so many great lines that you can't screw up!  Even my 2 year old daughter is constantly asking me if I know the Muffin Man!  Get this DVD - it is a classic.
B0000009OP|5.0|I first heard Morphine during the movie &quot;Spanking the Monkey&quot; and from there on I was hooked. This is an awesome album and is like nothing else I've ever heard. It's comprable to a Bob Dylan and bluegrass hybrid. Amazing!

0671027344|5.0|Get this book for your kid for Christmas. Im a 13-year-old male. I read this book a couple of months ago, and I really liked it. Most of the reviews on here are good, but I was surprised by a couple of people who found the book offensive, or unrealistic. I admit, Charlie's character was a little unusual, and not as real as Holden Caulfield, but not all together implausible. And as for offensive, there is no way. The truth is, drugs, encounters with the opposite sex, and homosexuals all exist in high school, and sometimes even in middle school, and people need to realize that. If this book offended you need to open your mind. I loved this book, and I would recommend it to anyone I know. (...)
B00005QZWI|4.0|This soundtrack is, well, a soundtrack. So I don't think we should always expect of a soundtrack to be something more than incidental music, and it is why I wouldn't bash this one for that. It's not a good reason even if, indeed, the soundtrack under review is really nothing more than an accompaniment. After many listenings, I still feel it to be lacking unity and coherence. It is underdeveloped, and not very richly orchestrated. I also expected much more thematic content.<br />However, even though this soundtrack has many flaws, I give it 4 stars because much of the music sounds gorgeous. Listen to the lush playing of the low strings in the beginning of the first track, &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, or at 1:30 of &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot;; the truly poignant choir in &quot;The Great River&quot; sounds like sacred music of the Orthodox Church (in fact, I at once heard tonal similarities with Rachmaninoff's Vespers, the sacred orthodox work I know the most). Also &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; achieves a magical atmosphere, with Enya's lyrical vocalization that works out rather well there, even though her Elvish accent is so bad (but this is just a detail, is it not).<br />Having seen the movie, however, I think this soundtrack has a better effect by itself than as an accompaniment to the movie. Trust your own imagination.

0805062971|5.0|Chuck Palahnuik may very well be one of the great writers of unconventional novel, as evident in the plot and the twists and turns of Fight Club.  Who would have thought that being imprisoned in a world where man becomes a slave to material possessions, albeit subconsciously, would eventually take its toll in a delusional way?  Great novel and a great movie too!
B000002JSP|2.0|By the end of the seventies, Led Zeppelin was a wreck. Guitarist, Jimmy Page, had succumbed to heroine addiction; drummer, John Bonham, was suffering from his own vice, alcoholism and lead singer, Robert Plant, was morning the sudden death of his son from a rare throat ailment. The only member of Zeppelin near his prime was bass/keyboard-player, John Paul Jones. Jones takes command on 1979's In Through the Out Door, glazing the album with modern-sounding, synthesizers and cowriting six of the album's seven songs.<br />The problem is Jones was never the heart and soul of Led Zeppelin. His strengths always lay in enhancing what the others had composed. He was someone who added a speacial varnish to the tracks or smoothed over their edges. He was an integral part of Zeppelin's chemistry, no doubt. His skill as an arranger was crucial to epics such as \\"No Quarter\\" and \\"Kashmir\\" as were his bouncy bass lines to rockers such as \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"The Lemon Song\\" yet his  steady, analytical approach to music never provided the unbridled passion that was Led Zeppelin's nucleus. Thus, In Through the Out Door leaves much to be desire. The super-glossed \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" is a weak echo of blues wailers like \\"I Can't Quit You Babe\\" and \\"Since I've Been Loving You;\\" \\"Hot Dog\\" and \\"Fool In the Rain\\" are little more than banal pop and \\"Carouselambra\\" features a pleasant synth-hum and a decent series of guitar strikes from Page but is stretched five minutes further than its worth. Only two tracks are of Zeppelin standard: the hyper-charged \\"In the Evening\\" and \\"All of My Love\\" Plant's touching tribute to his son, which features Jones' most gorgeous use of a synthesized orchestral sound. The rest of the album is forgettable.<br />Still, Jones and the destabilized band deserve to be accredited. The explorations into new technology and new adaptations to their styles is greatly preferable to the autopiloted series of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" clones they could have produced and, even when things may have seemed utterly bleak, they did not simply quit. Nice try, gentlemen, but still, In Through the Out Door is obviously the product of a great band out of its prime and under great strain.
0140386335|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books. in truth, the book really is neverending. i had seen the movie/s and i didn't really like them. but still i read the book. i will never regret it. i got confused while reading it though because that was where the movie ended. yet i was not quite half through the book yet.it went on and some of the things bastian encounters are so wonderfully imaginative i swelled up inside w/ joy. i hope they remake the movie because it is not true to the book. w/ all the new technology they could do a really good one. so if you like fantasy, this is just about as good as it gets.
B000002AP1|3.0|After two decades of complaints that the producer, David Bowie's slightly smoother mix spoiled the final album from jagged-edged punk pioneers, the Stooges, lead singer, Iggy Pop began work on a rougher remix of his former band's final album in 1997. \\"People kept asking me, musicians, kids I would see, `You ever thought about remixing Raw Power?' Everything's still in the red, it's a very violent mix. The proof's in the pudding,\\" Pop writes in the linier notes of his revised edition of Raw Power. The problem is that Pop often goes too far in his attempt to toughen-up the album. \\"Search and Destroy\\" survived Bowie's polishing and two decades as the ultimate testosterone anthem. Is all the additional jerky fuzz and frothy growling really necessary? Bowie's mix may have been too easy on the ears, but adding an extra layer of distortion and more howling to each track is not the remedy. Some of the hardest tracks (\\"Death Trip,\\" \\"Shake Appeal\\") manage but Pop ruins the instances in which the slightly less primal side of the Stooges worked (The brooding \\"Gimme Danger\\" and the slinky \\"Penetration\\"), two magnificent James Williamson guitar solos in \\"Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell\\" and the title track and more by forbidding any approach other than scathing roughness.<br />Still, the Stooges were magic and there was little anyone at the helms of the sound board could do to change that. An examination of Raw Power's eight songs show the rowdy, grimy, Detroit band echoing blank-minded, drugged-up, depraved decadence (\\"I Need Somebody\\" \\"Gimme Danger\\"), rock's proudest ferocity (\\"Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell\\" \\"Death Trip\\") and a mighty, early-20s testosterone-drunkenness (\\"Search and Destroy,\\" the title track), all of it utterly authentic and unforgettable. That was always the case. Now, however, one simply has to focus off Pop's botched remixing rather than Bowie's to see it. Sadly, this reissue is not the ultimate version of Raw Power, but the second bungled mix of whatobviously could have been an excellent album.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I LOVE this CD.  This is definately now become my favorite Christmas CD.  Her voice is beautiful and the mix between the traditional classics, Oh Holy Night, Ava Maria and some of the new songs is wonderful.  You won't be sorry if you buy this!!!
B000002C25|5.0|Anything that everybody hates this much had to be good. I bought it 3 years after it's release, after SOTSOG, just backtracking the catalog. This CD is blinding. Yes, the songs are too long. Absolutely, the lyrics are banal, but oh my goodness can these boys rock. Always written off as Beatle wannabes, and they will never achieve that artistry or creativity of the FABS, but I dare say, the Beatles didn't rock this hard. RIP George!
0553212737|5.0|I would classify this book as my favorite out of all the Jane Austen novels. It makes me cry everytime I finish it, because of The beautiful artwork of Austen's writing. Making all of Emma's mistakes seem so real, and her triphums seems as though they are your's. I see such a realism that only Austen seems to have mastered in her characters. Thought it always finishes with a happy ending, it gives hope that even as clueless (not meant to be a pun) as Emma is and how many stupid mistakes she made her efforts are rewarded with all of her matchmaking adventures coming to an end and everyone who was caught in the confusing love web being freed.
B00005R23S|4.0|This DVD performance proves why Bruce Springsteen, even at 50+ years old, is still the Michael Jordan of live rock performance. There is no face make-up or pyrotechnics in this show.  There is no guitar smashing or stage diving.  There is no elaborate or outrageous clothing (okay, guitarist Steve Van Zandt is an exception).  What you will see on this DVD is an incredible live document of pure, stripped down to the essence, guitar (and drum) driven, authentic, truly-felt rock and roll music performance.<br />Even non-Bruce fans or casual fans should scoop this document up for posterity and watch it at least annually for a purely amazing show.  Pay special attention to the wonderful new song Land of Hope and Dreams, that in my opinion, should have been saved for a new studio album, its that good.  Its an instant classic. Other incredible performances include Prove it All Night, Mansion on the Hill, Ramrod, Light of Day, Jungleland, and Youngstown (with special solo treat from the great journeyman guitarist Nils Lofgren.  <br />Also, the 15 minute so-called &quot;featurette&quot; is terrific!  Mind blowing snippet within it of the hard-driving rock song Adam Raised a Cain from 1978's classic Darkness on the Edge of Town.  One cannot watch Bruce choking his Fender Telecaster throughout this DVD and not be convinced he is absolutely possessed by the Gods and Spirit of Rock and Roll.  <br />Finally, but very important.  The sound on the DVD is amazing.  You can hear every instrument.  Obviously, I highly recommend it.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond's sheer knowledge was what impressed me most in Guns, Germs and Steel. The book was almost an enlightening experience for me, and gave me an entirely new view on humanity and how we've come to be who and where we are. I can still picture in my mind images of people moving around the world and watch technologies develop and spread across continents in certain directions, but not in others. I would recommend it to people interested in learning more about the movement's of people throughout time, and how we've come to be who we are.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I bought this CD today in anticipation for the film (bought my tickets!), I must admit it took a few listens to grow on me, but now I've fallen totally in love with it.  <br />The dynamics, haunting choirs, pounding drums, Enya, etc...<BR>I must say this is one very well done soundtrack, one of the best to date.<br />I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys great music.

B00005RYKV|3.0|I worship Kitano as a director and I really really love Kitano's work.  I was dying to see his new film after my very favorite Sonatine, Hana-Bi (Fireworks) and Kikujiro.<BR>There are many genius work in this film, but unfortunately it didn't quite come together as much as he intended.<BR>Maybe because this film took rather unique production procedures - a Hollywood format by Japanese director and staff.<BR>There are a bit too much brutal scenes of &quot;harakiri&quot; and yakuza rituals.  And the most disappointingly, too much story feeding to the audience by the protagonists' dialogues.  <BR>The last scene with Omar really wasn't necessary.  These unnecessary additions ruins the elegant taste he usually have for his former works. <br />In terms of acting, Kuroudo Maki was terrible!  He was farely good in &quot;Scene at the Sea&quot;.  So it was quite disappointing to see him how terrible he act out with dialogues..<br />But all in all, this till is a must-see movie - as you can't see anything like this anywhere.

B00005B36H|5.0|the album gets better and better after many listens. if you dont like this album or tool, that is fine. but if you listen to collective soul, nickelback, linkin park, well that speaks volumes in itself. lets be realistic here for a moment if we can. there is not another band out there as thought out, original, deep, dark, mysterious, brilliant as tool. show me 4 band members who have as good of chemistry as these guys, you cant do it. those who judge negative, have you seen them live? probably not is my guess. and dont classify &quot;tool fans&quot; into some big dumb category, for tool itself cannot be categorized. unfortunately, most people just dont have the attention span, its a serious issue. think it over. if you have time.  peace.

B000002GD9|5.0|In Supertramp's heyday back in the 1970's and early 1980's, there was nobody else quite like them.  Their music was, and still is, unique.  On Even in the Quietest Moments, this band has done what they always did best: they play intelligent music with complex musical compositions, variable textures, and thoughtful lyrics.  This album is a masterpiece.  <br />&quot;Fool's Overture&quot; is an unforgettable epic song, taking eleven minutes to wind through a masterfully crafted musical landscape until reaching an intense crescendo led by Roger Hodgson's soaring vocals.  The title track is of similar magnanimity; it's just as enthralling, but it's only six minutes long.  &quot;Give A Little Bit&quot; proved to be a hit single and is Supertramp's most widely known song on the album.  &quot;Lover Boy&quot; is a lighthearted affair, and &quot;Downstream&quot; is a quaint voyage on the water with nothing more than Rick Davies and his piano.  &quot;Babaji&quot; is another intense and entertaining ride, and &quot;From Now On&quot; has an almost jazz-like sound to it highlighted by John Anthony Helliwell's saxophone.  <br />That covers the album...  Seven outstanding songs from a talented group of seven musicians.  It's a shame Roger Hodgson left Supertramp, as he was half of the band's creative genius (the other half being Rick Davies, of course).  But Even in the Quietest Moments captures Supertramp's majestic sound, and I highly recommend the album to you!
0913022101|5.0|This book is an excellent journey into the mind of Adolf Hitler.  The author, Adolf Hitler, writes his struggle in shocking detail.  Every reader in America should read this book to understand the mind of one of the most influencial leaders of all time. Regardless, of personal feelings about the man, he still was the one dictator to single-handedly transformed a country in shambles, to a counrty taking over the world. No politician has ever done what Hitler did. Adolf Hitler vividly depicts his life the way he saw it, not the way we all interpret it. If one reads this book one can fully understand the causes of World War II and understand fully where the Germans came from. Many readers will think differently after reading this book.
B00005A46T|1.0|A coworker of mine purchased this CD last week and brought it to the office.  Thankfully I can say that I had never heard of this band before.  I simply could not believe what I was hearing out of the CD player and seeing on the CD inserts.  These guys don't play music.  These guys are nothing but racketeers trying to make money off of disengaged or angry teenagers.  At best Slipknot is completely farcical, and at worst they are utterly satanic.  Either way you look at it, this CD provides nothing more than comic relief.
B000002BFL|5.0|the ghost of tomjoad might not have the instant appeal of a River or Born in the USA,but it is an album that slowly grows on you and never lets go.It is difficult to call this album his best,cause my own preference varies with my current moods,etc.Suffice it to say that almost all of bruce's albums are outstanding and way above the creation of any other artist.<BR> GOTJ probably did not the recognition it deserved because 2day,everything is commercial and created [?]to suit the mass market,no time for artistic talents.I bought this album in 1995 and even today the album feels as great as it was back then.Greatness of an artist and an album is measured by the enduring impact it has on peoples lives and this album,like his others has this timeless appeal.
B00000DCHE|5.0|There's only one Billy Joel.  This guy is an American legend, a music icon, and on Songs In the Attic it's easy to understand why.  This was Billy's first live album, and it includes many of his very best songs.  He compiled the songs on this disc in an effort to capture the energy of his live performances, and he was successful.  Billy's live music sounds better than his recorded music, which tells you how talented this musician really is; Billy Joel doesn't need any sort of studio enhancements.  Just set him on stage with a piano and a band, and he's a wonder.  <br />Every song on this disc is excellent.  Even if you have already heard most these songs from other Billy Joel albums, it's still worth it to buy this CD.  Songs in the Attic is a classic!

B00005NNU4|4.0|It has been some years since Terence Trent D'arby burst onto our TV screens and Hifi's in 1987, and even longer it seems since any mew material has surfaced from this talented artist.<BR>   Wild Card TTD's/Sananda's fifth album and official follow up to 1995's Vibrator, and the first to be released on his own label, was recorded in 1998, and after much deliberation finally gets the light of day on cd.<BR>   The album as expected, is as diverse musically as previous albums by the artist but also shows signs of experimentation in style and content.<BR>   Over the 19 tracks included here, TTD again shows his range, both vocally and musically, gracing the album with jazz,pop,funk and rock songs brought to stunning life with that voice.<BR>   Unlike Symphony Or Damn TTD's pinnacle third album, Wild card is dominated by songs using programmed drumbeats and stripped down production, which at times is masterful and at others plodding, meaning that whilst it doesn't quite match Symphonys' scope and vision it does contain some of his finest compositions.<BR>   O'Davina the opening track, is probably TTD's/Sananda's best opener to any of his albums, a jazzy, beautiful pop song with great horns and vocal harmonies. He has also remained faithful to the unfashionable banjo used so often in his past work.<BR>   Designated Fool is a welcome departure for TTD, with programmed beats ,wah wah guitars and keyboards.<BR>   Suga Free is also unfamiliar ground, but TTD makes this song his own with a great vocal and excellent harmonies,   courtesy of one Mozart sample.<BR>   Ev'rythang and Drivin' me Crazy builds on a heavier, more dance orientated feel, keyboard synths and pulsating drum loops in full effect as TTD bellows out that voice. A collabaration with Glen Ballard on Shadows is less successful however, with the song never really working as a cohesive whole.<BR>   Whilst most of the album is donminated by mid tempo programmed tracks particularly the middle half, TTDs best work  improves when he picks up the pace. Goodbye Diane, a funky hard edged workout succeeds in rock n roll and Sayin' About You is probably TTD's most commercial record on the album.<BR>   The last 2 tracks improve things further still.<BR>Not originally included on the downloadable edition of WildCard these two tracks Benediction ; Sugar Ray and Testify bring this record to an upbeat, funky end.<BR>   Sugar Ray with its pulsating guitars , soft backdrop and great production captures TTD's great vocal range and stengths,<BR>whilst Testify again mixes hard funk, vocal harmonies and wah wah guitars to great effect.<BR>   Wildcard sees  a more mature artist shinning through. An artist in need to continue experimenting, changing styles and challenging himself. As a complete work it is diverse, frustrating and rewarding. It may lack a beautiful standout ballad so reminiscent of previous albums, it can get tedious<BR>in the middle half , but it remains a great addition to TTD's body of work. Recommended.
B00003CWL5|3.0|Simply put - this film loses me with it's disturbing sexually suggesting content. Sex becomes the center for observation outward, and for this crisis of soul... and while nothing is shown, in fact nothing really happens... it's felt in its raunchiest terms. <br />That (...) big time, because there really is a story here, a few in fact, of marvelous proportions of people getting in touch with life... but it's overwhelmed by the pointless sexual overtones and occasional crudity just for crude's sake...<br />That's not realism, that's not important revelations, that's just embarrassing. I can read a Henry Miller book for example, and the sex can be meaningless if I choose so I can read the real message... but in a movie where human beings are positioned to really do this stuff for us to watch... it only feels like disgusting voyeurism in the middle of what is supposed to be a good story. I'm not a prude by any account, but when something feels cheap and degrading to me, I don't lie, and this sort of sexual overtone in a movie does.<br />Just read the screenplay if you want to know this interesting spiritual tale without being embarassed by how the screen handles it
0060012331|5.0|Great fun, this book. What starts out as a simple restructuring of the story &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamlin&quot;, turns into a darker, deeper tale. Although written with kids/young adults in mind, Terry Pratchett gives us characters that we care about and a plot that is every bit as complex and interesting as his &quot;grown up&quot; Discworld stories. As a fan of Terry Pratchett, I can highly recommend this book to fellow fans as well as those who have never heard of Mr. Pratchett. If you've never loved a rat, here's your chance!!
B00005LKIM|2.0|The gore in this movie is lame. I cannot fathom why some have a problem with it. The movie never felt believable for a second so why would anyone think the rubber and red sauce meant anything? Do you freak out when you see those rubber things on halloween?<br />Why the heck (...) is Hannibal magical, could someone tell me that? He gets away with absolutely ANYTHING, handles every situation with supernatural control and precision, not to mention always defying the limits of time, physics, and all that... It's boring. I did not feel a lick of suspense watching this movie. Add to that the fact the Hannibal is a man (...) who degrades and tortures every human being for no reason, with only the pretense of having some cultured ammoral mind -- well nothing adds up, and it is not worth watching. It doesn't horrify, doesn't really intrigue, just gives the impression of... stupidity. This is all really dumb.<br />This is a real piece of hollywood, served up on by the book production values and nothing else.
0553573403|5.0|Ok...first of all, I hate &quot;Fantasy&quot; books. I read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings when I was 7, loved them, have re-read them numerous times, and that was enough Fantasy for me. I cringe at the mention of Elves, Fairys, Trolls, etc. Harry Potter gave me my fill of that stuff. (I love the Potter books, so there ARE exceptions.....). I was pretty much dared to read A Game of Thrones after I posted a review of Legends, an anthology that had a short story by George R.R. Martin. I loved that story, but wrote that I wouldn't try his Song of Ice &amp; Fire books because I hate Fantasy. I received an e-mail urging me to give it a try, so I did (Thanks Buddy, wherever you are!), and here I am.....I have to re-write my &quot;About Myself&quot; profile to include the fact that A Game of Thrones is (my new) all-time favorite book!<br />  Martin sets his story in the Seven Kingdoms, which are ruled by one King, but have many different Lords and Houses; all of which dwell under a very fragile peace. Needless to say, that peace doesn't last long, and betrayal, incest, murder, and revenge become the orders of the day.<br />  The narrative unfolds from numerous perspectives, among them:<br />  Lord Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, who is pressed into<br />  service as the Hand of the King, who he helped win the<br />  crown.<br />  His Wife, The Lady Catelyn Stark; who proves herself to be<br />  every bit as tough and resourceful as her Husband.<br />  Their Children Bran, Arya, and Sansa, as well as Eddard's<br />  Bastard son, Jon Snow- The children all have their own<br />  stories to tell, as tragic, and often horrific, events<br />  send them in their own seperate directions, to face<br />  their own destinies.<br />  Daenyris Stormborn, the last heir of the former king; we<br />  follow her truly tragic quest as she transforms from a<br />  sad little girl who just wants to go home into a<br />  steely-willed young woman, determined to become  a<br />  Queen.<br /> The book is populated by, literally, HUNDREDS of characters. I admit that, at first, it was somewhat hard to keep track of who was who. But Martin's writing is so brilliant that after a while you can rattle off these characters and their histories without missing a beat. It takes a truly gifted writer to craft an epic, and Martin is one of those who has pulled it off. There were moments where I wanted to cry, or cheer, or yell &quot;look out!!&quot; The plot twists were truly TWISTS; I didn't see them coming a mile off, as in most stories.<br />  I can practically guarantee that if you give this book a try, you'll love it. I'm already well into Book Two, A Clash of Kings.<br />And it's looking like it'll top book one......steely-willed young woman, determined to become  a <BR>          Queen.<br /> The book is populated by, literally, HUNDREDS of characters.

0385505833|3.0|I have read and enjoyed almost all of Grisham's books and was curious to explore how he would treat this subject matter that is somewhat of a departure for him. On the whole I found the book entertaining. Anyone who has wondered what it would be like to \\"skip Christmas\\" can probably picture themselves in at least one of the predicaments in which the Kranks find themselves. However, I would strongly not recommend this book to anyone who is a breast cancer patient or the family member of a breast cancer patient. For a book which bills itself as an \\"hilarious look at the chaos and frenzy that have become part of our holiday tradition,\\" there is an unexpected element that for this breast cancer patient was quite disturbing. I'm not saying that we should never read about the plight of such patients, as I have read several books devoted to that subject. However, I do believe that we should at least be aware going in that the book we are reading for escapism is going to hit us in the face with a dose of reality. I would hope that this review might keep others from being \\"blindsided\\" as I was by this turn of events in an otherwise entertaining book.  (...)
B00003CXXJ|4.0|When this came to the theaters, I refused to see it.  I kept hearing everyone rave about it, yet I still would not see it.  It finally came to video and boy do I regret not seeing it before.  I could not stop laughing.  The way they incorporated other fairytales was wonderfully amusing.  All the jokes where very adaptable for adults, lots of hiddeen meanings.  I am such a fan of this movie, now.  The animation was absolutley superb, too.  Give it a chance, and you will love it.  I garuantee!
0679879269|5.0|In my review of the first of these books, I stated that it was not as gripping as Harry Potter. I stick by that, it has taken me months to read this book, what with school and other activities, whereas if it had been a Harry Potter book of the same size I'd have read it in a couple of days. Harry Potter was more gripping, as in it had a grip on me. This book had many more tense moments then the whole series of Harry Potter combined, so far at least. I appreciated this book as a more mature, great peice of literature.<br />This book is packed with romance, action, dark materials, strange creatures, death, deaths, destruction, revolution, and, most importantly, Dust. Don't know what Dust is? Wondering what those strange creatures are? Wondering why I listed death twice, with one as a plural? To answer all of your questions I will direct you to read this story of how Lyras parents really feel about her, how Will and Roger really feel about her, how she feels about everyone else, and how she achieves her destiny. And if you have already read the other two books, which I recommend you do before reading this one, then you will find out what you have been wondering all along: What is Dust? Also, what happened to characters we said goodbye to earlier?<br />One thing that confuses me about this whole series is how much attention it has been given. Not positive attention, but negative attention. Harry Potter is banned this way and that for endorcing witchcraft. Here we have a story that not only has witchcraft, but basically says that every single religion, Christianity to Buddhism, is just a bunch of stories and chants and has no truth. Everyone is destined the same, and it is not pretty. Why are there no schools banning this book when it is much worse than Harry Potter, as far as religious people should be concerned?<br />In conclusion, I really enjoyed this series and nearly cried at the end for two reasons: 1. It was over and 2. What was happening was sad and written passionately. I strongly recommend this book to everyone, but only after you have read its prequels.
B00005QG9J|2.0|If there is one thing that I despise more than pop it is a \\"rock\\" band that doesn't know what rock is. These sell out backstreet n'stink wannabe's may have riffs, but that's the only piece of driftwood that they have to cling to in the dense ocean of music. Their first album was good, but all that this rubbish proves is that they're nothin' but southern-californian hippies who wouldn't know a true rock track if wacked them in the head with one of their surfboards and said, \\" Dude, pick up a Sabbath record.\\" (...) rock is a cancer almost as bad as pop (almost) and it is up to true fans of nu-metal, metal, thrash or whatever your favorite branch of rock is to snuff it out before it kills innocent people.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Every song on this album has its own story and beauty.  Pure emotion.<br />1)Affirmation-this song is a compilation of cliches but there is such an innocence to it, maybe because it is so honest.  Singing along with Darren on this makes you feel the words and some sort of release, like you could maybe believe in the reassuring words after all.<br />2)Hold Me-A lovely song, almost resigned.  The music-instruments, Darren's voice and the background vocals, also his-are intricate.  About not wanting to fight anymore and letting things go.<br />3)I Knew I Loved You-Beautiful lyrics, a classic love song.  Period.<br />4)The Best Thing-This song makes me so happy.  The instruments fit the words perfectly; it conveys the irrationality and spontaneity of the lyrics.  To me,it's about taking the risk to love in spite of how illogical it may seem.<br />5)Crash and Burn-Inspirational.  Makes you feel that it's true, we're not alone. Potentially life changing.<br />6)Chained to You-Again, the instrumental conveys the lyrics perfectly.  Very upbeat, very fervent-just like the kind of passion the lyrics talk about.<br />7)The Animal Song-Just a fun song.  A lot of people get turned off by the bongo drums in the intro but I think it fits the primitive nature of the song.  About getting away from the bustle sometimes.<br />8)The Lover After Me-A sad, honest song.  Darren's voice just shows the slight desperation of the situation and is touching.  Everyone can relate to this song, about not wanting to move on.<br />9)Two Beds and A Coffee Machine-A very raw song, very serious.  Sad but inspiring at the same time; like Crash and Burn potentially life-changing for those who can relate.<br />10)You Can Still Be Free-The way Darren sings it makes you feel a sort of freedom, especially if you sing along.  It's profound, it takes you on a journey.  It's about moving on after death, also serious.<br />11)Gunning Down Romance-One of my absolute favourite songs on the album.  The instrumental fits the cynical attitude; it's unpredictable and it builds the same type of tension in the lyrics.  There's a dark atmosphere to this song and the lyrics make you think. Also speaks to just about everyone who's been spurned in love.<br />12)I Don't Know You Anymore-Just beautiful.  Very very sad,  truthful and unpretentious.  It's about admitting your mistakes to another person, apologizing in your own way, and even wishing the other person well.
0688172377|4.0|This is the type of book to give to others who preach that all cultures should be respected. With Waris Dirie's bold description of her own female genital mutilation in Somalia, it is enough to say that every culture and religion should be examined for traditions and practices that are outright harmful, undignified for its proud people, and not worthy of rational human beings. Somalian and other Muslim men have been done a favor by Waris Dirie, as her explanation for such mutilation points out the weakness of an entire male population. I came away from reading this book convinced that it is the women who are the absolute strength of these nations, not their men. This is a courageous woman and the story told in simple terms proves it time and again.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|The first thing you need to know about \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is that musically, it is one of the best albums available right now. A nice mixture of jazz and funk, sprinkled with some nice guitar work and romance, it covers just about every possible genre of music, and does so very nicely. Anyone who is a long time Prince fan knows that he has always had spritual and religious undertones to his music, so the fact that those undertones are fleshed out even more on this recording shouldn't really be a big deal. One of the best things, but also one downside, is that \\"The Rainbow Children\\" listened to as a whole tells a complete story, with music as it's narrative. The downside to this is that it makes it hard to take out one track and listen to it. However that doesn't mean there aren't standout tracks, those would be \\"The Work, pt. 1\\"; \\"1+1+1=3\\"; \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\"; \\"Mellow\\" and \\"The Everlasting Now\\". However keep in mind, this CD is enjoyed best when listened to start to finish.
0553296981|5.0|One of the few books I have ever read that was made more powerfull by already knowing how it ends. Anne Frank was many things-A Jew, a young girl, a person enduring a seemingly impossible living situation-but above all of that she was a great writer. Her riveting account of growing up Jewish in occupied Amsterdam made me thankfull for all I have. I redcommend this book to everyone.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Have you watched Jurassic Park? Any of the them? Have you watched Star Wars? AI? ET? Hook? Sabrina? Home Alone? Schindler's List? Saving Private Ryan? Stepmom? And my last question is: Have you watched Harry Potter? Well these and many more movie soundtracks have been done by John Williams. Though some don't like how there's no vocals or that there's a lot of the same theme. But the theme is very mystical and fits the movie. Also it's played a few different ways. I should say also, this isn't one of those movies like &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. It's a score album. But it's very well done. Some of the songs even sound like Jurassic Park or Star Wars if you listen closely enough.<br />I enjoy the soundtrack immensely and my father who hasn't even seen the movie but heard the soundtrack, loves the soundtrack.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I am a true Prince fan!  I've followed his career since day one!<BR>(I still own his debut album-{&quot;For You&quot;).  I'll admit that I don't like everything he's put out....but &quot;The Rainbow Children&quot; is a 'Must Have!!!!'  This CD has a very 'Jazzy/Rock' feel to it.  Prince has alot of 'deep/spiritual' lyrics on this CD too-which is why I don't expect everyone to 'get it!'  With the 'tradgedy' involving the World Trade Center this year...I needed a CD like this one!!!  I feel that 'The Rainbow Children' celebrates LIFE!  I'm very proud of Prince!  It's one thing 2 mature musically.  When you mature 'spiritually', you've done something really BIG!(Anyone who listens 2 this CD will know that he's done both!!!)Job Well Done, Prince!  I haven't stopped listening 2 it since I bought it!
B000002HHB|3.0|I bought the CD for the song Carnival.  It sounds as good as I remember.  There are one or two good ones on here besides that one, but the rest is fluff.  Tired old chord progressions, well-produced, however, and with Natalie's sweet, vulnerable sounding vocals.  Nothing that really reaches out and grabs your attention.

B00003CXAY|4.0|Wonderful composition. I bought a DVD of it--imagine my dismay when I learned that it was only the soundtrack. Furthermore, I can only listen to it on my DVD player. What a crock! Can't wait for a real DVD to come out.
B00003CXRP|4.0|After his plane goes down a man is made to survive, alone, on a deserted island.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|To my friend from Hungary and others, the stated criterion for inclusion were that songs had to be number one singles from Record Retailer (UK) or Billboard (US). None of the excellent songs you listed were released as singles.<br />This collection is by definition the most popular songs they recorded. The large number of songs and the convenience of having them all on one disc are big pluses in buying it. <br />This CD is no substitute, however, for the many other songs in the catalog that weren't released as singles and are underappreciated. Particularly underrated are, among others, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;, &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life&quot;, &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot;, and &quot;If I Fell&quot;.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|I am a huge prince fan. I must admit that I fell off his bandwagon for a while. After sign O the times I kinda felt prince was going downhill. I apologize to prince and his fans. I should never have doubted his genius. The album equals if not sounds better than sign O the times. Every song is brilliant. I can tell he took his time and really concentrated on this album. I wish I could give it more than five stars. A message to the GRAMMY association, you have to nominate this as an album of the year! I was hesitant to buy it but I am so glad I did. Regardless what anybody says I think this is his best work and by far sounds better than any other artist out there. Let's give credit when credit is due , Prince album is the best!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKHP|5.0|No question that this majestic film is still the best reiteration of Star Trek, and I would in fact rank it among the ten finest sci-fi films of all time.  And the truth is that this is in fact a true sci-fi film, as opposed to a mishmash of action scenes with a starfield backdrop, as all of the other Trek films have been.  The re-working is nothing short of an astonishing revelation - the CGI blends in flawlessly, the result of the engineers achieving a 1979 look to the FX.  A great, great film.
B00000JZIK|5.0|this film is so good i had to watch it all over again straight after finishing it (this may have something to do with it also being fairly confusing..). the ending of his film sends hivers down my spine everytime and for those wh have seen it they will know what i mean. kevin spacey made hs big breakthrough in this film and he s now recognised as the best actor of the 90s. gabriel byrne and ben del toro are also excellent. if you like crime thrillers with a whodunnit thrown in, this is A MUST SEE...<BR>deftonakid
B00005RFAI|5.0|This cd is one of my personal favorites, I saw Pink in october at United We Stand concert and she rocked the house.

0312937385|4.0|After readimg Ender's Game in my Science Fiction class two weeks ago I became obsessed with finding out what happens next. Although this book shocked me at first at how different it was from Game it gradually pulled me in and towards the end I couldn't stop reading it. If you enjoyed Ender's Game you must try Speaker out, although it's a different style it's a great read and a great story. If you haven't read Game first then do so. Speaker of the Dead was what OCS wanted to write first but felt that he had to explain Enders' past in a whole novel, Ender's Game, so the reader could fully grasp the moral implications that arose from Ender's actions.
B00004XQP4|4.0|I'm not really a &quot;punk,&quot; but I listen to some &quot;punk&quot; artists, and it really made me mad when people said that this album was Green Day's &quot;sell-out&quot; album.  My view of selling out is if you are like Limp Bizkit, they sold out, and I don't think Green Day did.  I think that Green Day just grew up.<BR>So now onto my review.  I love this album.  My favorite track of the album is probably &quot;Fashion Victim&quot; or &quot;Waiting&quot;.  Some the pretty good tracks are &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Minority&quot;, &quot;Blood, Sex And Booze.&quot;  Then a bunch of so-so tracks &quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;Church On Sunday&quot;, &quot;Castaway&quot;, &quot;Deadbeat Holiday&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Jackass&quot;, &quot;Macy's Day Parade.&quot;<BR>But all in all its a pretty good album and worth a listen or two.  All the tracks, save &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot; &amp; &quot;Misery&quot;, are upbeat tracks. And &quot;Misery&quot; is a dark comedy type track.  Take my advice its worth the money.

0684171600|5.0|I was just reminiscing about how this book was required reading for me over one summer vacation back in elementary school (yes, I had homework over the summer).  I was a voracious reader but preferred books that gave insight into the experiences of girls or women.  Laura Ingalls Wilder and Jane Austen were much more my thing.  So I put off reading this book until the last week before school started and then only picked it up because of my mother's nagging. I dragged myself through the first few pages and then I was shocked (a little horrified I confess) to find myself loving it!  I couldn't stop turning the pages.  I sucked up the book in a day and enjoyed it all immensely.  It changed me.  It expanded my &quot;girlish&quot; view of the world.  The experience taught me to try books out before rejecting them.  Who knows if I would ever have read &quot;manly&quot; authors such as Hemingway and Steinbeck if it had not been for that experience?  I'm looking forward to reading it with my own two daughters.  Anyway, I give it two thumbs up :-)
0061040967|5.0|This is a great book.<br />I think everyone will enjoy it.<br />For someone unfamiliar with Terry Pratchett's novels, it is a marvelous introduction to his Discworld. Technically, it is fantasy, but in truth you won't find more realistic characters in any other author's books.<br />And, long time Pratchett fans will marvel at the quality of the writing and the splendid illustrations.
B00005K3NR|5.0|All I have to say is thank goodness DePalma chose Sissy Spacek.  Watching the documentary on this film was a real learning experience.  This is probably one of the best horror films made.  One of the things that makes it great is that it doesn't really start out as a horror film; more of like a &quot;coming of age&quot; type of movie.  But the sudden twist takes you deeper into the character, and makes you realize what hell Sissy goes through in that high school, with the people that surround her and within herself.<br />The transfer is the best I've heard so far.  The audio and the music together is equally balanced, which seems so rare to find on DVD's these days.  Beautiful menu montage, well done documentaries, and a touching picture gallary makes this DVD perfect to get at such a low price.  This is one of those DVD's that will make people want to get more and more movies on disc.  It was like watching the film all over again, as a new experience.  I felt I was sitting in a movie theater.  This standard will most likely change formats for DVD's, and change the way we look at films for a long time.  A great DVD to start your home viewing experience with.
0440213525|4.0|This is my fifth Grisham book I have read and it has to be one of my favorite. Starts out with a suicide and follows a young kid through all the twist and turns of a murder. You see how a kid handles knowing something he shouldn't know and being pressured by the FBI to tell and being threatened by the Mafia to stay quiet. At the end is the classic John Grisham action part followed by a cliffhanger ending that leaves you to wonder what happened to Mark Sway. All over it is a great book that I would recommend to any people that enjoy legal thrillers.
B00005OLY5|5.0|A dwarf-like aspiring sorcerer and a tough, sarcastic warrior embark on a quest to save a magical baby from an evil enchantress, who must destroy the child in order to safeguard her power.  Sound like a typical fantasy plot?  Sure it does.  But this movie doesn't pretend to be anything it's not.  It's a fantasy adventure, filled with magic, mayhem, humour, action, and a pair of brownies who talk and act like sterotypical drunken Frenchmen.  Nothing more.  The diminutive title character is a thoroughly endearing hero, one you can't help but root for, and swashbuckling swordsman Madmartigan has got to be one of Val Kilmer's most entertaining characters, with quotable quips spilling out of his mouth in every second scene.<BR>My only real criticism of this movie is its major female character, the daughter of the wicked queen.  She is presented as a powerful and ruthless warrior, but is subverted with ridiculous ease when she falls for the handsome-and-daring hero.  Forgive me, please, for the plot spoiler, but really, it's obvious from the moment we see her pretty, not-evil-in-any-way face, that she is going to be the love interest.  Heck, even the art on the sleeve gives it away.  And then, at the end, well, I won't describe what she's doing (or wearing) the last time we see her, but really... I thought she was a warrior!<BR>But every movie has its flaws, and even taking that into consideration, this movie still merits five stars.  It's exciting, it's funny, and if you're the sort of person who likes fairy tales, it's an evening well spent.  If, however, you've had trouble with fantasy films in the past, well then, you may not get this one.  Your loss.
0060012331|5.0|This is the best book published this year, for sure. <br />Before you start reading it, I suggest you<br />o make sure the iron is not plugged in<BR>o make sure the stove is off<BR>o unplug the phone<BR>o disconnect the doorbell<br />You'll recognize one of the standard childrens's book plots from the first page. (I'll not give it away here.) The nice well developed characters, and talking animals in a slightly unusual setting (if you've never read a Discworld novel before) will make you think this is very well written but sort of standard children's story. That feeling may last a page or two. <br />That's all Pratchett needs to draw you into the story. You'll be immersed.<br />Then, it gets a bit scary. It's not good versus bad, but kind versus mean. And mean looks like it is going to win.<br />You will be surprised, and pleased with the wonderful ending, too.

B00005RHGK|5.0|God,that's the best HORROR MOVIE i've seen this summer<BR>since <<GINGER SNAPS>>.The actors are good,the monster<BR>is cool,it's well done and the hole movie ROCKS.<BR>The movie is about a brother (Longand)and sister (Philips) return home during college break.Something happens on the road... something horrible and scary.They discover something in the basement of a church<BR>which leads to them being pursued by a \\"nightmare cloaked in rags.\\" \\"After making a horrific discovery in the basement of<BR>an old abandoned church,Trish (Gina Philips) and her<BR>brother Darry (Justin Long)watch their routine road trip<BR>home from college turn into a heart stopping race for their lives.

B00000DFSK|5.0|I have this in my extensive U2 collection of over 40 Cd's; and this one includes the best from each album they made from &quot;Boy&quot; up till &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot;.  It's a great CD for a true dedicated U2 fan or for someone who wants a sampling of their best of that 10 year span.  A super-elevated U2 fan in Missouri.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Yes, that's what I said. Ol' Steve knew what he was doing by releasing Episode 4 first. Who knew he had such vision? Like most of the other reviewers, I agree that if Episode 1 had been released first, there would have been a low rumble in the universe as Spielberg flopped into a big ol' pile of mud. But, by giving us Episodes 4, 5 and 6 he used the back end of a story to leave us panting for more. And he delivered more. We don't care that the acting is horrid or the plot is wobbly. All we want to see is how Anakin grows up to be Darth Vader.<br />Mr. Spielberg are you related to P.T. Barnum?
068484267X|5.0|I was really skeptical about reading this book.  I'm 15 and I am proud to admit that i have fallen into the whole Harry Potter craze.  i have never really liked &quot;biography&quot; type books (like &quot;I know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;) and so naturally i didn't think i would like this.  but my mom read it and told me i should (after raving about how GREAT it was). so i decided to try it.  one of the best parts about the book is that it catches you right at the begining.  i couldn't put it down.  i was really happy about it and think everyone should read it<br />Other Recomendations:  Harry Potter, J.K. Rowling; His Dark Materials, Phillip Pullman; The Dark is Rising, Susan Cooper; and all other books that help you learn something!

B00003CXXR|3.0|I really don't know how to review this movie. It is one of the hardest choices I have ever made when it comes to reviewing, but I concluded to a three star rating and you will see why.<br />This movie is a perfect example of a movie series gone bad. The first movie is good, and maybe the second, but when a sequel comes out, it is terrible, and ruins the entire series.<br />In this movie, a couple lies to the scientists and says that they have permision to go to a jurasic park island. They land on it, crash land rather, and then find themselves stranded on the island. The couple reveals the lie, that they had a son parachouting and crash landed on the island, so they wanted to look for him. Struglling for survival, they run into many different dinosaurs, and finaly, after many days, the army finds them.<br />As you can see, this movie is pretty cheesy. The story is pretty bad. What moron would allow their son to parachute from an airplane onto an island! You have to give them some credit though, because their special effects were incredible, and those of you with home theatre systems (like me) will enjoy the encredible sound. If you are a Jurasic Park fan, this is a must have, but if you aren't a hardcore fan, only get this if you have a DVD player and a home theatre system, for this movie should only to impress your friends with the incredible graphics and sound your system has.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I listened to incubus long before their success with Make Yourself, and my opinion is that for anyone who dislikes Morning View, you don't know who incubus really is.They are progressive, and they change their sound with every record,while still keeping their roots,proving they can play all types of music and this is just the next phase for them.If you don't like this one,then you were kidding yourself when you said you did like them.You just jumped on the bandwagon.This is the most inspiring and creative band out there,and the best damn live band that i've ever seen.I anticipated Morning View for a long time, and wasn't the slightest bit disappointed. Solid record from beginning to end.
6301607929|4.0|It's Labour Day weekend in a small midwestern town, and drifter William Holden rides the rails in, looking to get a job from college buddy Cliff Robertson. He meets Robertson's girlfriend Kim Novak, her younger sister Susan Strasberg, their mother Betty Field, old maid schoolteacher Rosalind Russell, and Russell's boyfriend Arthur O'Connell.  His appearance sets the stage for a Labour Day picnic they all won't soon forget, as the handsome drifter stirs the women up.  Holden is a little old for the role, but does such a great job of infusing the character with desperation, charm, and painful honesty that his age is hardly a liability.  Novak is good as the beautiful girl who wants to be known for more than just her beauty.  She doesn't bring much depth to the character, but she and Holden have an excellent chemistry on screen together.  The supporting cast is uniformly great.  Russell pulls out all the stops as the frustrated and pathetically desperate teacher, while O'Connell is laid back and a perfect counter-punch to her histrionics.  It's the kind of a story that almost everyone can find something to relate to - if you've ever felt trapped in your life, or been unsatisfied with where your life has gone, or had dreams for something more.  It's well written, well acted, and well worth watching.
059035342X|5.0|If your ever feeling down this book will pick you up again! It's full of mystical adventure to the little orphan boy dropped on the Dursley's doorstep one cold night. Harry finds out he's a wizard and he's going to attend Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. It is a wonderful tale full of humor and being serious all at the same time. It's a exciting tale for young and old! On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 10. <BR>  J.K. Rowling makes pictures in your mind. And Mary Grandpre draws them for you so it's as easy a pie. I never expected to ever find a book like Harry Potter. I almost which he was real.
B0000524E5|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have EVER seen (and I have seen thousands).  This movie was originally designed to be marketed towards teenage girls, as a triumphant story of a girl making it in life on her own.  After being tested to that market they found that the movie, with a horrible plot, bad acting, and miserable premise could only be lucrative if it was marketed to males age 16-35, nice save Bruckheimer, why don't you stick to making movies like Con Air and The Rock.  This movie fails at everything except introducing me to a cute actress, not the lead, but, Izabella Miko who plays Cammie, the cute &amp; sweet bartender who looks fabulous.  Other problems include John Goodman's acting talent being wasted on a miserable character-in a miserable movie(look at him in The Big Labowski).  The only difference between Showgirls and Coyote Ugly is that Showgirls doesn't lie about what it is and hide under a PG-13 rating by removing the nudity and vulgarness that would be present at a bar of this type (I mean who are we kidding-has anyone ever been to a bar that has the moral standards of Sesame Street?).
0380973650|5.0|this is an excellent book with one of the most fantastic story lines that will hook anyone into the depths of the story with Gaiman's fantasic voice and way of story-telling. the book has great characters and the mysterious plot keeps getting thicker, why there isnt a part where u wont be reading just to find out what happens next! from a life threatening game of chess to a mysterious talk with a girl on the roof to robbing a bank this book will get u. if anyone likes mystery/fantasy/action/adventure books u will love this book! i can get very bored with books really quickly and i truely couldn't put this one down! neverwhere is also a really good book by neil gaiman!

0385505833|1.0|I am very dissapointed. I loved other John Grisham's books but this time he really missed the mark.<br />I was taken aback by the author's tendency to stereoyping characters, making some sterotypical expectations about their daughter's Peruvian boyfriend.<br />The characters are shallow and hypocritical.<br />Not worth the money I paid for it nor the time spent reading it.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Wow! The legendary John Williams does it again with this magical score to the instant classic film 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'.  You hear this score and just know that it's John Williams, he's just such a wonderful composer, the best film composer out there in my opinion.  The music here is just so magical and sets the mood for the film perfectly.  One of the first things my friends and I said after seeing the movie was &quot;Wow, that was a great soundtrack, we have to get it!&quot;.  Well, I had already purchased the soundtrack, as soon as it had become available infact.  I trusted John Williams enough to buy this soundtrack without hearing any of the music yet.  I was pleasantly surprised!<br />John Williams's magical theme song (Prologue) reoccrs constantly in the score.  Often it is incorporated seamlessly into other tracks, making for a beautiful, magical, and highly original score.  My favorite track is defintely 'Prologue'.  I just can't get over that magical theme!  'Harry's Wondorous World, 'Christmas at Hogwarts', and 'Entry into the Great Hall and The Banquet' are also some of my favorites, but all of the tracks are wonderous!  With nineteen tracks on here, you get well worth your money!  The packaging is lovely and comes with a free poster of Harry and Hedwig, his owl.  There are other colorful and high-quality pictures in the booklet.  You get a free soundtrack collector's card with a chance to win Harry Potter items.  There is also a lovely little note from Chris Columbus in the booklet about magic, the film, and the score, which I just loved reading.  A must own!
6305307261|5.0|I love the films of Werner Herzog made with the participacion of Klaus Kinski as main actor and with Popol Vuh's music -it would'nt be the same to me without these great musicians-. Fortunately there were other films I have seen they made together like \\"Aguirre\\" and \\"Fitzcarraldo\\". There are other examples of these succesful combinations as Blake Edwards&Peter Sellers&Henry Mancini's films.<br /><br />What is my opinion on Nosferatu, the vampire?...well, the first time I saw it -many years ago- I felt bored like some of the persons who gave their opinion. I think mostly when someone grows up can be able to enter in a kind of film like this. But, however it is needed a mentality that would consist in understand the nature of Werner Herzog's films. He always try to show the close connection between man and the earth, and he get it thanks to brilliant actors, quite long sequences with few dialogues and wonderful fusions into beautiful landscapes and sighs to contemplate dreamily, and...the most important!...accompanied by Popol Vuh's music.<br /><br />I specially enjoy the scene when Bruno&Isabelle walk in the beach embracing each other under a light mist and a strong wind blowing. I must say that I truly enjoy everything on the film, wich it is always a pleasure to me to watch and submerge quietly on its calmness, spirituality and beauty. This film is unique and extraordinary.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This album is not intended for old Floyd fans as they would already have all of these songs already. This album is for newbies, younger fans who need exposure to Pink Floyd. Granted even ten cds would not do Pink Floyd justice but that would not be cost effective. The songs picked represent different phases in Pink Floyds career. Even the band will atest that some of there older songs were very experimental, but it gives the listener a clue to the process that led the band to their later greatness. Say what you want but this is still an album worth buying.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The opening sequences were so overwhelming that I thought &quot;I'm gonna hate this movie&quot; then by the end of the movie, I thought &quot;I wasn't crazy about the way it was presented, but it was such a beautiful story.&quot; But a funny thing happened afterward--The movie has stayed with me ever since and I can't wait to see it again!  What can I say...I generally hate musicals, but this one is exceptional and very memorable.  I think it is my favorite movie of 2001 (but Fellowship of the Ring isn't out yet)...and it is positively the one I think about most.
0385484518|4.0|The book &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; by Mitch Albom is one of those books that you want to give to everyone. Morrie the teacher and Mitch the student meet and form a warm relationship when Mitch is Morrie's student at Brandeis University. Years later,when Mitch hears of Morrie's terminal illness he goes to see his old friend. Until the time of Morrie's death they spend every tuesday together working on Morrie's final lessons. Morrie was a simple man, who even in his last days wanted to give to others the keys to a life of love and happiness. Mitch, like most of us was on all the roads that lead us away from what is really important in life. <BR>    Morrie taught and lived a life of giving. He gave to his students and his friends. He lived and enjoyed his life talking and listening to those around him. Mitch said about Morrie, when he was with you he was really with you. He gave one all of his attention when he listened. One more of Morrie's lessons we could all leard from,to listen. <BR>    Morrie was a great teacher, he taught students, his friends, and those who read his lessons in this book. Anyone who is looking for what is and what is not important in life can benefit from this book. The book ends on a sad note as it ends with Morrie's death. It would be a stretch to say that this book gave me a feeling of happiness. It would be correct to say it made me think about what makes me happy, and why. One thing that I will always remember, Morrie told Mitch as they talked about his death. &quot;You live on in the hearts of everyone you have touched and nurtured while you were here.&quot;  So very true.

B000002MP2|5.0|(...)I got this cd (Dookie) (...)in 1994 when the album was first released. I still have it and I listen to every chance I get . All of the songs on the Dookie cd are \\"AWSOME\\". I have to say, every cd  that I buy I always skip though songs and always find songs that I don't really like. But this I say sincerely, I have never skiped though any songs on this cd and I never will.I love every single one of them, I just can't pick a favorite. So if you like punk music this is the one you need in your cd collection, and you will never take out of cd player. Sincerley Yours, Amy (...)
B00002Z88D|5.0|Now, I must admit that I have a bit of a personal bias here... I love both the music of Metallica and the rock/classical hybrid. So even though I usually don't enjoy listening to live music I pulled this one off the shelf the first day it came out and I believe it was the best choice I've ever made in my musical shopping. The lush, full sound of the San Fransisco Symphony Orchestra hides behind, plays on par with and sometimes even overpowers the legenday rock/metal band. Now old favorites make this album more like a Greatest Hits collection than a new recording but as die hard Metallica fans know nothing beats the classics like &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; and &quot;One&quot; even alongside newer material such as &quot;Fuel&quot; and &quot;The Memory Remains.&quot; A sweet suprise was two new tracks avaliable no where else &quot;No Leaf Clover,&quot; which was released as a single, and &quot;Human&quot;. Also included is &quot;The Extascy of Gold&quot; famous from the old Clint Eastwood movies. A must buy for the Metallica fan or even the new listener to the rock genre.
B000002BHE|5.0|This is the best selling album that Cline has released so far, it hit number one all around the world. With hits like It's All Coming Back To Me Now, Because You Loved Me, All By Myself and the bonus track (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Women and international bonus tracks such as: the spanish version of 'All By Myself' and I'm Your Light. Though it also spawned other hits from Europe, that was never release here: Falling Into You, Call The Man. The overall tone of this album is love, sadness and joy. With the English adaptions of If That's What It Takes and I Don't Know, with Fly taking the spot of Vole. This is, if not one of the best albums ever released.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Dude, for the folks bashing this album, let's have a little lesson:<BR>1) This disc is a compilation of Beatles songs that were #1 on the charts. They may not have your fav, ok? I think you'll live ;) ummm.. Also, I think most people buying a recording have an idea of what's on it.<BR>2) The music is the BEATLES. If you bought the album, then it's more than likely you've heard of the Beatles, gee and you may even like their music.. or should I dare say.. Love it? hmmm... dude, the music is Beatles ok? so let's give them a little credit for the quality of music which I know you all enjoy to some extent.<br />ok, enough nonsense. <BR>The album is fantastic of course. check it out.

0375704027|5.0|norwegian wood is my favorite beatles song.  i picked up this book for that reason.  it was the first murakami book i read, and different than the ones i have read since.  <br />like the song, norwegian wood is sweet and simple and sad.  i enjoyed the story of a young man's journey through an extraordinarily emotional terrain.  it has been a while since i have read this book, and i only hope that i can be fair in my review.  when i read it, i could not put it down.  i didn't want to.  i wanted to stay with him, through his love and pain and heartache.  i wanted to hold him through it.  to take care of him ...  this is the best kind of book, where you feel like you can step into the pages and take the hand of the characters - bring them through the pain.<br />when they talk about norwegian wood, the song, a simple melody, a memory, i know what they mean.  i understand.  because i love that song.  it is a memory to me.  a journey and an understanding.<br />norwegian wood sings, 'i once had a girl, or should i say, she once had me?'  that is this book.  this story.  this love.  she has him.  he thinks, maybe, he has her, but it is a fleeting grip.  a touch.  she has him the entire time.  and she doesn't let go.<br />i reccommend this book to anyone who has ever felt the loss of a first love.  to anyone who has ever loved at all.<br />it may not be like the rest of murakami's books.  there are no unicorn skulls or wind-up birds, but it doesn't matter.  this is a gentle look at a young man realizing what it is truly like to BE a man.  and all the hurt and glory that goes along with it.
0060977264|5.0|All of Coelho's stories use the symbolism of a journey.  Each ends up being a journey from brokenness to greater wholeness.  Each tale ends up describing a deep fundamental change in the life of his characters that inspires readers to look at their own lives and set out on their own journeys.<br />This tale combines both a spiritual journey and the quest for love. There are many sub-themes that are beautifuly worked into this tapestry; the relationship between erotic love and divine love...the need to dream and to follow one's dreams, the fear of seeing your loved one hurt by your dreams, the feminine face of God as a necessary element of our relationship with God...<br />This story draws heavily on Coelho's Catholic heritage--Brazil being a most Catholic of countries.  For those who share in this heritage it adds to the story, drawing on images and experiences that are easy to relate to and understand.  For those who do not share this heritage, Coelho does not make that lack an obstacle to entering into the story.  The story is complete in itself and will entertain you, nourish you and get you reflecting.<br />The book is very much in the style of The Alchemist, in that it is clearly a fable for our instruction.  For me it had something of an otherworldly quality, rather than the more gritty feeling of Valkyries or even Pilgrimage.  Yet, all the events described were concrete--even more so than Pilgrimage.  I think the otherworldly quality comes from the sense of love that pervades the tale like a soft mist.  Afterall, love is something of a divine madness, the intersection of the otherworldly with our very worldly lives.  Perhaps, Coelho meant to capture that quality in his telling of this tale.  If so, he has done an admirable job of it.

B00005QK3W|5.0|Finally no more silly love songs (still can't believe he wrote that song). This album is quite different from the bulk of Paul's chart topping material. Yet in a strange way it seems to fit very comfortably with his style. I can accept it as McCartney but at the same time it's worlds apart from \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". When I first heard \\"She's Given Up Talking\\" I thought to myself, he's finally done it. In an era where most pop kinda (...) (like George Harrison said before he died, you either got cutesy-wutesy (...), or hard-edged, dissonent (...)) Paul's album is a breath of fresh air. I just hope he'll be around and recording for many years to come. BUY IT NOW!!!!
6300215512|5.0|At his wits end and needing a job before getting his car repossed Joe Gillis (William Holden) has to get a job fast or sell what little he has and return to Ohio.

Upon discovering that the house isn't vacant but is occupied with a derranged washed up actress and her first producer husband who is now her butler.  At first she thinks he is the mortian to take care of her dead chimp.  When she finds out that he is a writter she offers him a job reading her script which he accepts afterall he needs money to keep his car and home.  <br />She wants him to stay at her home to complete the job. This is where she takes control of his life, moving him in, clothing him in the best attire money can buy and now to be a couple in her mind.  In her mind she thinks she is still a big star, signing pictures for her fans.  Gill plays the game with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) for as long as he could.  He gets fed up with her being stuck on hersef, yet feeling sorry for her because he knows that she is out of touch with reality.  He decides he can't take it anymore and wants to leave only she doesn't want him to.  <BR>She has already did the sucided trick so that won't do her any good and he's tired of looking at her home movies and playing gin with her tired friends.  He's young and he wants out. Only Norma isn't going to let him go quite so easily she kills him.<br />The flashback scene at the beginning was great.  I would look at this film again.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|No longer am I the 16 year old who spent hours on public transit searching the city for used record stores that could sell me a Prince bootleg cassette for $30 !  No more am I a 22 year old university student naively spreading the word that Prince is the greatest artist in the history of time.  No longer am I an unmarried 28 year old sitting around on Saturday nights defending Prince's  latest release....  I'm a bit older now and simply a lot wiser.  Prince's releases since the early 90s have been littered with below par material.  Of course this phenomenal talent still recorded a few jewels but for most it became too much to search through all the releases to identify those diamonds.  <br />Many have come up with many many differnet reasons why Prince was releasing so much avergage material.  My theory is simply :  He hasn't felt inspired in a very long time.  With &quot;the rainbow children&quot; you know for the start that he is on a major high.  This album is full of joy.  He has finally written some beautiful songs .  Great song writing coupled with the muscianship that is displayed on this record makes this album a one of the brightest jewels in his crown.  If you ever had any interest in Prince, then you can not ignore this album.  His guitar playing is passionate, his drummer has to be heard to be believed.  For the first time in ages he sounds like he is not distracted, like he is totally focused on the music.  Listen to the title cut with it's instrumental ending and tell me I'm wrong. Listen to 'The Last December&quot; and realize that it will never be a 'hit' - then understand that this man is capable of writing songs of this calibre but because he has left the record industry machine, great songs like this will be ignored.  Turn up &quot;everywhere&quot; and feel as inspired as Prince is singing it. Still not convinced ??  Then I suggest putting on &quot;1+1+1 is 3&quot; .<br />I agree with others, the deep voice is annoying but the music is <BR>so fullof life.  <br />Prince has been criticized enough.. he has finally answered the critics who have called him a 'has been'.  Long time listeners always believed he could.<br />RONNY
0553712837|4.0|This would be a perfect, annual Christmas TV program. I can see Raymond Barone from the TV sitcom playing the part of Luther Krank. He's supposed to be such a serious, dollar counting, sly man but his antics will crack you up. Nora's tanning bed scene made me laugh and I will always think of this book whenever I see a &quot;Frosty&quot; decorating anyone's yard!!!<br />I recommend everyone to read this cute, little book of modern day Christmas. It's an exaggerated story of all of us during the festive holidays....Pick this book up and read it, you'll be glad you did....Enjoy  :-)
B00005RFAI|4.0|I like this one but its nothing to write home about. Kinda goes downhill after the first 4 songs. The \\"damn britney\\" comment is kind of funny but she shows some immaturity with the \\"ex-lax\\" joke. I could live without that. Too many lyrics referencing teenage issues for my taste but I guess thats the perspective she writes from so one has to expect it. Also think she tries to hard to act ghetto. Personally, I'm glad to see her get away from R&B. Thats why I didnt buy the first one. Unfortunately, there is still some blues on here with that [bad]\\"Misery\\". \\"Get this party Started\\" is the best dance tune ever recorded - what great melody, so perfect. I'd give the album 3.5 stars. Very good.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This is the best Disney movie I have ever seen!
B000002UCN|4.0|I'm an unabashed George Harrison music fan, from both Beatle days and solo George Harrison.  The first seven titles of this disc are Beatles songs; the remaining six are solo efforts.  I couldn't call this disc a &quot;Best Of&quot; because of the strange assortment of songs, and the omission of so many George Harrison &quot;Bests&quot;.  But I will say that the songs on this disc are excellent tunes, and the disc is well worth adding to your collection, especially if you are new to Mr. Harrison.<br />As far as Beatles songs, no one will argue about the beauty of a song like &quot;Someone&quot;.  &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Taxman&quot; also feel like anthems, whereas lovely tunes like &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; gently transport the listener to a beautiful place.  George's solo work is equally impressive.  &quot;Give Me Love&quot; and &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; deservedly ascended to the top of the charts.  &quot;What Is Life&quot; is infectious pop that sticks in your head, and &quot;Dark Horse&quot; is a hard-to-find treasure.  This collection of songs is not George's best, but it is wonderful nonetheless.  Highly recommended!
B000007NYS|5.0|All of Lucinda William's CDs are well worth owning, but this one is a must-have.  A consummate songwriter, I completely disagree with reviewers who suggest she's a second-rate singer.  While her range is limited, beginning with this breakthrough recording she uses her superbly expressive voice with abundant skill and confidence, and conveys more sheer sincerity than any other vocalist I can think of.  There are at least a half-dozen masterpieces on this CD that will permanently find their way into your soul, and a very nice bonus is commentary by Lucinda on each song and several acoustic tracks not included on the original issue on the Rough Trade label.
B00005QCYC|5.0|This trilogy give us the opportunity to own a masterpiece of action and science fiction movies. Jurassic Park as a movie opened a new era of in Hollywood bringing this incredible creatures to live. The trilogy show that dinosaurs will live forever.......
6303148352|3.0|If I had to say one good thing about this film its that the effects on the dinosaurs are very good and the overall feel (including the soundtrack) is very professional. But that's where it ends. Because Dinosaurs capture the hearts of many children Speilberg probably thought that his remade models of these creatures would carry the film by themselves. WRONG.<br />This isn't even worth the comparison with the book. The first 120 odd pages are left out, not to mention about 80 pages taken from other places in the book. That's HALF THE BOOK. Really cool parts are just left out. And what's worse is that CHARACTERS are left out. Leaving out the technical stuff is all fair and good (it's great in a book but would be out of place in a film), but surely characters and whole scenes should stay in the film? There were relatively important characters in the book that appeared once or twice (if at all) in the film. Perhaps they were too adult to put in a film designed for the family, but its not a childrens story! If he wanted to do a spiritual sequal to ET then he shouldn't have chosen this film to do it!<br />Many other things are wrong as well - in the film Alan Grant hates kids, in the book he loves them. In the film, Grant and Sattler are implied to be some sort of item - in the book there's a 20 year age difference and she's his student. People die who survive in the book and vice versa. (...) The overall feel of the film, whilst being professional like I said earlier, is just too much like Hollywood.<br />There's too much effort to make it a simple plot (there are other themes that run through in the book) and the overall intention is to make this seem like a money-making blockbuster. It also misses out the important social commentry concerning science that the book makes (I'll leave that for you to find out). The book makes you believe that one day, maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to create dinosaurs. Of course you know it's not gonna happen, but for a short time, you feel like it just might be able to happen. The film on the other hand just seems like the fantasy that it is.<br />Speilberg was great with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, and he proved that he could make gritty, powerful and realistic films. Here, I wasn't so impressed. Next time Steve, don't waste such great technology and such a fantastic story on such a one-dimensional family film.feel like it just might be able to happen.

B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam may be the best and most talented band in history!  They brought back classic rock and roll when it was dying.  This is their heaviest cd, for those of you who like more modern rock, this is the Pearl Jam cd for you.  This is a perfect cd from a perfect band, and was made while the band was deeply in love with their music.  Don't let the rabid whatever it is, on the cover scare you away....
B00005Q45W|5.0|This albums sounds like it was designed expressly to play in shadowy basement rooms on ridiculously expensive hi-fi. It's just so smooth and downright *liquid* sounding. I was worried that the bare instrumentation and simple arrangements would get boring, but Sharon Robinson (who should have gotten co-credit for the album) does a brilliant job with synths, bass and background vox. It sounds haunting. The recording quality is crytsalline, really allowing the listener to enjoy every nuance. The songs are hymnlike and very reflective. There is also a certain economy to the language which makes them some of the best and tightest compositions of Cohen's long career.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is definitely the Red Hot Chili Peppers best cd.  They mix hip hop, metal, and classic rock to form their own unique tasty style.  If you like ANY kind of rock, this cd is for you!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|The Beatles. Some say the inventors of pop music, and undeniably the biggest boy band of all time. Through the years, the Beatles have put out some incredible songs. The solo careers of both John and Ringo proved successful and left us with some of the finest music of all time. <br /> Judging by this, however, it's very difficult to believe. While the album includes some beautiful songs like &quot;Yesterday,&quot; &quot;All You Need Is Love,&quot; &quot;From Me to You,&quot; and &quot;Lady Madonna,&quot; it includes very little essential material. The obvious are on here, but some of their best works and biggest hits(especially &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;) are replaced by filler (like &quot;Paperback Wiriter&quot;). <br /> Though this is a decent collection of basic hits, it displays very little of the Beatles writing capabilities and still less of their power with lyrics. Some of their best songs were never #1 hits and some of their very worst were. While it is a nice introduction to the Beatles, it's nothing compared to the power of John's &quot;Imagine.&quot; The best words of advice I can give: Buy the remastered White Album or Abbey Road. They're much more enjoyable than this egotistic trip down #1 lane.
0783242808|5.0|I loved this movie about four &quot;unlucky in love&quot; high school friends who make the ultimate pact: lose their virginity by prom night. As they try to manipulate their way into the...hearts of some of their classmates, their plans often backfire with hilarity. This movie is great, funny movie. But I think that American Pie 2 is not going to be as good. It's worth the money especially the unrated version.

0553227246|5.0|&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; is a metaphysical mystery as well as a hilarious satire.  &quot;The Courier's Tragedy&quot; is probably the funniest episode I have ever read.  However, there is much more to this book than meets the eye.  In fact, I'd recommend, after you read it, to go back and re-read it with the help of J. Kerry Grant's Companion.  There are many allusions in this work that you probably weren't aware of (I sure wasn't) that make the mystery of the book all the more intriguing.  Though it is Pynchon's shortest novel, &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; packs enough paranoia into its pages to fill a thousand page epic.  This is probably his most accessible book, but do not be fooled: it is no easy read.  However, the rewards of it are well-worth the necessary efforts put forth.
B000002UC5|3.0|There are several good songs, including the original studio version of &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed,&quot; but a lot of it sounds like he made it up as he went along.  I'd say it was of historical interest, being his first solo album, but otherwise a bit of a disappointment.
0394178009|5.0|&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is a sheer joy to read.  The protagonist is one of the greatest comic creations of the twentieth century.  In John Kennedy Toole we find yet another example of a staggering talent of whom we can only now say &quot;what if...&quot;  However, I think we are extremely lucky to at least have this gracious gift of his left behind.  &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; will be providing laughing fits for centuries to come.
B000002OYB|4.0|Six years have passed since the 14th of November 1995 , the date this album was released . During this long period of time , Meat Loaf hasn't introduced anything new for the awaiting fans . This fact saddens me quite a bit , for I admire his music so much . I remember waiting eagerly for &quot;Welcome To The Neighborhood&quot; , after I'd come to know and love the two &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; albums .<br />I also remember that I warned myself not to expect too much , because I knew it was hard to repeat a major success like that the one &quot;Bat II&quot; had accomplished . Nevertheless , as soon as it had hit the stores I was the first to purchase the much awaited product , because I'm still a loyal fan . At first listen , as I expected , it wasn't as catchy as its predecessor , but I wasn't worried , after a few more cycles of listening the good songs just couldn't get out of my head , rerunning for days (and nights) .<br />I've read some reviews claiming that Meat tried to threepeat his former major successes without Steinman , and failed to achieve it - I disagree ; In the album itself , Steinman himself indeed is not as dominant as before in the writing rubric , conducting only two songs - 'Original Sin' and 'Left In The Dark'. However , that doesn't say anything about the level of the other songs present . Anyway , 'Left In The Dark' is one of the best in the album , very touchy and sad , and  I recall that while being a rookie in the army in '96 I was humming this song over and over to 'pass the time' in all the long shifts of guarding ...<br />As for the other songs - 'Not A Dry Eye in The House' is remarkable, and seems like a natural follow-up to 'Left In The Dark' , even though not written by Steinman . This song together with 'I'd Lie For You' really managed to recapture the magic of the melodramatic, grandiose and philharmonic rock ballads that Meat had created along with Steinman in ,for instance , 'I'd Do Anything For Love'(II) and 'For Crying Out Loud'(I) . Now , if this is not a testimony that Meat can manage without steinman , what is ? At the same breath, 'Martha' and 'Where Angels Sing' caught a glimpse of the more subtle , tender ballads, like 'Lost Boys and Golden Girls' (II)  and 'Heaven Can Wait'(I) , representing the  gentle side of Meat Loaf, showing how delicate the man can become .<br />As always , the hard rock songs exist in the shape of 'Where The Rubber Meets The Road' and 'Running For The Red Light', to name the better ones . Altogether, they are acceptable and even audible , but at the same time, represent the weaker part of the album .<br />All in all , the album worth the money , and I've never regretted buying it . It's a pity Meat's decided to focus his artistic efforts on motion pictures , and to completely neglect his vocal talent . Therefore , I would like to address the admired artist , and say :  Meat , if you ever read this , know that my brother and I will be waiting for your new releases , and the sooner - the better . Your star still shines !Loud'(I) . Now , if this is not a testimony that Meat can manage without steinman , what is ?

0440204399|5.0|&quot;Catch 22&quot; is one of the funniest books anyone's ever read.  I use that phrasing intentionally because pretty much everyone who's read it, it seems, considers it one of the funniest books they've ever read.  In fact, it's difficult to imagine anyone not finding this book utterly charming, despite the obvious dark themes which any novel about war will address.  Nearly every single character in this work is hilarious, though they are extremely varied-no two are alike.  This book shouldn't take very long for anyone to read, even though they'll probably be interrupted constantly by their own incessant gut-laughing.
0784011206|4.0|In the beginning of the eighties ,\\"Rambo\\" seemed to come from nowhere , but winded up setting the standard for a long series of films , in which the main theme was violence and carnage brought to the extreme.<br />\\"Rambo\\" is indeed which it was the opening shot for, but also has an extra value included - the violence stands for something you can understand, sympathy and identify with.<br /><br />When released, Stallone was already a big star after the three Rockies. It turned up that Rambo has established his stature to even a higher ground, and would be the character he'd be most recognized with worldwide from that day on.<br /><br />An ex-green berets, Vietnam War fighter wanders through the wrong All-American small town. He is captured and tormented for no obvious reason. Manages to escape and consequently is hunted down and decides to fight back and retaliate.<br /><br />There is one thing I dare to claim not as many as before remember , or attribute major importance to , and that's the closing speech of Rambo , which embodies the essence of the entire movie , and clarifies its message in a crystal clear way . This monologue gives the film its right to exist and to stand tall along with other influencing motion pictures of that time . I think that in this single scene Stallone gave one of the best performances of his life .<br /><br />After all that had happened - all the blood that had been spilled, all the men that had been killed , all the suffering so many had suffered , all the agony , pain and horror - after almost killing the man that had been responsible, in Rambo's view, to it all - he bursts out crying in the presence of his training officer and mentor , Colonel Trautman , and finally start talking . Watching this scene is so hard that tears might fill your eyes , because all the wrong and unjust in regard to the treatment of America of Post Vietnam War towards its returning soldiers is cried out loud ; Rambo and so many other soldiers came back to the U.S , as victims and survivors of the horrors of Vietnam , only to discover that not so many had missed them . The frustration of the American society from the fiasco in Vietnam was thrown in the faces of those lost boys , that did not understand what hit them .<br /><br />All this burden and more is vented in the mentioned above Epilogue , and there is no comfort in any reply Trautman could come up with , because there is no excuse to these sins of society that represent the ugly side of human nature . Stallone plays convincingly like he really was Rambo - a victim and a want to be survivor of the gloomy reality , and you then can better understand him - what he was all about , why , his violence , rage and the bloodshed he so expertly conducted .<br /><br />At that time (1982) , nearly ten years after the end of the war , these issues were still troubling , burning and unresolved in he American society . Nowadays , even twenty years after the movie has hit the screens , I think that not everything is forgiven and people still suffer from the consequences of that war . Maybe this movie , among many others that were made on the same subject (\\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Born On The Fourth Of July\\" to mention a few), should stand as a memoriam to the personal , often swept away , problems caused by wars , and for the terrible price single individuals must pay if they manage to stay alive and survive hell .

B00005N9CV|5.0|Grab your significant other, make a fire in the fireplace, pour the wine, and relax.  Diana Krall has hit another home run in the name of romance.  Sultry, diverse, and just plain sexy, this album will warm you up on the coldest winter night.  Krall performs &quot;The Look of Love&quot; as masterfully as I have ever heard it.  &quot;S'Wonderful&quot; is an absolute homage to Gershwin, and &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; is so good, it could even resurrect Astaire for one more spin around the floor.  This album is terrific.
B00005LOUS|2.0|OK, I admit Carrey gave a lot of good, witty lines to his character in this film. Watching scenes with him alone in his cavern is simply a pleasure, but everything surrounding those scenes is dull, dreary, and damn near unbearable. The sets are colourful but the hazy photography doesn't let them shine through. This film was more depressing than uplifting: at a certain point I just couldn't wait until it finished. Especially from director Ron Howard this is an appalling mess of a film. Let's hope his upcoming A BEAUTIFUL MIND is better.
B00005QDW5|2.0|I am going to make this short. I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan, and I must say that I am very disappointed with 'Echoes'. It lacks songs that people really need to hear. Songs like &quot;Have A Cigar&quot; &quot;Welcome To The Machine&quot; and also &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;. My main reccomendation is to not buy this. If you want to start with something, start with Dark Side Of The Moon, or Wish You Were Here. Later, explore The Wall and all others. And one more thing, don't buy this only for &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot;. That has much more meaning to the movie than standing alone in a poorly put together &quot;hits&quot; compilation.
0618002227|5.0|This is the best book in the trilogy. It is more detailed then an autobiography. If you do not own this book i advise you to buy it. it has been rated the best book ever and i agree.<BR>I would also like to say the people that rate on what the book looks like are rating for the wrong reason, because i saw i guy saying it was one of the best books he has ever read but he gave it on star because how it looks. Frodo is a better character than Bilbo was in the hobbit.<br />      Loads of supporting characters:Aragorn or Strider, Faramir, Sam Gamgee, Meriadoc, Peregin, Boromir, Bilbo, Gandalf, Eomyr, and Galadriel. One problem is Aragorn or Strider should have had a bigger role. Bilbo has a big role even though he is not in it alot that is very respectable. I like that the ring did not exclude Bilbo in its power.<br />      The mission is very clear and precise but how to get it done is shady and i like that. I like how they set up the dark lord and his minions(orcs). The book set it up so i could not avoid the second book(the two towers). This is a 10 star work.<br />      This is the best book Tolkien has ever written. <br />      This a classic masterpiece and I will not dissagree. I know I am just 12 and you will think i dont know what i am talking about but i do and i would like you to read this. This book would be suitable for ages 10 and up. This would be a book any kid would like to see under the tree on Christmas.<br />      The book has loads of facts: four Family trees, the rune alphabet, and an Index split into sections for easy info. there is not enough words to explain this instant masterpiece. You will never want to put this book down.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is one of my best DVDs as it's fully loaded with extra features and of course a great movie.<BR>You feel that is real and you are into this story from the beginning. It quite a long movie but I enjoyed all of it.<BR>I even enjoyed the scenes that finally were cut as I had to hear director's comments. There is also an hour documentary on the history of gladiators and believe it is very interesting. You will enjoy finally the how was shooted part where you will see all the fantastic graphics and tricks as well as laugh with Russel's Crow comments. I recommend this DVD to everyone that starts to build a quality DVD movie collection.
B00005QXXO|4.0|This album, in many ways, is a bitter pill for me to swallow.  I had tickets to see Radiohead play Bull Run, VA. - a show that was rained out and cancelled.  So &quot;I might be wrong&quot; is really the only chance I have to hear the band play material from the last two albums live.<br />On the whole, the album is very successful.  In many cases I prefer the more straight forward or energetic versions performed live to the studio versions.  Highlights include the gorgeous &quot;Like Spinning Plates,&quot; the frenetic &quot;Idioteque,&quot; and the warped and spiraling &quot;Everything in its Right Place.&quot;  <br />&quot;True Love Waits&quot; is a beautiful and haunting song, and the version on this album is the best recording of it available, but Thom's vocals sound a little thin compared to bootlegged versions available online.  Still, it's great to finally have a CD version of one of my favorite Radiohead songs.<br />The only disappointing track, for me, is the title track.  The dissonance Radiohead has successfully embraced over the last two years just doesn't work here.  The album version is clearly superior.  Still and all, a nice sampling of Radiohead's tour-de-force live show that will whet my appetite until the next tour, when Radiohead better return the Baltimore/Washington area!

Full of ska and since I currently redside 'unfortunatly' in Orange County where they happen to be from, I have much interest in the SoCal ska and neo-punk that comes out of here. I love this album and give it five stars for its unconventional lyrics and wonderful drum and bass solos'. Gwen Stefani has some of the best hair I have ever seen and had a unique and thouroughly enjoyable, quirky voice. I recommend this cd to anyone who is looking for fast-tempo, upbeat, ska that is always going to cheer anyone up.

0451197968|5.0|At the same time, I found this both to be one of the most enjoyable, and one of the most disturbing, of Stephen King's books.  It is definitely Richard Bachman style over King's usual subtle psychological horror.  The book is also much better than the movie.<br />The events take place in the future, when the television networks have more or less taken over political power.  The economic distinction between classes is much more stark, and the only opportunity for the poor to rise through the socio-economic ranks is to volunteer for life-threatening game shows.<br />The protagonist, a married victim of the old economy who is unable to find suitable employment, is unable to pay for basic medication that would save his infant daughter's life.  And so the financial allure of the games tempt him.<br />The story is well-told, but brutal in its telling.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Before I listened to Johnny Cash at San Quentin I did not listen to much music at all.  After this wonderful album I found my calling in the Johnny Cash dudes.  Some would say he does too much talking between songs, I disagree, The talk and jokes add to the fun of this album.<br />If you like Pop, rap, goth, rock, or country you will like this album it feeds all taste.  Just listen to the samples and you will get the feel of this wonderful peace.  I am surprised the album is not flying off the shelves after the terrorist attacks.  It is American all the way.
0783230710|5.0|I was reluctant to see this movie because it was &quot;so predictable.&quot; I thought it was reminiscent of Titanic (which was not good, in my opinion) and did not see it until it came out on video. I loved it. Tom Hanks did a phenomenal job acting, and the movie is well written and well scored. Ron Howard's commentary on the DVD is great as well as the Lovell's. A must buy.
0553106635|5.0|I keep reading in these reviews how George is not afraid to &quot;kill off&quot; main characters.  Now first off I dont think I totally agree, and secondly I dunno if I would want to mention that in a review.  I know that when my first &quot;favorite&quot; character bit the dust (no names, but he was a solemn lord) I was a bit shocked.  This guy had been DEVELOPED for petes sake!!  Well, Let me just say that I bet George doesnt Want to kill off anyone, but probably has to.  We all read History, just look at the Turnover to Communist Russia, poor Czar.  There was a REAL game of thrones.  I digress tho, dont I?  George, sees that in this brutal land, and war, people die.  Good, bad and ugly, no one escapes.  I read alot of names in book two that were no more than that.  But I betcha some cash that Ole George Has them characters figured out too.  The meat and mead of this series folks, rises and falls with its characters.  the plot twists and turns, as it should, but its the Characters that make us care.  SO, if you dont like character driven, and plot twisty books, and/or Fantasy, please dont buy these books...correction, buy em, and endorse an amazing author.<BR>   We are all eagerly awaiting the next installment, to be sure, me as much as anyone, so lets read our present copies to tattered remnants, and look to a day when book 4 is out.<br />Ryan Z<BR>PS, Winter is Coming...no really...in Canada its snowing and miserable.  :-)
0790729644|5.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Clint Eastwood, hence I had to buy this DVD. Clint does a great job acting and directing this gem, although some viewers may be marred by its apparent slowness. Unforgiven is unlike many of Clint's other westerns in that it explores the pain and anguish of death, and the audience is also exposed. Younger and squemish viewers may not find the violoence appropriate, but it certainly is vital to the theme of the picture. For those who are interested in Eastwood's action (as seen in Dirty Harry et al), the ending with the big \\"shoot out,\\" where he declares he'll hunt down and kill any man's family, friends, and dog, if he tries to kill him may please, but overall the film is very melancholy, and certainly oscar material.
0395389496|5.0|Reading to your child is good for both of you.  The experience strengthens your bond.  Your example also helps your child to learn to read.  Pick a good book, and you will have enriched your child's life in ways that would not otherwise be possible.  Reading The Polar Express aloud is a good opportunity to accomplish these worthwhile results.<br />This delightful Christmas story raises a challenging question for parents:  For whom is this book appropriate?  The text suggests that some children and parents (and almost all people as they get older) don't believe in Santa.  In addition, the story is filled with things parents tell their children never to do when parents are not around (such as take a ride with strangers, eat food and drink beverages from strangers, and accept gifts from strangers).  If you decide to read the story to a very wee one, you should also be prepared for the possibility that your child might be frightened by the idea that all of this commotion can happen on Christmas Eve near your house.<br />My conclusion is that the optimum time to read this story is the first time you become aware that your child is a little confused or skeptical about Santa.  This often occurs after seeing the 17th Santa in a mall or store during the same shopping trip.  You could use the multiplicity of Santas to explain why some children and adults are skeptical about these Santa's helpers.  Obviously, we all know that Santa is really busy at the North Pole.  I suggest that you handle the \\"unapproved\\" behavior by asking your child if she or he should do these things, and reinforce the proper lessons.<br />The story itself centers on faith.  A man remembers one Christmas Eve.  The Polar Express pulls up in front of his house when he was a boy and a conductor invited him on board for a trip to the North Pole.  During a mystical trip with a train full of children, the boy learned that one of the children will be selected by Santa to receive the very first gift of that Christmas.  The boy was chosen, and wanted a silver bell from Santa's sleigh.  Santa was delighted to provide it . . . and roared off in the sleigh to deliver toys to all the good little boys and girls.  The boy discovered he'd lost the bell, and was sad.  \\"It broke my heart to lose the bell.\\"  The Polar Express brought him home before dawn.  The next morning, he discovered one final present with his name on it.  It was the bell!  Santa had attached a note, \\"Found this on the seat of my sleigh.  Fix that hole in your pocket.\\"<br />The bell \\"made the most beautiful sound my sister and I had ever heard.\\"  \\"When I'd shaken the bell, my parents had not heard a sound.\\"<br />\\"At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them.\\"<br />\\"Though I've grown older, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe.\\"<br />I still believe in Santa . . . don't you?<br />The Polar Express won the 1986 Caldecott Medal for its outstanding illustrations.  These images appear to be a combination of gouache and pastels that create a mysterious, dreamlike feeling in me.  They are not the same as a dream though, more like being half-awake in the middle of the night on an overnight train trip and still being a little into a dream.  Each image is spread across almost all of a two-page spread with a little text to the side.  If you child holds the book close to her or his face, it will be easy to join into the scene.<br />Live with faith in the true spirit of Christmas every day!ristmas.

B00005OM4N|5.0|When I first bought this album, I wasn't feelin' it. But after listening to it a couple of time more, I really started to like it! The beats are great and the lyrics are very catchy.<br />1.I'm A Slave 4 U - A great first single with a great beat to go with it. Britney may say she is a slave for the music, but we alll know what she is really talking about.<br />2.Overprotected - This song really shows how Britney feels about wanting to be an independent woman. She really is tired of being overprotected.<br />3.Lonely - This is one of the songs that Britney wrote herself. It has a good hook and she wrote the lyrics very well.<br />4.I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - This is practically the only ballad on the album. Dido helped write this track and the video isn't too bad either.<br />5.Boys - She really likes those boys. But if she is a woman now, wouldn't she want a man? Dosn't matter, this song is still good.<br />6.Anticipating - A very girly, bubblegum sounding song. A good song and she does a really cool performance of this at her show.<br />7.I Love Rock 'N' Roll - Originally sang by Joan Jett, this remake is, in my opinion, better than the 80s version.<br />8.Cinderella - This is my favorite song on the album. She is basically telling this guy that she is tired of being this guy's &quot;cinderella&quot; and she is getting away from him. It really reminds me of Stronger.<br />9.Let Me Be - Not one of my favorites but still a great song. It is also on the On The Line soundtrack.<br />10.Bombastic Love - My second favorite song on the album. The lyrics are wonderful and is just a very well thought out song.<br />11.That's Where You Take Me - This is the &quot;Sometimes&quot; of her new album. It is an ok song but not one of my favorites.<br />12.What It's Like To Be Me -  A duet with Justin really proved useful for this song. If she releases this as a single, she should promise to herself to stay with Justin and not do what Jessica Simpson did.<br />In the end, this is a Grade A Album and should be in everyones CD collection.
6302561841|5.0|While it is only the first Charlie Chaplin movie I have seen, I am already prepared to say that this is one of his best works. In this memorable, hilarious and touching movie, Chaplin takes on the modern era along with his newfound girl friend (Paulette Goddard) in a quest for happiness.<br />Chaplin is a factory worker at a rather boring factory controlled by a boss who talks to his employees through screens (If that's not television, then I don't know what it is). With the same lame, repetitive work each day, Chaplin suffers a breakdown and is sent to the hospital. He recovers and is released, only to be arrested for accidentally being the leader of a communist parade. Goddard is a homeless girl who struggles everyday to live. Chaplin and Goddard eventually meet and the two vow to get a new home, \\"Even if I have to work for it!\\"<br />There are countless memorable sight gags in Modern Times. My favorite is when Chaplin, employed as a mechanic's assistant, gets his boss stuck in a machine. Another equally memorable gag is when Chaplin, in prison, gets hyperactive after sprinkling `Nose Powder' on his food and inadvertently adverts a prison break.  <br />There is much symbolism in this movie. For most of the film, the only things that have sound are mechanical objects such as machines, cars and radios. But for most of the film (As he was through the beginning of the silent era) Chaplin refuses to talk. His memorable song at the end, however, seems to show that he had given up and was ready to enter the modern times of cinema. If only all \\"Comedians\\" these days could be as funny or creative. I guess that's the \\"Modern Times\\" for you.

B00003CXGG|5.0|The main reason why I like this movie so much was because it had a very fresh feel to it. It's something I haven't seen before. The mixing of Chinese and Black characters is very new to Hollywood and makes this movie one of a kind. The fight scenes were also very fun to watch even if the special effects and editing got in the way at times. Also, the subtle humor keeps this movie so fun to watch that I might even consider this a comedy, well, an action comedy anyway. The DVD extras were also fun to see. There were short interviews with many actors during the behind the scenes. The addition of the music video was also a nice feature.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Im hesitant to say this, but it might be on my top 20 list of best albums I've ever heard. Some said like spinning plates was dissapointing, it one of the best. Second only to Pyramid song I think. Hunting bears remided me so much of Black Sabbath's Laguna Sunrise. Knives out was a good but not so good to be recognized as the best single. I might be Wrong had me playing it over and over again. Pyramid song is the best, I especially love playing it as loud as possible. Pulk/pppull revolving doors sounds really annoying at first, but after a while its not so bad and then you really start to enjoy it.
0679721037|4.0|Hiroshima, by John Hersey, is about the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and what happened to six people before and after the explosion.  The author describes well in the book how terrible and awful the Hiroshima was after the bomb.  I am a high school student who have never experienced war.  This book helps people who has never experienced war to understand how terrible and awful the war is.  It has been more than 50 years since the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima.  However, there are many people who are still suffering from the aftereffect of the atomic bomb today.  After you read this book, your perspective of an atomic bomb would be different.  I believe that we should never use the bomb again.  I suggest to read this book, especially if you have never experienced war.  I hope peace will be with us in our world forever.

B00005QG9J|4.0|I was pretty excited about this CD, and bought it the first day it came out. I love &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot; is one of my favorite songs, plus &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is good stuff. So I was very anxious when I put this CD in to my walkman for the first time.<br />Right away we are treated to &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, by far my favorite song on this CD. It has the stinging quality of past songs &quot;Pardon Me&quot; and &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. I was feeling very good after this track, and it continued through &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.<br />After track 4 started, I began to get worried. I lost the rhythm somehow and the every track blended together (except for the last &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;). Granted this is excellent music, but I really lost track of what song I was on. This was disappointing as nothing seemed to stand out.<br />Overall I would recommend this CD if you liked &quot;Make Yourself&quot; or any of the Incubus singles you've heard. It's a solid, if indistinguishable, CD.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I fell in love with this film the very first time i saw it. To put it simply it is a masterpiece, a superb thriller from Luc Besson. You have to see the uncut version to get the true feel of the relationship that developes between the loner, moody  hitman Leon and the girl he takes under his wing after her parents are murdered by corrupt DEA agents (brilliantly played by Natalie Portman). Gary Oldmans performance is truly terrifying (and at times over the top) as the rogue cop gone bad.
