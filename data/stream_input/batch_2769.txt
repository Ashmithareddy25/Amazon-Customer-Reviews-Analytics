B005IEGUDY|3.0|Good history novel.  A little long at 1200 pages though.  I was expecting some of the details to be tied together throughout the book and at the end, but they never were.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Lee Child's books don't vary. The stories are different but the quality is constant.<br />Recommend them to anyone who loves reading.
B002N7RAH4|5.0|Hot Fuzz covers the spectrum of humor, from over-the-top slapstick to subtle dry British wit.  If you've ever wondered how quaint country villages remain that way, this movie reveals the answer.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Show is fast paced and smart. Sexy as hell, impeccably dressed. Things are not what they seem and you get to know and love the characters. What else do you need?
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is a great combination of sly comedy and drama. Perfect character presentation and development. This is my idea of entertaining TV watching. Crackling dialog; always enjoyable.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great for every situation, music and movies, even for moving around the house while doing the cleaning! recommend for all
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is my first foray into hidden object games, and it was pretty cool. It has a cute story, zany characters, and the voice acting didn't make me cringe. Best of all, it was the free app of the day for my kindle! Unfortunately, it doesn't have too much replay value, as once you solve everything, what's left to do? So you just let it hang around on your cloud until you forget everything, and start over. XD  I would recommend this to someone who likes hidden object/puzzle games, and I would definitely try another of these games in the future. It downloaded no problem, and the gameplay flowed nicely, so no technical problems with this game on my end. Someone mentioned that it didn't save their location when they left the game, so this made me paranoid to leave it until I finished it! Great way to spend a rainy day, LOL.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Lots of action and it's entertaining. The cast is the best thing about the movie - everyone seems to be having a good time.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This is a great app, but the recent update has ruined it. It is now clunky, slow, and nearly impossible to use. I've spent some money on this, but I quit. I'll be finding a different app to use until it's updated to fix the mess created by this horrible &quot;update.&quot;
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|nice it takes long to build money but overall good job. they step this type of strategic game up it is time consuming
B007FJFDXS|3.0|This game is kind of fun. You have to tri to get a block in a hole. But to get to the whole, you have to go through kind of a maze. I think the game could be better buy not bad for a while.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Good movie. Interesting twist to it. I'm not a psychological thriller person but I'd recommend it. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
0802473156|4.0|A good rule of thumb for any relationship, friendship, associates at work, family members and especially love interests, good reading for anyone.
0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One takes place in a futuristic, dystopian society where many members of the population find an escape from reality in a virtual world called the Oasis. The story begins after the world's richest man, David Halliday, dies and leaves his entire fortune to the first person who can find his hidden \\"easter egg\\" somewhere inside the Oasis.<br /><br />I really liked this book; it was a lot less morbid than I thought it was going to be. I think that this novel may be geared more towards guys rather than girls because the main character is male, but I really enjoyed it despite that.<br /><br />I also liked that the action started almost immediately, and there was very little down time once the story got going.<br /><br />I'm definitely glad I took the time to read it. This is a great read for any gamer!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is really easy at first, but gets increasingly hard. The goal of the game is to make a sickness that will kill the world. It involves a lot of time but, is really fun
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good app to pass the time... wish there were more levels. Challenging enough to be thought provoking but not too difficult overall...
B00AB7HESI|4.0|As promised, this is the same Scribblenauts fun I've enjoyed on the Nintendo DS.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's *very* short.  I suppose given the 99c price tag vs the DS's $20 it shouldn't be that surprising, and I still felt like I got my dollar's worth, but I was a bit sad that the base game was missing simpler additions like the Advanced Mode of previous games where you have to solve the same level 3 times without reusing any words.  We're talking maybe an hour or so of gameplay on the first go, although like other scribblenauts games the replay value is limited only by your imagination.<br /><br />I haven't yet done the in-app purchase for the other levels, but I expect I will eventually since I find it hard to believe that I wouldn't eventually get another dollar's worth of fun out of this.
140006922X|3.0|I was looking forward to what I expected to be a humanizing book about a person I admire for courage, love and truth-telling and how well that fit the profile of a \\"Zealot.\\"<br /><br />The \\"Life and Times\\" chapters are, as per other reviewers, Aslan's retelling of contemporary scholarship regarding Palestinian life, Temple practices and Roman empire. However, for anyone new to the vast array of scholarly literature about the life of Jesus, while much of the information is factual, sorting through opinion and conjecture (e.g.,Jesus was really a disciple of John the Baptist), is daunting, and if you say to a room of 50 theologians, \\"Fill in the blank:_________: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,\\" you'll get 50 different answers.<br /><br />That's why I found his use of \\"Zealot,\\" particularly unsatisfactory, and not because I don't agree. I'm perfectly happy with Jesus standing with the poor and proclaiming the coming Kingdom in defiance of the Temple/Roman powers that be. I certainly agree with the fact that he lived in a \\"zealot\\" and crucifixion culture. Things get stretched though when Aslan begins to talk about Jesus' core message. It did contain the words: \\"The Kingdom of God is at hand.\\" But that was not followed by any zealot call: \\"Down with the Romans!\\" And, although Aslan mentions that the \\"Messianic secret\\" seems authentic and that Jesus privately asked the disciples, \\"Who do you say that I am?\\" None of them said, \\"Some say a Zealot.\\" At very critical points, Jesus instead connects himself to prophets, to fulfillment of prophecy in terms of salvation, and not to zealots - the first part of the gospel call, \\"Repent,\\" issues out of a long prophetic tradition, and as to his identity, all guesses were \\"prophets\\" prior to the Messiah.  Those are just 2 examples but, it's just not easy to pull \\"zealot\\" out of that hat - unless you're a Roman.<br /><br />Granted, this book doesn't claim to be about the person of Jesus. So my expectation to find new insight into his motives, frustrations, reasoning, love for people, relationships,  went unmet. And in accordance with current theology, Paul also takes a beating.<br /><br />There is, last of all, an unhappy, pervasive assumption in the scholarly community that  unwashed, illiterate, peasant followers could scarcely pull together enough brain cells among them to remotely understand the complexities of theology! It's embarrassing to continue to read this kind of prejudice. And it comes from scholars who mix with plenty of wealthy entrepreneurs who never got a degree, but because of their money they are never treated with disrespect. How could James have disputed Paul's line of thought if he was too dense to understand it? Paul is not easy for any reader! Did Jesus simply pop on to the scene out of nowhere (even if he was briefly John's disciple)? No, like others seeking a holy life, he studied and prayed during the decade of his 20's and then went out to teach.  The poor may surprise the scholarly - they develop their own intelligence to survive.<br />Matthew 11:25 But enough of my zeal.<br /><br />Life and Times: Interesting<br />Zealot: Yes, but more than a zealot is here.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|This book had everything. Suspense, romance, history and a complex main character. I plan to read all Nesbo's books, in order, because Harry Ho,e is so engagingly flawed.
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies has quickly become one of my favorite sci-fi shows!  I am unable to walk away from my computer when I am watching this!

B004TI5N38|5.0|I like his fast paced mysteries, even though they always have almost comically climactic endings. I guess it's just the good writing, and characters, I find entertaining.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Fun, action packed, and helps me kill time before between and after classes. Lots of leveling up and new challenges everyday. Waiting for the third of the series to be released.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It a really nice read and an amazing addition to the first book. I can't wait to read the third.!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|FUN, exciting quick, excellent graphics lots of different avenues to explore ~ quickly tho. At 60+ years young, I'm having as much fun as the little girl next door does. On my list (short list) of faves...
0375869026|5.0|Touching story with lessons on so many levels.  I plan to share this story with my students.  It is a great starting point for conversations about acceptance, resiliency in the face of adversity, and so many other topics.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this trilogy. I don't like reading stuff on the kindle but this was worth it. I was great.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book! It was the best one in the series yet! Love, drama, action, suspense, and passion all in one book. Who could ask for more?!?!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Great help for my computer illiterate husband search the web for the things he is looking for with is Kindel
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Obviously an incredibly amount of work went into this movie, every time I watch it I see something I never noticed before. Tons of foreshadowing, great script, entertaining plot. It's not some dumb parody movie that just makes fun of a genre and has no real plot, this is a completely stand alone great film and deserves every bit of praise it gets.
B001DJLD1M|4.0|I like it but the only problem is that I live in australia and my country code is 4.<br />Amazon sent me DVD's for a contry code 1 and none of my Australian products allow me to watch it.<br />Is there any way of getting it replaced?<br />sincerely,<br />Lehel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love this app so much i have it on my other device but i wish other places where free
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Very good movie. A movie for adults, also a movie to get ideas for Halloween. My favorite song in the movie is Time Warp
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It really is crazy how fun this game is. At first the kids and I were playing it and then my husband saw and had to get involved. Definitely a game the whole family can get involved with.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I like it but the only problem is that I live in australia and my country code is 4.<br />Amazon sent me DVD's for a contry code 1 and none of my Australian products allow me to watch it.<br />Is there any way of getting it replaced? Can you forward this message to the right personnel please.<br />This is really important, I had a look at which country code is 1 for DVD's and it's USA.  So if I want to watch my favourite movies then I would have to order a DVD player from USA and that's not good enough.<br />sincerely,<br />Lehel.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|Once you begin watching Lost, you cannot look away.  Ground-breaking, addictive, mind bending series.  Ready to watch it all, all over again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ive only been playing this game for like two weeks and I'm already in love with it I didn't even know it was out there unroll my stepmom showed me it one day walking through the store and at that moment I knew I had to have it so when I got home I downloaded it. well to cut this short this game keeps me on my toes you never know what is next. keep it up guys make more games like this and I will never leave my couch.
B002BRRTUO|3.0|Movies based on comic book heroes have changed a lot. Flesh was fun to watch but considering it came out three years after Star Wars, the special effects are a little rough. Still fun though and who doesn't love the theme song by Queen.
B000FGGE68|4.0|I like it but the only problem is that I live in australia and my country code is 4.<br />Amazon sent me DVD's for a contry code 1 and none of my Australian products allow me to watch it.<br />Is there any way of getting it replaced?

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Every once in a while a series comes along that just redefines things. This is such a series.<br /><br />It's a medieval story set in another world  that looks geographically bit like Britain.  One thing, spoiler alert, don't get too attached to any character.  Life was dangerous in that world, nobody is safe.  You'll be sad when a beloved character bites it and you will love to hate the bad guys.  In fact, it's not very clear who is good or bad, they're just very real to life characters trying to make their way in this fantastic story.<br /><br />This stands up there with lord of the rings and other grand stories of our times.  Watch it, love it, love to hate it.<br /><br />Oh, it's hbo so there is plenty of nudity and violence absolutely not for kids in any way.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|What can I say about this comic? A captivating, psychological analysis from beginning to end on a group of heroes and heroines we come to feel more compelled to care about as the story progresses. Highly recommended for the passive-reader and comic fan alike! An excellent story with excellent character development!!!
B000W9399S|3.0|So this was my first Pratchett novel.  Although he is a gifted writer, I don't see what the hubbub is all about.  The irreverence and nonsensical nature of the plot is just not suited for my taste. Might have to read one more just to be sure...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very nice app. Love it. Very good for children. I recommend this app for parents. It'll keep them busy :)
B009DCOU9S|4.0|this game is pretty nice. I like the different layers to it and also that it gives you different types of tasks to comeplete.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|Giant robots. Giant menacing aliens. Battling each other and laying waste to everything around them. If that sounds good to you, this film delivers what you want to see. Fun, action packed movie. Not a lot of depth in the storyline, acting isn't going to win any awards, but its a highly entertaining, visually stunning (especially in 3D), live-action-mecha vs alien straight popcorn flick.<br /><br />I initially was hoping that del Toro would channel his amazing talent with mixing drama-horror (Pan's Labyrinth/Devil's Backbone), making something that was both emotionally deep and visually astonishing, but it was his Hellboy style all the way. If you don't mind the cheesy characters and storyline arcs that follow those kind of movies, then you'll find the movie a treat full of great special effects and sci-if action.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app<br /><br />Always accurate and easy to navigate very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,good great super nice groovy app totally cool can't live with out it
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|The app all together was good, but the thing holding it back was lack of gun selection, I give it a 4 out of 5
B0016ZQQZ6|5.0|I love, love, love this charming book that reaches out and touches the bibliophile in me! Only one who has a life-long love affair with books will truly appreciate this story of the decades' long correspondence between Helene Hanff, a script reader/ writer living in New York, and Frank Doel, the manager of an antiquarian British bookshop, Marks & Co. The correspondence starts in the year 1949 and ends in 1968.<br /><br />These letters reveal two people who shared a similar sense of humor and a passion for old books. Ms. Hanff had a particular fondness for antiquarian books filled with wisdom - the works of John Donne, Samuel Pepys, Newman, Leigh Hunt, Walter Savage Landor, and many others. Despite making little money, Hanff develops such a fondness for the people running the bookshop that she sends them food parcels when she discovers England is being subjected to food rationing in the post-war period.<br /><br />My love for this story is not only because it is about a love of books, but also because it harkens back to a time when people actually took pains to correspond with each other (not that they had a choice), an art that is slowly dying out (I try my best to keep it alive by penning long letters to my parents who live on a different continent and who are blissfully oblivious to the wonders of e-mailing and social networking).<br /><br />84, Charing Cross Road resonates with me on so many levels, and is the perfect read on days when I'd like to just slow down and savor the pleasure of curling up with a light read. The movie adaptation starring Anne Bancroft and Sir Anthony Hopkins is another delight that perfectly captures the essence of the book. Also recommended:<br />Q's Legacy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it should be the app of the day. I love that it is on tour and new charters to buy.  hope you love it too.
B00BGI08GG|4.0|Smallville convincingly demonstrated that you can strip down a superhero to his core, removing a lot of the powers and fantastical elements along the way.<br /><br />Arrow takes that basic idea even further taking the comparatively obscure Green Arrow character from DC Comics de-aging him and giving us a show about a completely non-powered character who dresses up in a green hood and shoots arrows at people.<br /><br />On the surface that looks like a tough sell.<br /><br />But it works, and it works rather well. In part because it follows the CW template of focussing on attractive young things, frequently with their shirts off. But also because it's sharply written with some very strong action sequences.<br /><br />It's not perfect mind you. At times the soap opera elements threaten to overwhelm the action. Stephen Arnell who plays Oliver Queen/Arrow doesn't give us a lot of facial expressions (well two basically, brooding and angry) and unfortunately reminds me of Ashton Kutcher (not really his fault mind you).<br /><br />The rest of the cast makes up for it though, with Emily Bett Rickards of particular note as Felicity Smoak, but also nods to Paul Blackthorne and David Ramsey.<br /><br />The flashbacks to the island where Oliver was stranded for 5 years do initially go a long way towards explaining the character's transformation but part way through the season dip into Lost territory with twist layered on twist layered on twist for no real reason I can see. And in those later episodes the emphasis on the flashbacks sometimes hurts the show's supposed A plot.<br /><br />The other season arc is significantly stronger as Oliver and his colleagues struggle to figure out the significance of the list that his father has left for him.<br /><br />The show generally works best when it takes itself seriously, but not too seriously and it kept me hooked enough to watch multiple episodes a night curious where things were going.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome i recommend it to everyone and it is so cool its fun and addiction lol and i was so happy when i saw ot

B000JMLFLW|5.0|I'm not much of a reader so understanding it at first was difficult but once I picked up on the language I fell in love with the book!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I have tried this game out for a couple of days and still cannot get past a certain point.  The game doesn't give you any hints and so you are stuck.  I wouldn't recommend this game unless someone has the patience of Job.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I say it's a good graphic game for all kids my little sister she's four years old and she loves it, me...I say I've can get a little bit better with obstacles, characters, and cheaper upgrades
B00011KHTM|5.0|This item satisfied my need, it was new and works perfectly. Also apple tends to make his old products useless and being able to find this type of items helps me keep using my laptop.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|My daughter and I enjoyed watching this series.  We have never heard of this show until we saw it on Amazon.  The only downfall is the second season was not free.
0812973992|5.0|a masterpiece<br />writing - shear poetry<br />issues wrestled with - of cosmic significance<br />like life: seemingly disparate energies become one

B00A8ECU24|3.0|She is 4 and loves it. To avoid buying by mistake I turned on the parental control and now before buy it asks for a pass.

B0083DJWGO|1.0|Taleb is incredibly well read and intelligent.  He has an insightful point to make about the asymmetry of many kinds of risks/decision-making and I very much hoped to see him develop it.  Unfortunately, he chose to make this book be a polemic from his anti-establishment viewpoint rather than be informative.  He engages in that style of name calling and vehemence that seems to pass for discourse these days--at least on extremophile radio and TV.<br /><br />Taleb is open about his many personal foibles, beliefs and preferences.  None of those are of particular interest to me in the context of constructive discourse except where he admits he is not a writer.  Specifically he eschews the conventional implicit contract a writer makes with his reader to indulge those personal peculiarities.  He clearly states he writes for himself not for his readers or even the edification of his audience.  Having read his books before and knowing the content-to-diatribe ratio was low, I was somewhat prepared for this, and was willing to tolerate the ranting for the content; but it is not clear that the content of this book is even net positive let alone sufficient.  Let me be more specific:<br /><br />The word &#34;fragile&#34; obviously plays a key role in this book. Unfortunately, the use of the word to put it mildly was forced.  Taleb uses an initial definition of the word that is sufficiently far from its actual meaning that it is disingenuous to use it.  He is then &#34;shocked&#34; that there is no antonym for his forced definition so he makes up &#34;antifragile&#34;  Early in the book, one can almost accept his definition for short-hand's sake, but as the book goes on he morphs it ad absurdum.  In order to work through the chaff, I substituted &#34;seemly&#34; and &#34;Nassimly&#34;  for &#34;fragile&#34; and &#34;antifragile&#34; as it became clear that it was really all about his view of the world and not logical discourse.  His view of an activity often had more to do with how it related to a Levantine souk than any rational definition of &#34;fragile&#34;.<br /><br />The almost farcical aspect of his definition descriptions is that he would go through one aspect of his terms and demonstrate the &#34;Nassimly&#34; part and then attempt to show that something he did not like was the opposite, when in reality they were quite similar, except that he stopped his analyses when he got the answer he wanted.  For example, when restaurants fail because people don't like them (or get sick) this is good because it keeps us from eating in Soviet cafeterias and makes the next generation of restaurants better. On the other hand it is bad when the medical profession improves the same way. Things that happen on different time scales (e.g. shock vs. adaptation) are only evaluated on the time scale that makes the point he chooses to make.  It make me chuckle at times.  In fact, &#34;spotting the farce&#34; became one of the things that allowed me to finish the book.<br /><br />Taleb is very skilled in constructing a long argument that ostensibly seems plausible, but is based on some clever redefinitions which induce a bit of blindness to the flaws in the argument.  I realized that this technique was familiar and only one other book had bothered me as much in this regard.  It became obvious to me as Taleb was (for some personal reason)  listing off all the philosophers he had read.  I realized then I hadread only one better constructed fallacy and that was in Karl Marx's Capital. Taleb and Marx seem share a lot in their personal perspectives--at least that part that comes through their writings.  (I am curious if the 4 people in the world who read this review and both the Taleb and Marx books agree.)<br /><br />I have counter-arguments to many of his examples and explanations, but this review is already long enough. This book clearly made me think and develop my thinking, but that is not what I wanted from it.  Taleb failed to develop his core insight about non-linearity very far while he was busy espousing. For me this is the biggest loss.  On the other hand, you may like his style or agree with his world view and not be bothered by the Vonnegutting of the topic.  (This book would also make an excellent project for a senior course in critical thinking.)<br /><br />Perhaps I should have known better:  In the case of the Black Swan, other writers did a much better job of developing Taleb's insight.  I expect it will happen here as well.  It is much easier in this case--I think even I could do it. :)ut non-linearity very far while he was busy espousing. For me this is the biggest loss.

B000YMM3CC|5.0|Tough to put into words, I like this film so much. I noticed one review said this film gets back to the basics of true love. And I agree.  Very nice movie. A favorite.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this is a cute app to play when you're bored but during competitions you spend all your focus on the bar at the bottom of the screen
B004P1JEXE|1.0|After book 3 this was a big letdown. All the events are focused in Westeros where little happens and there are no accounts of events beyond the wall or in the East.
B00C8REB8U|3.0|The movie is great and the disk arrived in good shape as promised  The movie however, is full of glitches.  Strangely enough, the one we rented before purchasing had the same problmes which make me wonder if it's a manufacturer's problem.
B001EUTY66|5.0|A great Album the Family singe with great harmony's and great lyrics, one of the best albums up till this point
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Very touching story that brought memories for me of losing a parent. This story really shows how unfair life can be and no matter what you have to find a way to deal. I loved this book and despite the event that took place in the end, I was very happy with the ending. This book made me laugh and cry at the same time.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Prior to Adam Johnson's wonderful book I had very little knowledge of North Korean culture, politics and pathos. Even though I was a young student during the Korean War, my education did not include much information about North Korea. This is a beautiful yet sad epic. I highly recommend it. I am looking forward to My book discussion group's discussion of The Orphan Master's Son.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is nice to have this option on my computer and phone. I never thought anyone would take me away from my books but this is so handy.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Excellent book.  Would recommend this read to anyone who like Baldacci. As always he did not let his readers down.
B005544TRQ|4.0|fast moving and fun.  like the banter between everyone and love the movie references / quoting. I think its stupid to have to write a certian number of words to provide a review!!
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Taleb continues to be brilliant, but he seems to be descending into navel gazing.  His diet and exercise tips are pure pop-culture and he loses his intellectual sheen to be seen to fall for them.  Still, his insights into the folly of the markets are wonderful and the on-going semi-autobiographical story of Tulip and friends is amusing.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I enjoy the variety of books.  I am a big zombie fan and also enjoy anthologies involving horror and the selection of both are great.Plus if it turns out not to be the greatest of books the lifetime $20.00 is well worth it.. I never thought I would enjoy e- reading but it has grown on me because of this site.  thanks!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is a fascinating read, and more balanced than I expected from the title. It isn't so much about how introverts are better than extroverts, as how well the two groups complement each other and how they each have their own valuable contributions to make to society. It is also excellent at examining many of the cultural norms built around extroverted ideals, and prompting re-evaluation of &#34;negative&#34; personality traits. Highly recommended.
B006O5Y75Y|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Liked it better than Planet of the Apes. Watched with some girlfriends and they enjoyed too, not just for guys n
B000OVLINI|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafron's writing has style and flair.  Beautiful descriptions that allow the reader to be transported to Barcelona itself!!
B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|This too is my first Blake Shelton cd.  There isn't a song on it I don't like, which is quite unusual for any artist.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Both my wife and I enjoyed the move.  It was a fun action move and Mary-Louise Parker added a great touch of humor.  The quality of the video was good but the audio wasn't.  It would have been more enjoyable with surround sound.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It is stuck on the tip screen and won't load I really want to try it  it looks like a lot of fun I really hope it starts working<br />,
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I got the CD and the cloud version both for $10. can't beat that.. One of my fav bands and they didn't let me down... Love it!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|If you have not watched this series, I have to recommend it. I'm addicted (bad word choice - you'd know what I meant if you were a viewer). Awesome videography, great acting, it's got everything a good series should.
086571701X|5.0|I got this book two months after starting into aquaponics. Bernstein's book has answered many questions that I couldn't get answers to from the different blogs on the web. The author was able to make the biology very understandable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series has been amazing since the beginning but I do believe each one gets better and better.  The only hard part about season 3 was that I think I cried for about half of it.  There was a lot of heart breaking episodes and the season final nearly killed me!  But it makes me long for season 4.  I can't wait!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I initially purchased the first part of this series.  I absolutely could not put it down and was thrilled to find this omnibus edition.  The characters were well developed and easy to relate to.  I liked the attention to details which helped make me feel like I was right there with the characters.  I just purchased shift and am very excited to start reading it!!  I would recommend this book to everyone!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I bought Hunger Games 2-Disc Blu-ray +Ultra Violet Digital copy with 16x9 wide wide screen 2.40:1 format for $12! I thought, that it was a very nice deal, considering that HG is less than an year old movie! Jennifer Lawrence and Hutcherson's  performances are commendable. J Law clearly stole the show with her gritty persona as Katnis Everdeen. Even though the movie looks like a mega reality show involving blood bath, the movie went by the book mostly and did justice.<br /><br />The special features disc is loaded with many special features, which include the making of HG, interviews with Gary Ross and Elvis Mitchell are entertaining.<br /><br />Given the ambiguity surrounding the Ultra Violet way of cloud storage of movies, with all the negative feedback online, I chose to pick the Digital copy. Redeeming the code was a piece of cake. I have not yet downloaded my copy on to my laptop though, due to space constraints. Overall, I am very happy with the deal and I strongly feel, that it was my money's worth. Yes, I would certainly recommend it to my friends!
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Our 15 month old will stop anywhere and dance if she hears a catchy tune, so we bought this movie for her. It is far and away her favorite! The animation is engaging and the music is infectious. It is one of the only movies that our little active one will watch all the way through, and we enjoy watching it as well.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I didn't have to skip to the next track because all the songs are great. A lot of raw emotions. Made me more of a fan if that's even impossible. I love how she challenges herself with her vocals
B000089RV6|5.0|Since you can't download this as an MP3, I broke down and bought the CD.  I love listening to it.  Good on the way to and from work!
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Not something I would necessarily watch again, but it was entertaining and we stayed engaged as the movie progressed.  Storyline was interesting and the actors did a really good job in their roles.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an awesome game, very creative and a lot of levels to try. I will always love angry birds.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The book has a well known Dan Brown's style of mixing science and information into a novel. The central idea of the book - the power of mind and the God inside us - is intriguing and exciting.
0061950726|5.0|Always like to learn about a part of history that I was unaware existed. Good character development and will recommend to my book club
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's great that the original actors for the Super Heroes came back to do the film. And the fact that they don't all get along is great as well.  Lots of action and great acting.  No wonder this is the 3rd highest grossing film of all time.
B007SGM084|5.0|the story kept you reading until the end. Then you wanted to know what happened after the end of the third book. Great character development
B001XUH69Y|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever made. Funny, hip, mystery, romantic, action, it has it all. Bogie is the star, but don't take your eyes off of Claude Raines, he's genius in this film.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Cute game, my 4 year old loves it, not very easy for her but she still enjoys trying to get the bananas
B002KCYIEA|5.0|I love all three main characters in this movie.  Great job!  They worked so well together.  I would watch it again and again.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|This flick gets into the gnarly side of horror. In some instances it can be hard to watch. Definitely worth a look if you like the genre.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|The story is not like the others and its a good thing that it was told....Lots of fun and a pretty cool message for kids as well as adults alike.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I would recommend these books to all people who like detective<br />novels and Harry Bosch!  Great books!<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Laura
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved this show. I would watch it again. I would recommend this season to any one. A must see.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|First off, I LOVE MLP....have since the 80's when I was a kid.  I downloaded this WANTING to love it...and I did, for about 10 minutes.  Then I quickly realized that you can only do so much before you hit a &#34;wall&#34;.  You either have to wait long periods of time, or buy their little gems so you can progress.<br /><br />I know the game is free to download, but frankly I would have preferred to pay a few bucks up front for the game and had the ability to unlock everything just by playing the game.  As it is, you'd have to play for MONTHS solid to get all the things unlocked - which is particularly frustrating if you have a favorite pony (and who doesn't) that happens to be a &#34;buy only&#34; pony.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows ever, I cannot wait for seaon 4. I cannot get enough of Downton Abbey!  ROCKS!
B004G25V9S|5.0|It is with some hesitation and reluctance that I review this album, now two years after its release.  There are many reviewers who state that this is the culmination of the \\"natural\\" progression of Opeth's sound, and with this view, I must respectfully disagree.  I will summarize my views of Opeth's progress below.<br /><br />Orchid/Morningrise - Opeth without a fully developed sound.  We see some of their trademarks, the mix of growling and clean vocals, and even a power ballad in the form of \\"To Bid You Farewell,\\" although it retains its unmistakably death metal roots.<br /><br />My Arms, Your Hearse/Still Life/Blackwater Park/Deliverance - Opeth developing and mastering the blend of beauty and horror.<br /><br />Damnation - A side street.  This album was recorded at the same time as Deliverance, and apparently the band had two options - releasing two albums, both a mix of long tracks we fans were familiar with and some shorter ballads, or releasing a \\"heavy\\" album and a \\"light\\" album.  I almost would have preferred the former, if Damnation were not such a great album in its own right.<br /><br />Ghost Reveries/Watershed - Here, we see what Deliverance and Damnation may have sounded like had the band opted for the former option.  Long tracks with a few ballads thrown in here and there on Ghost Reveries, with longer pieces on Heritage but still, more clean vocals than we have been accustomed to in the past.<br /><br />With that out of the way, I turn to Heritage, and here is the reason for my hesitation with this review.  This album does not fit in at all.  Damnation's tracks are unmistakably Opeth - in fact, during its live set playing Damnation through, Opeth also played \\"Harvest\\" from Blackwater Park, and the song fit in with the rest naturally.  See, Lamentations.  I daresay that none of the songs from Heritage would fit so naturally with any of the other \\"clean\\" Opeth songs, and I felt this way at the last concert I attended, which was indeed a collection of \\"clean\\" tracks from previous albums with tracks from Heritage.  And the old tracks were objectively better.<br /><br />It is hard to review this album in a vacuum, knowing the full potential of the band.  It is hard not to dismiss this album as an \\"oopsie\\" and hope Opeth returns to its \\"roots.\\"  But that's the thing, isn't it?  What could Opeth possibly do after Watershed?  Of course, I asked this question after Ghost Reveries, because that album certainly felt like another Still Life, albeit with more clean vocals and a bit more progression.  After perfecting the sound that made them famous, there really were only two ways for Opeth to go: a new direction, or down.  Opeth chose a new direction, and I truly cannot fault them for that.  But at least with Watershed, I felt I was in a familiar territory, but an expanded territory, where Opeth astounded me because they were able to do more with their signature sound than I believed possible.<br /><br />So what is Heritage, and where does it fit?  I think it is best to view Heritage as a tribute.  Indeed, the title definitely lends support for this idea.  These are tracks that certainly appear to be based on bands cited as Opeth...well...Akerfeldt's influences.  It is a self-indulgent, pompous affair, and that by itself will alienate some fans.  But what I missed on my first listen, and many subsequent listens, is that if this were an album by any other band, it would be considered an amazing retro record.  These guys can impersonate 70's prog rock, and they can turn tired, familiar tracks into amazing set pieces with the interjection of modern sounds to remind you that this is just a tribute.<br /><br />I am hoping that I am right, and that this is not the new path of Opeth, but just their nod and homage to the legends of old before they continue on their progredeath journey.  Standing alone, this is a five star album, but Opeth can do better.
B0012QVJXS|4.0|A classic movie that's still as enjoyable now as it was years ago. Recommend giving it a watch. Christopher Reeves played the perfect part.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|This movie was one of my favorites as a kid. I recommend this movie to anyone between the ages of 10 to 18.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary comes in handy when you need one.  Very easy to use and was free.  I couldn't find a dictionary of course in my house and downloaded this one.  Would recommend to anyone needing a dictionary in a pinch
0817439390|5.0|Bought this book for my sister and it was $10.00 less than Barnes & Noble.  My sister loved it and recommends it to everyone that is a beginner to photography.  She says that Bryan Peterson is a genius at explaining iso, shutter speed and aperture.
B000MGATTE|5.0|Mr. King paints the most wonderful characters to populate his work and Lisey is one of the best. I genuinely read her as a cherished friend and the story is quite entertaining.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Great historical movie about the war between the Scottish and the British. Realistic gore and combat. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has interest in both history and war.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Love the chemistry between Romala Garai and Jonny Lee Miller. And, the longer format really made the difference. All around winner.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|This was a good movie didnt like a few elements but as a long time fan and collector and as a kod had all the figures I would like to see another one soon.
B000IZ4R1U|3.0|Movie was OK.  A decent diversion for this type of action flick.<br /><br />Angelina certainly looked the part!  Enjoyed the FX and the stunts.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Although I dutifully read the series, this book was the final straw.  There were too many places where well developed characters ended their story line with a sentence in passing during another characters chapter.  I read the authors notes about splitting the characters up and it really was for not.  Until the Book four part two price comes down to $3 or so I won't both finishing the series, even though my favorite remaining character has not been concluded.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I absolutely love this. It so much easier for me to get to the important items I  download on the kindle .it's works slot better then I expected.

B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I loved this novel. It is far better than the movie I saw growing up in the 90's. Jo and Laurie's relationship is addicting. I wanted them to be together so badly.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Just starred playing today. Don't know how to change avatars or gift but I'm learning.yay me. But it's fun to learn.it sucks there's an ad every time you move but you only get tokens every 45 mins. If we have to endure ads please let us play more.

B002JXK5VU|4.0|Good show, takes a few episodes and then you are hooked.  First season was enjoyable, second season is where the show starts to hum. Worth watching.
B0026IUXME|5.0|This was Avery heart felt film, showing human kindness in the mist of turmoil and prejudice.<br />I highly recommend this movie.
B00CFA227C|1.0|This has to be one of the most stupid and ridiculous movies I have ever seen.  It is childish and not worth watching.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is a lot like subway sitters but better I would take this over subway suffers temple run 1 and 2 and jet pack joyride and angry Gran run its kind of like all of them mixed you even get points for hurting evil and good minions there's different costumes maps and bosses
B001AQQR2S|4.0|I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid, and it is better than I remember it. Directed by Danny DeVito, this movie doesn't loose it's magic after growing up.
0345529057|5.0|I've read reviews about the paperbacks missing pages. This wasn't true with my order. I'm very happy with the set. They aren't cheaply made like others have stated. None of my pages have fallen out, nor do I think the paper is too thin or the print is too small (these are gripes I've read). They are the normal, mass production books you find in any bookstore.<br /><br />As for the story, I absolutely love these books! It's actually a big surprise to me. I never thought I'd read this genre, but I'm so glad I did!  I watched the first three seasons of Game of Thrones and wondered if the books were worth reading. It's actually pretty cool to read the book and imagine the show playback in my mind as I read along. I'm about 600 pages into the first book, and it can't wait to keep reading. So far, so good!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I utterly loved the book from cover to cover. I felt every emotion Ana felt clumsy embarrassment, scared, lust, longing for Christian, ecstasy, love and last tear of pain. I can't stop crying and being sad for them both. What a emotional book, I am buying book 2 now.

0375869026|5.0|I have never laughed and cried (happy and sad tears) so much as I have reading this book.  I wish it was around when I was younger.  It is such an inspiring story and the characters are so real.  You feel for each one and what they are going through.  It should be a requirement for all kids to read to learn humility and what it's like to be in someone else's shoes.  Such an inspiring story! Highly recommend it!!!!
B0055S348W|5.0|You can print straight from your tablet and that is what I mainly use it for. Very handy app for the busy people
B008GFI418|5.0|This is a nicely done documentary on a classy man.  It was nice to get to hear from Mrs Martin.  I love them driving their regular guy Morris rather than something flashy.  George has always had a lot of class and it surely rubbed off on the Fabs, as well as the many other artists he produced.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I loved it. Oblivion delivers. It would have made a 100 million at the domestic box office if not for poor scheduling. Had it opened two weeks earlier it would have made over 100 million domestically. Tom Cruise still delivers after over three decades with a movie that is wonderfully crafted around people rather than kiddie superhero CGI. The movie had action aplenty but it was not action for the sake of action. The action came from the story line and the characters who peopled it. It is beautifully filmed and engrossing and satisfying until the last frame. Buy it, Rent it, whichever is your choice. Its worth it. Tom Cruise, the entire cast, the director and the film deliver.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|The definitive book on \\"Scarface\\" is here.  This is essential reading for fans of the movie (the 1980s one).  There is no audio commentary for \\"Scarface,\\" so I was excited to read this.  The book discusses the origins of the movie and its development history -- with essays, trivia, and lots of fascinating factoids.  I had no idea most of \\"Scarface\\" was Sidney Lumet's idea.  The producers wanted to do a 1930s period piece before he thought to set it in Miami.  This was not Oliver Stone's idea, but Stone's script borrows heavily from the original movie -- including a lot of the dialogue.<br /><br />This book debunks a lot of myths about \\"Scarface\\" and gets to the truth behind `Making Of' documentaries and all the false rumors (like Pacino ad-libbed the word `yeyo') put out on the web by the likes of IMDB.  The book goes through a lengthy analysis of the movie, scene by scene.  I thought I knew a lot about \\"Scarface\\" until I read this book.  Give it a read if you like film analysis and you like \\"Scarface\\"!

B000005H3M|5.0|Hello Friend; Anyone can and should enjoy this spectacular recording that has equally and additionally marvelous material than the LP of 45 years ago. The sound is is wonderful, alive and crisp. The band roars and the playing is outstanding. As for Buddy Rich and his Krypton like origin, it helps to be a drummer to try to fathom his technique skill, taste and musicality, never duplicated by anyone. His playing elicits moans from other players trying to understand what they heard AND CANNOT He did not read music, what would have been the need? who could write the things he played? even if written who could perform the long solos the fill ins, the lead ins the, nuances, the power, the precise time and the perfection of it all including his brush playing .<br />My first knowledge of Buddy Rich was in 1939 as a 10 year old. I am still amazed baffled, 75 years later by this perfectionist who never duplicated a solo and originated everything he played and had a savant like photographic memory of the hundred of band arrangements stored in his mind for instant recall.<br />I was listening to this CD in my car waiting for a gas refill when Buddy Rich had his 12 daughter sing a tune<br />&#34;The Beat Goes On&#34;, during a live performance. Midway through the arrangement I found myself smiling, thinking of her singing in front of THAT band, she was great and whAt a talent, what bravery, what a precious moment in life.also listen to that Steam Locomotive of a band after her vocal, it is beyond description.<br />You can listen to this CD a hundred times and hear something new every time. buy the DVD visual &#34;Buddy at the Hague in Holland in 1978&#34; to view what a talent, musician, entertainer, comediene, actor, and sublime performer that the  man was. He is a man of our time......................... &#34;A ONE OF A KIND&#34;<br />i HAVE ORDERED BUT HAVEN'T SEEN THE MONTREAL DVD. AS YET. i DID HEAR IT ON A CD AND WAS MESMERIZED BY THE PERFORMANCES AND BUDDY RICH'S PLAYING .<br />I have listened to most of the drummers throughout the years and they are wonderful, skillful and hardworking at what they do  and I wish for them recognition and a lot of work and I know they will all agree with me....<br /><br />...............&#34;the likes of him will never be seen again&#34;<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Rich.for a lifetime of enjoyment and thrills<br />Jerry Gerard.<br />I have listened to most of the drummers throughout the years and they are wonderful, skillful and hardworking at what they do  and I wish for them recognition and a lot of work and I know they will all agree with me....<br /><br />...............&#34;the likes of him will never be seen again&#34;<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Rich.for a lifetime of enjoyment and thrills<br />Jerry Gerard
0307352153|5.0|Very much enjoyed reading this book, then purchased it for my grown children to read.  Good insight into why we are as we are and how we can use our personality to better advantage.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|*Minor Spoilers*<br /><br />A Feast for Crows is the fourth book in the series after a pretty long wait. Does it match the build up.. In a different sort that I don't criticize this entry for necessarily. I will address the perceived flaw. People have too much expectation for some installments. Here is a novel that after a series of major deaths occur in Book 3 of the main cast there is a lot of space left there as well as a need to slow down and take into account of what has happened. The War of the Five Kings, I would not say is over but in a different stage. A stage that has to form up given losses and shifts of power and show the politics and repercussions of what has happened.<br /><br />Now the things I liked about this entry.<br /><br />One more focus on Cersei and Jamie. Along the way with some Arya and Samwell.<br /><br />The Politics and some of the looks of the aftermath of books 1-3<br />The last 30 percent of the novel.<br /><br />The Bad..<br /><br />Too much looks at the country side and the other characters I did not find as compelling. (Greyjoys, Brienne, and Sansa)<br />Terrible editing throughout the novel.. Really needed to be cut down some and rearranged.<br />Omission of Jon Snow, Dany, and Tyrion..really deflate the novels likeability and the pacing some.<br />Pacing is slow and tedious<br /><br />I think the reaction is a bit too overblown but it is showing some of the flaws of bad editing and pacing that were present in the first three but not as bad. I will be moving on to book five and to see if it is as mixed as this one is.
B00BUT5I84|3.0|this effort sounds produced and doesn't do it for me--not a rock'n effort.drummer seems to be lead instrument...and I like that........but
B004SIP98S|5.0|Interesting story and wonderful performances from the two leads. As most people know,Helen Mirren won the Oscar for best female performance.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is fun, very addicting (beware), and just challenging enough not to be irritating. I would definitely recommend this app!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really really really really like this game and I am addicited to it and can't stop laying this game lol
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|he doesn't stop playing guitar-licks -you hang-on-to  for the duration of the CD. The man is amazing. I have always favored the English greats...but I can see this man's influence and rate him as the beginning of their greatness. this is a must have....
B002H09I0Y|4.0|This is a great original movie...it is the type that will keep you guessing the whole movie! Definitely have to see it!
B008602KQI|5.0|We put this movie on late thinking we would only watch half and watch the other half the next night.  However it is so good it kept us awake till late.  Would definetely recomend it!
B000002IAS|5.0|This is one of my favorite live albums. Every track's performance is clean and tight. The music is a great synergy of Delanie & Bonnie with Eric Clapton. They were both great on their own but the synergy is even better. Every track is great but my favorites are \\"Only you know and I know\\", \\"Where there's a will there's a way\\", and \\"Comin' Home\\".<br /><br />Audio quality is quite fine allowing for when it was recorded, so don't expect what isn't realistic to expect. Look at it as proof of the album's authenticity.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Clapton as a band member more than solo, this is a great live album to get and I originally got on Vinyl in the early 70's.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I picked this game up when it was the FAOTD but it is worth .99 of they  eventually update it with more levels. As it is currently it only took me about two to three hours of total game play to finish the whole game. The learning curve is not very steep and once you figure what the various &quot;tools&quot; allow you to do the game becomes one where you plan out what you need to do first, second, third and so on until you get the desired result. On a lot of the levels if you don't get that very first step right you'll find several steps later you need to start completely over again.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Every day there is a new challenge and it keeps the game interesting. I look forward to completing the daily and weekly challenges. Great graphics and lots of fun for the arcade game lover. Overall the game is lots of fun.
B00001PE4D|5.0|it definitly shows the dark side of the rich when they get bored with their lives and how it effects others
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly was one of the best series that didn't make it. Not because of the quality of but because of narrow network programming priorities or lack of imagination.<br /><br />I've watched the whole series dozens of times and it has never gotten old. I know there has been a great deal said about the acting, plot, actors, Joss Wheadon, Tim Minear, brown coats and lots more. I'm sure I feel as positive about that as the thousands of other 5 star reviewers.<br /><br />What speaks to me from Firefly that I think may be under appreciated is the music. It's easy to see how. The music is so integrated into the episodes the skillful work of Greg Edmonson in composing and arranging the music is extraordinary. If you love the firefly complete series consider picking up the sound track: [[ASIN:B000BLI4PQ Firefly (Original Television Soundtrack)]] and the musical contribution can be heard and then better appreciated with the series.<br /><br />Firefly is great for a lot of reasons. For me the music is a big one.<br /><br />I hope this helps someone.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I didn't like the way the main character was a womanizer in the beginning, but his character changes as the movie progresses. I wasn't too fond of the ending either. I think it should have been a more family oriented film.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I didn't know that Minnie Driver was a singer, but she's great!  I love the song, Mockingbird, and highly recommend her music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good fun, incredibly addicting. Brilliant and enjoyable for all ages, lots of fun characters to collect and themes to go through
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|The charger works as expected, and works for charging the Samsung galaxy 4 when plugged into the iPhone (Apple) port.
B008CP93S0|1.0|Previews indicated that the movie was a comedy, but it wasn't funny. It had some pretty disgusting parts and would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B0012GMV58|5.0|Like so many musicians in the early 70s, Carlos Santana moved into a jazz-rock inspired improvisational mode in 1971's ``Caravanserai,'' and influenced by his friend - and fellow spiritual traveler - John McLaughlin, moved deeper and deeper into jazz- influenced guitar. ``Welcome'' is the masterpiece by the Santana band that threw all of his and his band members influences into one of the greatest guitar-driven albums of the '70s. Which is not to say this is predominantly a guitar-based album. Tom Coster's keyboards are crucial to the albums overall texture, and the rhythms that had always driven Santana created a deep and comfortable bed for the gorgeous melodies and densely textured guitar work heard throughout. Includes a spectacular guest appearance by John McLaughlin on ``Flame Sky.'' Why did SONY  decide to add the bonus track, ``Mantra,'' which adds nothing tp the album, and was better off left in a tape box in a warehouse?
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I definitely recommend this book! It is sad but at the the same time, it's inspiring. Not many books portray characters in this way living with cancer; cancer is not the only thing consuming their life.<br /><br />A read for all ages.
1619492881|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, I felt it has the most to say of almost any of Forster's books. The theme is clear and powerful, and the characters are wonderfully represented. But, on the other, I also feel this is one of the least cohesive of his books. It rambles, even swerves. To convey so thoughtful a theme, it could have benefited from a much tighter plot.
006114665X|5.0|This is one of those stories that, in spite of the fact that you know how it ends, keeps you on the edge of your seat for every page.  It's not only the fascinating interplay of personalities and national agendas but the countless times I imagined how history could so very easily have gone in a different direction had this or that key player had just a little more foresight.  Everyone alive today thinks of the geopolitical world as stable compared to the pre 1914 era.  The collapse of the Soviet Union was the one big change since World War II.  But the alliance structure and international antagonisms have remained fairly constant in my lifetime (I'm approaching 50).  Now consider that Britain and France nearly went to war 16 years before the outbreak of WWI, and that on the eve of the Great War Britons had as much fear and distrust of Russia as they did of Germany.<br /><br />The author is careful not to assign blame, as all the countries involved share a portion.  But what I took from this narrative is that if you rank the Great Powers in order of culpability, Russia and France are at the top of the list.  Russia would never have taken the first step (mobilization) without French assurances that they would go the distance with them.  France would never have assured Russia of their support were they not confident in the combined might of the entente powers.  In effect, they goaded each other into war confident that they would win and thus regain pride and territory (Alsace-Lorraine and the Turkish straits).<br /><br />It's easy to blame the Serbs as well, but they come across as a very naughty child in a room of adults.  Had the adults in the room been more mature and less opportunistic the actions of that naughty child should not have resulted in the world war.<br /><br />Perhaps the only oversight in this book is the authors failure to mention the absence of war in the collective memory of most Europeans.  I believe this to be an important factor when answering the question of \\"how could they let this happen?\\"  An interesting photojournalism display I once saw posed the photos taken on the day war was declared in all the belligerent capitals from 1914 on one side and 1939 on the other.  The 1914 pictures all show cheering, exuberant crowds.  The 1939 photos show subdued and weary populations.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was the perfect Vegas love story. I wanted to keep reading until the very end without a break. Keeps you enticed about what could happen next.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Better luck next time. This movie was a flop for me. It bounced around too much and tried to impress viewers with raunchy language and sexy moments.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'm Watching this for the 2nd time.<br />Good acting and story lines.<br />I wonder how historically correct it is.<br />Very entertaining
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The &#34;upstairs downstairs&#34; characters are so believable and you become a part of their lives.  Original and beautifully done. In love with Downton Abbey!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I now understand the hoopla that surrounded this story. I'm so glad the next books are available because I need to know what happens next. This story is a fantastic balance of suspenseful  action and developing love story with an underlying tone of political attributes. It's a story that makes you think \\"what if\\" in a handful of directions.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I mostly use it to keep the blades sharp on small to medium folders, including some that have a serrated section on the blade.  It works fast the bevel is just fine for that (for those of you who expect more, I suggest using a razor to shave your legs).  I even used to sharpen a really dull 10-inch meat knife.  It was quick but the little unit is somewhat more difficult to hold correctly for a long stroke like that.  I keep it in my EDC bag.  Now I need another for my BOB.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|This is a great book.  This is a must read for business people.  I'm re-reading it for the third time to make sure I got it.

6305428425|5.0|very funny film<br />I like Lisa Kudrow's work since I loved 'Friends'.<br />the girls are funny, beautiful and with good ideas.<br />Definitely a good fun!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|This show is better than it had to be. Its like GoT but with less magic, CGI, pomp and circumstance. Good performances from the leads, and a good example of a show doing a lot comparatively little. It hits some slow spots when it really nerds out and goes into historical expository mode, but there's a certain charm in that too. I don't feel like I learn much about the middle ages from watching GoT, but I do feel that way about the Viking age and this show, so that's something. And that Fimmel dude has a ton of charisma–the show would almost be worth watching for his devilish grins alone.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the type of roles the actors in this movie played, much different than The Hunger Games or The Hangover.  I liked how there were a range of mental health issues displayed by the characters in this movie.  The mental health factor made this movie a little more interesting than other unrealistic romance movies.
B003Y059EK|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid.  ALL great fantasy movies have a villan and the NATURE of a VILLAN  is to....threaten the hero and scare kids!  This is much better than their new attempt, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful.\\" I saw it when I was around 8 years old, and thought that the Wicked Witch of the West from the 1939 movie was much scarier than the Gnome King! I grew up LOVING things like Neverending Story, Hocus Pocus, 1939 Wizard of Oz, the Polar Bear King, the Muppet Christmas Carol, The Witches (MUCH SCARIER!), the Goosebumps Books, The Spooky Old Tree, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Eerie Indiana and the Goosebumps T.V. series.Later on, Harry potter became popular. Oh, if the kids like Tim Burton movies, show it to them. This movie is no scarier than Harry Potter or any other very good fantasy film or book geared towards kids. If your kids like fantasy, they will like this. Let's not let the \\"Don't scare kids!\\" police ruin this movie, the fantasy genre, and magic for kids.<br /><br />P.S. I'm a professional violinist, and I would like to know if anyone knows where I can find the sheet music for the violin solo from this movie?
0316010669|5.0|I love his writing - it's always interesting - its well plotted out and captures your attention. Fascinating! Well worth the read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe this isn't the end. Although I'm glad, I hope the next book is coming soon.<br />Last time I read the first two, then had to wait 6 months for the third. By which time I had read so many other books I was getting confused, so I had to read all three in a row. Just as great the second time. Lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game i definitely liked it it's also challenging very fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun i wish it had more levels
B00BVYU2P2|4.0|I'd like to say it was over-sexualized, but unfortunately it is more likely accurately sexualized view of teenage life.  Of course the entertainment industry loves to portray the Christian character in the story as a confused, shallow idiot.  They wouldn't dare portray any negative racial stereotypes, but in this case they can portray their own stereotype that they have developed and love to employ.  I did enjoyed it based on its value as a view into the teenage, &#34;It's all about me&#34; culture of today and must admit that it was fairly entertaining in its own right.  The characters grow on you and I found the adult characters especially interesting.  It was entertaining that when one of the characters parents were on the verge of divorce, the concerns of the teenager never flinched for a moment from being on herself.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|what can i say... you can't not love space jam. product is just as described and has the shiny case!
B005J2UM9S|3.0|I watched this late at night one time.  It really was creepy and scary at times.<br /><br />-Good creepy atmosphere<br />-Good acting for the most part<br />-One scene toward the end is pretty shocking<br /><br />If you like ghost movies/paranormal type movies, you will most likely like this movie.  Also, if you like \\"found footage\\" type horror movies.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|At the start of idle I knew he was going to make a big in country music and he continues making a good music.<br />Thanks,Leo.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|If you are wondering why this movie was granted so many awards, just watch. You will not be disappointed. Robert DeNiro gives a excellent performance as well.
0723257639|5.0|I chose a five star rating because the set met all my expectations. The presentation box is wonderful. I give this as a baby gift.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood is a bad ass. Do I need to say anymore? Watch this movie. You will not be disappointed!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Its very similar to movie Aliens. But otherwise it is pretty good for high tech and high effect movie. I give it thumbs up for some parts in movie, tho the beginning stretches out with lot talk, it seems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! Even when it can get you mad when you get caught, it's still so addicting. I play it everyday! Also with the different missions and daily challenges it's perfect for almost everyone. :)
B00ADS98FC|5.0|great movie. my kids loves it, my husband loves it, my brother-in-law (who doesn't like movies like this) liked it!
B0035LJZ1Q|4.0|This is a good movie, if you like Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. The movie has some funny parts and isn't really scary at all, but still a good movie.
B004XQO8VO|4.0|I love this movie. It just so funny, orginial, etc. Too bad these days it seem lot movies are reproduced off by other movies, mamking it not orginial. Come up with cool ideas like this one same as Waterworld!
B005544V6A|5.0|Love this show can't wait to see what happens next. These guys are awesome - makes me want to become a lawyer!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|It is funny wirh lots of action and cute twists.  Enjoyed all the actors.  I just saw the new \\"Die Hard\\" with Bruce Willis and his \\"son\\".  I love Bruce Willis but there's no chemistry between him and his \\"son\\" in the new \\"Die Hard\\".  There is definitely chemistry in this movie.  All the actors were talented and entertaining.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|This is a great game. My daughter who is almost 7 was having a hard time with eye/hand coordination and this game has helped her slot. I also like playing. This is a great a game for the whole family. Only had one problem, when I died and fell into the water, the game froze. I had to turn my kindle completely off to fix, but it only happened once.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|I love Dexter, its orginial, funny, quiky, strange situation, and more. I am sad to find out that it might be last season this fall, 2013. :(
B005DJREJS|5.0|It brings back memories of being a teenager, and all the comedy mixed in just makes it hard to stop watching the show. I would easily watch hour long episodes instead of the half hour ones here, the show is great.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Being one of a handful of people left in the world with a prepay phone, I find this a wonderful way to message someone without using my minutes.  It as also quick and easy to use.  I have to thank my granddaughter for her recommendation.
0399159347|5.0|I thought Liane Moriarty's previous books were pretty amazing, but this one topped anything I've read in a long time.  It is so many different things--a thriller, a character-driven novel, and a touching, beautiful study of families and life.
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|I liked the way they set it up for story in this movie. It seem very orginial. Really liked it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love the game so far, but I'm only level 3. :) I really like the quests and the relaxation of it all. I'm playing on my Kindle Fire and it's really nice.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Very Very Very cute game. I was ready to play and it kept force closing. So I uninstalled it. I hope this problem get fixed I really would like to play the game.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|There are dope artists from the UK who look like us... Love this album so much... I play it often as I write.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|This cover is very sleek and protects the face of the phone very well.  I like the feature of propping up the phone for video viewing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|LOVE this game. Very addictive and hilarious!  Even when you lose, you laugh!  Stuck on Meena, but I will beat her!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am finishing this book and from the start could hardly put it down.<br /> A great story beyond our world.
B002BPQ0Y2|4.0|You've probably heard the first few songs of the album. The rest of the songs are pretty much the same - the same techno and fast beat. If you like Black Eyed Peas, you'll probably enjoy the album, But I do have to warn you that eventually, the music begins to blend together and sound the same. I can't even tell where Ring A Ling ends and Party All the Time begins until the song is about a minute in,.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Good for reference at Dr appointments or if you are making a  short grocery list or just reminders for youself
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I can't get enough of this game!! I purchased this game a couple of months ago and I am still trying to get to the top. Other games ate too easy this game has lots of challenges.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like it but it really eats up the battery time.  It will be great when I have to wait at the doctor's office.
1582701709|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book as everyone told me it was a must read!  I order the book and when it came i put it aside as I was reading other books and had to finish them first.  Today, I opened this book up and it smelled horribly like cigarette smoke.  So much to the point where I cant even read it.<br /><br />I have contacted the seller &#34;Little city books&#34; and hope they can do something for me.  I would NOT recommend buying a book from this seller.  I will update on if they return my message.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I have won this game and I have started all over from the beginning again to challenge my grandchildren I let them show  me what to do since they don't know I have already beat the game
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Another great book by Lee Childs. Jack Reacher just can't stay out of trouble! He uses his past military experiences and reasoning to find evidence others have overlooked. There are more twists, turns,ups and downs that a San Francisco street!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow. Amazing game! It's one of the best games I've ever played! I highly recommend this game to any horse lovers!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I didn't like how Facebook appeared on the browser that comes with the Kindlefire HD so I wondered if downloading an app would make it appear better on the screen.  Nope!  This made the newsfeed look huge like I'd zoomed in and there doesn't seem to be anyway to reduce the size.  It also only shows the top couple of stories of the newsfeed.  Also typing in my own status on the newsfeed for some reason it kept replacing words I typed, like the word so for App. Predictive text is turned off on the device so I don't know why this app wants to do that annoying feature.  It is easier to log out of this Facebook App than the one that appears on the browser being the logout icon is so small on that screen but that's all this app has going for it. Better of just to use the web browser and use Facebook that way.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very challenging the farther you get in the game I got the game so I could play along with my grandchildren
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not a bad way to challenge your mind but once you get started its really hard to stop.  I can't wait for the new levels to come out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great app its so fun and its so realistic and it gives me something to do when I'm bourd I love this app and I think all of the people who love houses will too.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is pretty fun! Who didn't in the pool when you were a little kid pretend to be a shark and eat your parents or friends? Or when you were older and at the beach and some hot girl you liked is facing the shore swim under them and bring your hands with your fingernails together on their leg so for a brief second they think they're being attacked by a shark.  Well now you get to be that shark all over again.  The aim of this game is that basically you're an eating machine, and if you don't keep eating, words will flash on the screen telling you that you're starving and if you don't eat someone or something soon you'll eventually die.  You can also die or come close to it by being eaten by other sharks, eating poisonous creatures, getting stung by jellyfish or swimming too deep and staying down there too long (there is tasty stuff to find down there though).  The screen graphics are pretty good, not photographic realistic but a far cry above what you think of with the words computer game animation. It's quite fun when you eat someone on a boat ramp or a woman that reminds me of the naked girl at the start of Jaws (she's got a bikini on in this game) your victims may cool terrified sound effects.<br /><br />Hungry Shark Evolution isn't an adrenaline game or fast moving action game.  It's a relaxing way to pass the time. It may well be too slow for those who get bored easily. The better you do the bigger species of shark you can become. I'm still on the initial shark but he's cool.  A lot of these apps, you play once and then delete from your device, I'll definitely be keeping this one to play from time to time.  It really is a relaxing game!<br /><br />Update after trying a few other games - What I never realised was a real bonus at the time I first played it with Hungry Sharks Evolution, is that you can play the game without being connected to Wi-Fi.  So you can play it in bed, on a plane or whenever you want without needing to be in a library, caf&eacute; or somewhere with Wi-Fi.  I don't understand why so many other games with less content than this one, force you to be online just to play them.ere with Wi-Fi.

0062238868|5.0|Very enlightening book in to the world of Navy SEAL's.  Chris Kyle was a patriot, sad he died so young.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|I personally did enjoy this movie even though it doesn’t take place on Mars. I, like so many others of my generation grew up reading all the pulp books of John Carter on Mars. I loved the stories and the Frazetta illustrations! I always remember when I was a kid thinking about when the movie would be made. Finally, after years and years of waiting it finally came out. Only the birth of 3d graphics could have made this film possible. And Yes, it does have many flaws in the story but I don’t think you should blame the Director or anyone who actually made this film. If you have ever read John Carter on Mars you would know how many paper back books there were. I can’t even remember how many! I think I have at least twelve books but that doesn’t even get close to the amount that was written. So if you want to blame anyone I would blame the studio for only making a two hour film of John Carter epic. Trying to fit so much of the story into a limited time of only two hours was impossible. They should have planned to make it in movie sequels I think. But anyway putting aside all the problems it still is a beautiful film to watch with awesome battles,  a gorgeous princess and lots of cool stuff to blow your mind. It was a good first try, I hope they will give it another attempt in the future.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|Can't hear audio from my desktop when I try and access videos. Any help? Video works but no audio. Volume is up on both devices. Can I get a hand here?<br />This is over twenty words come on hello
B008YU0AOE|5.0|All I was looking for was a calculator to load onto my Kindlefire HD since like a lot of things the device should come with, it didn't have one.  If you have your Kindlefire in portrait (vertical) mode it appears nicely on the screen as just a basic calculator. The buttons are big as is the results display screen at the top.  If you turn you fire to Landscape (horizontal) it becomes a calculator with more buttons and features.  Can't say I'll ever use those myself, I just wanted a simple calculator like comes included on a computer.  That's exactly what this is when it's in portrait mode, and it's a nice looking design too.  There is a banner advertisement at the top to upgrade or buy other app products, like you see on a lot of websites on a computer.  Doesn't bother me, I don't click on it and there's no way to mistakenly do so.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|Thankfully it was free. I didn't play the first one. If you have a small child who's bored this might work for you.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This book requested my attention immediately and I was happy to oblige. The story line provokes thought and interest but also adds humor to lighten the seriousness of the events when needed. I have not read a book by DeVille before but the author had gained a new \\"bookie\\" sctusy an \\"E-bookie\\".
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Surprised by this program completely. Did not think it was something I would enjoy but I could not have been more mistaken
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun fun fun! I love this game it's so cute and its really fun! Haha I can literally  play for hours!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard, not too easy. Good workout for your brain. Would be nice if completed tasks did not reset if you exit the game before completing a level.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Being avid Si-Fi buff's this is really a good movie. The thought put into the making and the actor's make this a believable event that could happen.  It show's how the entire world put's all their differences behind them and band together to bring these alien invaders down.<br /><br />Will Smith's acting is GREAT as always as only Will Smith can do.
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|What a wonderful dvd, I have always wanted to own this and thanks to amazon I now do! This movie will not let you down. Such a wonderful piece to add to your fashion collection. Great price too I give it 5 stars!!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Probably a little too subtle on the humor for most people.  We liked it and wish they had made more.
0385349947|5.0|This is incredible. A must read. What \\"Your Best Health Today\\" is to health innovation. This is to career innovation.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Entertaining, but first one had more action and better plot. It was a bit slow at times and there was a lack of cool gadgets.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We all love this game and fight to play and beat each other's scores... defenently a great game for the whole family... love the minions
B00A4L8CCS|4.0|I saw this on 60 Minutes recently and have also learned it was shown there previously about a year ago. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was packed a bit too loosely and rattled around in the box. I do not feel that my two copies are damaged, but the item itself when new is covered only with a thin plastic wrap not intended to take much abuse without losing its integrity and should have been packed with more air/plastic cushioning
B00AMS38YU|5.0|I like this movie because it has a lot of action in it. There aren't any slow, plot building periods that so many movies get hung up on. The plot is simple yet very entertaining. I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone!
B000U6BT40|5.0|I hated to see the end of this show. Loved it and Colin Ferguson, what a hottie. Too bad there really isn't such a place as Eureka, or maybe there is and we don't know it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its fun and can be quite challenging at times...keeps your brain at work and makes you think ... all in all its a pretty good game
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love the Weather Channel app. I even have it on my phone. Not too crazy about the new format, but, getting used to it.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book convinced me to give up dairy products and eat a plant based diet. There are still unanswered questions for me, such as did protein from sources other than casein also increase cancer cell growth. Observational studies say &#34;probably&#34; but it has not been demonstrated with research.  In spite of that I'm eating less meat ( grass fed, organic).
B006O6F932|3.0|I don't know much about Monster High, but she was very excited to get this.  Remember to assemble it with your kid so she understands it isn't easy and she shouldn't try to destroy it.  Building it with you will make her want to keep it nice.
B00D6QUJ6U|3.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not a true HD release, and the image is no better than your previous DVD upscaled by any BD player. The audio is also just stereo and not 5.1 (or at least that's what it defaults to). Very disappointing. The concert, of course, is a fantastic performance by the brothers covering their entire career, but sadly it looks like we'll never get a true HD concert of them. The bonus material is SD 4.3 footage of about four performances at a London show, I believe, around the same time as the ONO concert. The interview segment runs about 20 minutes and has some good stuff, but looks like outtake material from the excellent \\"In Our Own Time\\" documentary that previously came out on Blu-ray.<br /><br />To summarize. Skip the Blu-ray release if you already have the DVD. You won't get a better image.
B002O4JAV0|5.0|Sounds good. I have liked this album for a while. I don't know much about this guy except that he is from Ohio.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|I'd loved this book. The main character is cute and sweet in his own way... And it's adorable the way he tries to change himself in order to win the girl...
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I was going through the levels, enjoying the game play and the announcer. It makes good use of the stereo speakers on the Fire. After I completed, I think, 4 different levels, the game showed that everything else was locked, waiting for me to pay real money. I deleted the game. At least it was a FAOTD when I got it.
B0094M30I4|5.0|I found this a very entertaining Alice.  Although it has its dark moments, it is very well done.  Johnny Depp is an excellent Mad Hatter, Mia Wasikowska is a very good calm collected Alice.  I thought the anymation/graphics was done seamlessly.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great game you have to stick with it. You have to be patient if you don't want to spend money. Lots of fun. I love my park.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Buddy Guy at his usual best! I would recommend any fan to buy this CD.  You won't be disappointed in this one.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful tribute to the everlasting love of brothers and sisters. Hosseini always delivers an emotionally uplifting story of the ties that will never be broken.  This is another winner!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had only seen Doctor Who periodically on PBS. Thanks to Russell T. Davies the show makes a fantastic return. Enjoy the rebirth then the 10th, 11th, and soon to come 12th Doctors. Then go back and enjoy Classic Doctor Who. You have 50 years of awesome to explore! Allons-y!!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Wow this game was soo AWESOME I didn't want to put it down finished it in one day but I'm telling you it's a must try it and you won't regret it is puzzling yet satisfying once you start don't give up its soo worth it ...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its very fun. there's alot you can do on it but one thing i dont like is that its harder to get coins and im single
B00873GRU4|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It was extremely well written and the author painted a detailed picture in my mind of the Silo. I loved the main character. Looking forward to DUST
B002UM5BXW|4.0|He does such a great job of detailing every single kitchen and chef position that you tend to get a little lost and bored.  But I love Anthony Bourdain and still liked this book.
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|great cast. good storyline thats why i bought it its one you can watch over and over. He still has style.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved how stories of different characters intertwined though at times it was a bit difficult to follow.  Another great read by Khaled Hosseini.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|One of my favorite books!! Awesome job to the author! Would definitely read again! I couldn't put the book down!!!
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Great collection of songs from one of our favorite performers/songwriters. George Harrision was in the background as a Beatle, but came into his own indpendently.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love this movie, it's so funny and the singing is great. If you love musicals with some added gross humor you will love this movie.
B00C50NV2M|5.0|These work flawlessly and you can't beat the price! I had an older 3D TV  that u have to chrge the glasses and those were over $60 a pair so u definitely can't complain on $10.

1401922732|5.0|Whether these cards actually hold messages from Archangel Michael or not, all the cards are uplifiting and hold relevant guidance for Life.  For me, the conscious intention to connect with this Energy in this (usually) unseen Dimension of life, is helpful.  Even with that disclaimer, this user more often than not finds that these cards hit the nail on the head with a specificity that brings comfort, positive motivation for action, and goosebumps.

0224071262|5.0|An excellent, detailed and objective account of Mao,  a story that needed to be told. Thorough,  but easy to read.
140006922X|2.0|Zealot seems to be a mildly mannered polemic against Christianity. The author dissects the gospel accounts with an historical approach, describing a Jesus who was not the son of God. Aslan writes that Jesus never claimed to be divine, and in fact was just one of many similar religious leaders of his time. He refers to scholarly works and an extensive bibliography (but no footnotes) in his argument. His writing is smooth, skillful, and even artful at times. Historians of the ancient world write mostly for each other, and their prose is dense, technical and almost unreadable to non-historians. This narrative  is highly readable and readily understandable by a general audience, as popular history should be.<br /><br />As I examined this text, I grew disappointed with Aslan's thinking and his method of argument. His main point is that Jesus was not divine, never claimed to be God, but was only given that status by his later followers. This is not an original idea. Aslan does not present any original ideas of consequence in this book. His reasoning is highly selective and misleading. He draws speculative conclusions, and downplays conflicting evidence. For example, he describes Luke 14 as a \\"fabulous concoction \\" because there is no archaeological evidence of a synagogue in Nazareth. In the notes section (you should read the notes) Aslan admits that the synagogue of that time and place could have been a simple room with a Torah scroll. My conclusion: Aslan has made a fabulous concoction of his own. Why does he make such a claim? Why bury the negation of his argument in the notes? The author is pursuing an argument, not a dispassionate examination of history. He is an advocate, not an historian.<br /><br />The historical accuracy of the gospels is a subject of great contention among scholars with better credentials than Reza Aslan. They have not achieved widespread agreement on the historicity of most of the new  testament. You will not hear of that from Aslan. He presents his position as if it was grounded in historical research, supported by reason and science, devoid of controversy.<br /><br />He seeks to discredit Christianity by unmasking Jesus as merely human. If you negate the divinity of Christ, you negate Christianity. He says that the historical record backs his argument. He does not mention the problem with this argument: the only historical evidence we have of Jesus is in the gospel accounts. There is no other historical documentation of Him, except for brief mention in a few later sources. In the gospels Jesus unequivocally states that he is the son of God, and that salvation can only be obtained through Him. That is the historical record, and the author never gets around this fact. He chips away at the gospels, criticizing them for their lack of historicity, the approximate dates of  their writing, the agenda of their writers, and other problems. These questions have been extensively studied over the centuries.  The gospels are extraordinarily accurate in many details. They were not written as works of history, and criticism that they fail to meet modern historical standards misses the point.<br /><br />Aslan finds a willing western audience, motivated by disaffection with religion and dislike of Christianity. How different is his approach to Islam in his previous book, No God but God, The Origins Evolution and Future of Islam, which was an extensive apologetic for that religion.  He treats Islam with elaborate reverence, disputing none of the material in the Koran, ignoring all of the controversy around the historical figure of Mohammed. The average liberal westerner is ignorant of religion, biased in history, and eager to prove their \\"tolerance\\" by defending the most illiberal of the great religions. Aslan recognizes these tendencies, and he flourishes in their midst. Zealot received positive reviews and sycophantic adoration from  the mainstream  media, but most of it was devoid of close examination.. Reza Aslan's writing does not survive a close examination.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Having viewed the first four films in the franchise and being let down by \\"Die Hard 2\\" and the last entry, I was ambivalent about the latest installment, until the teaser poster and first two trailers were released, which made me hope that the series would be going back to its R-rated roots. Sure enough, I was right. The latest entry in the Die Hard series is reminiscent of the first three films in terms of content, only that the violence is more graphic, and the language is tempered down a bit. However, never fear. John McClane's signature phrase is uncensored this time around (unlike the fourth film, where it was inexplicably toned down for a PG-13 rating, though there was still some moderate-to-strong profanity that should have earned it an R-rating).<br /><br />The plot of the fifth film isn't as strong as \\"Die Hard\\" and \\"Die Hard With A Vengeance,\\" but it's definitely much better than \\"Die Hard 2\\" and \\"Live Free or Die Hard,\\" and the actor playing the main villain may not be as well-known as Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons, but he still did a good job. Shame that the great Michael Kamen (who scored the first three movies, plus all of the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" films, \\"Licence To Kill,\\" \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" and Disney's \\"The Three Musketeers\\") is no longer with us to provide another great score for another \\"Die Hard\\" movie.<br /><br />My only quibbles are with the profaning of God's Name (i.e., combining the Name of God with a mild profanity, thereby turning it into a strong religious profanity; God saith, \\"Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord Thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.\\") and for some reason, several scene extensions and at least one scene in the trailer were not in the movie. Why is that scenes in a trailer are cut from the movie before theatrical release? and the so-called \\"Extended Cut\\" is not really an extended cut, as Mary Elizabeth Winnstead is cut from the film in that version, and the additions are insignificant. The movie should have had a stronger script, ala Die Hard or Die Hard With A Vengeance.<br /><br />Yippee-ki-yay. My ranking of the \\"Die Hard\\" movies is as follows.<br /><br />I. \\"Die Hard\\"<br /><br />II. \\"Die Hard With A Vengeance\\"<br /><br />III. \\"A Good Day To Die Hard\\"<br /><br />IV. \\"Die Hard 2\\"<br /><br />V. \\"Live Free Or Die Hard\\"<br /><br />I recommend the first and third entries in the series. Skip the second and fourth installments. View the fifth film once.tions are insignificant.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a pretty good app not too hard but there are not a lot of levels yet so you go though iit pretty quick.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|In this version of the future, children are called \\"Uglies\\" from 12 till their 16th birthday and they live in dorms with the other Uglies.  At 16 they undergo extreme plastic surgery (not just facial, whole body, perhaps even changing skin tone).  Everyone is then a \\"Pretty\\".  If everyone is pretty, then there will be more peace.  The new Pretties (recently had surgery) spend their nights partying and their days sleeping it off.  Tally is almost 16 and her best friend Peris has already been made pretty.  She's lonely and when she visits him (an absolute no-no) he doesn't seem quite the same.  However, she's got such a short time to wait.  Then she meets Shay.  Shay doesn't want to be a Pretty, she knows of a place where you can go and live off the grid and stay Ugly.  Shay asks Tally to go with her, but Tally isn't interested.  However, before she can have her surgery Special Circumstances informs her that she not only needs to find Shay, but lead them to the Uglies hide out.<br /><br />Tally starts as a spy, but learns to love the Smoke (Uglies' hide out), and learns that there is something darker going on with the surgery beyond just making people pretty.<br /><br />This book dwells a lot of perceptions of physical beauty.  At times Tally seems incredibly shallow, but isn't she just a product of her world?  I enjoyed reading this book and am ready to read book 2 to see where the story goes from here.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|As always this was great on amazon prime, having never seen Lost before we are enjoying the second season. I can't wait to start the third season
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Jack the Giant Slayer kept me on the edge of my seat going &#34;watch out Jack&#34;! Hah. I love it when the good guys win! I think I'll watch it again soon.
B00E8S2GJI|4.0|I've been waiting for the extended copy since I only want to buy this once.  I'm glad they're offering the extended version in 3D.  But I'm shocked that at this price it doesn't even come with an iTunes Digital copy.  Kinda ghetto.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love love love it love historical fiction.  Costumes are interesting. I wish there were a few more happy endings.  Great fun
B002XXPNXG|3.0|The film was short compared to first movie, but again the ending left us in the air, but luckily there's now the third follow-up that I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.  The rental prices are too high for HD.  I don't even know why Amazon charges more for HD, everything now should be HD.  All movies should just cost  $1.00 to watch.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game is just you collect bananas and buy stuff my friend showed me this and I've played it on a different tablet but on this tablet it does not work and the prices are too expensive and if you buy tokens you don't get much
1623420148|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Emma's chase's writing is SPECTACULAR!!! One of my favorite books of 2013 and cannot wait for Twisted to come out!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|At first I thought it was going to be a fake dumb version of subway surfer but I find this better. It's really fun and its addicting
B0013KTGAG|5.0|This must be one of Danny Boyle's best so far. Interesting plot, great acting and cinematography, much more polished than some of his earlier movies. We watched it<br />on Blue ray disk very impressive. Highly recommended.
B008LV8TSU|1.0|Mind you, it isn't my kind of literature(?). In fact, I am not qualified to judge this genre. I do find it incredible that an adult reader would EVER like this sort of fiction. One of the few books I couldn't finish.
B000SNW0HA|5.0|Yum yum yummy rainy day rainbows when these sounds pump though your headpiece.....beats that will trip u inta infinite lackadaisical dreams
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|This is an excellent family movie, based on a Rohl Dahl story it is a black comedy with good plot and great acting. Mathilda is this gifted child with delinquent parents. Her dad (Devito) sends her to school with this headmistress from hell. The characters are great, the wicked headmistress really steals the show with her superhuman powers, we laughed out loud. There are comedic scenes of schoolkids being thrown large distances by the headmistress but all very much tongue in cheek. Anyway highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I usually find free games boring or cheaply made, but this has nice graphics and was a fun challenge. I can't wait for more rooms!
B009SMWYOG|5.0|This is the tastiest ear spaghetti I have ever had my entire life. Delicious musical brain pudding for the entire cult.

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game, it really makes u think, it's a game that requires thought and planning as well as trial and error.  I personally am stuck on level 30, can't seem to get past it. Oh well I'll keep trying lol
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics, cute characters, smooth game animation and enough extra side missions to keep you occupied. The only complaint would be large file size, but that's not really an issue for my device.
B00821OX98|4.0|Great series.  Can't wait to get back to it..  Using Prime trial and will probably subscribe. Not disappointed so fat.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|GREAT GAME. LOTS OF FUN,But tries to get you to buy lots of extras. IT CAN GET VERY EXPENSIVE. Parents need to monitor children's play.
B002VKDDBK|5.0|I remember my mom reading this to me and I read it to my children. I have purchased this book for each of my grandchildren and they love it. Now we have pictures of the grands with the duckling statues on the Boston common.
034580404X|5.0|LOVED THE SERIES!!!!!!! I would recommend this to anyone!!!! Very good and easy read. Perfect for out by the pool
1781162646|5.0|I love how Stephen King uses words to paint such vivid pictures for the reader's mind.  This book reads like an old-fashioned mystery with a bit of ghost story in the mix -- very entertaining!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Exceptional acting and writing. Each actor/actress was chosen for their part perfectly and the dialogue is great. Each show leaves you anticipating the next one.
B005K15XR4|5.0|This music makes good background for all sorts of tasks, It keeps my mind focused on what i'm doing, and adds excitement to chores like baking.
0312427646|3.0|My book club picked this one as our short, light read for June.  So although that is the only reason I ever would have read this book, I did find that it was clever and amusing in that very proper, dry, witty English sort of way.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Love playing this game on my cell phone but it won't load on my kindle fire HD :( looks like I'm not the only one with this issue, please fix it
B000JQUZCI|5.0|Why spend money to get this in a physical format if you have a digital reader?  The story is as good today as it was the first time I read it in middle school.<br /><br />No formatting issues.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|resolution could be better, and it could be a bit faster on the download.  I'll keep it for a while
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is one of the most representative movies of the human spirit<br />ever made. It shows the depths to which people will sink when ignoring<br />or ignorant of their spirit, the power of the spirit when a person has their<br />integrity intact and a love of the spirit and how we are redeemable, no matter<br />how low we go, if we are willing.
0671646788|5.0|Dr. Schwartz actually uses common everyday examples to help one relate to the individual topics being addressed. Recommendation very much appreciated
B0067R0APK|3.0|I just doesn't have the same features that I'd like.  Resolution is better than TWC, I may go back to them.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I have become an avid follower of Sherlock Holmes from the original viewing on PBS.  The producers have masterfully crafted a series that challenges the mind to the fullest extent.  It is apparent that BBC has been able to take ones imagination to the next level.  While never showing what transpires, one's mind and imagination catapults you into a cat and mouse game of wit and mystery.  The suspense holds you in a transvex state trying to outguess what the producers have in store for Sherlock and Watson.  I would highly recommend this series for those individuals who seek more than just gory murder mysteries and unsolved phenomenon.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I enjoy this very much except my kindle shut down almost e very time when loading.Each new game was fun and I'm glad it's not timed.It is very long and just keeps getting more fun.
6305428387|5.0|This is a story with good, clean fun, distinct characters, and a meaningful message. It's inspiring to watch an age-old truth that hard work and a team spirit pay off with great rewards.
B000IZ3CZC|5.0|There's nothing like the original child's play, the sequels were in my opinion unessessary and stupid . And now they are doing a reboot 😡😡😡 extremely unessessary 😡😡anyway . For those out there that have never seen this timless classic film , no CGI , just good old faction fun and terror . A must see .ENJOY
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Out of the box it only plays videos from Netflix, YouTube and Google play. Essentially it turns your dumb TV into a smart TV. I have no issues streaming videos to this device with my wireless router sitting on the other end of the house.<br /><br />Many developers and companies have hinted at supporting this little device like Hulu, Plex and others (how could they not? it's cheap and reportedly easy to develop for).
B004XQX4K0|5.0|Is a very nice book in order to have a good reference and many concepts on javascript. Eventhough I made my own websites with javascript, this book has many things I did not know.<br /><br />Thanks to the author!<br /><br />Juan
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun but yesterday I wanted to play it but I  coundn't becausd it froze.  then I left it there for an hour. I came back but it was still frozen.  but I still love it when it works.
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|What did I expect?  It is in the 7th season.  For me, this series peeked at the 3rd or 4th season.  I guess I was sooooo into it that my expectations were too high.  I have been paying for each episode and will continue to watch it.  The difference is, I get a new episode when there is nothing else that sounds good.  Quite a difference from past seasons that I watched in a matter of days!  All in all, I'm still a fan.  :)
B00D2K40WY|4.0|i keep playing this game and keep wondering how to unlock the other princesses. i have the regular game and same result. please help.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I do enjoy the game, but it should be noted that there is NO ONLINE multiplayer. You need a tablet with bluetooth support and the game installed, and someone else sitting across from you with a bluetooth supported tablet and the game installed. Why would we use tablets when we are close enough to use paper cards?<br />I am really enjoying the singleplayer, even with the sealed deck issues, but I do not see myself ever using multiplayer unless online support is added.<br /><br />Singleplayer<br />+ Great graphics<br />+ Good interface<br />+/- Some customization options, but not much<br />- Sealed play is not resetable in any way, you are stuck with the cards you got FOREVER<br /><br />Multiplayer<br />- Must have bluetooth<br />- Must have magic-addicted friend within a few feet of you<br />- NOT ONLINE
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is really nice. Although you need an internet connection otherwise it lock you out. But over all nice game
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It glitches and when that happens you gets 4 stars it is a fun game dont get me wrong i love it, it needs to have unlimited games because i could play the actual card game at home with my mom for hours and hours and hours.<br /><br />So in conclusion i like this app but it needs a little work. So bye bye people
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read it because I was trying to figure out what to read next and saw it on a list. Gone Girl was definitely a find for not knowing much about it before I downloaded it on my Kindle.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Nice game.  The game seems to work fine as long as device is connected to the internet. Game works well.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is a lot of fun but after the update I am unable to connect to facebook any longer. I addition my Kindle has frozen several times forcing a hard boot to resolve. please fix update.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This movie is so cute! I show it to my first graders. The message of the movie is about doing for others and following through with your promises. It also repeats the line, &#34;a person is a person, no matter how small&#34;. Tells us that we are all significant. Love it!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very beautiful story. Could not put it down. I now want to include the meanings of the flowers in my everyday life. I got pulled in immediately.
B008X8RSTM|2.0|Ok so I spent an hour searching for existing addresses including my own (8 times) and it hasn't produced a single result. When searching my own address I tried different text i.e.: east instead of e., avenue instead of ave. nothing. Then I went online and found other local addresses and spelled them exactly as they appeared to no avail. Same result: \\"no results\\". Maps load very slow on faster newer phones especially when zoomed in and moving from one city block to another. Don't waste your time with this one. They should have put more into the testing before releasing.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I work a stressful job and sometimes have a hard time &quot;De-compressing&quot; when I get home. This game is great for that. The music that plays while you construct your chosen puzzle is delightful. One of the better apps I have downloaded in a while.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I love the despicable me movie, but for some reason the app isn't working=( I have the kindle fire hd and I'm always stuck at the loading bar, hopefully the creators fix that because I would love to play and I've installed and uninstalled it many times
B005544TRQ|5.0|Suits season one is just the beginning of a hopefully long running TV drama. The main characters, Harvey and Mike, are the focus of the show, but the supporting cast, including Donna, Rachel, and even Love to hate Louis, bring depth, humor, and witty dialog to an already addicting show.
B004SBQALA|5.0|I am an avid reader, and usually really particular with movies from books. However, stand alone this movie is great! It did a good job of interpreting the movie and the character choice was pretty spot on, minus Sarah Harts part. Otherwise, I recommend reading the books and short novellas that accompany the series. I look forward to seeing of they make any other of the books into movies!
0061733199|3.0|I just read the section on tornados and saw that Lofty had in there instructions to open windows to help equilize pressure in your home to keep it from exploding. That's an old myth. I have lived in Chicago my entire life, even though I have not had to deal with one as of yet what to do and not to do has been drilled into my head for years. If the tornado wants to take your roof or move your home to a new location or simply demolish it have the windows open or shut makes no difference. I have no real idea about how to deal with sharks since the closest I have been to one is at the aquarium but I was always taught in school not to thrash about and make noise but to stay calm. I have seen other reviews that say some of the first aid like CPR is out of date I don't know anything at all about that but knowing the tornado section is then.... I'm assuming the section on plants is correct but I think I'll check other sources first. I really liked the section on camp craft and fishing I think I'll stick to using that information for now till it can verify the questions I have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you got it waste it lol. That's what I say which is why I downloaded this one fun easy and funny sometimes.

B005PK56TA|5.0|American Horror Story is a great series full of twist and turns. I recommend it strongly if you are looking for a scary and suspenseful show to watch.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Basic Nevosoft with a slight break from the norm.  The addition of Room type puzzles is a welcome change, however they could use some work.  Sometimes it was difficult to figure out what the next step was supposed to be, and the objects didn't always clearly resemble what it should.  They're moving in the right direction, but some more finessing is needed.

Deterimined to terrorize his sister, Laurie, he begins chasing her in Haddonfield. Donald Pleasance is brilliant as Dr. Loomis.  Halloween is the best horror movie of all-time and a well-crafted thriller. This movie will keep on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Halloween is tbe best horror movie of all-time.

B0064MGU98|5.0|I know, I know, just another lawyer drama - but wait this has a some refreshing twists. Try it you'll like it!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I find this show to be far more artistic than most American produced television. The photography is beautiful and the writing is superb. I love the subtle execution of a worthy theme in each episode. The characters are well developed. Each episode ends before I am ready to be finished watching, but I am left feeling uplifted and a better person for watching. In other words, this is not cheap entertainment!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|The deep, rich storyline combined with the stellar cast, suspenseful situations, and some of the most diverse and developed characters anyone could imagine make this some of the best television ever produced.  The unflinching portrayal of power, sex and deception will pull you into this world.  You'll root for your favorites and gasp at the callous acts of the villains.  In what always characterizes the best stories - consequences of rash decisions are permanent.  I highly recommend.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Just downloaded this and am captivated.  I like the mini games within the game.  Now, back to helping Susan...where's my monkey?
B004XDYJRU|3.0|Android/gtv has the most innovative products. Hope @google works with @googlenexus to develop more than CHROMECAST. #FRAGMENTATIONISGOOD @googlenexus is hands down the best phone minus the lack of LTE support
B005MMZ63C|5.0|This was the first I have sat down and watched this wonderful masterpiece all the way through. Orson Welles was way before his time. The special effects crap that is produced today can't begin to compare to the quality of this work.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|What can I say? Five Finger Death Punch has been one of my favorite bands since the beginning, I've seen them live and met all of them (thank you guys so much, I'll always cherish that memory), I have every album so far, and I have yet to be disappointed. With most bands, I get the album, like a few songs, and hate a few, but with FFDP, I've never had that problem, I love every single song I have ever heard from them, they just kick ass!! This album is no different, it is a must have for any fan of metal, and I highly recommend it. It brings back some of the older elements of FFDP from Way of the Fist, but it brings some new stuff to the table as well. It keeps those heavy, balls to the walls riffs and groove metal type beats, punching bass, and kick ass vocals, but also introduces some new harmonies and melodies, Ivan's vocals just keep getting better with every album, I never fail to be blown away by how aggressive he can be, but then how soft he can be as well. So far, my favorite songs are: Burn MF, Dot Your Eyes, Anywhere But Here, and Lift Me Up. I really enjoyed the metal version of Mama Said Knock You Out as well, it's epic! YOU MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!
B005SEZCVK|5.0|When I missed some episodes during the Science Channel's marathon, I looked to fandom friends and Amazon to play &#34;catch up.&#34;  Saw most of them from my DVR, one from a DVD and this one and one other from Amazon.  I was very impressed with the quality -- easily as good as the other two formats (although my DVD player is NOT Blue Ray, so don't rule out the possibility of better quality there).  I was happy that it was both available and included at no extra cost with the Prime membership.
B00CDCLL1A|2.0|This was too slow and hard to watch in the beginning. It took me 3 times to get through the movie.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|richard marx has always been one of my favorite performers Went to see him when he first came out and loved it.He came out on stage with a tuxedo on, lifted the tails and sat at the piano. Ist song was right here waiting for you. watch a lot of him on you tube and his sons are so talented. Loved the DVD that came with the CD, watched it
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|How can there be a guide for the candy crush saga game but there isn't an app on kindle fire for the game? That is so, as my son can say, FAKE!!!!! GET it together Amazon!!!!!! Really!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a fun game I play it a lot  it is a good game if you like temple run
B009NQZVKG|2.0|This was my least favorite of all of Rollins' books. It just didn't do it for me, although I still think he's a great writer and look forward to his next book. Fingers crossed!
B009AJDDQU|5.0|As a prequel to the alien series, this movie is great.  It is visually stunning, and I like how it makes you wonder, where did we really come from.  Some of the action sequences are a little over the top (Hello lady, jumping and leaping and running and being totally invincible after that emergency C-section?!) but I suppose most movie action usually is.  It does make me miss Bishop though - it seems all those A.I robots are just as nasty - or nastier - than their human counterparts.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fast pace uno game with other people not computers that will never give you the chance of winning!!!! Love love love love love love it!!!!
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|I love this work by MAYA&#62; The jazz component is awesome. I always loved her work and this peace is a gem.  I Love this cd. The item was received within the time frame that was set. I am satisfied with this purchase. CD is in excellent condition and played with utmost satisfaction.
B004GJYROG|5.0|My husban an i bought this movie for our son. We wanted him to watch movies that we used to watch when we were young. Which are better then some movies now days! He loves it!
B000M5AJQI|5.0|This DVD was one of the most intriguing of all of the movies I had seen. Dam! the suspense was breath taking. DiCaprio was at his best. I Love this DVD. Watched it several times, a feat that is somewhat difficult for me to accomplish with movies. The item was received within the time frame that was set. I am satisfied with this purchase. DVD is in excellent condition and played uninterrupted and I am totally satisfied.
0345529057|4.0|Whether you like the books or not depends on your taste, but I will say that I'm not into fantasy. I picked these up based solely on my experience with the TV show. This may be bad advice, but if the show is fresh in your mind I would consider skipping the first book since season one of the show is very much in line with what happens in book one. I think nearly every major quote from the book is in the show, and I could picture the scenes exactly as I read the text.<br /><br />Books two and three are somewhat different from the show. You really feel like you're getting some info and foreshadowing that simply isn't conveyed in the show. Still, aside from a few major differences, they are somewhat the same. I will say that enough happens in the last 400 or so pages of book three to make it worth your while if you are a fan of the show. The series is going to get a little crazy!<br /><br />Book four - I don't know what to say... it's the weakest in the series. Apparently it happens in parallel with book five, which is interesting, except it is missing all of the characters I care about. There are no Tyrion or John Snow chapters in AFFC. Nearly half the book is Cersei and Brienne. They are good characters, but not near as intriguing. It also marks a huge slowdown in the series. Book three happens at a fever pitch, and book four gears down quite a bit right when some interesting things start to happen. There's also a bunch of cliffhangers at the end, so if you're impatient I'd hold off on reading the books.<br /><br />As far as this package goes, it's not the best but it gets the job done. The books are printed on very thin paper and the text is very small. This wasn't that big of a problem, but if I had to do things over again I would have sprung for the hard cover or kindle versions. I got the hardcover for the fifth book, and it is much easier to read.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Great DVD. Move recording was crisp. Visual was crystal clear and sound effects very captivating and engaging. One of the better performances exhibited by Ben. A very moving and engaging thriller. The DVD was a gem. The item was received within the time frame that was set. I am satisfied with this purchase. DVD is in excellent condition and played uninterrupted.
B00005JOA0|5.0|Love amazon movie collections I continue to build up my collection of movies. Just make sure the company your buying from has good reviews and a high score and look to see if they have any major complaints on them . I never had any problems but I always checked there reviews!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was very different from what I expected in a positive way!! Love the message it sends to everyone about life, love, evil and more. Truly a cute movie for everyone to enjoy :)

B006C45CFG|5.0|The movie was true to the time, clothes, towns, people, etc.  And to have something like this happen in that time would be like something like that happening in our time.  It was a good story, good characters, I love Daniel Craig, and all my family and friends thought it a great movie.<br /><br />a

0689835604|5.0|My grandson's 7 months old, and he'll love this book. Baby's love learning about their eyes, ears, nose, belly button, etc. This book is well-made, and the pictures are cute, cute, cute! We'll all have fun reading it to him over and over.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Lame and poorly acted. Found myself playing with my phone and reading a magazine while I \\"watched.\\" The premise seemed good, but the actual progression of the story and the acting was pitiful.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the greatest game ever it rocks buy it as soon as you see it it is awesome !!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pros:<br />- Once set up it works as advertised for a great price<br />- Image quality is good provided you have decent wireless coverage<br />- Superior use model to Apple's AIRPLAY for cloud based content where you initiate with synced device, but then the Chromecast takes over and directly streams the content.  For example, with Netflix you an use a tablet device to select a movie, select the Chromecast to stream, and can then turn off the tablet device or do other things with the tablet.  On an iOS device using AIRPLAY you must leave the device on as AIRPLAY is streaming from the device and for video the iOS device must be actively playing the video - in the AIRPLAY model the iOs device is streaming from the cloud based source and the AIRPLAY device is streaming from the iOS device.<br />This direct streaming model is a VERY nice feature for Chromecast (please copy Apple) but will be more useful when more apps are available.  What makes this less useful in reality is that for cloud based content, like HBOGO or Netflix, an app can be written for AppleTV (or Roku) and selected direclty using the on-device GUI which is a better use experience anyway.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lack of a GUI makes setup and use harder than it needs to be:<br />- Why require any secondary device to set it up?  (The Roku has the same issue which makes even less sense as the Roku has a remote and full GUI interface.)<br />- On my network, during setup, the Chromecast claimed it could not connect even though a look at the DHCP server clearly showed the Chromecast was getting an IP address.  Google's (rather poor - online only) help was useless as it asked me to set things that were either already set or did not resolve the issue.  I finally had to DMZ the Chromecast to make the initial connection and complete configuration.  (At this point I was able to remove Chromecast from the DMZ and it worked fine for regular use.)<br />- Really miss a proper GUI for regular use - this device is not really an alternative for a Roku or Apple TV, as one must use the synced device to find, select, control (read Pause) any content.  I find myself missing a GUI and missing a real remote even more.<br /><br />I eagerly ordered this device to try because as the 3 months of Netflix included meant it was less than $20 to test drive.  However, as I already own other devices (AppleTV and Roku) I have not really used the Chromecast since setting it up.  The Chromecast is simply not as slick as either the AppleTV or Roku as a media player.<br /><br />I think this is a great device (at a very fair price) for Android users who want the capability to show some content on TV screens (meaning an AIRPLAY like option for Android) but the Chromecast is not a great media player alternative - the Chromecast needs a GUI and remote to be really useful for media player duties.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I don't often play hidden object games because they're overpriced, or just too easy, but this game is really fun and has some challenging elements. The art is attractive as well and that always helps when you're playing something that the intent is for you to stare at the picture. I didn't give it five stars because if I'm going to pay for something I want it to be A-MAZ-ING. This was close, but not quite there. Overall, fun game, nice art, and it doesn't end within an hour of purchase.
B006TTC54A|5.0|The Blues Brothers have been given the best restoration the film has gotten on this set. The colours, the sound, everything has been cleaned.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the film before, this is the best version out to own, and if you have, get it now! The music will never leave your mind, and the humor is best left to be seen, you'll understand why it's a &#34;classic&#34;in so many people's eyes. The diner scene in particular has to be my favorite.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I could watch Glee everyday.  I have watched the series 3 times now.  I have already ordered season 4. I love it
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Ok, but would like more difficulty, still was fun with finding hidden objects. Would enjoy solving more puzzles. Need more interactive screens
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I think I actually am starting to get the concept of rhythm due to this app. Since I have none, it is quite nice to finally start learning it at my age.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have this app also for the ipod. very easy to use and provides many hours of entertainment. only problem is the small glitches with the free gems tab, but other than that, I love this game!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|Percy Jackson's story is a new twist on an old concept, the offspring of Greek gods. From the old myths of medusa and the minator to Persephone hatred for Hades. Definitely worth watching.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|This film is a very interesting approach to the power of love.  It begins in black and white displaying the lack of deep emotion of each character for each other and. as each starts feeling deeply for each other,  one by one each turns to color.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|So i dont write reviews becasue im just too lazy but this book was fantastic.  It is a long book with intricate plots.  the author leaves you with many questions that intertwine with each other to make for a fantastic read.  I personally cannot wait for the next one.  It is a great book and it is relatively cheep. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This fantastic movie has inspired me to write my first Amazon review, after many years of lurking.<br />The plot is well constructed and not predictable. The acting was top notch.<br />There is quite a bit of swearing and bloody violence, so this is not an appropriate movie for kids.<br />I have not yet seen the movie on which it was based, Infernal Affairs, but hope to do so.
B003GAB6QI|5.0|Police academy movie is really funny.It makes you laugh and that what counts!Enjoy.. you can afford it. Every thing in this movie is the opposite of the real academy.!
1439196834|5.0|Got it as a gift for my boyfriend who is a super fan of How I Met Your Mother. It has the plays mentioned in the show plus more. If you are a fan of the show, I'm sure you will find it hilarious too!
B00003CXS4|3.0|With this being one of the first used I bought I was very pleased with the condition of the item it was pretty much new.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is an amazing movie!  I want Robert Downy Jr.'s babies!  He is so hot and smooth and smart and quick witted.  I love Natasha Rominoff...she is one bad a## chick!  Funny, entertaining....loved it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A splendid movie all the way around. Heartwarming and inspiring sounds clichéd, but about nails it.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed Tom Courtenay's character, having dimly remembered my dad taking us to see &#34;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&#34; in the early 60s. What a career! Dustin Hoffman makes his directorial debut at 75 and knocks it out of the park!
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I'm not one for hype, so I cautiously started this, not expecting a masterpiece.  It's a fun read, not the visceral gravitas of ice and fire, but if you're on the fence and want a new fantasy read, give it a go.
B000VSAEYI|1.0|This is my first review on Amazon, which should show how much I dislike this product.  First, let me say that out of the box everything looked great and it held air.  My kids love this thing!  I discovered a problem when I first drained the pool.  When all of the water was out, I tried to move it but couldn't, as there was water in there that I couldn't see.  It turns out the water that was running through the sprayers leaked into the air chamber.  So the only way to get the water out and move the pool was to deflate the main chamber and then attempt to drain the water.  To use it again, I had to reinflate it and the same problem reoccurred.<br /><br />I was exactly one day outside the Amazon return window, so I decided to call Intex as I figured I couldn't be the only person with this problem.  The call center was clearly outside the U.S. as the operator struggled to understand my fairly simple problem.  It wasn't her fault, but she was clearly being fed prompts from a computer in an attempt to troubleshoot my problem.  Eventually she became frustrated and tried to end the call by saying &#34;everything is working, any questions, thank you for calling.&#34;  I continued to insist that the item needed to be replaced so she put me on hold.  When she came back she apologized and said that there was no warranty for this item so there was nothing she could do.  I asked to speak to a supervisor but she said they were not allowed to transfer calls.<br /><br />Personally I am done buying Intex products.  This is not the first poorly made item from them that I have come across, and their customer service was the worst I have ever encountered.  Fortunately Amazon was more understanding and agreed to refund me, which is why I will continue to shop Amazon, just not for Intex products.  It's a shame because this is a great pool with a major flaw that Intex will not address.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|It was like the childhood I remember.when I was young watching the wizard of oz.Disney got it right.thank you.Starlite.p.s. if you have not seen this movie,see it!
B004SVM7BW|1.0|There.are.a.lot.of.apps like these out there and having a.pdf reader is very useful on a mobile device, especially if you are using it to read diagrams, patterns, tech manuals, etc.<br /><br />However, the fact that you MUST have internet access in order to USE it makes it useless to me.  I don't have, nor do I WANT to have, constant internet access on my Nexus 7 tablet.  The point of having a reader like this is so you can download the item you need and then read it when you are ready.  I am a avian tracker and have manuals to keep notes on while in the field so I thought this would be great for that.  Wrong.  I can only use it on one.device or have to pay.for.another.copy, can only use it with internet.access which takes more battery, costs.ME money and leaves my personal life.and location open to some random developer.<br /><br />Keep looking if you want a pdf reader that allows notetaking, there are better apps out there that dont violate your privacy, greedily require you to purchase.a separate copy for all of your devices and allow you to use the app in a.way that is convenient to YOU.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun.  Still trying to figure out how the power ups all work.  Now hoping for even bigger maps.  Great job!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Loved the trilogy! Great story behind the story. Worth reading. It keeps you wanting more. You won't regret buying the books.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey continues it's excellence.  I would like to see more of the unfolding of the move to the 20th century.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|After so much hype, controversy, etc. it took me awhile to actually buy the book. I was pleasantly surprised by the book and loved the back story (not talking about the steamy stuff).  It keeps you hooked and I ended up buying and subsequently reading the rest of the trilogy in one weekend!
B0046B3QTG|4.0|My husband and I loved this movie. I cannot wait to see the second one. Very cute with nice message
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Loved the trilogy! Great story behind the story. Worth reading. It keeps you wanting more. You won't regret buying the books.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|This movie has all the elements of a GREAT movie! First, it is Science Fiction! A man who stands apart finds Eternal Love and HOME!! And Led Zeppelin!! On my list of my top favorites The Last Samurai is always in the top 3 for me. I remember the LOOK on his face when he finds HOME from both movies!!! And he also has a companion named \\"Bob\\" he seems to always have one-way conversations with!
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show is entertaining and has thoughtful stories. It has good twists and turns which seem more realistic than most shows. Character development is always in the foreground and not shoved to the side.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|This movie is a classic! What those men went through was horrific, but they stuck together to accomplish their goal.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|As an introvert I really relished this book. I found myself in almost every page. It's packed with stories, meaningful research and amazing warmth. Though I am a psychologist myself and have studied, read about these concepts for years. The way it was presented in this book was really beautiful.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|He takes the mystery out of the Bible and replaces it with logic.  It seems that the followers of Jesus are today's orthodox Jews while the Christians follow the teaching of Paul.  I do not believe a Christian or a Jew could have written a book like this because of their built in biases.  It took a Muslim to paint such an accurate picture of the man.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Riveting - Suzanne Collins has a fantastic mind!  Could this be our future if we don't pay attention to what 's going on in the world around us? Do we blindly believe what we  are told or do we question and make intelligent decisions based on facts and logical reasoning?!
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|The plot is only there to drive the fight scenes, which leaves the movie feeling kinda empty. It would make a decent movie if they had tried but well its as it is, its decent but will leave you wanting something more filling.
B0063GORYU|3.0|At first, I really enjoyed this game. But it gets old. I don't play this much anymore but you may want to give it a try.
B0095P33IW|5.0|I am not a fan of comic books, never read them as a kid.  In fact I don't care for much animation either.  However I do enjoy a good action movie so when a friend told us about the Marvel comic series: Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Thor and the Avengers we decided to someday take a look.  We found ourselves watching Iron Man on regular TV--commercials and all we were so hooked.  We went to Amazon immediately to see what they offered.  We were amazed at how well these movies were done.  Captain America is fantastic and is my favorite too.  I thought it was going to be hokey but it was so well done I wanted to watch it again.  Suspend reality and take a break, watch the Marvel Comics series you'll have a great time.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie, I have seen every James Bond movie made and this one was definitely one of my favorites, a good end to the story started in casino royale
B004ADF7RO|5.0|HD was life-like and crystal clear. Goonies is a true classic. It is free with Amazon Prime...One Eyed Willy would approve.  HEEEEEY YOOOOOOOOU GUUUUUUYSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Interestig take on Jesus, nothing too controversial.  Well written and gas heart.would appeal to readers who appreciate  Marcus Borg and graduates of EDM
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent series. To tell you the truth, I didn't think I would like it. Turns out, I was wrong.  The characters are well developed, it has a great story line and the acting is excellent. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. Well done!
0843178442|5.0|I really enjoy the Mr. and Little Miss books. Any child with collection of these stories should be very lucky. They are fun to read to children and are simple enough for children to read themselves. Highly recommend them.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love lawyer shows just like I love reading John Grisham novels. I think I may have been a lawyer in another life. Anyway, this is one of the best lawyer shows on TV. Harvey Spectre is the coolest cat on the block. Got swag!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|What a piece of junk! I was desperate for something to watch and even though I had my doubts about this movie I thought the special effects might be good. Wrong! There is nothing at all redeeming about this movie!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show. Harvey is so cool and Mike is so smart. I wish I were both of them combined.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|The price for this dvd are higher at the Box stores. You can beat the price Shia Labeouf has. Transformer Fan
B005K0HDGE|5.0|How does Stephen King tell such wonderful stories? Kept me wanting the to continue even further. Yet another great one!
B000P0J09W|5.0|Love this movie!  Absolutely love it!  This is one of the greatest movies from my childhood. A true 80's classic.
B009POHHR6|5.0|The only thing I didn't enjoy or rather made me uncomfortable was how parallel this book truly is from a socioeconomic standpoint.
B009CG29RK|5.0|I just love this movie makes me laugh every time I watch. Ready to own Despicable Me 2 have already seen it twice.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Mindless action adventure, but turn the sound off, the dialog is really pretty silly. Cardboard villains and cardboard heros. Waste of time.
B001HN6922|3.0|i really didnt like it that much but it was for my friend who really enjoys disney movies. she is the one who i help on here to get movies for.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm a huge batman fan. Always have been. I was very impressed with this trilogy. I own the first 2 on DVD and was looking for to buy the 3rd. This set went on sale on bluray for cheaper than I could have gotten the 3rd alone. No brainer. Not to mention I would have upgraded the first two to bluray eventually anyway. No complaints from me! The special features discs are just an added bonus, but I was really after the movies. It comes with a cool little book you'll look at once or twice so there's another bonus. I prefer boxed sets that come with individual cases, this one does not. But, like I said, I really just want to have the movies to watch, now I have them!
0307887960|5.0|[...]<br />free book.<br /><br />my friend did it for 6 months and she looks amazing. I got jealous so i'll do i too.
B005LHOKFS|3.0|It does contain some chain motels, dining, etc. I am on a kindle fire so the app does not  do location based information. I typed a local address it did not use for location. General chain info was not a problem. It may not be worth taking up space on my device. I can not comment how it works on a smart phone. I only wanted to be able to type address from which I could locate  optional facilities.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The best thing about angry birds star wars is it's not just the same old birds. They have been given cool new powers, or weapons, and the boards are more challenging to match. My favorite bird is now Red, because he went from useless to cool with the addition of a lightsaber. I paid for it and don't have the free version on my kindle fire HD, so I am never bothered by ads whatsoever. So worth it. I have the free version on my phone and it's so annoying the way it literally interrupts the game!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is mad fun and the world tours are cool too. I'm at Beijing now and it's very atmospheric and the graphics are nice.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Magic academy 1 was a good find the item and find the difference game. MA2 mixes it up with moving walls and sequence of items needed for things to happen. It still has the find the missing items and find the difference like the first game.  MA2 does not have a time limit so you can think, and try different parts to a puzzle.  Fun game.  I'm enjoying it.  Can't wait to show my daughter this game, after I finish it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Dear Subway Surfers creator,<br /><br />You people did a great job on this game. So many people love this game. How did you guys make the game so exciting. Thanks guys you made lots of people happy.<br /><br />From Justin
B009IU6BIS|5.0|I have watched this movie probly over 100 times, and it's funnier every time I watch it! LOL 10+++++ Stars
B00DW3X07M|5.0|I only heard about Virgil when he started playing some gigs recently with Allan Holdsworth. I knew he was an amazing drummer from viewing some of those performances, however I wasn't prepared for such a polished and frankly outstanding solo album. The music here is high energy, with high level musicianship in the \\"fusion\\" vein...though don't place too much importance on labels, this recording covers a huge amount of ground. Compared to the frankly lame efforts of late by other artists in the same realm, this is a real gem. What I love is the strong composition, lending a great framework to some great solo pieces. Too often, music in this genre relies on great musicianship and soloing, but hasn't got the composition or the ideas.....it just becomes boring and self indulgent. This is such a great recording I'm finding it difficult to leave it alone. There are a lot of influences here, but it doesn't copy anyone.....I've been hearing elements of \\"heavy machinery\\", tribal tech, UK, Holdsworth (of course) and even some orchestral pieces reminiscent of Tony Williams later stuff. The playing is just top notch. In fact, there are many players on the cd that I've never heard before, so I'll need to follow some leads. This is generally at the heavier end of the musical spectrum than I'm used to, but I find it addictive and have really been blown away by this cd.....very highly recommended!
B00C27LB20|4.0|Great singer songrwriter. Catchy but definitely not pop. Unique sound - a little Appalachian, a little country rock, all with an edge.  Similar to early Dylan in places.  His lyrics are clever and about life, through the eyes of a young guy.  Love songs are there too but Jake is much more than that.  Agree -  best new talent in a long time.  Others I've played this for agree - we expect to hear much more from him.  Hope to see him in Dallas in Oct.<br />Four stars because not every song is superb.  But still a great album.
B00936A2SM|1.0|I'm afraid this falls into the category of so much promise.....unfulfilled.<br />You can't deny the musicianship here...all three players are at the top of their game, but I was left feeling utterly let down by this recording. The basic problem?......lack of ideas. I want more from these guys than largely a collection of poor cover versions of other tunes...what were these guys thinking?<br /><br />If musicians of this caliber want to just jam....go to a rehearsal room and jam....don't try to make a cd that says nothing and ultimately disappoints completely. I expected more of these guys and so should you. Great music doesn't just happen when you join great musicians together, there needs to be a game plan and clearly these guys didn't have one. Save your money and don't buy this, maybe they'll get the message!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My daughter & her friends love this game. It's entertaining & has the social responsibility theme of rescuing wildlife. Plus it's free.
B008ENA74E|4.0|Greg Smith was very brave in exposing the bid dogs on Wall Street. We should all be grateful to him.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Couldn't put this book down.  It was so fascinating to learn about a part of history I barely knew.  I now want to read more real life stories about these orphans.  I loved the older main character and so wanted her life to have a least one happy ending or connection in her earlier years.  The present day teenager grew on me as the story went on.  Great book.  Would highly recommend to others.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I totally loved this revamp of the the series! Superb acting!<br />I could watch ten more seasons!!!<br />A must see for Downton Abbey lovers too!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Easy to get the hang of, but challenging enough to keep you around, and not hard enough to drive you away.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Fabulous series that I missed when it first came out.<br />After Season 1 I was totally hooked!<br />Well done in every aspect and I wish it never ended!
B000002WU9|5.0|Top 5 Hip Hop Album Of All Time!!!!.The Whole LP Is Sicc,the Killa Traccs are all but the one's that make my head spin are Knuccleheadz,Knowledge God,Criminology,Rainy Dayz,Guillotine {Swords},Can It Be{remix],Glaciers of Ice,Verbal Intercourse,Ice Cream was killin da 90's,Wu-Gambinos, & Heaven or Hell.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Original and imaginative series with interesting story lines. The first season got me hooked. The first season is well worth watching!
B0000024LN|5.0|Muddy an Dare iz a Darkside are his great albums.Iz He 4 Real!!!,Welcome,Case Closed!!!,Picc It Up,Smoke Buddah,Whateva Man!!! ft The Green Eye Bandit,Creepin,It's Like That{My Big Brother},Soopaman Luva 3, & Da ill Out!!!{Muddy Waters...We Out Fa 97 Word Up Son Peace}.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story has possibilities. However, it become a little monotonous when they continually argue and do makeup sex with out any pause...A little overdone.  And when Ana will not quit asking..., get real!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|As A Farming Family .. We Live By The weather And Use This App Daily!  My Hudband Won't Use any Other app To Plan The Days Work.
B00C7O8MJ8|3.0|Really love the first cd from '09 so opted to get this one without a preview as I haven't seen the movie yet, waiting for the bluray etc, anyway has a mixture of familiar themes as well as new stuff but is not nearly as musical or delightful to listen to as the first rendition was imho. Imagine I'll listen to this one off n on but not as often as I still listen to the original!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it's a likable game but I think it could be made a little tougher or i'm not far enough in the game to get to the tougher games.  its still fun to pass the time away.
B0017I1FP8|4.0|Had no idea if I'd like this soundtrack or not but heard one of the tracks briefly on local on the 8s on twc so previewed it here & found #4 to be the one, overall the whole cd isn't bad, very dark almost Tron-like in places. Very capable piece & worth the time to listen to it! Of course, 7 speakers help with the output! Lots of deep bass that really booms & rattles the windows!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|just wanted to see what it was all about an I liked.  was just cruising the apps section and decided to download it.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Even though the story opens with these words, the prose in itself is nothing less than a masterpiece of art. The fluidity of narration and the detailed description of the surroundings would appeal to lovers of old classics and connoisseurs of modern prose alike.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|This was an awesome movie. It was even worth watching twice. I liked this movie because it was a great drama.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|blu ray is great....prompt service.....nice to have choices for enjoying your favorite movies.  Always love Amy Adams.  Thanks for having it available.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Really enjoyed this game that I just found last night.  I had to think and process and reason and be surprised, and I thought it was great.  Am going back now to try some more.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|It is one of the worst terror movies that I ever seen. Bad visual effects, bad writing and sequences. Do not waste neither your money nor your time.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|But disturbing.  It left me wondering how the parents of kids who kill get through life after such a tragedy.
B00139XSBA|5.0|This book describes the souls and spirit of the astronauts who were in from the beginning.  I will confess that I saw the movie first; that did not diminish the excitement of the book.  I misplaced my copy of the book;  I recently bought the Kindle version and read it again!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is full of information that you need to be aware of to understand why most  Americans are overweight and dying by the thousands, of diseases caused by excessive carb consumption primarily from wheat and wheat based products.
B0000VCZKW|4.0|Our kids loved the movie.  Our son had read the book first, and liked that, so he wanted to see the movie.  The movie is a little different, but very good.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Not finished yet but enjoying this one thoroughly!!!!!! Well written and fluid,, characters well developed. Cannot put this one down. Looking forward to more!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Was under the assumption that this was a plug and play device-that it almost installs itself. That is very far from reality. It initially installed very easily, but &#34;casting &#34; from the icon on the program page resulted in a very grainy,unwatchable picture on the TV despite the page being clear on my computer. After fruitlessly searching the help section on the chromecast page I gave up and called support. The agent was very helpful, but explained that it only really works on netflix and youtube correctly right now. You have to click on the app icon on the video playback window, not the one on the cast app page. He said its still in beta, and there should be upgrades or patches available soon.I checked and it did play a more watchable picture, but when I tried to stop playback the video continued playing but the chrome cast icon on my mac toolbar disappeared. The video continued playing with no way to control it. I have a Roku that this was going to replace or be an alternative to. The Chromecast is now carefully packed back in its box and will be on the way back to Google Monday morning. The Roku set up and has worked flawlessly since the first install. The Chromecast is an interesting toy, but I have no time to play.I actually expected it to work as reviewed and advertised.Maybe some day it will.....until then Roku is my choice.
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|Tom Keifer includes the usual Hard Rock offerings in this effort. The Bluesy slide guitar song, the ballads, the mid-tempo  forgettables, and the angst-ridden social commentaries all are present. Oddly, the album seems to be a Country album. One of today's Kenny Chesneys or Jason Aldeans could dissect this CD and add obligatory banjos and mandolins to the arrangements and have CMT and radio hits. I like the CD, but I'm reminded how easily old Hard Rock has become New Country. Tom Keifer's work from the past and present is a New Country blueprint; he does, however show greater earnestness and acumen than the aforementioned. I will end with this warning: Don't expect original or imaginative lyrics. These songs boast no real novel insights or themes - love, angst, and loss prevail in the usual schemes. The strength of this album relies on the delivery. Mr. Keifer has a brilliant voice and backs himself with phenomenal musicians.
B005F9CPG8|3.0|Well, let's start with the actual music. It's The Beatles, so I personally like most of it.<br />Some songs that aren't too great: \\"Something\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\"<br />This compilation also has a forest of their older, simpler little ditties, which at times can be ridiculously simple. For example, \\"She Love You.\\" Seriously, listen to the chorus. I mean, really? You just have to love the harmonica on the songs like these, though.<br />Some highlights of the CD are, \\"Penny Lane,\\" \\"Lady Madonna,\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby.\\"<br /><br />Now on to packaging, tracklisting, etc.<br /><br />Ok, so I know CD's can only hold 80 minutes, but this thing is missing a lot, and I don't think it's a good enough representation of The Beatles. There's not a single song on here from Sgt. Pepper! That's my favorite album of theirs! But, I see where they were going with this. It really is exactly what it says, \\"A collection of The Beatles' number one hits.\\" It's not THEIR fault Sgt. Pepper didn't have any number one hits. I can understand that. However, the booklet is the disappointment for me. Don't get me wrong, they must have worked hard on it to collect all of those pictures of old sleeves. And the pictures ARE a nice little feature. But, what I don't like is the lack of lyrics. Seriously, don't you want to sing along to all their hits, or at least know what they're singing? Also, it doesn't tell you what albums the songs can be found on. I still have no idea where the following songs were originally from:<br /><br />Eight Days a Week<br />Ticket to Ride<br />Day Tripper<br />We Can Work it Out<br />Paperback Writer (is it Revolver?)<br />Eleanor Rigby<br />Penny Lane<br />All You Need is Love (Yellow Submarine, or from somewhere else?)<br />Hello Goodbye<br />Lady Madonna<br />Hey Jude<br /><br />This is the only Beatles CD I own, however I've gathered a few things and came up with this:<br /><br />OK, so I'm not really a die-hard Beatles fan, even though I'm pretty sure thisis my first Amazon Review. So, I really don't want to have to put up with the crap songs like \\"Revolution 9.\\" But, I still like The Beatles, and want a good representation of their music. So, the quality and content of this representation depends on how much you're willing to spend:<br /><br />1.) If you just want ONE SINGLE CD of a few of their best songs, then I suppose you should get this. [[ASIN:B005F9CPG8 The Beatles 1]]<br /><br />2.) If you want ALL of their good songs, with lyrics and essays, then you should really get both the Red Album and the Blue Album. [[ASIN:B003YNFYCO The Beatles: 1962-1966]] [[ASIN:B003YNFYD8 The Beatles: 1967-1970]]<br /><br />3.) Any further then that, you should just get all their songs. [[ASIN:B002BSHWUU The Beatles (The Original Studio Recordings)]]
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I've seen this at the theatre twice and awaiting release of DVD so I can buy it.  It was just as exciting and entertaining to watch as the first one and Chris Pine was outstanding as Captain Kirk.  I look forward to a 3rd production.
B001P36OY2|4.0|This movie was based on a Georges Dantec &#34;Babylon Babies&#34;. While not a faithful reproduction of Mr. Dantec's novel, it managed to catch the tone and emotional flavor of the book. Vin Diesel did a good job playing Toorop, the central character.<br /><br />The action scenes are great and kept the movie exciting. Some scenes of the movie reminded me of Mad Max and Doomsday.<br />Strong performances from great actresses like Charlotte Rampling and Michele Yeoh also added positively to the movie.<br /><br />The ending was a disappointment as others mentioned. The movie is good but not great. It could have been better if it were made longer to develop story sub-plots.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is sharp and delivers powerful DTS Master Audio effects.<br />I liked the movie and will be watching it more than once.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Lots of action due primarily to Bruce's co-star Jai Courtney.  It still feels like a continuation of the DieHard series, but this time in Russia.  Still, lots of action, but getting harder for Bruce to complete all the action.  I think it's time he retired.
B001AK3S3U|5.0|I thought this was a great sequel. It has plenty of action, special effects, and comedy. Ice Cube breathes new life into the xXx series.<br /><br />Others may disagree, but I thought XXX: State of the Union was a great action movie; it had everything I want in this kind of thriller, and there's nothing more enjoyable than getting to the truth of a vast conspiracy - especially when the path is filled with as many explosions as the filmmakers can pack into 100 minutes. It's true that a lot of innocent civilians and a fair share of good guys are killed in the process, but this is just a movie -a wildly entertaining one that I thoroughly enjoyed.
B00AZNEW5G|2.0|I just couldn't get interested in this film.  It moved slow and the action was, well, not entertaining.  I was sorry I rented this one.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I loved the way the story was told - memories of the ladies maid. Interesting story of the choices women had- both well-to--do and poor, their place in society and reasons for marriages.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and Meryle did an outstanding performance of Thatcher.  Many things I never noticed about the real 'Iron Lady' when she was Prime Minister, but watching this film gave me new insight.  Loved it.
0140143505|3.0|I liked it but you can tell that there are some parts missing and that is a little bit confusing.  But still good.  We should all continue to write letters, they are more lasting than texts and emails.
B00846REIS|3.0|I bought this book a year after reading the fifty shades trilogy and I am very disappointed. I purchased this book looking for summer entertainment and instead received summer disappointment.  While I read many reviews before buying and downloaded the sample before purchasing the complete book I am not happy with the out come. Yes, there are some slight similarities to the fifty shades of grey book I feel that the story line (sex)  in this book was delivered better but the over all plot lacked suspense. After reading this book I have no desire to follow up on the Eva and Gideon's relationship ... I'm more invested in Eva and Carey's.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|A convenient way to add money to your account.also great for browsing the catalog as well as send gifts to friends and family.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Fun way to escape reality. Sound effects not as good as the original. Would have had one more star except for constant interruption of ads.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I carry my books with me on my Smartphone and my Nexus7. No need for an E Reader. I can read books on my devices as well as playing games.Not to mention staying in touch. This App made my devices even more useful.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I started reading it actually thinking I would not like it, it would be predictable and mundane. I was soon hooked and couldn't put it down, actually not knowing for sure whodunnit through the end.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Heard the music & saw the video on a demo TV at Fry's Electronics. Used a phone app to find out who it was and bought it on the spot. I have no regret. Worth every penny!
B008220C38|1.0|I should have read about this movie before I bought it. I assumed it would be a good movie since Keira Knightley and Jude Law were in it. It's a terrible movie.  It is boring and does not make much sense. They made it like a play on a stage instead of like a movie. That was a bad idea. I quit watching after a while and wrote this review. Do not waste your money on this like I did.
B003VANOFY|2.0|  DO NOT BUY THESE  DO NOT BUY THESE  DO NOT BUY THESE  DO NOT BUY THESE  DO NOT BUY THESE  DO NOT BUY THESE  DO NOT BUY  <br />I purchased these, getting back into gaming as I lost my old headset. These seemed pretty good and were fairly cheap, (paid ~$80 for them) and was fairly excited. As I handled them right out of the box I could tell they were cheaply made. The way it's put together makes it very noisy when moved, and just your jaw movement makes a very annoying noise from them. Now, the mic was great quality and crystal clear. The software for the headset glitched up all the time and every hour or less the headphones will shut off and turn back on, interrupting any playing sound. The sidetone goes to about %15 when it has any connection problems, eg: a bit too far away from host connector. The mic volume never stays in the same place when using the mic itself. The charge level is never displayed correctly and it dies quickly after a few weeks. I repeat, do not purchase these, go with the corsair vengeance 2000 headset instead. Thank me later
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really love this game. I can't stop playing it. I refuse to buy coins though and this makes things frustrating when I run out and have to wait for more...
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never thought I would be interested in a show about law but this show has certainly got me captivated.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The first two and a half seasons were great, but things unravel in the third season. The plot starts to mirror a soap opera and the producers abandoned their historical narrative in favor of a comfy, modernized 1920s. But more than all of that, if the show can't convince it's biggest stars to stay on to the end of the series, how will they convince the viewers to keep watching as the show kills off main characters whose actors are heading for greener pastures? It looks like they might crawl across the finish line. Too bad, because it started as a great series.
B009KUANWG|5.0|What can I say, she is a superstar, love all Adele's songs and loved the movie that went with the song.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can hardly wait for the next season!  I have recommended the show to several people;  it's good, clean entertainment.  It is realistic but heartwarming.  I like all the actors/actresses as well.  It's addictive!!
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Slick and badass is a good way to describe the movie. If you have seen the other two movies, you know what to expect: impressive special effects, lots of action, lots of battles with Autobots and Decepticons and much more. The movie didn't letdown in any category.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Saw the movie on TV without 3D.  After purchasing a 3D TV this was the 1st movie I bought. Great story...3D makes it better
B001B51B9M|5.0|A classic, which my grandkids really enjoyed. In this day and age of computer generated &#34;stuff&#34;, it was nice to watch a good musical!
B000VSAEYI|3.0|When I took it out of the box, it automatically had a hole.  It did NOT come with a patch kit as I had thought it would have.  It took a while to blow up, with way to many things to block off and separate chambers and what not...The small children had lots of fun...the side wall fountain/squirt wall was a great effect!
B005JZBP8W|5.0|Wonderful movie. Wish the movie makers of today could produce something that was not all full of computer generated special effects, and poor story lines...
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I need the game app. That's why I'll b returning my fire hd.I known this should not b a deal breaker.
0143038583|2.0|This author is notorious for writing good stuff that is TOO MUCH information for the ordinary person to be able to use and profit from.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I finally watched all 3 seasons after hearing it was so good. I can confirm that's its a fantastic show. I also looking forward to Season 4 in January.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Every time I tried to use this it w would say service was down for maintenance I never even got it to work once I gave up on it and have already removed it
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|Everything you need.  All movies included.  2 or movies per case so it appears you might be missing some.  But turn the case over and there is the next movie.have not watched all movies yet but the ones I have watched have been top quality.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|No glitches lots of ho games the levels are hard due to zoom sucks but other than that it would be a five star game
B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Getting totally into country music & The Band Perry were one of the first that just loved. Got 2nd album, & just had to get this one
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written, impeccably researched and extremely well cited. Even the non theologian can understand the realities of the time of Jesus. An excellent read.
B00B3HJMLM|4.0|Loved the first album. Just started playing this one, but enjoying it.  Is he trying to find his youth again.. ha!!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I downloaded this to read books that I purchased from a non-amazon source.  Totally unsuccessful.  Used Aldiko in its place and worked well.  I plan on removing it from my tab and phone if I can.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|Just wanted last night & really enjoyed it. Yes typical Die Hard, but what do you expect. Don't you just LOVE his son!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I first saw it on my granddaughters phone and I was hooked.  Play regularly to lower tension and relax.  My Tablet and phone both have it.
B007HO392S|4.0|Loving the music, loving the songs. Not sure if Carrie Underwood can do wrong!! Great great songs.... Bring it on.
B005K17RU0|2.0|this apps is slow. I liked the original app better.  although there is more info I don't care about it.  it loads very slow now. I am looking for a simpler faster weather app.
B009GX69RK|5.0|Funny, quirky, laugh out loud entertainment!!!!! Highly recommend this show! If you like to laugh, you'll love this ensemble! Buy now!
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This book is very readable.  The story line is quite good and the pace is good.  Some of it is predictable but there is enough variation in the story to keep it interesting.  You can't help wonder what you would do in if you were in this situation.
B009GEYX5E|3.0|I don't know if it is my camera or the film. I'm not very pleased with the pictures. They came out too light.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|This is a good movie it could have been better but it dragged on to far especially with the ending. Still a good flick if you like Mark Wahlberg.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|both new and clever.refreshing change from ordinary games.really enjoyed so far.good test of logic circuits in the ole brainpan.should be fun to get to the end if this ones.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun!! Our family - kids and parents have competitions for who can get the highest score. Fun for all ages!
B007UR1OHO|5.0|OK the combination of stars in this great film just has to be owned and watched over and over. It is a tear jerker in parts but both stars are fascinating to watch as they travel through this difficult situation. Well worth the price. This is a very sweet film.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Beautiful. Once again Mitch Albom outdid himself. It is well worth the read. Thought provoking from the beginning start to the end.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|Charming little doll easily handled by a very young mommy--can be hugged, tossed or dragged along and still look good for all the wear and tear.  My granddaughters love them!

B004GYY714|5.0|My husband was recently in the hospital for bypass surgery.  I downloaded this ap to my Kindle so he could listen to his favorite NPR shows.  It was a little piece of his routine during his recovery that he could enjoy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Another addictive male soap opera. Fun to watch and you quickly find yourself cheering for the main characters. The actor who plays Harvey does such a good job at being an a-hole.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just so engrossing and well done.  The characters are so real and the storyline continues to draw you in.  Just a wonderfully done period piece.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is mentaly challenging it makes you use your brain.if you are deciding to get this game ill tell you if you do it wont be a mistake.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This was so sad and beautiful. It makes you want to hug everyone close to you and miss those that aren't. It's the first time I felt my tears weren't waisted on a movie. I remember this tragedy when it happened, glad I was on a ship knowing we were able donate to them.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My husband and I look forward to sitting down and watching this show!! Comedy, drama and great story line. Definitely am hooked

And what's even better, ITS FREE!! Trust me, you won't regret getting this app if you like playing uno! And also, if you run out of tokens to play games with people, every 22 minutes, you win some more!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Not much to say.  This is a basic calculator that works very well.  It looks good and is very easy to use.
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|I was captivated by this trilogy from the very beginning. I could not put it down, until the very last page of the last book. I have never read anything like it before, and I would highly recommend it,
0670451495|4.0|This is a great book for children that can read.  The story is very good and the illustrations are excellent.  I will save this book for when my granddaughter is a little older.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book held me captive. The story was very interesting, and I was surprised and delighted with the ending. I cried real tears, and also smiled a lot.
B00CO8TA4I|4.0|I selected this CPU for a gaming rig. I needed something future proof to make sure it doesn't bottleneck any GPU I place in there. tested it with a GTX 770 which is equivalent to the GTX 680. ran benchmarks on 1080p and got almost the same results I got from i5 4670k (no overclocking in both tests). no need to OC nor try to exceed the capabilities of this CPU. I was planning to get an i5 4670k + after market cooler + Z87 mobo. then I researched some benchmarks and realised there is no need to go for an expensive CPU while the graphics are all in the GPU. so I skipped the cooler, downgraded to this CPU and downgraded the mobo choise to B85. this saved my $ 80 which was invested in upgrading the GPU and thus achiving an excellent performance.<br /><br />if you plan to play games on a single monitor at 1080 res or even at 1440 res then you're looking for a GPU of the GTX 760 tier or HD 7870 XT or even the higher tier such as GTX 770 or HD 7970 then this CPU is the right choice for you. however, if you plan to go even higher or to SLI, then I guess you'd be better off with an i5 4670k (or i7 depending on your target res+FPS and required GPU setup for the job) + Z87 board + after market cooler in that case. hence that overclocking will require you to buy a higher watt PSU which might add up more bucks to the budget. I'm using 550W for this build which is considered overkill considering I'm not overclocking or using GPU in SLI/CF.<br /><br />The only con that cost the last star is the price point. although this cpu is great, I find it more feasible to buy an ivy bridge higher end cpu from microcenter at the same/lower price. idk what intel is thinking with their price ranges. you'll also save up on mobo as the Z77 prices are decreasing in the presence of the newer Z87 generation. it's true that you'll lose the 10% performance advantage of haswell but you'll have overcloking capabilities which is even more future proof for gaming rigs.<br /><br />The setup:<br /><br />CPU:Intel Core i5-4570<br />Motherboard: MSI B85-G41 PC Mate ATX LGA1150<br />Memory: Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 CL9 1.5v<br />SSD: Samsung 840 120GB SATA 6b/s<br />HDD: Western Digital Caviar Black 750GB 3.5\\" 7200RPM SATA 6b/s<br />GPU: EVGA GTX 760 2GB ACX Cooler Superclosked<br />Case: NZXT Tempest 410<br />PSU: SeaSonic G 550W 80 PLUS Gold ATX12V / EPS12V Semi-Modular<br />OD: LG GH24NS95 DVD/CD Writer<br />OS: Microsoft Windows 8 Professional (64-bit)

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I have always had a fascination with the who, what, why of these young men we read about all too frequently who garner an arsenal of weapons and shoot teachers, school mates, family members, etc.  Written through the eyes of the mother, I gained so much insight into who these young men are, were, and what their psyche drives them to do.

B00AFPVPDG|4.0|I heard Josh interviewed on a recent podcast (Accidental Creative, also highly recommended). His analytical method, broken into specific steps is a major step forward in how to effectively and efficiently learn pretty much anything. With the increased attention &#34;just in time learning&#34; is getting these days, Josh's spot on in learning what you need to know and putting it to use quickly. A very good read that applies to nearly all skill sets. Give it a read; you won't be disappointed.

B0090SI3ZW|3.0|RZA loves Hong-Kong martial arts movies. Even if you don't know the origin of his group's name Wu-Tang Clan, you know that for sure after watching \\"The Man with the Iron Fists\\" RZA stars and directs. Together with such famous actors like Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu, RZA's feature debut includes such veteran Chinese actors as Kuan Tai Chen, Ka-Yan Leung and Chia Hui Liu (credited as Gordon Liu), the star of, yes, \\"The 36th Chamber of Shaolin.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, loving something is one thing; making it actually is another. \\"The Man with the Iron Fists\\" just doesn't have a good story to tell, and a central character that hold our attention throughout the film's running time. Here RZA plays the titular reluctant hero, a skilled weapon-making blacksmith in the 19th century Chinese \\"Jungle Village,\\" where warring clans fight over power, money and honor.<br /><br />But I'd rather not summarize the plot which is slow and pretty dull. To be fair, the martial arts sequences are interesting, being choreographed by Cory Yuen (choreographer of \\"The Transporter\\" and many others). The gorgeous production design, with the set made in China, is also impressive.<br /><br />This is RZA's homage to the 70s exploitation movies including Shaw Brothers kung-fu films. Like Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill,\\" the film is made with love for the genre, but that is not enough to make a compelling action movie that stands on its own.

B00DHNBPA6|5.0|As a horror movie buff it takes a LOT to make me jump and this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I am still a huge fan of the original movies but this was a whole new direction of scary(but Bruce Campbell should have been at least in for a cameo)

B008Y73XTQ|4.0|They don't make 'em like this anymore. Wolfgang Peterson's epic WW2 submariner opera is lengthy enough to contain the tedium of 'the silent service' with action-packed scenes that more than make up for it. It's a taut survival thriller that shows the maddening pressures and overwhelming camaraderie of this doomed submarine crew.<br />Watch this film to see what subsequent, lesser films of similar subject matter tried to emulate.
B00338QENI|5.0|&#34;The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks&#34; definitely deserves 5 stars, not only because of the superb research, but the ability of<br />Rebecca Skloot to understand and present the feelings of the Lacks family. The writing was remarkably graceful writing  for such an extremely complex subject.  As a book club choice it elicited more discussion than any other book we have read this year.

B0064X79JC|2.0|Having read both Drive and Driven (the sequel) in about a day and half as they are fairly short and concise novels, I'm not sure I can totally relate to many of the positive reviews here. The author does have a dry prose which serves well to depict the grit and dilapidation of certain american sprawling suburbs like Phoenix and LA, where most of the book takes place, however the story line is very disjointed and downright confusing. Present actions interleave with past ones, which interleave with future ones, to a point where the entire plot starts looking like a car swerving out of control. As a better analogy, imagine the story being a big jigsaw puzzle that you break apart, shuffle well then pick randomly piece by piece and read. Some passages definitely require a second pass in order to make sense of what's really going on.<br />Second thing I disliked is how easily the main character dispatches goons, without any weapons or prior training in martial arts as if they're simple, mindless puppets or automatons. But make no mistake, they all come at him prepared and armed with deadly intent, yet somehow he always prevails unscathed. Completely unrealistic. Even 007 has closer calls! And for those that are looking to retrace segments of the famous movie, there's about 10% overlap with the onscreen adaptation...which is very, very loosely based on this book. On the positive side, some dialogues are fun to read if you can make abstraction of the cookie-cutter mobsters.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|this book was a great read on the weekend. but i do not think i would have paid full price.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is a new kind of game for me. The tasks and quest are a little confusing because I can't tell if I have collected the prize for completion sometimes. Maybe would be better played on a larger screen. A little to crowded on the kindle fire I use.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|The leather feels very nice on this case.  That's the only nice thing I can really say and I will give it the 2nd star for the cow that had to die for it.  The case I received does not stay closed on its own without the strap so it continuously went to sleep and woke up on its own. Of course in the morning my kindle was drained of power. Also the part that rotates is not solidly in the case, it is just held on by 1 side.  So when I would be holding it it would sometimes just flip apart and bang my kindle on whatever was next to me.  Returned,

0307346617|5.0|No, the book is not the movie.  I really liked the movie.  I loved this book.<br /><br />I ordered this because I love a good zombie story and I'd already read about 40 pages sometime last year.  There's a lot that can be said about this book, but most impressively, Max Brooks gets to the point.  He covers a lot of ground in a little over 340 pages and all of it is engaging.  After a brief intro explaining why this work exists, it consists entirely of interviews with people who survived the war.<br /><br />These voices give the book it's character, ranging from people in the human-trafficking world where the first infected were spilling out of China, to a girl who watched ill-prepared survivors try to out last their first winter, to a soldier who survived a catastrophic battle with a horde of zombies.  The book strikes a balance between giving you up close details from these first person perspectives and leaving plenty to the imagination.  So while he doesn't spend the whole book talking about people being eaten by zombies or dying from other horrible circumstances, you can pretty much figure what goes down all over the world in each phase of the war.<br /><br />I also loved the gaps which developed in the storyline, leaving you wondering how certain things happened.  Many of them are filled in later but not all of them.  This is a book written by people who survived the war and are still trying to understand it.  (The intro explains that the war has been over for some time, so I'm not giving anything away.  Though as you get closer to the end, you learn more about what the current state of the planet is like, adding even more intrigue.)<br /><br />I also read The Zombie Survival Guide after this book.  It's an even faster read than this one and is a lot of fun.  I recommend it.
B00338QENI|5.0|this book was SO GOOD! i read it in just a couple of days because i found it so interesting. i loved reading about the science as well as the people in the lacks family. definitely recommend this book!

B00AFPVPDG|2.0|I would expect a guide to decompose tasks to actually achieve something in 20 hours. Instead of this, I got some 50 pages of theory (the three stars) and a few guides on how to write a web page and do some other stuff I don't care about. It really lacks some generalisation of the process as there is only half a page at the end of each \\"accomplishment\\" chapter on what he did (unfortunately, not a word on the method, only a bullet list of tasks)<br /><br />Maybe a title like: how to write a book and make loads of money in 20 hours, would suit it better.<br /><br />I really start to miss authors that actually research their field and not list their \\"Experiences\\" on how they accomplished to be rich selling the book you just paid.

1451695195|5.0|I found this book to be enlightening, assuring,  graphically painted, and very believable. There are those who are adept at connecting  ordinary people with family and friends in the afterlife; truly a wonderful gift in of itself -- albeit none that I know of that could speak as clearly on the subject, as the author, himself, who lived it ...Doctor Eben Alexander has done so in his marvelous book, &#34;Proof of Heaven,&#34; Clearly he presents dialogue that is crisp and easy to grasp, as well as lifting the reader into the total experience that gives hope. Overall, the detail is inspiring.  With that said, there is only one caveat ... I think that the author could have done a better job editing the piece  grammatically before going to print.  Other than that. BRAVO Dr. Alexander, BRAVO!

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is an adorable film that is fun to watch as a family.  A unique plot, a nontraditional family theme, and fantastic characters are a total win in our house.  We even laugh at the DVD menus.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Took a chance on the crossfire series based off the other reviews.  I've also read 50 shades books.  The may seem similar but there are differences in these two series.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book is O.K. but I was a little disappointed since I don't believe it is as good as the other books by Khaled HOSSEINI (&#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;).  I will admit, I put it down and did not get back to it for awhile (usually, if a book is really good, I will not put it down - I will continue to read it until done) and found it very confusing to get back to the story.  I would recommend it BUT do not expect it to be as interesting as the other two books that I mentioned.
B00006F2TV|4.0|excellent movie. if u like super hero movies this one is a good origin about how he first got his powers n then started fighting crime.
B00CTERB2A|2.0|With all the positive review I had hoped to enjoy this show for some mindless entertainment. However, I quickly got bored and didn't even finish the season. It's not for me but maybe you'll enjoy it.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I love this series.  It if filled with metaphors to current life, but done with good storytelling, great characters and FX.  But what makes this a great series is the use of world history as a basis for the stories and characters.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|The show is funny and unpredictable sometimes.  I really like the characters, especially Jenna.  I am looking forward to watching season 2.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I think many people have expressed adequately what I thought of this book, so I'm not going to repeat it. There was nothing right about this book.

B001JIFYSA|5.0|Love Actually is, by far, my favorite romantic comedy of all time.<br /><br />The power of the previous statement is limited by both the qualifying term \\"romantic comedy\\" and the fact that I'm not typically a fan of the genre.  So, a skeptical reader might (correctly) surmise that \\"Love Actually is, by far, my favorite romantic comedy of all time\\" isn't quite the proclamation of towering praise it initially seems to be.  Okay, fair enough.<br /><br />Love Actually is in my top 10 favorite films of all time; I've watched it at least twice a year since it was released; it is my VERY favorite holiday film, and I've purchased 17 copies of the DVD over the years.<br /><br />Better?<br /><br />The movie is just plain good.  Sappy in places?  Sure.  But there's enough variety here that just about any viewer is going to find something to like.  There is a pretty absurd amount of star power here, and most of them deliver really solid performances.  There is no shortage of laugh-out-loud scenes, and while the movie offers more than a few moments that will tug at your heartstrings, this film is (thank God) not a tear-jerker.<br /><br />Love Actually is a true ensemble film.  It doesn't really follow a single plot.  Instead, it follows more than a dozen different people through individual storylines that turn out to be (loosely in most cases) intertwined.  They range from the completely silly to the more-sad-than-funny, and all of them are played out against a Holiday Season backdrop in London.<br /><br />I've watched this movie with lots of different people over the years, and I can't think of a more ringing endorsement than the number of copies of the DVD I've given as gifts to those same people (after their reaction to the first viewing).
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This was an okay book...I had heard much hype about it since the movie came out. I don't really watch movies of books, as a reader, so I didn't see it, but was excited to read the book. I was deflated. It was such a bland teen angst novel that I barely made it through. Worse, I will only be able to recommend it to the most elite of high school readers.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Absolutely perfect. John Green by far my Favorite author, one for the history books next to Austen, Dickens, Fitzgerald, and so many more.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved the book! I bought it for my 9th grade English library and read it first. I will recommend it for sure. It has an awkward vibe, an underdog thing going for it that I really liked and that I think will appeal to my students. The love story was very touching.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|The subject says it all, I wanted the game on my kindle and all I got was a help guide, to what? No game offered.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|But only if you want to laugh your tail feathers off... typical over the top humor on Chevy Chases part makes this a fun movie to watch. Enjoy.
1439130833|3.0|I thought it would be something else.  It is not that I don't like it, its just I guess I thought it was something else.
B00BXHLM1K|5.0|I love the music in this opera and I enjoyed the Las Vegas setting.  I enjoy seeing different versions of the same opera.  I've seen the traditional production at the Met with Placido Domingo and that was, of course, great too.  But while some modern, trashy productions ruin an opera, this production does not.  I will watch it again and again.
B00DYMM76Q|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin have done a fantastic job of capturing the Bakersfield sound on this album.  Easily one of this year's best albums.
B004FWXHS6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It has a great deal of froth and a not so surprising,  but good and full filing ending
B006SV2LWA|4.0|I always thought it would be fun to be a virologist. I love movies like this. We always worry about the big problems in the world but maybe it is the little things that need our attention.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I can't say wow enough!  What an amazing story Lauren wrote. I can't wait to read more books in this series including Hana!
B003L77FYS|5.0|Great season that continues to develop the relationship between Castle and Beckett.  Also has some great opening into Beckett's past (like the guy who trained her).  Would definitely recommend this to any Castle fan.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|It's a rarity that I don't finish a book. I simply had no interest in how it ended. the end
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Love  this book! So glad I get to read it to my kids just like my mom read it to me.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very emotional book. I remember similar personalities from when I was in school. And the music mentioned was from my era.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Excellent story and acting.  Very exciting story line and the acting was wonderful. I would like to see a sequel with the same main actors to this movie.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Although the movie didn't follow the book it was still good. I felt the same emotions as when reading the book.
B000002GYI|5.0|This is the first Kraftwerk album I've owned and it is at least still my second favorite. The simple beats and melodies are so appealingly so, I'm never not in the mood for Computer World.
B009NYF2GQ|3.0|i know this is suppose to be a movie classic.after watching it<br />im wondering what all the fanfare was about. Liza was great, but<br />it just a so-so love story<br />having nothing to do with WWII except a couple of scenes with<br />nazi members hanging around.saw it for the first time. dont ever need to see it again
0545265355|5.0|First off, my 12 yo daughter read this before me.  Oops, i don't feel it is fit for her.<br />Aside from that, this series is very well written.  The characters are so well developed you are right there in the story with them.  The descriptions of the arenas, the capitol, the people very well done.<br />High drama, twisted plot, and a warped romance. My favorite part is the ending is not predictable in any of the 3 books.  I don't recommend for early teens.<br />Must read .
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Without a doubt the finest addiction you'll ever cultivate!!! 14 episodes of endearing characters with a great line of stories and then BAM a lifetime of regret that there will never be a season two!!!! Still all the angst that follows will be worth it without a rutting doubt it's worth it!!!
B001XVD21Y|5.0|A top flight movie with great performances, direction, and script.  A superior cast with fine direction from Martin Scorcese.  I loved it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|A must if you enjoy hidden objects games, highly recommended. Not too difficult but also makes you think. Sometimes the dialogue can go on a bit but once through that the games are interesting with very good graphics.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I have to start out by saying that I loved the previous two books in what I hoped was a trilogy and now found out after finishing the book, that it is not! Again Gideon was incredibily handsome and rich and yes good in bed and all of that. Eva, was still the same girl, but changing with all the love and obsession in their relationship... I think my previous sentence says it all. It is some more of the same as previously, with a few twists and turns here and there. In my opinion this story could have been written over two to the maximum three books. It is almost as if the author wants the drag it out and I found myself skipping some pages. I know this review is really harsh, but maybe if my expectation of the third book was not so high, I would have rated it better.<br />Mainly, I would say I was dissapointed and had hoped for more!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, it was a fascinating insight into someone with Aspergers and also compromise and tolerance. Very entertaining
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids &amp; I both absolutely love this game! I am a fan of endless running games but this one is so much more than that. Just play it &amp; see for yourself, but beware, it is ADDICTING, lol. Have fun : )
B00CA3C1N4|2.0|no matter what your strategy is you cant win...<br />I'm deleting from my tablet for something else that will give you a fighting chance at winning - at least one game..
B00932DCS8|4.0|Love how the plot segues from one mistake/disaster to another, keeps you wondering if the hero will make it out alive!
B0051GY0LS|3.0|Very slow at the beginning with a lot of  time spent waiting and waiting. Gets more interesting as the plot works towards a finish.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|We highly recommend this game to couples or for a game night. We had so much fun just solving problems. We all especially enjoyed the rings. What a great interface as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game and fun for all ages. I would recommend this game to anyone. Great quality as well.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|I loved this book. It was exciting & kept me on my toes. I couldn't stop reading it! Very nice
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I just don't read book...I like audio and I can not figure out how to listen to the book with this product.
B0031RS42K|4.0|He is a exallect writer i have enjoyed his books I have read so far and hope to enjoy a few more
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The unit works as described.  I think that some people will be put off by the low resolution, but for me it served the purpose of getting digital files from family slides and negatives.  You do have to spend some time to get the exposure correct, but I guess that just means that the original slides weren't always properly exposed.  Anyway, I was a little disappointed in the resolution, but I guess it's good enough to keep.
B008FRFN7A|3.0|To print any thing you have to open the app and navigate within the app  to print. Printing pictures is easy, within the app it goes to you gallery, you choose a picture and print. Printing from a web page is a pain. Within the app, you have to enter the URL, from there you can only print the whole page. You can set up your email within the app and only print the whole thing.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I FIRST HEARD THIS ALBUM BACK IN 1970. LOVED IT MY FAVORATE SONG ON IT IS I TALK TO THE WIND. EVERY NOTE IN THAT SONG IS SO CLEAN. PETE TOWNSONS OFF THE WHO SAID THIS ALBUM IS A UNCANNY MASTERPIECE, LISTEN TO THIS AND YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I enjoy this series. Started watching the series  on network TV during season 4. Thought it would be good to catch up. Even better without commercials
B007SGM084|5.0|I LOVED these books.  I originally had no desire to read them, but my husband downloaded the series to my Kindle and said he was going to read them.  Then a friend of mine who NEVER reads started reading the first book and couldn't put it down, so I decided to read them and loved them.  It wasn't so much because of the sex, but I loved the storyline.  I highly recommend this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is not the type of story I would usually read. My wife told me about a review she read about this book. So, not having a better idea for a read, I tried it. After a couple chapters I was hooked. It is written in an unusual way, I was not sure at first if I liked it, but as I kept reading I came to enjoy it. And the ending will leave you wanting more! Always a good sign...
B0015AARJI|5.0|This standard issue PS3 controller works great. All the buttons function as they should and are responsive. The sticks are good, they don't have any issues.
B0058YPL66|5.0|liked this show from the first episode hope it goes for a while going to buy season two soon great, when will we see season 3
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the whole season, but I'm a little saddened by the ending.  Hopefully I won't be disappointed by season 4 and all the changes.
B001DF68MA|5.0|My son loves riding on my bike. I wish I got the WeeRide LTD Kangaroo Child Bike Seat sooner.<br /><br />After reading the reviews, I was worried that the seat would not work on my bike. I have suspension forks (Suntour NCX-D LO) so I might not have enough space to turn the wheel. Also the front head tube is pretty wide compared to my wife's bike. When I opened the box, I was pleased to see a bag with extra screws marked for oversized head tubes. I was able to install the mounting bar and seat by myself in about 15 minutes. Everything worked out perfectly.
B00005JPLW|1.0|We just receved the dvd to upon opening the dvd the wrap was melted to the case the dvd has alot of scratches it skips alot. Going to be replaced by a different seller
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Scorsese hits it out of the park. The cast is perfectly chosen. The performances are restrained when need be and manic when required. The use of a narrator and flash backs to New York in the 50's and 60's great device for telling the tale. New York City is as much a character in the film as the cast. See it. Again and again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very fun. Addictive. My 6 year old and myself love to play! We even got my husband on it via Facebook we can visit each others villages.
B00699SDR8|4.0|I loved this book.  It is a thorough introduction to philosophy & presented in an enjoyable narrative that encourages the reader to learn more.  Wish I had read it 60 years ago so am sharing  this book to my teenage friends & grandkids.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I played this game's prequel and annoyed it. I looked forward to this game, but didn't expect it to be as difficult as it is. I'm not complaining, I like a challenge. I just wish that the instructions were a bit more clear.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Honestly , i hate the new layout, its so confusing and i think the weather channel is more about Weather RELATED instead of it reporting the weather like they are supposed to.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it was a repeat if u liked the first u will like this I wish new power ups but it was good
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Not challenging for adults. More suited for kids. I've actually played this game on a pc. Graphics are just as good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending! Good story. Worth a read. I would recommend this book to anyone.  Even if your not a teen.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I cant do multiplayer and what are realms it works fine but it isn't the same again what are realms
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Coming of age story that so many can relate to. Touching, poignant, painful and celebratory of the human adolescent spirit.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game challenges my five year old big time! I love this game because every level challenges him alot more...<br />He loves the break from the normal Angry Birds and loves building things.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|It's everything you want in a TV drama: Richly developed, complex and evolving characters. Intense scenes. Fine actors doing some of the best work of their careers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cutest, coolest game ever!! I usually take turns with my five year old! It likes up with Facebook if you want it to.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|The trilogy can be a bit wordy at times but I really enjoyed the series! I'm so glad I ready the books because so much was left out of the movies it really brings a whole new level of comprehension to the books.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My five year old loves all the Angry Bird collections. I play it every once in a while but he flies thru all the levels. I get stuck often. LOL!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought it to use in my office to record my sessions with clients and also for my son to record his music when performing at different venues.  I will buy another soon so we won't have to share.
B007N85POS|5.0|My five year old loves all the Angry Bird collections. I play it every once in a while but he flies thru all the levels. I get stuck often. LOL!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I LOVE it, it's so fun to play over and over again! :D But I wish they had hair in the back! THAT'S ALL, this game is awesome.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My five year old loves all the Angry Bird collections. I play it every once in a while but he flies thru all the levels. I get stuck often. LOL!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My five year old loves all the Angry Bird collections. I play it every once in a while but he flies thru all the levels. I get stuck often. LOL!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I saw the movie Zero Dark Thirty before reading this book. This book didn't seem to shed any more light on the subject. However the book is well written and describes somewhat briefly other missions some of which made headlines and some of which didn't. I enjoyed the book enough that I will read more by these authors.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this game with my granddaughter. We both Love horses and we feel like we really have our very own horses to play with and take care of. You won't be dissatisfied with this game!
0062255657|3.0|I love Neil Gaiman's mind. This is a great story, but it comes across as just a small part of a bigger world, a world I wanted to know more about. I browsed the acknowledgments, and Gaiman mentions that this novel began as a short story. The brevity is noticeable. I liked the idea of making sense of adulthood through a child's eyes. I like the imaginative aspects. But when I think back about the plot, not enough happens.
0142421715|5.0|I really liked this series. It's not like anything that's out there really. I liked how Cassia becomes stronger and questions how they are forced to live in their society.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was an amusing twist on zombies. I like zombie movies that don't take themselves seriously.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|I love all these Edgar Wright movies. I had been meaning to pick up Hot Fuzz for awhile. I'm huge fan of steelbook cases I think they look great. Love the comic book style they did with it. It was really great too that I got DVD, Blu ray, and and Ultraviolet copy for on $14!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|It's not my favorite.  It didn't stick with me much after I finished it, but I did really enjoy it while I was reading it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was not one of Grisham's best but it was entertaining. The main characters were not very intriguing and the plot lacked suspense.
0786955570|4.0|Played this both by myself and with my friends about fifteen times now. It is quite fun and the models are cool. There are a few broken game mechanics that make it almost too easy, and I wish that the role-played aspect was a little deeper (leveling up, for instance). Otherwise enjoyable.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|It is a really fun and addicting game and funny too because if u don't stay on the track<br />you can fall off and all the passengers get hurt. BUY THIS FREAKING AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!
B00005O3VC|5.0|If you haven't watched this movie, you've been living under a rock for most of your life. British comedy at it's best. Family favorite.
0761166173|5.0|I have read this book out loud to my two year old grandson, who is now four years old, and I still read this book out loud to him  with lots of expressiveness. His two year old brother has become a listener. Each time it comes to the 'chorus,' &#34;ITS PAJAMA TIME,&#34; we are all singing and almost dancing on the spot.  I estimate I've read it to #1 grandson around forty times and to #2 grandson around ten times...with no end in sight.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|This movie gets a lot of flack online and I will admit, the plot holes and contrivances make it less fun to rewatch than Dark Knight. However, it was still a fun movie and I thought Hardy made an excellent Bane.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It's been three days since I finished Me Before You and I still can't stop thinking about it. I keep going back to reread passages that struck me. It's been a while since a book has stuck with me like that. I will definitely be reading more by Ms. Moyes. Though I was a bit conflicted by the ending, I think deep down I knew from the beginning that this was the only way for this story to end. My one complaint is that I felt like I didn't get to know Will as much as I would've liked. Surely that was a byproduct of the story being told mostly from Lou's perspective. But I understand why Ms. Moyes didn't include any passages narrated by Will. Not sure there was any way to do  it without giving away the ending
B001QVFDA4|4.0|I'd heard mixed reviews of this movie, but would up watching it twice by myself and then again with my wife - and I rarely rewatch movies. Very clever and enjoyable, especially if you enjoyed Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I could sit and watch this all afternoon. I love the time period and the clothing and the way of life. Very interesting step back in time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|All my KIndle Touch books moved to my HP Slate 7 Tablet cleanly, with color.  Many Android aps now available through Amazon. This is an indispensable tool for Android users.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I have had trouble with other usb3 hubs, but this one works great!  I like the convenience of not needing an attached power supply.
B008469DGY|4.0|A frustrating but fun golf tee shot simulation. I like the way my motion controls the shot. I really like the 3d &#34;camera&#34; movements. Very gratifying and well worth the price (free).
0785153942|5.0|It took 20 people to create this graphic novel, and it comes off as a complimentary piece to the movie. For those looking for mindless explosions, look elsewhere. For those who love more context to their stories, this is perfect.<br /><br />Naomi Sokolov (who is an exclusive character to this graphic novel) interviews three central characters to the story: Tendo Choi, who was in San Francisco during the events of K-Day (the arrival of the first Kaiju, Trespasser), Dr. Jasper Schoenfeld, one of the creators of the Jaeger Project, and  Stacker Pentecost, Raleigh's CO and heralded Jaeger project. Through the flashbacks revealed in this graphic novel, you see the unseen backstory of the events of K-Day, the personal drama surrounding the creation of Brawler Yukon, the first Jeager to kill a Kaiju, and why the war with the Kaiju is so personal to Stacker Pentecost.<br /><br />The story aspect makes you want to read it again, since the story fits together like a jigsaw puzzle in correlation to the events in the film. The Illustrations add proportionate scope when the Kaiju appear in the story, yet with the subtlety, the meaning, and the mood when it relates to the characters outside of the Jaegers.<br /><br />I read the graphic novel after I saw the sublime Pacific Rim, and this serves as a great companion piece to the movie. I spent $15 for this product, and I am happy to report that it is worth every last dime. If you have not picked up this story yet, I give it a wholehearted recommendation.
B0018STVHQ|5.0|This is a movie I can watch over and over again. It has everything that makes a great movie: well-known actors, interesting characters, good movie plot, family, betrayal, and much more. I definitely recommend this movie to those who love a good drama.
B00007BKVC|5.0|I've loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it many years. I bought it because the older movies are being dropped and I wanted to have it. That way I can watch it whenever I feel like it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is the best game ever you have to try it you can upgrade your shark and you can also buy a baby it is really good buy it and you will have a lot of fun
B002OKGJUO|4.0|I don't watch a lot of silent movies, but this one caught my interest and I gave it a whirl.  That I watched the whole show gets it three stars. The story was interesting and related well despite the lack of voice. I got a little creepy when the rats and coffins made their appearance, and the special effects had to be pretty strong for the time.  The color hue was interesting; at times your typical black and white, and at other times more variations of orange.  I guess that was Kino at work?  At 95 minutes it was a little longer than I anticipated, assuming that pre-talkies tended to run well under today's 2-hour mark... but it kept me engaged for the duration. Good late-night viewing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game&hellip;its fun and has great and realistic graphics! It sure makes me wish I had a real horse.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|This is a book which assuredly gets your attention. While some of the poems were a little graphic, I have to admit the author has a lot of talent. For those who love to read this sort of thing, I really recommend this book.
B00340LM8C|5.0|A true classic that remains great through each repeated viewing.  I never tire of seeing this film even after many years of watching it.
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|I can not use the app on my table and amazon will not support there app by tell me how to install the app;So no more amazon for me and they have been number 1 with me in the past .Good by amazon!!!!!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Not intuitive enough for us old folks. I found it expensive to go very far. Although it was free, it quickly became necessary to purchase items to play the game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. I love that I can customize the look of the cards. I spend a lot of time playing it.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Another time management/building game, but with Nemo as the theme. Not great on small screens like your mobile phone, so I uninstalled it. I suspect that farther in you would have had to purchase items with real money. Boring.
B0082XJGRK|4.0|A historical perspective applicable to young and old alike. Sage words from centuries past.  A \\"thinking\\" person's primer. Highly recommend.
B002NNA9N0|3.0|This is a good story. The dialogs are loaded with profanities which could be entretaining up to a certain point.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|So, when I first downloaded the game it was amazing. Everything was working perfect. However it started to take longer and  longer to get past the minion download page to get to the play screen. Since the update I've only been able to play it once. Not too happy, this was my favorite game on my Kindle. I try everyday and it still has not worked, even after downloading multiple times. Boo! So not happy! Please fix!!!!!
B0068THAGY|3.0|Entertaining. Good quality production, considering the year it came out. Acting was good, just enjoy it, don't ask questions about logic or storylines, etc.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Way better than the other garbage out there today. People who didn't like are probably young 'reality tv' watchers, or better known as useful idiots.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I watched a couple of episodes on TV but since I came into the middle of the series, I didn't get all of the nuances. On Prime, I watched the entire series starting with the first show - very nice! Loved the ending.
B004CURZFC|5.0|We couldn't find this anywhere until Amazon.  Kids and husband totally loved this movie.  They were glued to the story from beginning to end.
1608862801|5.0|very entertaining, a book you could read over and over and not get sick of it! buy this book now!!!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|surprised the kids with this... they love it and watch it over and over and over and over and over again... I practically know the whole movie from listening to it alone since it is a favorite on car trips :)
B005HSL626|4.0|It was a great hit with my grandkids.  Easy to download to my kindle.  Nice bright colors in the graphics.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love this app. its so easy to use and helps me keep up to date with celebrities. I wish we could have more than one account on there though. and I don't know how to log out pf it but overall I love it.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|Reloaded it 4 times and could never get it to work on my kindle.  Wasted too much time trying to get it working.  My grandson was so disappointed that it wouldn't work.
B000W746GK|5.0|My eight year old grandson and I enjoyed every minute of this although he liked the spiders better than I did.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I got this app because my sister had it and it was the best game ive ever played. when I went to getbit on my kindle, it got stuck on the loading screen. I waited 3 hrs, restart my kindle, and reinstalled the app. nothing worked. its a really great app if u can get it to work. it looks like ill be stealing my sisters ipod a lot
B00005LK94|5.0|I saw this when it came out in theaters and got to enjoy it again with my granddaughter. It has lost nothing in the intervening years. Still a heart-warming story. A perfect family picture.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game.I've been playing on Facebook almost since it started.I have three tournament crowns to date.I love that we can play on different devices.Still waiting for Bingo Rush 1and2 for my kindle fire.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|As always, I read the book first in order to understant the plot of the movie.  After viewing the special features disc, I eagerly await the next installment of the movie, The Hobbit:  The Demise of Smaug.  The movie is very faithful to the book, which is a rarity in this day and age.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is an amazing game I let my nephews play and it is so entertaining for them I recommend this app.
B00BNXOMHA|4.0|Had to buy a new TV for this product but it was well worth it.  I read the books several times before purchasing the movies and have always found thisd helpful in understanding the movie plot.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I do look forward to this show when it's airing - most shows I just don't care about, and I'll catch them later on Hulu or whenever. It can be said that HBO is getting formulaic with their shows, but hey - enjoy the good ones and stop watching the bad ones, I guess.<br /><br />The story is intriguing and told in such a way that the intertwining political arcs are intricately enough to keep it interesting without going overboard and getting too annoying to keep up with - this seems like a feat to be celebrated for a TV show with so few episodes per season and what always seems like such a long time to wait between them.<br /><br />(spoiler below)<br /><br />Also, Sean Bean just seems to do medieval characters so well, I just wish he'd make it to the end of one of the films/shows, etc. lol
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Worth reading. Expected it to be more crazy with the S And M stuff. Glad it wasn't. Read on my vacation in Jamaica n couldn't wait to read whenever i got back in from being on the road.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|I put this CPU in a budget build with other mid-priced components, and it doesn't even feel like a budget build *at all.*<br /><br />It runs cool, it's fast and Intel processors have never given me an issue. I've only stopped using them to go from single core to dual, and then dual to quad. They've never actually died on me after years and years of being on 24/7/365.<br /><br />Get this or the current equivalent and spend the extra money you saved vs an 8-core or an i7 on an SSD - and your computer will go from 'I just clicked reboot' to 'holy crap it's up and running 100% already' in 10-12 seconds.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game and I'm glad that I did. It is challenging as it should be. But I don't like how its basically the same as the Temple Runs and Subway Surfer. I love the Despicable Me minions so I think that this game is awesome.
0399159347|1.0|\\"What were you thinking when you wrote this book? I have read everything you have written and never closed one of your books after finishing it with a \\"sorry.\\" I will not recommend this book to my co-workers as I have all your others. An epic \\"fail\\" Lianne----
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is extremely well written and I love how it doesn't have a typical ending. I thought it was a deep book that made me think throughout the entire book. I really liked the ending because it wasn't an in your face type ending. You actually had to think about it after you put the book down which made it so much more enjoyable!!
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Very difficult to put down, even missed my bus stop while reading it. Will definitely get more books from this series.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like this app and use it several times a week. its easy to use... actually I like it better than the Pc version. I like not losing your &quot;place&quot; each time I pin something. the ability to see something larger without pinning is also a great feature. loving the &quot;quick pin&quot; feature of your last three boards that pops up without searching. I am not however very pleased with all the &quot;wait or force close&quot; issues. and the aforementioned &quot;quick pins&quot; has just recently stopped working. all in all a very nice app especially for free.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|This program is crap. Amazon needs quick office or Polaris! Doesn't keep original format of excel or word documents. Boo.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|RepliGo PDF Reader does not require internet access.<br />Internet is need fo the &quot;first time only&quot; (This is to accept the EULA).<br />After this step, RepliGo can be used without internet.<br /><br />I installed RepliGo on my tablet, opened the app and accepted the EULA.<br />The EULA  &quot;pops up&quot; the first time RepliGo is opened.<br />After this, I placed my tablet in &quot;Airplane Mode&quot;.<br />RepliGo worked well everytime that I opened it in Airplane Mode.<br />This indicates to me that internet is not required to use this app.<br />Since RepliGo does not use internet for use, I don't think that I need to worry about data mining.<br /><br />I do not like apps that require a separate purchase for each device (As RepliGo does).<br />While I do not like the EULA, I am not very concerned about the other aspects of this app.<br />Many other reviewers really like RepliGo, and you might also like this app.<br /><br />If you lke RepliGo, be sure to download this to all of your devices today, while it is the FAOTD.<br />Otherwise, you may be unpleasantly surprised by the EULA which limits this to one device per purchase.<br /><br />I hope that this helps clear some issues about this app.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love his game, it is addictive. Just a shame there was not more ways to collect tokens or for your daily allowance to increase as you progress through the game
B00C1S945G|5.0|Have loved this tv show since I was a kid now being able to watch when ever I want is the best
B004SVM7BW|1.0|Skip this app. Permissions and intrusive access make this one of the worst apps out there. Amazon has done it again with a FAOTD that digs deep into your device and can steal your data for zero reason. You also must be online to use so no airplane rides.  Skip, skip, skip, there are many better apps for PDFs out there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent acting, story line, historical and gripping. I have watched all 3 seasons twice and so have my friends! When is season 4!!!!
B004X2M9VY|4.0|This has been a great series to watch.  I have loved getting back into Dr Who. If you are a fan of old you should watch this new Doctors.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very exciting scifi series.Unique start after the invasion of Earth by aliens. Enjoy the actors who were selected for the characters.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|Best Resident evil movie ever.  This is even better than the new movie with it's unexpected twists and turns.  The action seens were awesome and reminds me roughly of RE5 the game.  Recommended to any horror connoisseur.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love season three. The story remains New and fresh but also continues with completion of story lines. Cannot wait for season four. Best period piece ever done!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Our counselor recommended this book.  After discovering each other's love language, it really made us closer.  We now know what's important to each other.  Wow, If every spouse would learn  and understand what's important to their partner, what a wonderful world it would be.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome and cool all thought it takes long To load but it takes long To load because they is so much awesome things
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It is so very convenient having this app on my device because it saves time from having to find a calculator
0380713802|3.0|It is an enjoyable read, but somehow it lacks the focus and depth (Bryson can get into asides with some depth on a topic)of his books like A Walk in the Woods or In a Sunburned Country. He hops around Europe with mostly stories of looking for places to sleep and eat...and drink...with just a few glowing or snarky impressions of the locale and people. Amazon has lots of reviews with good descriptions of the book, but I did want to add that this was copywrited in 1992, and some of his references are starting to be a bit dated. Examples...Margaret Thatcher for a joke, the Euro does not exist, Yogoslavia still exists.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|A good show if you like the typical cop/lawyer type shows.  You will like it if you like shows like The Closer, White Collar, etc.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Very interesting. You really get involved with characters, they are so well written. Definitely a page turner, with a sad abrupt ending.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so awesome love it so much whoohoo sweet cant stop playing so much love it.so much play play play
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Great game for your money.  Will get hooked and won't be able to put down. Nice to have limited hints for when you get stuck.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The pacing at times just seemed unnecessarily slow.  Action scenes were good, like the new &#34;Q&#34;, but not the best of the Craig's three Bond movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun. perfect for not only kids, but adults as well<br />Its a great way to kill time.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Trust me, if you want a great new series, that will give you that &#34;Twilight&#34; and &#34; Hunger  Games&#34; feeling, just read it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series, my mom and I won't miss an episode. Am looking forward to seeing what happens next season. Though I will miss Matthew
B008KP2VZY|4.0|I was looking for an app that can help me keep track of all my cloud drives and this is exactly what I was looking for plus more. I'm very happy with my purchase and this app is well worth the money.
B0076HN3T0|5.0|This has a little of everything, like a FOO Fighters buffet.  Some history, good music, and surprisingly some very personal stuff about these musicians.  Most of the time I don't want to know too much about the bands I like (play something already!) but after watching this documentary I just admire them more.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is fun. i like it when im bored and just want a chill type game. just download it.
B006S01GH2|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you should give it a try.  It has everything including a great story with developed characters and plot, excellent acting, and artistic cinematography.  The scenery is also a bonus.  Fun but NOT a movie for the whole family due to some sexual content.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|My daughter loves this app/ game. She thinks she a real little doctor. Very cute game for kids and parents too!
0762451319|3.0|I picked this up in a local store today since I kept forgetting to preorder it. I definitely enjoy the items, but they could definitely be better.<br /><br />The tattoos are very cute, and a smaller size than the ones sold individually, which was a plus. And the pendant of the necklace appeared well made. As others have said, though, the chain is quite short-likely a 16 inch one. Aside from the length, the links of the chain had really rough edges in several places. My wife couldn't even wear it because it kept scratching her. The magnets are of decent quality, and the images are clear. The book is very thin, which was expected, with stills and lines of dialogue from the movie. Cute, definitely, but not spectacular.<br /><br />For the price-at least this discounted one-the contents are worth it to a fan. But if you aren't that into the series I'd probably give it a pass.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This is a great resource on the topic of factory farming and the amount of suffering that occurs every second in order for people to have their meat and eat it too.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I was looking on the app store and saw a different youtube app so I downloaded it it was  awful!!!!! So I kept looking and I found this youtube app and it is awesome I am glad it was invented!!!! I say get this app get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I have it in my orders, but cannot figure out how to down load it.  Can any one help me out?<br />Thanks
B0091QS88K|5.0|My 6 year old daughter likes this game. She says the game is great and kept her occupied for some time. She wants the full version now.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|It don't work on my device I cannot under stand the app it looks like fun tho<br />Too luck to all
B009AMANBA|5.0|As a retired history professor, I must acknowledge that it is likely that very few college history professors will actually read Doris Kearns Goodwins' book: LINCOLN: A TEAM OF RIVALS.  They should - but I know from experience they will not.  It is not simply a \\"good book,\\" it is a \\"great book.\\" Knowing that few titled professors will read the book, it goes without saying that very few students would.  They should, too.  Nonetheless, this movie, \\"Lincoln,\\" passes the test and I would, if still teaching, provide extra credit to my students who did view the film. We have been told that President Obama did view the film.  It would be wonderful if all of Congress HAD TO view the film, too.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I've seen this one twice now and both times I was stressed out!  Remarkable story with fine acting and film work.
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|Brian De Palma has created such absorbing films as Redacted, The Black Dahlia, Femme Fatale, Mission: Impossible, Carlito's Way, The Bonfire of the Vanities, Casualties of War,  The Untouchables, Wise Guys, Scarface, Blow Out among others and is usually a dependable craftsman of tightly woven movies that explore the mind of crime. So why is this film such a mess? Perhaps it is his re-writing of Natalie Carter and Alain Corneau's fine French film \\"Crime d'amour\\" with Kristin Scott Thomas and Ludivine Sagnier that is at fault or the strange casting of Rachel McAdams and Noomi Repace (both usually fine actresses) in the lead roles, but whatever happened it makes for a very non-De Palma movie - and a thudding predictable bore at that.<br /><br />Ruthless executive Christine (Rachel McAdams) brings on Isabelle (Noomi Repace) as her assistant, and she takes delight in toying with the young woman's innocence. But when the prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s ideas become tempting enough for Christine to pass on as her own, she underestimates Isabelle's ambition and cunning -- and the ground is set for all out war. The use of the now infamous spying cameras and computer manipulations are stale, as is complicating the story with a love triangle with the drunken Dirk (Paul Anderson) and a vying for same sex attraction among the two women and Isabelle's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Dani (Karoline Herfurth). The clues to the silly crimes committed are offered in the first part of the film only to resurrect in the end in a vapid conclusion. Professional women who care about their perception as leaders will be appalled by this flimsy, thoughtless, poorly paced tale of humiliation and revenge and murder. Strange because McAdams and Repace are usually so fine when they have good material. Grady Harp, August 13
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|what can I say - Bruce Willis in action moives - great fun and enjoyed it - how come Tatum is killed off in alot of his movies in the beginning
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Very emotional, good outcome, great photography. It prompt science discussion of a real event and outcome of huge geological issue.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The story line kept my interest from the pilot show - it is hard to find shows to make you think!
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I use this quite often for work. Very easy to use and it works well. I would recommend trying it.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|If you like Pride and Prejuidice or Sense and Sensibility, give this work a read. Austen develops vivid characters and makes you feel the loss and confusion of Anne acutely as the work progresses.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Full of goodness.  Everyone should read this guide to kindness. It's easy to read and very entertaining. You will feel uplifted and inspired.
140006922X|1.0|To accurately assess the validity of this book one must assess the author. He presents himself as a religious scholar with a PhD in religious studies. That is not accurate. He actually has a PhD in creative writing. He also presents himself as a university professor who teaches religion. He actually teaches how to wage revolution in the Mideast.  He was a Christian who became a Muslim.  Muslims do not believe Jesus was the son of God. So his viewpoint is slanted against Jesus already and not objective. His publisher is funded by George Soros, who is a known anti-Semite and hates Christianity. So this book is a misrepresentation of Jesus and pushing a liberal, progressive viewpoint with the ultimate goal of destroying the Christian viewpoint and establishing a socialist/fascist dictatorship in the US
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Finally a scientist that supports what most of us know in ours heart. Validation. It bolsters our confirmation that all is in divine order!
B00846REIS|1.0|The author takes exactly zero time getting into the erotic parts of this story. The lack of time to become attached to or emotionally involved in the characters' lives made the sex scenes seem robotic and boring. She also lacks sufficient knowledge of New York City which killed it for me. I trudged my way through the first $10 'book' and went so far as to tell a friend with the paper copy that I didn't even want to read the second one. It's THAT BAD!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Pretty challenging and a really interesting story. Another great puzzle game for puzzle lovers to add to their collection.  Keep them coming
B00CRJSWBQ|5.0|Update 10/23/13:<br /><br />I took the time and found that Asus has finally released updates for this product.  I installed and things seem much better which means it worked without errors and seemed to detect my high performance DDR3 RAM through XMP where it was not previously.  AS I said earlier, this board has a lot of features and has been perfectly stable at stock.  I can now whole-heartedly recommend this board for those willing to pay a little extra for a fully featured board with decent auto OC capabilities.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />Each version of AISuiteIII seems to have a different bug with the most recent experiencing an access violation upon reboot when you try to run 4-way optimization.  I'm new to the OC world and may try manual settings, but I was hoping ASUS software would take care of the basics until I have time to play a little.  As I have read from others, ASUS tries to blame Windows 8... I've tried a reinstall and get the same result.  Original CD sort of works and the new one has the access violation.  Bios loses XMP settings which defeats the purpose of purchasing the XMP memory they suggest in their compatibility list.  I would be willing to upgrade my rating if ASUS will get serious about fixing their buggy software otherwise don't try to sell features that are not really ready as features.
1426308469|5.0|This book has many pictures of dinosaurs and good information, which should keep children interested, with a smile.Good pictures, good information, sent in good time, all that was as described.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This is a great movie and very thought provoking. We were very impressed with all of the different roles each actor played. This is something I would rewatch just to see what I picked up the second time around. Considering adding the book to our reading list.
B003I55BIA|4.0|was debating wether to give it 3 stars or 4 stars. i gave it 4 because i definitely enjoyed this book but i would have like it better if their was more romance.
B008P9M614|5.0|We are working our way through the series and are up to Season Five. We are as addicted to the series as House is to his Vicaden! I've noticed that since watching the series, I've changed my approach to problem solving. It's not always the &#34;symptoms&#34; that lead to the answer, sometimes it's what isn't there that leads to the answer. Great acting and writing.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I loved the starting action sequence. It was enough to keep me interested even though not much happens after that.  It isn't a masterpiece, but still intrigiuing enough to be worth the watch.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Take a base of Mission Impossible, where Bruce Willis is Tom Cruise.  But mix it with the comedy of True Lies the whole way through.  Then add a Ocean's Eleven type caper feel throughout (especially the end) and I think you'll have some idea of what this movie watches like.<br /><br />I loved it, I liked/loved all the above.  Bruce and Morgan, plus the girl is really very likeable (much more so early on, that didn't develop like I wanted it to) and it's as much likeable star power as any of those other movies as well.  A lot of fun.
B00821OW8K|4.0|I almost gave up on this series. I was about to stop watching but then it really picked up. It still has a lot of so-so episodes that are sometimes almost painful to watch.  Everyone once in awhile the episodes are fantastic.  This series could go either way. With some polishing it could become really good, or it might just peter out. The overall concept, although campy, still has potential.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Loved  everything about this book.tried to read when younger but no patience.now I learn as characters in book,time can cure all.
B005T87QCI|3.0|Solid looking graphics, I like the look for the robots. Game play can get very repetitive at times and I'd like to see some more cut-scene moves added to spice things up a bit because it gets boring seeing the same action animation over and over again. It's not that difficult during the tournaments but remember that each time you beat a tournament, You unlock better robots so remember to switch to better robots at the start of each tournament and you should be fine going through it.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment is the Build A Robot feature. I brought the app specifically for this feature because it would be interesting to build your own bot and battle others, Upgrade as you go. While it came off as free in the description, Turns out you actually have to buy this feature in order to get it. That means paying another dollar for it. Very disappointing because it came off as free in the description.<br /><br />Overall though, Not a bad game. It looks good and the game play is fine, Worth giving a shot for 99 cents.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the ultimate ,most addicting game in Despicable Me history. If you love minions, get this game and your life will be complete.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|WAHLBERG WAS WONDERFUL IN CONTRABAND! IT WAS FILLED WITH ACTION && I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!<br />IT WAS AWESOME!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not to hard.  Great way to unwind at the end of the day.  Enjoy puzzles and mysteries and this gives you a little of both.  Has a tendency to be somewhat addicting at times.
1558908846|4.0|JUDGE DREDD WAS FILLED WITH LOTS OF ACTION BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN MUCH BETTER THAN IT WAS BUT MR. STALLONE IZ STILL A GREAT ACTOR! ONE OF MY FAVORITEZ!
B0092S4WLY|4.0|A great way to unwind at the end of the day.  Can be addicting and hard to put down.  Mystery and puzzle all in one.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Id rather shoot myself in the face. The witches were a joke, acting was horrible, and the effects were something seen from the 80s.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|There is good news regarding this DVD. Although it is from Universal Studios, the open to this film does not include that obnoxious music that usually accompanies (and ruins) most Universal releases. Good news. You can watch this DVD without exposing your brain to damage from listening to that disturbing Universal logo music. Praise the lord.
B004FEJ3VY|5.0|I ordered this for my 6 year old boy. Yes, the transformation is not very simple. But my son is completely happy. He says that this is the best version of Optimus Prime.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have lost count of how many times I have read this book but it seems fresh every time.  Having a copy in my Kindle library is the logical thing to do.
B004FEL6GO|5.0|My son dreamed of Bumblebee. This Bumblebee easy enough to transform for my 6-year-old boy. Both the car and robot mode are look great. He love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|VERY GOOD GAME, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE I KNOW! I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME , ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUSH THE DOWNLOAD BUTTON AND PLAY FOR YOURSELF TO SEE WHAT ALL THE COOL THINGS PEOPLE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. TRUST ME YOU WILL ENJOY EVERY SECOND OF IT!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Marvel did big time with this movie !! all your favorite superheroes in an action packed movie. A must see in HD quality .
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for and it works very well. So yeah I would recommend it. yurp yeah uhh...........
B009WUBERW|3.0|Sylvester Stallone delivers big time with Van Damme but the story is flat and pointless.<br />But if you liked action movies from the 80's and early 90's i'd say go for it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|This app is actually really fun and creative. Its easy to work and a very simple concept. I enjoy using it and making cool beats and sounds.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Absolutely love the conversation towards the end about analog and digital. Loved the music throughout, Wow so much more than what I hoped for.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is awesome. It's exactly what I was looking for and there are so many possibilities in what you would like these notebooks to be. It's your choice and there are a good variety of cute covers, so awesome.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Kids wanted to see it. Streamed perfectly. Enjoy getting these movies for kids. I don't really care for Ray Romano.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I love this drawing pad because I get to distract my younger siblings for about 30 min. to an hour. Plus its better for the planet because there not wasting paper.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|This review is for the Anker Astro Slim3 which I received in order to test, with the stipulation my review would be fair and honest.<br /><br />-The Slim 3 as I measured is 13.3 cm by 7 cm by 1.1 cm. It is light, though I did not take an actual measurement, it is similar in weight to the iPhone 4s. It is textured black on the surface, with rubber around the edges. It is slightly rounded at the corners and the sides.<br /><br />-There is one input, which takes micro-usb, as well as two outputs, one is a permanent micro-usb output that has a wide rubber cord that tucks into the sides and plugs into the input port for storage. The other output is a usb port located on the other side that accepts any normal sized usb cord. Also included in the box I received were a usb to micro usb cord for charging the device or as a second charger output, as well as a micro-usb to 30 pin adapter for charging apple devices.<br /><br />-The Slim3 is easy to use, as the inputs and outputs are easy to find and clearly labeled. Also, the connections are firm, and the permanent micro usb output is conveniently located for charging during use. I found the lightness of the Slim3, coupled with the placement of the ports to be good for charging while in hand, or in the pocket. I used the Slim 3 to charge an iPod touch in my pocket while working, and found it to be quite comfortable. However, charging a device while using it was a little more difficult as the slightly textured surface was good for gripping skin, but not so much for gripping devices, and they tended to slide around.<br /><br />-The Slim3 seems to be quite durable from my tests. I dropped the Slim repeatedly from two meters up, onto a steel bolt, on linoleum and the Slim has little more than slight dents that cannot be seen without looking for them. When it is dropped without the steel bolt directly onto the linoleum, it shows no signs of trauma. The textured surface does wear down from devices sliding against it. Also, the usb output has a small dent in the metal from being twisted while a cable was in it. In other words, the Slim3 can takes some hits, though it is not kryptonian.<br /><br />-Finally, the big stuff. It can be charged in about eight hours. It charges an iPhone 4s three times, and it takes less than five hours for each charge. It can charge two devices at the same time, and at full speed. The Slim never heated up more than ambient temperature as far as I could tell, whether charging other devices or being charged itself.<br /><br />-In conclusion, this is an excellent device, attractive, functional, light,  fairly durable, and it runs very cool. It would be good for people who run down their battery a lot in a day, especially on trips. If you plan on a multi-day trip away from power, or with a lot of devices, I would suggest something with more mAH, but for a single device or for shorter adventures, this works perfectly.<br /><br />*Also, as an aside, the included 30 pin adapter sticks much more firmly in the devices than the micro-usb does in the 30 pin adapter, so it is a little irritating to remove. I would prefer my own 30 pin cord for most i-devices while charging if it is not in my pocket.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's Kik, what can I say it's a good running app and I haven't had any probs so far. So I can guarantee It's not a fake app and it's free.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I would absolutely recommend ordering any parts from  this site!  Every thing I have ordered has been great  for myself or others.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is or was my first app and I'm so not regretting getting it.it was the free app of the day too. But how do you complete level 31? I just can't figure it out.
B0008ENHT4|5.0|Good flick, car chase was forerunner of many stunt effects to follow.<br />Having visited and driven the streets of San Francisco one has a greater<br />appreciation. Less graphic violence than more contemporary films.<br />Gotta love Steve McQueen!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The games fun. It's complicated yet simple, it has great graphics sound. The only problem I have with is how boring it can get after a while. All in all its a good app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it &lt;33333333 whoever loves horse will love this app. GET THIS APP!!!!you get your own horse and you get to groom,muck stalls,and clean paddocks. Go shows and much more!!!!!
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|A little cartoonish for my taste. Always love to see Bruce Willis as he is able to pull off the comedic/action piece.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game.....the game starts off simple but each level seems to add a twist whether it involves math or placing objects in a specific order to move on. Some of it is common sense with a twist but this game keeps you drawn in it is sort of a problem solve/puzzle game.
B005544V6A|5.0|i don't know if all law offices have an eclectic cast  of characters as Pearson Hardmann, but this bunch sure is entertaining.  Watched both seasons in one week.  Addictive.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Nice game - I like the fact that there are a variety of puzzles along with hidden item searches.  I wish there were an option to magnify, as it would certainly aid in targeting as well as locating objects.  Otherwise very enjoyable.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Entertaining movie with lots of action and humor.  Good shoot 'em up for a night in front of the TV.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I loved this game, especially the large variety of sometimes challenging, sometimes easy puzzles.  Many people have complained about having to restart a level if all the puzzles were not finished in time.  That did add a bit of stress, but I never did have to restart a level, so in my case it just added to the challenging aspect of the game.  There are also \\"passes\\" you can win if there are particular puzzles you just can't complete.  Really looking forward to a second installment.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|I don't know whether the other reviewers own Weta statues already but those who do know what an amazing opportunity this is - just an extra $30 to get hold of a weta sculpture - I think that's a bargain. Their work is outstanding and this piece will be a terrific companion to the three Lord of the Rings gift-set statues.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This movie is modern spin on Hansel and Gretel...with a lot of Blade I and II action and special effects.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids love it and it is entertaining and challenging enough for adults.  Appropriate, engaging, well written and designed.  It was a great free purchase.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|The one song very good and very played out in PR everyone loves it so I decided to get it and listen to the rest of the album it's good
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I really like this App, but I hate the fact that I have to connect to Facebook to complete some missions, I understand why they want me to do this, but Gameloft should think that maybe I don't want to. The worst part is that it don't gave you new mission until you connect to Faceboot.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This was a fun game to play. I would recommend it to people. I graphics were really good. If there was a similar game, I would play it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this app is great. got it on my kindle and my phone. best game I have came across in a long time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season lived up to the first two as being a great series. Very nicely done. I loved it once again.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|read it and see what happens :), it drew me in and it took me from one turn to the next, I especially liked the very unexpected ending
B000FC130E|3.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman book and based on reviews of his work maybe I was expecting too much.  This is a solid sci-fi/fantasy book.  Original concept (for the most part)  but not as satisfying as I thought it should be.  The climax of the book left a little to be desired and some of the characters were a little &#34;unfleshed&#34; (in particular the main villain).<br /><br />But it was a solid summer read.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Tom Cruise is in good form and the addition of the new cast of actors adds new energy and personalities.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is a very interesting tale!  The author does a great job of giving tons of back story history regarding air force activities of both Germany and the United States in WW  II.<br /><br />However the main event of the book is rather quick. (although INCREDIBLY riveting and HUMAN!)  So the author then had to fill out the rest of the book with a very protracted denouement.<br /><br />Still worth a read.
B007V4530A|3.0|Just good, many help in improving my presentation skill.<br />Through this book I have a clue to how to deliver my speech in front of audience.
B003HKN51Q|5.0|We were looking for this exact group of songs. This one is juts what we needed and plays the way we liked.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|Just as summer vacation 2013 began, I just knew I need new music for the time off.<br />I visit to Reddit and I saw a post that the new QotSA album was out and reached #1 on the billboards.<br />I've never been a fan, but I knew I had to hear it and was not disappointed.<br />The first four songs are amazing. The songwriting is interesting and the compositions almost sound like sketches of songs.<br />The cover is killer, but the rest of the artwork and video don't jive with me and the music.<br />Overall , a recommended album!
B001DF68MA|5.0|My one year old can now ride with us and we didn't need to buy an expensive trailer.  Easy to install and very sturdy.  No complaints at all.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Purchased this to show my 13 years old son. We watched the original release. I'll someday show him the Redux version.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this app to wake me up for my early golf games and it has not failed me once.  Even shows me the weather and lets me know whether I should get up or not in case it is raining.  Highly recommend.
B0041V1R7O|4.0|I enjoy this release more than debut album. Great songs for a specific mood.<br />Kitchenette is especially good, but I'm surprised at the similarities of Palaces of Montezuma and that other song.<br />Too similar to be coincidence.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thought he could never bring the humanity and compelling story line to a third book, but I was wrong. His characters are beyond literature; they are life.I am so grateful for his talent.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|We should really get to sleep, but keep watching way too late!  Love this show.  The writers are really awesome,
0812973992|5.0|Book arrived in fine condition, much better than I had anticipated & I received it promptly. Am enjoying reading it & filling in the gaps!
B00B935SUY|5.0|Great little documentary. Great for someone who is completely unfamiliar with recording history or how that stuff actually gets created. It leaves you a little heartbroken that the business couldn't continue on, but hooray for Dave for taking the most important part and using it for what its made for!<br />I really enjoyed the album they created with it too. (and i'm not that much of a rock fan)
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|this is a really good movie. the reason i say this is good acting; great plot, excellent special effects. one great indicator of a great movie is that even if you have seen it more than a few times, it still retains its freshness and maintains its entertainment value. time well spent.<br /> plus, you feel that you have witnessed a great event.<br /> it is like breathing the good air that is there for you to enjoy!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book gave me a different perspective of life as a citizen during the Nazi regime. An intimate look into a young girls hard life and how love touched her. I had to keep reading, to see how her life continued; when I was finished, I took days to digest and honor the story.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I will never complain about spending money on this series. Always worth watching. I love the politics and law terminology.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|My granddaughter read the book - actually could not put it down - even to eat..  She said it is definitely a FIVE star book.
B00A83075M|5.0|If you're looking for a fun children's movie, this is a good one. This movie has a lot of entertainment value, and gives a good amount of story time to boys and girls. It starts with the game Fix It Felix, and tells a story about Ralph and his journey to not be a bad guy. He travels to a few different video games including Candy Rush and Hero's Duty, so there is broad spectrum of cutesy and war like scenes, something for everyone. And he is looking to return to his game with a medal for heroism to be accepted by his neighbors and Felix. I imagine the main appeal of this movie for children would be Candy Rush. The entire game is made out of candy sans the players, it has gum ball obstacles, mentos stalactites, coca cola lakes, peppermint trees, and laughing taffy a play on laffy taffy.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|I loved the game, bought it for my kindle fire. After the first day though it wouldn't open any more. It crashes at the title screen.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Finally the end of an epoch storyline.  It seemed a bit muddled with the author trying to tie up all of the many character lines.
1609611543|5.0|last year, I had 5 by passes and need to lose some weight. This book should help me to get healthy and live wheat free.
B00821OX98|4.0|If your not into sci fi it might be an OK show for you as its more of a modern american revolution take but the aliens are too much for non sci fi fans.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is boss totally worth the wait  it is super fun .<br /><br />Only question is what did meana  com from?
B007V4530A|3.0|In summary, it is a neat book, with quite excellent tips; the recaps at the end of each chapter are well-done and I would recommend this book to any high school student, college student, and anybody else, who is suddenly faced with the situation, having to give talks on a  regular basis.<br /><br />What is appalling about this book is, that quite obviously the author tries to capitalize on the great name \\"TED Talk\\". When I started reading this book I first thought that Jeremey Donovan is a big fan of the organization, by the end of the book I doubted that. It rather appears that Mr. Donovan is trying to associate his name with this great organization.<br /><br />This book is missing an index of the TED Talks he quotes. If Jeremy Donovan really wanted the reader to profit from the examples he would have listed those. Even college students have to quote their sources.<br /><br />For instance, early in the book, on page 10 of 107, Donovan writes:<br />\\"Of the ten most viewed TED Talks as of the end of 2011, seven focused on inspiring people to change themselves.\\"<br /><br />That's when for me it began to sink in that this book is not on TED level.<br />How about naming these ten most viewed TED Talks?<br /><br />Beyond that there are the usual demagogic phrases fitting into the category of \\"Reader, please get excited about what I am about to reveal\\". Jeremey Donovan asks the rhetorical question:<br />So, where does that leave the rest of us?<br />How can we make it to the TED stage and inspire the world with our words?<br /><br />Until the very end, Jeremey Donovan never answers these questions.  This book's promises too much.<br /><br />Even though he ends the book on a great sentence, the end is abrupt and considering that there is no index of any sort, this book may not have passed for a college term paper.<br /><br />Gisela Hausmann, blogger & author
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|Brilliant results. A great asset to my craft room. I hope to collect the whole set of the cartridges. A must have.
0143117564|5.0|A very original prose. A great and funny story in a time and place where any present rock and roller wishes to have experienced. Groovy seems an appropriate word to describe this book. Hats off to Pynchon.
140006922X|1.0|Mr. Reza Aslan claims his book to be a new \\"scholarly\\" examination of the \\"historical\\" Jesus. Then let's start by examining the \\"scholarly\\" background of the \\"historical\\" Mr. Aslan. It's a long subject but we'll just review three telling episodes. On 10/6/2010, during a live debate on ABC moderated by Christiane Amanpour and titled \\"Holy War\\", Mr. Aslan likened the reverend Franklin Graham to Osama bin Laden, then he \\"scholarly\\" derided his opponents on the other side of the panel as \\"destined to the trash heap of history.\\" Needless to say the forum had a live audience that went wild with Mr. Aslan's well-crafted demagoguish \\"scholarly\\" lines. Then on 7/29/2013, during a CNN interview with Pierce Morgan (supposedly to discuss the book \\"The Zealot\\", but went on to bash Fox News moderator Lauren Green), Mr. Aslan said among other things that his \\"book was actually not about Chrsitianity but rather about Judaism because Jesus was a Jew.\\" No reaction from Mr. Morgan who apparently has no clue of neither Judiasm nor Christianity.<br /><br />Ok, enough of Mr. Aslan's \\"scholarism\\", you get the point, you make the call.<br /><br />Let's turn to the book itself \\"The Zealot\\" touted as a \\"new examination of the historical Jesus\\". Anybody familiar with the subject knows full well that the notion of examining the historical Jesus dates back at least to 1774 when the essay \\"Apologie...\\" by the German philosopher Hermann Reimarus was published posthumously. Since then the subject has been endlessly dissected by miriads of both real scholars as well as fortune and fame seekers. There is nothing new in Mr. Aslan's book. He merely copied or \\"cited\\" previous works and came to an old conclusion. Mr. Aslan is no plagiarist, after all he cited just about every book writen on the matter. But he is no original thinker either. Is he a fame and fortune seeker? You make the call.<br /><br />So why is such a second rate work generating so much chatter? Here comes Mr. Aslan's real \\"scholarly\\" contribution, namely; his first rate \\"Media Jockerism\\". Mr. Aslan fled revolutioary Iran in 1979 to America. He was a Muslim, converted to Christianity, then re-converted to Islam. He didn't waste his time in America. He studied American media very well, which, combined with a natural street smartness, provided him with exceptional Western media savviness. He learned what are the politically correct lines, the demagoguish lines that draw the bigest applause, and which venues you can safely ridicule to gain fame (Fox News, Rev Graham...). And above all, he developped an unparalleled ability to turn any question he doesn't like into a sarcastic indictment of his interviewer, which, in the presence of live audiences, draws wild applauses and can be quite effective. He indeed elevated \\"Jockerism\\" not only to an art, but to a true discipline that ought to be taught in Journalism Schools allover the world. I won't be surprised if one day a degree in his honor called \\"Media Jockerism\\" will be offered.<br /><br />And if Mr. Aslan is the foremost \\"scholarly\\" authority on religions that he claims, so when is his \\"Critical Examination of the Historic Muhammed\\" is coming? After all, as a Muslim, he should be the foremost authority on his own religion. And by that I mean a REAL CRITICAL INVESTIGATION of the history of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed, in the mold of his book on Jesus \\"The Zealot\\" in which he questions established truths, and not merely echoeing what has already been said. His previous book \\"No God But God\\" doesn't offer any critical thinking of Islam worth of mentioning. I hope the wait won't be too long.<br /><br />Finally, believe it or not, the \\"scholar\\" Mr. Aslan is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and from what I hear, he has a growing audience with most decision makers in America, including the White House. Well, for anyone following the news this shouldn't come as a shocker. If anybody was still wondering why we seem to be getting just about everything wrong about the entire Muslim World, from Afghanistan to Syria to Tunisia, I guess you got your answer. If this is the quality of \\"scholarly\\" advice our White House is listening to, what else do you expect??
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the series, I kinda started backwards, but they will always be funny. Can't wait to buy more of these.
B000L53D4O|1.0|very disappointing...feels and looks very cheap. activity on front is not stimulating or entertaining enough. wish i didn't buy this.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Class, all class - the story, the actors, the conspiracies...  The British system is very different to the USA parliamentary system.  Extremely interesting and very entertaining.
1451620829|3.0|From his first mention of KISS, it's pretty clear that Peter Criss has a score to settle with Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. If there was an opportunity to trash Stanley and Simmons, Criss took it, and that's what makes Pete's story a little tough to swallow. Pete hires an \\"idiot\\" to represent him in the reunion negotiations yet it's Paul and Gene who screwed Criss out of the payday he thought he deserved. Pete blows through all his money and it's the fault of Stanley and Simmons that he's broke. Pete regales us with tales of shooting things, destroying hotel rooms, physical altercations with his wives and girlfriends, drug addiction, screaming at people over tacos, and best of all, his admitted insecurity and mental instability - yet Stanley and Simmons are the ones who are \\"insane.\\" Peter Criss tells us a story about receiving oral sex from Ace Frehley then goes on to allege that Paul Stanley is gay. The best part? Criss then has the nerve to ridicule Paul Stanley because he thinks Paul may be bisexual. Criss admits he did a lot of bad things yet he takes responsibility for none of them. If there was an opportunity to somehow blame Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley for his misfortune, Peter Criss took that opportunity.<br /><br />Reading the reviews before I read this book, I went in thinking I'd come away with a little sympathy for Peter Criss. That was hardly the case.  His tale of woe rings more than a little hollow. Pete has spent all these years thinking his ex-bandmates were his biggest enemies. After reading this book, it's easy to see that Peter's biggest enemy has always been himself. Peter Criss wanted to set the record straight with this book and in the end that's exactly he did. Turns out Paul and Gene were right about Peter Criss all along.<br /><br />If you're a KISS fan like I am, the book is worth reading.  Just don't expect it to be anything more than the hatchet job it is.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Torchwood had all I expect from Brit TV. Give the series a try. You will not be sorry you took the time.
B00CQTKGY8|5.0|All I needed to read to get going. Good hints, tips and camera safety suggestions too. Written clearly and objectively and am so happy to recommend. Now feeling tricked out and ready to GoPro-ing!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a very good book just as the first two were.  I hope there is another book to follow.  I still have some unanswered questions and would like to know how some things will turn out.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|hey, its DUNE what else can you say. this is the single disc 2 version packed in the special tin case. it has the original 2hr 17 minute version and the 2hr 57 minute directors version. get it noe before some idiot decides to do a remake.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is one of my favorite games.  You start out with just a few tiles, and then work your way until you get a lot of tiles to match.
B000ZM1MGE|5.0|very good movie. made back when Hollywood was still putting out entertainment and not the CGI junk they have today.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this is probably the best King book i've read since The Stand. It was so different from his usual books. I fell in love with the characters and cried at the end. Things don't always turn out the way we want, but things do happen for a reason. it really makes you think about life and why things turn out the way they do...It was one of those books i just didn't want to end.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Good read. I think the author was still not convinced on what he had experienced. He spent to much time in trying to convince us that what he had experienced was real that he missed the boat. He also missed it by constantly trying to convince us he was not a quack because of his credentials. This made him come across as if he was above everyone else that had the same experience, because he was such a well educated physician. I understand why he felt that it was so important for us to know his background, but after so many references it came across as arrogance. He would have done a better job if he had concentrated more on telling his journey then using so much of the book on his earthly credentials.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I am a huge fan of the series, but the third season was a bit exhausting. I won't go into the untimely deaths. They're part of the dilemma of having a series go on and on. but the episode in Scotland was over the top. I understand the need to introduce new characters and to 'explain' Rose, but Edith's new love appearing...too contrived. And enough with the country fairs. We get the point. In spite of this critique,I look forward to 4.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|Free should be free. Not free then you need to subscribe for a fee. Don`t buy . I think I'll let the free trial run out and then delete it.

B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Engages my son's attention and fosters his imagination in a way that is less violent than current video games and TV sitcoms.
1400069289|5.0|With stories, and good science this book covers how we develop habits, and how we can change them. This book is not for you if you are looking for a quick fix or a silver bullet to break bad habits. If what you're looking for is a book which covers habits work at a behavioral and neurological level, and how to approach understanding them and changing them, this book is what you are looking for.
B0000025JT|5.0|Wow--love this CD!  When Streisand and Gibb blend their beautiful and distinct voices together, the result is pure heaven to my ears.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Great movie... the best sci-fi movie ive seen in a long time great twist to wrap everything up..would recommend to anyone who like sci-fi
B002UZXJA6|5.0|This is the second &#34;Songs from the Heart&#34; CD I bought from Amazon.  I carried the first one with me everywhere because I loved to listen to it so much, and I lost it.  This is a keeper!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|The physical appearance of the usb hub is slightly bulkier than I would've liked but It works perfectly so I will give it 5 stars. One thing worth mentioning is that if the usb ports on your computer are directly side by side to form a line and are relatively close to each other (as they are on my 2009 macbook pro), they you may not be able to fit a flash drive or something with a larger body into the usb port next to where this hub is occupying. The plastic around the usb to computer on this hub is 3/4&#34; so keep that in mind.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this product.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Suspenseful, lots of action and funny too! A great combination. Helen Mirren does a great job as do they all. I would definitely recommend it to anyone close to retirement and everyone else too.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my two sisters. I found it a most absorbing and satisfying read. The descriptions of the English countryside made me feel quite homesick as I now live in Australia.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|I read this book with my son, then watched the movie. I hated all the changes they made. It was so much scarier than in the book, and very dark. I recommend the book to people, but DO NOT recommend the movie.
B0063IH60K|3.0|VERY annoying ads after each hand. I'd rather pay for the game and get rid of the ads. Please offer a paid version.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love this game but after this update I was unable to play it would not load and I had to remove it and restart now all my friends list is gone and . Not coming back . Up but besides that I love this game very addicting my kids . Love helping me . Play it

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think.this is awesome game, wish there were more levels and it d ooh dint take so much to switch characters
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Not just good, but great. I don't think I need to write a review here as I am sure most people have seen this film. I just re-watched it on Amazon Instant because I had a hankering for a good mob movie, especially after James Gandolfini's death. Never disappoints.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|A great product for documentation.  I use it with dropbox to store all my important receipts for items with warranties.  SInce you can scan multiple images and store them in one file, it's perfect for expense reports too.  you are only a click or two away from emailing them to yourself as well.
B000W745CU|5.0|Watched my very first Harry Potter movie the other day. Was unable to finish watching it so I ordered the dvd. Then I was hooked and had to order the next dv and then the next dvd. Love Harry Potter.

B005LAIIFS|5.0|We took our granddaughters to see this movie at the Theater. We all loved it, The girls are 5 and 6 and the movie kept their attention. So when it came out on DVD. We ordered it for them.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is by far, one of the best WWII books I've read.  I rarely give a review on any Amazon purchase due to their ~must~ use at least 20 word minium rule.
B008220D7S|5.0|We ordered this dvd. It is so funny...And so true. We haughed through out the whole dvd. Its great for a light comedy
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Before buying this controller, I read a lot of reviews about dead zones being an issue. I have experienced no such issue with dead zones at all. The controls are crisp and clean, and everything is properly responsive. The dead zone was as expected to be.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />You can't turn on the PS3 with the controller. I don't see this worthy of losing a star.<br />The grip can get a bit uncomfortable with long periods of use. I haven't had this problem, but my friends sometimes complain about it.
B001706I5I|5.0|My granddaughters wanted the How the Grinch Stole Christmas dvd. So I ordered it for them. they love this movie.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Met my requirements and much more. Very good processor for the price. Loved AMD for the longest and was always against Intel. I have heard so much from friends about intel plus I work with them at work so I thought I would take the challenge and switch.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It was really fun and I loved it. Until it updated and wouldn't work. I'm about to delete this app if it doesn't work within a week.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|This CDis one of my favorites,  just a feel good sound.  Sunroof open windows down and the volume up!  Buy it.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app I've always wanted a horse and now I can have one, well sort of have one.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This cooler has dropped my temperatures by at least 10 degrees Celsius. The only problems I personally have with it is that it's right up against my top 120mm fans on my case and that's it's just a few millimeters away from my RAM, but it's not causing any harm at all.<br />Anyone who purchases this should keep in mind that their case has to be big enough to hold this cooler since it is fair large. I have the Cooler Master Elite 430 and it fits in there just enough so that it's not in the way of any other components. People with larger cases shouldn't face that issue. Other than that, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap, efficient cooler!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Finally the book that started it all. Jo Nesbø is an excellent writer you love his characters flaws and all. He also tells a great story.

B008JFUNYG|4.0|It had to happen eventually. A remake of the beloved cult-classic \\"Evil Dead\\" has always been around the corner and on the tips of everyone's tongue. Almost as if Hollywood reached into the dark, dank recesses of its basement and uncovered its own Necronomicon, the \\"Evil Dead\\" remake has always been lying in wait, dormant and ready to surface at any given moment. Just as nearly every iconic '70s and '80s splatter flick got madeover during the mid-'00s remake boom, we all knew this one was going to be let out of the basement, for better or for worse. Thankfully, it's (mostly) for the better.<br /><br />Whereas remakes of \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\" and \\"Halloween\\" have suffered being interpreted by folks who had nothing to do with the source material, this updated \\"Evil Dead\\" benefits from having the involvement of original director/writer Sam Raimi, producer Robert Tapert and, of course, the indispensable and iconic Bruce Campbell, who parlayed the original's success into a long and (mostly) fulfilling b-film career. Director Fede Alvarez makes his feature-film debut, working with a fresh-faced young cast that includes \\"Suburgatory\\" star Jane Levy as the film's inevitable \\"Scream Queen,\\" cast in sharp juxtaposition to Campbell's hapless and hopeless hero in Raimi's original. There's a genuine care and craft that went into this film and it shows in both its simple yet engaging plot, it's buffet of bloody goodness and its unassuming yet unrelenting style. If any recent remake deserves to hang its coat next to its original, it is certainly this one.<br /><br />While the basic premise of the film remains pretty much true to the original, there are a few creative liberties that were taken that actually work in the film's favor. Rather than being a care-free group of college friends looking for a good time, the crew that populates this cabin in the woods are doing so in an effort to help their friend (Levy) kick a nasty drug-habit. A musty and unpleasant odor leads to an investigation into the basement where the Necronomicon lays wrapped in a trash bag and barbed-wire, proving too tempting for one of the guests to refuse. Faster than you can say \\"We'll swallow your soul!\\" the Book of the Dead turns a would-be detox into an all-out bloodbath. Achieved with mostly practical effects, this \\"Evil Dead\\" is a symphony of dismemberment and decay, true to the spirit of Raimi's original. Hardcore horror fans will appreciate, if nothing else, the film's giddiness in regards to its goriness. Just when you think the film has gone too far, it goes even further.<br /><br />While the film delivers all of the goods one would expect from a true splatter flick, it comes up a bit empty on the character front. While the original didn't so much to expand its characters, it also didn't ask us to invest in their personal problems like this version does. Aside from a few lines sputtered here and there about, there is very little in the way of character development. In its brief 80 +/- minute span, one can't help but feel that the film could have taken a little more time out of the schedule to flesh out the demon fodder a bit. This little nitpick aside, the film is still entertaining from front to back and pays more than its fair share of fan service (stay tuned beyond the credits for a groovy cameo). Even as a stand-alone film, it delivers the goods meaning that those who enjoyed the original \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy in their youth can enjoy just as much as the teens who are only just now discovering the genre. As far as modern remakes, you could do much, much worse.investigation into the basement where the Necronomicon lays wrapped in a trash bag and barbed-wire, proving too tempting for one of the guests to refuse.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As a child, the world can be filled with wonders and terrors in equal measure. When an adult recalls their childhood there's a haze over the recollections, a thick mist where only specific memories can be discerned but not with perfect clarity. The memory of a man as a boy serves as a starting point for Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane to explore the fears and wonders a child encounters.<br />Gaiman has used magical realism before to great effect in American Gods. With his latest novel, Gaiman explores the seeming reality of childhood by incorporating magical elements in an otherwise mundane, bucolic world. By setting the novel in a first-person narrative and as a memory, Gaiman is able to use the often-unreliable nature of memory to introduce those fantastical elements. The unnamed narrator returns to the area he grew up in and begins recalling a series of events involving a girl named Lettie Hempstock.<br /><br />To read and/or hear the rest of this review please visit my blog, The King's Crier: Book Reviews.

B000JMKRKC|3.0|&#34;Tell me the truth&#34;, repeatedly throughout The Thirteenth Tale the reader is confronted with this phrase. The truth builds gradually to reveal an odd tale that may leave the reader applauding for more from this debut novel. With such an intriguing plot and elements that pay homage to the cornerstones of the Gothic Literature era and an out of the ordinary weaving of: drama, mystery, long concealed family secrets and sins- abandon the notion of an obvious predictable read where all mysteries can be solved within the first three chapters. In The Thirteenth Tale, dark secrets and intertwined puzzles stay buried deep within the pages and slowly reveal themselves to the patient reader.<br /><br />In the end, I was immediately drawn by the magnetic description and poetic prose of Ms. Setterfield. Sadly at the same time, these descriptions and prose required the reader to sit patiently and wait for rambling discussions, passages and thoughts to end and move further into the story. As the tale untangled itself and created additional obscurity and drama, the abrupt interruptions between tiresome narration and shared stories caused slight annoyance for this reviewer. Although in a way I can understand their purpose to create suspense it just confirms my overall impression- a lot of patience is required from the reader. Still an engaging read and a noteworthy debut that should be praised, The Thirteenth Tale is a well polished novel that left this reviewer with feelings of completion and anticipation for Ms. Setterfield's next novel (Bellman & Black).<br /><br />reviewed in August 2013, review written August 2013/copy of THE THIRTEENTH TALE borrowed from local library

1451695195|5.0|Great story. I love the fact that a man of science can come out in public and give this kind of testimony.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I will NOT include any spoilers at all in this review, you can be sure of that.<br /><br />What most people have been claiming about this movie is that it has many elements of innumerable other sci-fi movies. It's true, it has from small bits to colossal similarities in plot, filming, conclusion, and development from other titles. But it's not necessarily a copy, but a brilliant adaptation of what others have created.<br /><br />People who have enjoyed titles like \\"Alien\\", \\"Matrix\\", \\"Red Planet\\", \\"Avatar\\", \\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"Star Wars\\", \\"I, Robot\\" and \\"A.I.\\" will surely enjoy this masterpiece.<br /><br />When I first read about this movie and noted that Tom Cruse starred, I thought (like many others might) that Tom Cruise is anything but Sci-Fi material. His role in movies like Top Gun, MI (saga), Jack Reacher, and many other, wouldn't really make him suitable for this kind of film, but then again... Remember his appearance in Vanilla Sky, quite a great movie, and with similar elements to Oblivion.<br /><br />All I can say about this movie is that it's suitable for anyone that loves Sci-Fi and Thrillers. I sustain my opinion of it as one of the greatest Sci-Fi titles since Matrix. And like Matrix, it is one movie that must be first-seen with as few (or none at all) spoilers at all.<br /><br />As with rating, I'd say it is suitable for anyone down to 8 years old, there are some scenes that might qualify as violent, but they are minimal, since sound (explosions, alien sounds, machinery, etc.) is what enhances the violent scenes that might not be suitable for minors.<br /><br />This is a must watch for all Sci-Fi fans.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Entertaining and insightful trip into the psyche of a present day male hot into his career at the expense of love & real friendship.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the game but the first one is better then the secound I would recommend it for my friends and family.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|Somewhere to escape reality for a while, where there's magic all around you.<br />Plenty of imagination went into creating this lovely story.<br /><br />Imagine riding a dragon,Soaring high into the sky skimming the clouds, then riding on the back of a giant turtle., there is also a two legged fish who loves nothing better than sunbathing.<br />Meeting up with elves, fairies, and creatures of the forest, ghosts, dwellers, and going to 'n' from the spirit world.<br /><br />When you think it's all over, nothing more can happen.....you realize its not over.<br /><br />Sometimes what looks beautiful on the outside is actually evil and cunning and cannot be trusted.<br /><br />But sometimes you do meet someone trustworthy and special from the opposite sex. Even though you want to see each other every day you know this could never be.<br /><br />The poems that are at the end of this magnificent fairy tale are most wonderful.<br /><br />Thanks William for letting me to read this and I would recommend this book to all
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|clean up all the glitches. other than that it is a fun game.<br />I play it on my I phone.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love how it shows how he deals with everything and all the drama that August and Via go through. It's just like real life. Plus it seems like it's written like a kid.  There's so many different characters in the book and u get to read from each person's perspective.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think the game is fantastic, unless you don't like mlp. in that case, why did you even click this?
B00CX7TOOG|1.0|Horrible accents, horrible acting and a horrible plot. The entire movie seems like they are rushing just to get it over with. I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me.
B0068THAGY|4.0|This was a good movie. Story line was good. Just a little \\"not impressed\\" with the alien/ monster character. The movie made it very dramatic and the alien/monster was hidden til near the end, and when they presented it, it ended up less than what I expected... But overall for storyline and effects 4🌟's.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I loved this movie !!! good action, good acting and great sound and special effects. Why do I need to put more words? sometimes one word is enough
B004SIMNF0|5.0|I am strictly an amateur who takes a lot of event photos (anniversaries, graduations, birthdays, and a lot of swimming events as my two god-children swim competitively).  I use a Nikon D3s, Nikkor 50mm 1:1.4, Nikkor 70-200mm 1:2.8, and a 1.7 Teleconverter.  I have some pretty bad neck problems, and the standard Nikon strap that came with the camera body was terrible.<br /><br />After researching shoulder straps from 4 different manufacturers, I was uncomfortable ordering any of them as user reviews for each included at least of couple of disastrous outcomes in the form of failure of the tripod socket connection of the strap and sudden dropping of the camera thus leading to either thousands of dollars in repairs or a total loss of equipment.  One of those stories came from a professional photographer in Dallas who was kind enough to correspond with me, and I am very glad that he did.  He was the one who recommended the Spider Pro device.<br /><br />The Spider Pro belt holster mechanism has been a delight to use and has delivered in every way promised.  The adjustable belt fits snugly below the belt for my shorts or jeans, and the 3-way front clip mechanism works perfectly and feels very secure.  The base plate that fits on the bottom of the camera is solid metal and the interface is tight and feels very secure.  The holster mechanism took a little practice to use; but now, even when lugging 10 lbs of equipment at my waist, I can safe grab the camera, raise it and begin shooting very quickly.  The fact that I can lock the camera in the holster is an added plus; but admittedly, the weight of the whole thing seems to make it unlikely that it will slip out of the holster.  The ability to place the camera back in the holster, be hands-free, and take all tension off of my neck is a blessing and, for me, the best part of this device.<br /><br />I have no connection or financial relationship with the manufacturer.  I strongly recommend this device for anyone who carries around a heavy DSLR camera.<br /><br />  GF

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read a lot of books in the apocalyptic genre on my kindle and enjoy the exclusivity of many authors through amazon.  The Wool collection focuses on a very unique development in post-apocalyptic America.  Well-written an appropriate level of detail to provide readers enough imagery to understand this world so very different from our own.
