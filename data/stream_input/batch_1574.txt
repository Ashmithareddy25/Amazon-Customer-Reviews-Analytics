B002RI8ZPK|4.0|This book is an electronic collection of three books which I decided to read as research for my own writing (see my book The Changeling Detective).<br /><br />Reading three books written in the same style in a row got a bit tiring by about the middle of the third book, but I kept reading and I'm glad I did because there's a lot to like here.<br /><br />I especially liked the turns of phrase used in the descriptions, which despite these books being written over fifty years ago are still evocative, well at least they are to this reader. Unlike the descriptions, I found the dialogue a little hard to follow because it contained terms I didn't know and the point of view character, the Private Investigator Philip Marlowe, seems to be continually trying to keep the people he is talking to off balance by making provocative statements to see how they react. This technique works, but even though the story is told in first person from Marlowe's point of view the reader is not privy to the workings of his logic.<br /><br />Of the three books here: 'The Big Sleep', 'The Long Goodbye' and 'Farewell my Lovely', I liked the first and the last the best. The first, because it was my first exposure to Chandler's writing, the last, because it just kept on giving in the mystery department as layer after layer of the plot were peeled away by Marlowe's continuous digging because things just didn't seem to add up.<br /><br />I recommend this collection as canon for any one who loves detective stories and as a good learning experience on how to write good descriptive prose to any writers out there.
0307352145|4.0|i can relate to both sides of the brain which are introvert and extrovert and during the course of the day they both can't pick a side. this book truly explores the mental regions and finds so many ways to answer and ask questions of how it all works to relate in a Introverted manner and yet see a extroverted world.  i guess i could say  Texting is the right answer, because voices are quiet while alot of talking is going on, and this book ping pongs  back and forth with timing, places and settings at using both approaches  and how they work for one. alot of good strong information and a better understanding and depth of the subject. i  had to read this book in places a  few times and digest it and it truly works out really well.<br /><br />the Author did a really good here.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Honestly, I really wanted to like this book. I have never jumped on a book bandwagon before buying this book and I almost instantaneously regretted it. The dialogue is awful. The whole 'Mr. Grey/Miss Steele (smirk)' banter between the two main characters made me nauseous. The sex scenes were good, but repetitive. And if I never read the words 'inner goddess' again, it will be too soon. Total trash.
B00846REIS|3.0|I've read all 3 of the \\"50 Shades\\" books and was looking for the next step up.  I had read several reviews stating that this was a \\"must read\\" for those that enjoyed the \\"50 Shades\\" series and that it was more well written.  I was a bit disappointed at the lack of actual plot and repetitive sex scenes ( I mean really how many times does Eva receive oral or talk about his erection?? 100??). Complete lack of creativity or experimentation.  There was no real lead up, simply sex scene after sex scene with bits of story line between.  Not to mention the fact that I read the entire book in a day, waiting for the story to go somewhere, but it never did....I must say I was disappointed.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />First off, Jeremy Renner's physical prowess is mesmerizing!  His action shots in the movie are simply breathtaking. His character Aaron Cross is also more interesting than Jason Bourne, in that Aaron had intelligence issues prior to being introduced into the program - Outcome.  He also appears to have had a brain injury - so he is no wunderkind to begin with.<br /><br />The movie is slow and they spend a lot of time unnecessarily showing Aaron roaming around in Alaska - we get it - within 2 minutes we understand what he's doing.  No need to drag it out for 40 minutes.<br /><br />Edward Norton doesn't seem like the right fit - he's simply not commanding enough in his role.<br /><br />Rachel Weisz - I love her but I wish she would stop using a fake American accent - it's too distracting when her emphasis is wrong.  She often sounds like a Brit doing a bad mocking impression of a US accent.  I was also surprised at how she fumbled around with some of the medical paraphernalia while looking very unsure of herself.  Strange for an actress at her level.  She should have paid a few visits to a hospital prior to filming to see how it's really done.  It looked like she had never touched medical equipment before.<br /><br />What is nice is that there is tenderness between her character Marta and Aaron Cross that develops during the course of the movie - much more refreshing than all out awkward love scenes could possibly be.<br /><br />The whole movie is basically a setup for the next two movies when the fun will really begin.  This is a filler movie.  The weakest of the four so far, but still very entertaining and very much worth watching.

B008FOB124|5.0|Dead Can Dance always produced music that was timeless. It therefore strikes as an evidence that they should come back after a 16 years hiatus. Time has mended their differences, and they now appear as a mature musical couple only too happy to forget the bad memories to show that they have much pleasure creating beautiful music together.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Children Of The Sun\\", sung by Brendan Perry, introduces the general feel of the album. It is deliciously atmospheric. It is Dead Can Dance as a well-aged wine. Less extravagant than in the past but every bit as elaborate, it delivers a very satisfying feeling of plenitude. The tone of the album is given. Follows the slow and very easy to like \\"Anabasis\\" sung by Lisa Gerrard, and \\"Anastasis\\" slowly unfolds. It is no longer groundbreaking as their first albums were, more a voyage where they take us by the hand for a luxuriant visit into their sophisticated world.<br /><br />Never production on a Dead Can Dance opus sounded so polished. Not a moment feels cheap or unchallenging to the ear. Both singers have exceptional voices that suit their style perfectly, and they are at their best here. Lisa Gerrard leads four songs (including one, the opulent \\"The Return Of The She-King\\" where her partner joins in at the end), as does Brendan Perry. Eight songs may seem on paper like too simple an effort after 16 years, but all songs are in the five to seven minutes range, and most importantly, there is a sense of unity, an \\"album feel\\", that is very powerful in this release. Where the old albums were always original, individual songs didn't always flow as strongly into a sense of unity proper to a definite album. There was sometimes a feeling that each song had its determined personality, and contrast between each song was looked after as much as album cohesion. With \\"Anastasis\\", there is a more definite sense of musical entity, and while ethnic flavors are very present (Middle Eastern in \\"Agape\\" or Irish in \\"The Return Of The She-King\\"), it all blends majestically together into a consistent and coherent mood - and a sumptuous album.<br /><br />Repeat auditions of Dead Can Dance's long-awaited reunion album have only managed to reinforce my spontaneous conviction that indeed it was worth waiting sixteen years.turn Of The She-King\\"), it all blends majestically together into a consistent and coherent mood - and a sumptuous album.<br /><br />Repeat auditions of Dead Can Dance's long-awaited reunion album have only managed to reinforce my spontaneous conviction that indeed it was worth waiting sixteen years.

B001QWBM62|5.0|Getting right to the point, the Zoom H4N is an incredible device. I have been looking for a way to get great sound for web video and this is it! I rented it a few times before I made the purchase to be sure it did what I wanted it to. Each project I do with this device, I'm more impressed with the quality. I recently filmed an interview outdoors (with my Zoom and a lapel mic) when it started to rain... we found shelter under a tree and completed the interview but I was so worried the sound would be terrible-- it was really coming down! When I uploaded the audio, I was so impressed, the voiceover was perfect and the rain was barely audible in the background. Without it, I would have had to redo the entire interview. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|An endlessly fascinating and quite absorbing collection of music from a odd time in American Rock history. It's almost like teens and twentysomethings across America reinterpreted what teens and twentysomethings across the Atlantic had reinterpreted from Stateside rhythmn and blues of the 30's and 40's and rock and roll from the '50s. It is criminal that many of the songs contained herein did not become Trans-Atlantic smashes. Booley in box is also first-rate and a compelling read.

B001TH16DI|4.0|I will keep this short.<br /><br />I was a little leery of buying this set after reading all the 1-2 star reviews.  The price was right though so I took a chance.<br /><br />It turns out that the quality is excellent.  Yes, these are the theatrical versions. If you are looking for some of the extra stuff not in the theatrical release (as many Star Trek Fans may be) then don't buy this set.  Spend more money.  For me though, the cuts that they made for the theatrical release do not stop me from enjoying these movies as I also enjoyed them in the theater.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  It's not quality related since the quality is good.  The 4 stars is only recognizing that some people may be looking for the directors cut.  If I was just rating this for myself I would give it 5 stars.

Having read it, I would like to know WHY???  I was very disappointed in this book.  First of all, the language is extremely crude and vulgar.  I'm not a prude, but there was just too much foul language.  Second, I don't need to fall in love with the main characters in a story, but I at least like to sympathize with them or relate to them.  By the end of the book, I didn't care what happened to either main character, and I was repulsed by their actions.  I think I'd rather be friends with Hannibal Lecter than Amy and Nick.  If you choose to read this book, don't say I didn't warn you!

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Rachel Joyce's The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a story of a man who breaks from the monotony of his daily life to walk across England to see a friend dying of cancer.  Despite the rather macabre premise, I thought it would be a largely whimsical story because of the absurdity of Harold's decision: a non-athletic man traveling 600 miles on foot out of the blue.  Joyce's novel  turns out to be much more than a profile of an eccentric man who decides to walk because \\"it's a nice day.\\"  The novel develops into a moving story of friendship, love, loss, and ultimately forgiveness.<br /><br />As Harold winds his way through England's hills and flat country, from Devon to Berwick-upon-Tweed, the novel slowly reveals why this man in his golden years feels compelled to walk 600 miles from his wife of 45 years, Maureen, toward another woman from his past, Queenie Hennessey, a woman for whom he claims to have never felt any romantic interest.  Harold is only sixty-five years old, hardly old by today's standards, but he feels like an old man in many ways.  Finally facing a lifetime of regrets, Harold believes he is doing something bigger than himself; some would call his conviction faith, others would call it foolishness.  His journey produces a fascinating tale either way.<br /><br />I love Joyce's descriptive writing, detailing the scenery of the English countryside and its quaint towns and inhabitants, describing what Harold learns from each person he meets.  This is a novel about \\"big ideas\\" (if you're reading it on a Kindle, the lessons will jump out at you if you have the \\"popular highlight\\" feature turned on).  These are lessons that will appeal to a broad audience, an appeal that will likely withstand the test of time, but the incorporation of so many explicit lessons felt a bit heavy-handed at times, like I was being lectured to at a high school graduation about what's important in life. A gentle, well-written lecture, but a lecture nonetheless.  It does, however, make this book a perfect choice for a book club discussion; there's a lot of meat here, if you want to talk about it.er, make this book a perfect choice for a book club discussion; there's a lot of meat here, if you want to talk about it.

1401235417|5.0|Great book! Just wanted to let everyone know that there are some pages about 2/3 of the way through the story that are supposed to be printed upside-down. I sent my copy back because of these pages, thinking it was a misprint, then got the replacement copy, and the same pages were upside down! I did a little internet research at that point, and I realized that those pages were, in fact, supposed to be upside down. It's at a part of the story where Batman is kind of going a little bit crazy, and his perception is all messed up, so the pages go horizontal (which I understood), and then upside-down, so you kind of end up turning the book 90 degrees clockwise as you are reading, then 90 degrees clockwise again, then back to normal! It at first appears to be a printing error, but then I realized it was an intentional artistic decision....too bad I wasted the time and Amazon had to waste the postage sending my copy back and shipping me a replacement! Here's a source where I verified the printing: [...]    Anyways - good story, good art, clever little gimmick with the upside-down pages....nobody better give me a copy of House of Leaves!!
0446582778|5.0|I was just reading the section in the Noe Yawk Times Book Review, where they ask some author or celebrity what their favorite book is, and that got me to thinking, What is my favorite book?<br /><br />That's a difficult question to answer, but then I remembered that there are several books that I've read many times. Repeated readings must be an indication of how much I enjoy a book, and if nothing else, it demonstrates that the book is worth reading more than once.  In my teens, I read Robert van Gulik's [[ASIN:0226848655 Judge Dee mysteries]] over and over. Other favorites that I never tire of are [[ASIN:0140192468 The Sleepwalkers]] by Arthur Koestler, any history by Barbara Tuchman or William Manchester, [[ASIN:0877973008 Honey in the Horn]] by H. L. Davis. At parties in my youth, I often read aloud from the bizarre [[ASIN:0936756888 This Is Your Final Warning!]] by Thom Metzger.<br /><br />But it so happens that the one book I've read and reread more than any other is Angels Flight. I admire all of Michael Connelly's novels, but in this one he goes beyond the classic hard-boiled-detective, whodunit genre. It's really a work of literature.<br /><br />I once saw Michael Connelly at a book signing, and when he autographed this book for me, he told me that he wrote it backwards -- that is, he wrote the ending, and then wrote the chapters in reverse order. That seemed strange to me, because the ending is the weakest part of the book. Like most of his novels, Angels Flight goes on for too long, and the last third of the novel is just another of his sordid tales of an evil old man who molests children. (Chapters 39- 40 are pure bathos.) But the beginning of the book is closer to Dostoyevsky than the typical crime thriller.<br /><br />What makes this novel so great is what it lacks. Connelly has abandoned the standard devices of most authors.<br /><br />Second-rate novelists often rely on the threadbare device of the simile. I imagine that in creative writing classes they teach nascent authors to use as many similes as possible. (A simile is a metaphor with \\"like\\" or \\"as\\" in the sentence, and ironically one of Connelly's favorite authors, Raymond Chandler, wrote one of the most famous and egregious similes in fiction: \\"He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.\\")  I am often dismayed that an author I otherwise admire will stoop to using such a hackneyed contrivance, but in general, the worse the author, the more rancid the simile. Connelly has dispensed with such artifice entirely.<br /><br />There is no \\"blind lead,\\" where the book starts out with a vague and shadowy description of something unnamed, and you will learn the details of how it fits into the plot later. There is very little description in any of Connelly's novels, and if you really want to know what the scene looks like, you can purchase [[ASIN:B000F8E92M Blue Neon Night - Michael Connelly's Los Angeles,]] a DVD of Los Angeles landmarks that are often mentioned in the novels. The same footage is available at various places on line.<br /><br />James A. Michener famously said that he deliberately made the opening chapters of his novels difficult so as to \\"Weed out the ribbon clerks\\"(a gambling expression).  That doesn't happen with Connelly's novels. He burns rubber from the opening paragraph. Unlike inferior novels such as [[ASIN:0345803485 the most popular book among women]] (where he doesn't put the pork to her until chapter 8), Angels Flight takes no time to get going. On page one, the phone rings. Harry Bosch is summoned to a crime scene. There is no setup, no gimmickry. You hit the ground running. The dialogue is terse and realistic. The situation is plausible.  There's no temptation to skip ahead, and you wouldn't dare, because things move fast.<br /><br />Nor is the story told out of sequence -- the latest fad -- jumping back-and-forth in time. The beauty of Michael Connelly's style is that he has stripped the writing down to itsbare essentials, and in discarding the gimmicks, he has thus made it more effective.<br /><br />Characters in the novels of Dan Brown and Michael Crichton often flit about to scenes in another continent. Most of this novel takes place within a few square miles of downtown Los Angeles. Unlike the novels of Tom Clancy, the locale never shifts to what Team B is doing on the other side of the earth. Nobody in Connelly's novels hops onto a waiting private jet.<br /><br />Although the reviews of Angels Flight posted here are overwhelmingly positive, I can see why a casual reader in the market for an action-thriller might not enjoy this novel. As opposed to the typical good-guys/bad-guys scenario of most popular fiction, Angels Flight is unrelentingly dark and depressing. There are no thrills in the form of car chases or shootouts; no racing around trying to find a time bomb with a red digital-readout. It's not a movie script, it's a novel.<br /><br />Reading through his oeuvre, one notices with admiration how much Connelly improved as a writer over the span of his early novels. He gradually discarded anything that was unrealistic or a clich&eacute;. Thrown overboard were the perverted evil genius lurking under the bed; no more Dollmaker; no one crawling through ventilation ducts. In place of the boogeyman, there appeared the far more disturbing threat of sociopolitical conflict. Instead of escapist entertainment, stark realism became his intent.<br /><br />Most of the early scenes in Angels Flight take place inside confined areas, instilling a feeling of claustrophobic unease in the reader. The protagonist, Harry Bosch, is, as usual, menaced by his old nemesis, Deputy Chief Irving. Bosch can't trust his fellow cops. His wife is leaving him. The principal case is taken away from him. Frankie Sheehan's ordeal. The sense of frustration and isolation are overwhelming.  It's not a fun book.<br /><br />I'm embarrassed to admit that I have occasionally purchased some book, sold it, then purchased it again some years later. Poor books make such a slight impression on me, that I forget that I've read them. I haven't read Angels Flight in its entirety in about five years, yet I recall some scenes in it vividly, as if I'd just put the book down. Occasionally, I'll read just a passage, a few pages in the book, because because they're my favorite writing. Sometimes, so as to clear my palate, I'll pick this book up after reading a particularly trashy novel, just to remind myself that I really do enjoy reading. It's just as you might have a favorite song that you listen to when you're in a certain mood. The late-night clandestine meeting where Harry Bosch and Captain John Garwood sit in a car parked at Frank Sinatra's star on the Hollywood Walk is one such passage, and I often paraphrase Garwood's words to a friend: \\"I know how you feel. Everybody's drinking, but you can't.\\"<br /><br />I should again mention that the whodunit aspect of this novel is of minor importance. After the denouement, when the identity of the real killer is revealed, it's somewhat of a letdown. The poignancy of the story is Harry Bosch's determination to press on after everyone and everything has turned against him, when any ordinary man would've given it up . . . and just quit. The mystery isn't the story, Harry Bosch is the story. Stubborn, volatile, generally dislikable, this character launched a host of imitators (e.g., [[ASIN:0062068423 Harry Hole]]). Before Harry Bosch, detectives were suave, debonaire, unbeatable. Now, detectives with problems are the fad. Before Michael Connelly's breakthrough the only problem detectives had was keeping the dames off of them.<br /><br />Novelists who are generally considered to be profound -- e.g., David Foster Wallace or Thomas Pynchon -- include everything they can think of in their books: politics, ethics, metaphysics. Michael Connelly takes the opposite approach. He zeros in on the thoughts and actions of one man -- Harry Bosch-- to the exclusion of all else. It's very focused writing, and that seems to me to be a more difficult feat to perform.it, then purchased it again some years later.

Before Harry Bosch, detectives were suave, debonaire, unbeatable. Now, detectives with problems are the fad. Before Michael Connelly's breakthrough the only problem detectives had was keeping the dames off of them.<br /><br />Novelists who are generally considered to be profound -- e.g., David Foster Wallace or Thomas Pynchon -- include everything they can think of in their books: politics, ethics, metaphysics. Michael Connelly takes the opposite approach. He zeros in on the thoughts and actions of one man -- Harry Bosch-- to the exclusion of all else. It's very focused writing, and that seems to me to be a more difficult feat to perform.

B000069KE0|4.0|I used to listen to this album more than any other release by Chicago. This was back in my teens, so my tastes definitely have changed in the three-plus decades since then. And maybe it's inevitable that we perceive things differently as we age.<br /><br />Still, \\"Chicago II,\\" as it came to be known, hasn't worn well with me in the last few years. I don't like it now nearly as much \\"Chicago Transit Authority I,\\" the band's debut. Musically, the songs lack the edginess of those on the first album, and lyrically, Chicago's political pretensions get rather out of control here.<br /><br />That said, the first side (to use old vinyl terminology) is great. Trombonist James Pankow's \\"Movin' In\\" makes for a nice mid-tempo opener, while guitarist Terry Kath offers two fine songs, \\"The Road\\" and \\"In the Country.\\" Keyboardist Robert Lamm's first song on the album is the more pensive \\"Poem for the People.\\"<br /><br />It's side two where things begin to go wrong. Lamm's \\"Wake Up Sunshine\\" is pretty forgettable soft pop. It's followed by Pankow's \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon,\\" a seven-part suite that takes up the rest of the side. It has some nice moments, including \\"Make Me Smile,\\" but it also features \\"Colour My World.\\" The latter, over the years, would be sung at countless proms and high school graduations, and would become my least favorite Chicago track.<br /><br />Side three is better, featuring two good Lamm songs including the classic \\"25 or 6 to 4,\\" plus a surprisingly tender four-song suite written by Kath with Peter Matz called \\"Memories of Love.\\"<br /><br />Rarely, these days, can I get through side four, which is dominated by Lamm's four-part \\"It Better End Soon.\\" It's not that I disagree now, or ever did, with the song's anti-war sentiments. But there's little subltety here, musically or lyrically. Kath always has been one of my favorite guitartists, but his playing on the intro song, \\"1st Movement,\\" is downright aggravating.<br /><br />Yet this remains one of the band's most popular albums, and one of only two, along with \\"Chicago V,\\" that was remixed in 5.1-channel sound for DVD Audio. That's the version to get if you have the gear to play it and the wallet to afford it; it's out of print and very expensive now.e band's most popular albums, and one of only two, along with \\"Chicago V,\\" that was remixed in 5.1-channel sound for DVD Audio.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I heard from a friend that this was a very good book.  I had a really hard time getting into it though.  The book just didn't seem to \\"flow\\" to me and I found myself reading the same sentences again and again to make sure I comprehended what the author was trying to convey. Once I finally got into the book the ending came and I was more diappointed than before!  I understand why it ended the way it did and I almost believe that it's because there could be a sequel.  Don't want to give any spoilers so I'll stop here but this will probably be my first and last read by this author.
B000069KGM|5.0|When it comes to ambition, the band first known to the world as the Chicago Transit Authority couldn't be found lacking. At a time when many rock bands were four-piece outfits (guitars, bass, drums, keyboards), the CTA arrived on the late-1960s music scene as a seven-piece lineup, supplementing the usual instruments with a horn section consisting of a trombonist, trumpeter and woodwinds player. At a time when the standard release was one LP (that's long-play record to you digital kiddies), the CTA's debut album was a two-disc set. And a time when jazz and big band were not being heard, for the most part, by a popular audience, CTA was all over the radio with music that fused rock with those forms, and to great success.<br /><br />\\"CTA\\" was outrageously good, for the most part. The songs:<br /><br />\\"Introduction\\": Written by guitarist Terry Kath, this song was the perfect opening number and, yes, introduction to the band. The jaunty lyrics announced the presence of this act even as the singer (Kath himself) admitted, \\"We're a little nervous.\\" The music sounded like Stan Kenton meets the Spencer Davis Group.<br /><br />\\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" Keyboardist Robert Lamm's song began with an odd but strangely compelling \\"free-form\\" piano solo.<br /><br />\\"Beginnings\\": This was another Lamm song, opening with a breezy acoustic guitar part. Lyrically, it was a pretty standard love song, but the band delivered it with such gusto, and Lamm sang it so convincingly, that the cliches didn't matter.<br /><br />\\"Questions 67 and 68\\": Another relationship song written by Lamm, sung by Lamm with bassist Peter Cetera. I still don't know EXACTLY what questions 67 and 68 might be, but I don't care, either -- clearly, it's from the point of view of someone excited by the prospect of commitment, but a person who also has lots of fears and questions.<br /><br />\\"Listen\\": A short, punchy song by Lamm, driven by Kath's distorted electric guitar. Lamm declares that if people think the band is just here for the money ... well, they could be making lots more money doing other things (this would quickly change for Chicago, to be sure, as their hits started piling up).<br /><br />\\"Poem 58\\": A long, smoldering song from Lamm, a strong declaration of love. The title is a total mystery to me, but maybe Lamm was trying to suggest just how difficult it was for him to write something like this, to express himself in the face of something as profound as love.<br /><br />\\"Free Form Guitar\\": Well ... what can I say? This is six minutes and forty-seven seconds of Terry Kath making the most howling, obnoxious, anti-melodic music he could possibly wrench out of his electric guitar. Virtuosic? Undoubtedly. But all these years later, it's a pretty hard listen, frankly -- even more soaked in feedback and noise than Jimi Hendrix's take on \\"The Star-Spangled Banner.\\"<br /><br />\\"South California Purples\\": Essentially a slow blues song by Lamm; the clever title refers to the band's relocation from Chicago, where they formed, and the blues of that city, to the smog-infested, purplish skies of Los Angeles.<br /><br />\\"I'm a Man\\": Kath, Cetera and Lamm trade vocals on the Spencer Davis Group classic, penned by Steve Winwood and Jimmy Miller.<br /><br />\\"Prologue (August 29, 1968)\\": Sound effects from protestors at the 1968 Democratic Convention (\\"the whole world's watching ... the whole world's watching\\") credited to producer James William Guercio.<br /><br />\\"Someday (August 29, 1968)\\": Lamm and trombonist Jimmy Pankow cowrote this song inspired by the '68 Democratic National Convention. An ominous song about political upheaval and personal sacrifice, sung by Lamm and Cetera.<br /><br />\\"Liberation\\": The album's closer is Pankow's mostly instrumental showcase for the band's playing abilities. The exception comes nearly 13 minutes into the 14-1/2-minute song as Kath sings, \\"Whoa, thank you, people.\\" It sounds absurd but his deep, soulful baritone voice madeit work. And the horn section -- Pankow along with trumpeter Lee Loughnane and sax/flute man Walt Parazaider -- are at their brazen best on this one.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The politics of the album certainly sound dated now -- both in the societal sense but also the personal sense. It was the 1960s, after all, and peace, love and revolution were in the air. Musically, though, \\"CTA\\" sounds remarkably fresh. Every member of the band plays well on it, but especially notable are Cetera's bass parts and Danny Seraphine's drumming, which is very aggressive here but would be toned down as CTA became known simply as Chicago, and the band became more interested in AM radio hits over FM radio airplay.<br /><br />Highly recommended.it work.

B00843TZJ2|3.0|Well, it's Crosby, Stills, & Nash. It's tempting to give this an extra star just for keeping on, keeping on. However, there's nothing here that sounds nearly as good, or as fresh, as these guys in their prime. The new songs are nice, but mostly forgetable. Crosby's and Nash's voices still sound good, but have definitely aged, while Stills' voice is personable, but muted. The backing band is every bit as professional as might be expected. Stills' finds some room for very expressive guitar work, but certainly not as often as for his solo performances. I prefer this to the choppy, but likeable, Deja Vu Live, but certainly not to any of their live performances from the 70s & 80s, or to Stills' Live at Shepherd's Bush. But CSN fans should find plenty to enjoy here. Great to have CDs and DVD together. (This review is not for Blu-Ray, which I think is great technology, but excessively expensive for digital video.)
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Prometheus was a lot smaller than I expected this is because the plot takes place on the space station and the alien planet which sets the scene for a trite stereotypical science fiction movie. Prometheus is clearly not the typical high standard artistic Ridley Scott masterpiece that one would expect. The acting was pretentious and forced throughout the movie which was the most obvious disappointment. The actor who played the Captain (Idris Elba) was notably the worst actor: he appeared to have hated working on the movie the most. For instance when a harsh windstorm tears down the team he just sits there mumbling to himself and not truly caring as he watches the team get blasted on a high-tech spaceship monitor. Furthermore, it seemed as if the actors hated working on the set with each other and with Ridley Scott.<br /><br />The script was average but great actors could have redeemed that flaw. The movie progressed very slowly as the languid main actress Noomi Rapace(the scientist/doctor) discovers what look like cave drawings and cryptic writings. She determined without proof that whoever wrote that also engineered humans. A sub-plot includes Dr. Weyland who expects to find a cure for old age on the mysterious planet. Dr. Weyland is in for a shock when the blue humanoid man who is found hibernating inside the planet reacts with hostility.<br /><br />As the movie slowly progressed it seemed to me that Ridley Scott borrowed many ideas from Star Trek: The Next Generation rather than working with previous ideas from the Alien series. There are also no hints of Blade Runner elements in Prometheus. Rather than innovating and making a progressive science fiction movie this is more of a return to the Star Trek era which is unoriginal to say the least.<br /><br />What saves this movie from being a complete disappointment is that it gets more intriguing, foreboding, ominous, and eerie as it progressed. The level of gore and violence was stereotypical for any modern science fiction movie made after the 1990's era; causing me to disagree with those reviewers who stated that Prometheus was more of a horror movie. Prometheus is not a horror movie although there is a bizarre and terrifying scene where Noomi Rapace must have an automated mechanical c section in order to remove an Alien squid. The baby squid Alien looked both ridiculous and eerie which didn't add any sparkle to the already odd movie. The other mildly horrific moments were quick, to the point, and odd: that included a giant alien squid attack on a blue humanoid that was originally hibernating from within the planet; and at the end of the movie the blue humanoid grotesquely gives birth to what looks like The Alien from the first Alien movie.<br /><br />In addition to that there are a few long drawn out scenes where the team explores the planet; several frightening windstorms; a random creature attack which breaks one of the team member's arms; a random zombie attack; and an enormous spaceship literally crashed on and crushed Charlize Theron's annoying character.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the production design and set design are average. There is nothing unique or notable about that. The creatures, and special effects looked out-dated by at least 6 years. I believe H.R. Giger did not work on this movie which was a shame.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was very intriguing starting in the middle part and I was not bored. However, Prometheus seemed rushed, forced, pretentious, and ultimately like a Star Trek: The Next Generation movie. Noomi Repace's underwhelming performance was a disappointment considering how Alien fans are accustomed to the power and strength of the Ripley female character. Charlize Theron's character was catty, antagonistic, and selfish: nothing interesting there. At one point the ship's captain asks if she is a robot. Michael Fassbender performed well as the creepy narcissistic android but wasn't anything very special. The team that explores the planet is dull and doesn't add anything to the movie. The movie itself was filmed well: the cinematography shots throughout the movie were interesting but nothing that lived up to the original Alien movie or Blade Runner.<br /><br />As of now I give this move a C+. I recommend you watch it if you like Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek (the movie remake).

I'm a social studies teacher, so I was intrigued by the topic from the start.  I appreciated all the research he did in bringing this story to life. I won't go into a synopsis ~ lot of good ones here. My review is more about the experience of reading this book. I have read many of Stephen King's books, but I haven't in a while, so it was so nice to hear his \\"voice\\" again. I found myself dogearing pages simply because of his prose. I'm here hoping to find another one of his books that will willingly suck me into one of his worlds. If I can't find something today, maybe I'll read the Talisman for the third time.

0345803507|4.0|I just finished reading the third book in the series. This book is very interesting and explains some hidden secrets not known before. I had to laugh at some of the silliness between Christian and Ana. Once again there are many sexual parts in this book but once you get over reading these there is a real story to the three books.<br />I wonder if there will be another book written. If there is I will surely purchase it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hesitated to purchase and read this book due to much controversy.  However, aside from some of the very graphic details of this book I found that I just could not put it down and underneath was the most amazing complex love story I have ever read.  I highly recommend this book series and can't wait for a movie to be made.  The author did an amazing job of unfolding this story, I was even hoping that it could continue.
1469984202|1.0|For the life of me, I cannot figure out why so many people gave this book 5 stars. There are good ideas in there (although nothing groundbreaking), and the setting could have been the scene for a very good story. But instead the author focuses on useless details. The description of a protagonist going up and down the silo staircase can go on for page after boring page; you'll also learn with excruciating detail how people put on or remove clothes, repair broken stuff, and so on. Sometimes it feel like you are watching a movie in slow-motion. And it gets worse as the book goes - the first novella actually contains ALL the ideas of the series, the rest is just further dilution of already very diluted ideas. The author was obviously surprised with the 1st novella's success and was pushed to write on even if he was clearly out of inspiration.<br /><br />So if you remove the boring drivel out of the 470+ pages of the omnibus, you are left with cliché cardboard-cutout characters whose decisions often do not make much sense and a smattering of teenage romance. That's it ! A complete absence of thought-provoking elements.<br /><br />If the author had stopped at the first novella or condensed the whole thing into 50 pages, the whole thing could actually have been enjoyable. But I feel cheated for having wasted so much time trundling through 500 boring pages for so few ideas and a cliché happy ending. This is IN NO WAY the masterwork of SF that some 5-star review claim it is. Don't be fooled by them, as I was!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This was a very enjoyable series to watch. I didn't think it would grab my attention but it did. Enjoy. Thank you.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Pretty pleased with this cover.  It seems to protect well and gives me more comfort in caring around my Kindle.  It is well designed and does what it advertises.  It is kind of expensive but that is just what covers cost I suppose.  Would recommend though!
B002GY9F9K|3.0|Why can't they leave a perfectly good story line alone?  I did not know a TV series had been made, so was excited after reading the first 4-6 books non-stop.  I couldn't wait to see if what I had envisioned in my head while reading was anything like what appeared on screen (I should have stayed with my imagination).  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt though, I've only watched the first disc (first 4 episodes) but was so turned off at the lame attempt at recreating a decent series.  Evidently no decent actor was beating down the door to be part of the TV series because the ones they hired are horrible - Zedd is actually scary not the semi-crazy but lovable character in the book.  And Kahlan, who is supposed to be one of the most beautiful women to ever, though pretty, is no great beauty and the slo-mo running through the forest became tiresome in just the 3-4 episode.  I'm O.C.D. and will want to watch all 18 episodes of Season One as well as whatever is on Season Two, since I paid for them, but I'm not in much of a hurry to do so yet.

B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham once again has delivered an execptional novel full of twists and turns where his main charactors are pitted against enormous odds. Notwithstanding, in \\"The Litigators\\" his principal figures do not \\"walk away with their dreams fulfilled\\". Nonetheless, it more closley resembles reality and has definetly a \\"feel-good\\" ending. This novel was even better than I had expected!!!!

Maybe Martin Luther King could be a close match given the chance. His respect for \\"the enemy\\" saved South Africa and he is our hope that men of his stature could exist in the future.
0143170090|5.0|I actually got this book from a relative of mine. I started reading it, I didn't find it slow or at least I don't remember. I got sucked into it relatively fast. I love the characters, Lisabeth is awesome. It's great to see such a strong woman like her. It's a shame that larsson is dead, he's definitely got a fan in me. I also recommend watching the swedish version of the books with noami rapace. It's awesome.
0062082353|2.0|I found American Sniper to be very disappointing. It has some interesting behind the scenes information about the Navy Seals, but the book is written in the style of a 9th grade term paper.  The alcohol-fueled frat boy hazing left me flat, and the author's continual use of the term \\"savages\\" to describe his opponents in the middle east really bothered me. People with a different culture and a different set of beliefs are not necessarily \\"savages.\\" It reminded me of the way Native Americans are often incorrectly referred to as \\"savages\\" in old western movies. I'm sorry, but things are just not that black and white.<br /><br />Although a professed Christian, the author is repeatedly arrested for getting in bar fights off base and is let go each time with a wink and a slap on the wrist. Excuse me, but are repeated assaults a laughing matter for Seals in our justice system? I guess I expected more leadership by example.
0307949508|5.0|This book is even better than the first. I am addicted to this series. I can't wait for the next one when Lisabeth gets her revenge. I have never really been into murder mysteries, but this series definitely got me into it. These books are probably the best I have read in a while.
0439023513|1.0|What a horribly despairing, depressing person Suzanne Collins must be! The Hunger Games was gripping and entertaining. Catching Fire was surprising as well as gripping but it left you hanging so you had to read the next book. Mockingjay was despairing! It holds you only because after coming so far you had to know how it ends. And the end is so despairing. This author should not be writing children's books.<br /><br />Final thought: it's like the author got to the end of everything she had to write and she thought (or the publisher did), \\"Ok, I've got to close this out somehow. I'll just stick these last 2 pages in and hope it goes over well!\\"<br /><br />My recommendation: After you read The Hunger Games, STOP! Appreciate is as a good story and leave it at that. If you start reading Catching Fire you'll just have to read Mockingjay to finish the story. And believe me, you don't want to go there!
030758836X|3.0|The experience of reading this cleverly crafted novel was a great ride until the last page.  It seens as if the author got bored and just wanted to finish it.  The word \\"ironic\\" is used throughout the book, however it is apt for the ending:  great story, ironically unsatisfying.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Excellent movie, great plot, so-so acting (but then many of the \\"actors\\" were REAL ex-Navy SEALs; that made the action scenes, dialogue and mannerisms seem that much more realistic).  This is billed as being taken from actual events.  Makes me proud to be an American!

B0053B347M|4.0|I purchased these to help with bias lighting behind my 21\\" LCD monitor. The Antec Halo 6 LED kit comes with a self-adhesive backing and it is quite sticky. I attached it to the back of my monitor and plugged the USB cable into my desktop. It powered on with no problem and works well. I did notice that after a few days the LED strip was starting to peel away from the monitor at the corded end of the strip. I made sure there was plenty of slack, however, I believe that because that end is heavier it pulled more and started to peel away. I used some masking tape right at the beginning of the corded end and haven't had any issues since.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|There was no doubt that after Fifty Shades of Gray I was enthralled by Christian and Ana. Whilst their doubts and fears twisted the smooth sailing, it was the interaction of the minor characters and the sub plots which kept me reading. I would have liked to know more about the development of the young Christian and his on going therapy in order to better understand his reasoning. After a while I skipped over the erotic paragraphs as they were a little repetitous. I shall no dout return to the triology as I was so engrossed with their journeys that I didn't really savour the writing.<br />I look forward to more pieces from Ms James.
0307887448|5.0|What a fantastic book! Just now re-read it, and I'm STILL hooked! It's like my entire childhood of video games, late night D&D and 80's and 90's pop culture rolled into one, oh AND it has the TARDIS! I want more from this universe, please!
B001UU75WK|3.0|This is NOT science fiction, it's fantasy. Ultimately the plots became so convoluted I doubt even the writers could figure out what was going on let alone the viewers. Way too many story arcs apparently happening simultaneously, too many hanging threads. I gave Fringe 1-star for originality (alternate universes? X-Files plot-lines? Been there, done that) but 5-stars for casting, loved the characters and the on-screen chemistry they created each week -- it was the only reason I kept watching. Never the less, X-Files was a better series overall.<br /><br />Considering all the trash that's on T.V. these days, this show is a cut above, family-viewable and generally interesting enough to keep you coming back for more. For that reason I gave them 3- 3.5 stars.
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|I've seen the movie before & I loved it. I knew I had to get the 2-disc version because I had the 1-disc version of the movie. However, the 1-disc version didn't have the special features. I wanted to buy the 2-disc version in stores, but I wanted to buy The Incredible Hulk 2-disc version in stores. Since I purchased this movie online, it was cheaper than buying it in stores.

Beside all that is it exciting.  By the end of the movie you are on your feet cheering.  The acting is good and the characters are very believable -- it is based on a true story.  I have watched this movie at least 25 times and never get tired of it.  For several months the movie was available on the cable channels and On Demand and I watched it consistently.  But when they stopped showing it I realized that I needed to get my own copy.  When I come home from work feeling a little down, I put \\"Secretariat\\" in the DVD player and my mood changes immediately.  My only regret is that I never saw it on the big screen. I guarantee that you will love this movie for years to come!
B005ES1CZ0|5.0|This style has more cushion than the standard style making it more suitable for outdoor use. They are larger in both length and width than my older Crocks of the same size and I may have been happier with a smaller size.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Wow! What an absolutely gripping book and not from the second or third chapter either. O no, gripping from the very first page! I could not put this one down. It's not just BDSM front to back - it's about two people from different walks of life trying new things, liking each other, working to get over their issues. It's interesting and sexy and shocking and scary and exciting all rolled into one!
B0068RHSCW|5.0|I don't know about you but I suffer through an awful lot of substandard flicks these days, hoping to find a little diamond in the rough... and here it is.<br /><br />From the artwork and trailer I wasn't expecting much, I simply rented it to enjoy Craig and Weisz. What I ended up with was something so extraordinary that I immediately bought a copy on Amazon, while the credits were still running. It's one of those films that as it fades to black causes you to sit back and say \\"wow\\" under your breath.<br /><br />I won't go into details of the plot, let them hit you at the pace intended when you see it. I will however rave about the INCREDIBLE performances by everyone involved, especially the very wide ranging, emotional and I think Oscar worthy performance by Mr. Craig. Ms. Weisz is her usual brilliant self, but Craig really excels here. There's a scene... how do I tell you without telling you... there's a scene where Craig's character is confronted by a doctor... that's as powerful a few moments as I've watched in decades.<br /><br />Just a warning... if you have trouble with goodbyes... there's a scene here which will have your grabbing the tissues, especially if you're a man. I'm a pretty jaded guy and I'll confess I had a few tears rolling down my cheeks.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended. A GREAT film.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|seriously though...this series is a great read. Do yourself a favor and read it before or after you watch the series.
030758836X|2.0|The book was a good read. Good plot, exciting story, a real page turner. I was telling everyone about the book and how good it was. I couldn't wait to start reading.  I could not wait until the end, and it ended so abruptly that I was shocked. I could not believe it. The ending was so bad that I was sorry I even read the book. It was like the author got tired and just quit.
0307716988|3.0|MJ really held back in this book, he didn't mention anything about Vitiligo, I felt that was cowardly on his part, He gave so much to charity, I wonder did he give anything for Vitiligo research cure or something. This book was good on MJ's music career but sucked on MJ's personal life because he held back too much, he said nothing about the abuse from his father, he says nothing about the bond with his brothers except him and Jermaine were closest cause they shared hotel rooms together, he seemed to have really only bonded with Janet, and his mom as far as family is concerned. He doesn't talk about any of his relationships, with women this book kinda sucked.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Beautiful disaster is well named.  The relationship was so dysfunctional and the characters both so mercurial that several times I thought about deleting the book but somehow I couldn't stop reading it.  Its like that train wreck that you can't look away from. The characters were a little young for me but about halfway through I decided to stick it out to the end and was rewarded by surprises in the plot and the characters. The side stories, urgency and impulsiveness of both the main characters made it a surprisingly entertaining read.  With all the drama in this story, I wonder what the rest of their lives will be like.

1401322336|4.0|Along with Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking and Marcella Hazan's Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, Jamie Oliver's Cook with Jamie has been very useful. The introduction and instructions in every chapter are perhaps its most important feature. I particularly like Jamie's discussion on how to buy and choose fish. He is actually very elaborate in most of his explanations especially with regard to meats and Italian cooking. The ribbon-marker also came in very handy. However, Jamie Oliver's videos--especially those about his dream school--are much more clear and illustrative. Inasmuch as these videos are already available, I wish the author had provided these in a companion CD. Still, the book is a very entertaining as much as it is very educational and informative. Truly, the book can make you a better cook.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read all three (3) books in 1 month. I couldn't put them down I just had to find out what was going to happen next.
B007OV9EYG|2.0|My family really enjoyed the original version of this story and were somewhat excited to see the remake.  We purchased it and were very disappointed.  It certainly isn't like the original so if that is what you were hoping -- a more modernly produced version of the original -- you will be disappointed.  We found the movie to have musical numbers and themes that were busy and unclear to the original story or message.  The movie was definitely, in our opinion, created to try and appeal to a different demographic than the original (older kids - perhaps early teens?)  The rating should have been a give-away and did make us wonder at first about the remake.<br /><br />In short.... if you really liked the original you probably won't care for this version.  Anyone want to buy a lightly viewed version of this release?

1468161660|3.0|Colleen Hoover demonstrates an active and pliant imagination, and that's great for stories around the campfire but it takes much more craft and discipline to bring fanciful yarns to the written page.  It also takes a firm grounding in grammar and vocabulary.  Unfortunately, Ms Hoover is lacking in those fundamental strengths. I very nearly gave up on this unusual story after the third \\"I wish I would have... (done, said, gone, whatever). But the corker was the  \\"I have ran...\\" that we got from the boyfriend, who just happens to be a TEACHER, and who just happens to teach English (I presume, since it's a poetry class).<br />I became convinced long ago that publishers have fired all their editors in reaction to the economic realities of their collapsing industry.  I have had that theory strongly reinforced by this book, which COULD have been so much more than it is if only an editor had taken an interest in it.  Besides the grammatical atrocities that might have been doctored up, some guidance might have been offered for the polishing of a prose style that simply can't get its motor running, mostly because of unrefined sentences that throw bunches of words at you and depend upon you to sort them out and make them sparkle.<br />Another reviewer wonders in his/her text just HOW anyone could give this book five stars.  I'm convinced it's the work of those ever reliable romance fiends who would give five stars to an Archie comic book, if the guy would just once kiss Veronica or Betty.

B0068FYZH0|5.0|This movie has been a personal favorite ever since I first saw it back in 2001.  Classic story about a man who has struggles that he overcomes, meanwhile involving those closest to him, real or not.  Led by the remarkable performances of Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris, this star studded cast puts together an ensemble of unforgettable emotion and thought that can be described in only one word: masterpiece.

Truly a great album no matter what you're mood in and something that holds a special meaning to me and place in my heart.

B000001EKX|5.0|\\"Hotter Than Hell\\" is living proof of how great the original Kiss was. Great songs, great singing, great solos, great drumming. I wouldn't change a second. A rock'n'roll abandon feast. This album has always been one of my favorites and it's high up there on the Kiss altar, full of classic songs.<br /><br />I just don't get it when people have issues with the band's musicianship. I find it annoying and pointless because truth is, apart from a very selected few, rock bands were never about virtuosity alone. The songs were what really mattered, and THAT Kiss could deliver.<br /><br />Summing up: \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" is the Kiss I'll always miss when listening to the current line-up, it just can't be topped or copied. Classic.

B008NEMPTO|5.0|Took my wife, on a slow weekend, and wow... it was great. Emotional, epic, big scenes! 3D was really good, especially with scenery. Action was great. Obviously I wanted a little more of this or that, but in the end, it was good. I'm a Christian too, and thought it upheld that part well.... for a comic book feel that is. Worth seeing. Not sure about this price, but heck I wouldn't pay this much for Avengers. But I might... I might... the 3D was the best I've seen. I even recommended my daughters go see it. It was gorey but good vs evil... moral vs amoral... good stuff.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I am very disappointed that I spent time reading this book, it would have to be the most poorly written piece ever contrived.<br />The characters are annoying, the sex scenes are average at best and if I never hear or see the words \\"My inner goddess\\" again, it will be all too soon!<br />I wish I hadn't caved to the bandwagon of the masses and had just left it alone.

1609611543|5.0|Amazing book I am going off wheat products as a test after reading this book. Always thought wheat was one of the healthy grains, started buying Daves Killer Bread because it seemed to be the best, but find after reading this book that it's no better than white Wonder Bread that I always avoided. I was at a local street fair festival this weekend and was listening to a band and eating some fish while watching the crowd doing some people watching and Wheat Belly's were everywhere, I had a hard time finding people who were not heavy or had a big middle heavy overweight people are the norm. I decided to give it 2 months with out wheat as a test. I think this book has hit a nerve with me and is calling me out, a lot of books are interesting but this one has got me moving.

B002SRQ214|3.0|So, this may only happen to one in so many, or maybe not.<br /><br />I bought the 965 already being the owner of the 955 model. This particular 965 comes with a Cooler-Master branded cooling device. The previous one had an AMD branded one.<br />The cooler is like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-AM2-AM3-CPU/dp/B004X5TGO4/ref=sr_1_31?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1344969366&sr=1-31&keywords=coolermaster+CPU+cooler<br /><br />Its not a bad design, but the fan itself is terrible. It vibrates heavily at low RPMs and once it starts getting warm and speeds up, forget about it. The entire case shakes!<br /><br />I had this issue with fans before and usually pressing down on the middle of the fan can 'reseat' the bearings of something. Didn't work. Nothing seems to work.<br /><br />So I just changed it out with a spare i happened to have.<br /><br />3 stars though because it should come with at least a decent stock cooler, especially for $100+.
B0085I0UHW|4.0|Im digging this album if i think of it as  a pop record and not a follow up to Pink Friday? it seems as if everyone is turning their music into this clubby dub step electronic music i.e. Chris Brown, Rihanna, even Madonnas MDnA has this generic dubsteppy stuff Its not that I dont like it its just that it all sounds similar. I really dont get why they named it Roman Reloaded and only a few songs have Roman rhymes in them. but newho i got the vinyl edition and it has the 19 standard edition songs, nice gaefold double lp and a free mp3 card (which imop every new vinyl release should automatically have  this included) the songs have been out since april so u kn ow wut ur gettin but the vinyl edition should be your choice its a nice medium instead of regular cd or mp3 ps....07 nicki please call back ;) thanks for reading, Andrew

1603580557|5.0|As the title suggests, this book is written as a 'primer' into the subject, and it fulfils this function with ease and grace. It has the confident feel and logical evolved structure of a book written by someone who had completely mastered her subject and was well used to introducing these key ideas to her university students.<br /><br />There is a strong emphasis within the book on economic and environmental issues, which suited me well. I presume that the late author held quite progressive environmental views anyway, but systems thinking engenders and illuminates environmental concerns better than any other approach I can think of. The sections on resource depletion are both fascinating and frighteningly realistic. Although the issues and underlying thinking was not necessarily always original to systems thinking, the language (labelling of terms) and often counter-intuitive approach of systems modelling has got a lot to give in these two subjects.<br /><br />Concepts introduced such as information hierarchies and resilience, are both common sense and useful intellectual tools at the same time.<br /><br />\\"I think of resilience as a plateau upon which the system can play, performing its normal functions in safety. A resilient system has a big plateau, a lot of space over which it can wonder, with gentle, elastic walls that will bounce it back, if it comes near a dangerous edge. As a system loses its resilience, its plateau shrinks, and its protective walls become lower and more rigid, until the system is operating on a knife edge, likely to fall off in one direction or another whenever it makes a move. Loss of resilience can come as a surprise, because the system usually is paying much more attention to its play than to its playing space. One day it does something it has done a hundred times before and crashes.\\"p78<br /><br />Looking back through it, the structure of this book is also very good as I have mentioned. It progresses in a logical way from the practicalities of systems thinking through to their implications and ends with some quite philosophical themes and advice. As another reviewer has mentioned, the appendix is actually useful in this book for a change, and seems in parts like a list of the key points of the book in a type of student revision notes form.<br /><br />The writing and citations in this book almost seem to suggest an air of bemused condescension on behalf of systems thinkers for their misdirected non systems thinking fellow man and the subsequent mistakes they make. Similar to the airy condescension of free market economists, but more justified and less disproved by recent events. There are many examples given which justify this air of superiority, and it seems to me to be an easy stance to buy into! Systems thinking does seem to contain the right tools for tackling the biggest contemporary problems.<br /><br />Anyone suggest a suitable follow up book on systems thinking? ( preferably one biased towards economics)<br /><br />Very accessible and recommended to all as an enjoyable introduction to this subject.ties of systems thinking through to their implications and ends with some quite philosophical themes and advice.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|There were those that criticized this work because it wasn't typically King. Usually, there's some supernatural creature, threat, or force that haunts the hero throughout. That's what most people think of. But in 11/22/63, King asks us to swallow one small piece of the supernatural, to accept just one possibility, that a forgotten diner in a small town has a time portal back to 1958. Swallow that one condition and then the book follows Jake Epping on what I would call one of the greatest spy thrillers I have ever read!  And there's a pretty great love story there, too! Gripping, involving, captivating doesn't do it justice. I'm an author myself and it's been a very long time since I read ANY book that had me cheering, cursing, exclaiming in panic and frustration... but this one did! I know he's written a lot, a lot I haven't read, but of all I have read/seen/heard, this is truly his finest work. Read it! Even if you are not a King fan and are afraid of the things that he makes go bump in the night, that's not what this is about. READ IT!

B003L20IHE|4.0|Actually one of the few movies I watched before reading the book. I am a Zac Efron fan, but looking pass that, the movie was really good in my opinion. I read the book afterwards, and there were many differences. I like the book way better, but still really enjoy the movie's interpretation of the story.
0451169514|5.0|we all know Stephen King has a way with words and is a master of description so I wont reiterate that. It is a horrifying delight. I have never seen the movie but I can not believe that it could surpass this book. The imagery King is able to paint in 1000 pages covers 7 people's lifetimes and is truely amazing.<br /><br />As with a lot of King's books this is based on children and the horrors they see and can stand up to. King makes us believe there is something more than just us influencing our actions. It isnt very often a book can really give me the heeby jeebies but It did. I am sure any Stephen King fan wouldn't hesitate to pick this up and I encourage even the King haters to read it. It might very well be the best book I have ever read and I finished it with sadness knowing that I wouldnt be able to follow the lives of Bill, Bev, Ben, Richie, Stan, Mike and Eddie anymore and I miss them!

B0000009SY|5.0|From the moment the actors hit the stage, it is clear that this will be anything but ordinary.  JG manages to pull together FZ's top skills- excellent musicianship (as always), wacky lyrics/scrips sung in perfect pitch and timing, and commentary on the current state of people, religion, and government censorship.  But what brings it all together is what makes Joe's Garage such an all out success.  Without structure, FZ can provide excellent musicianship with one of the most talented (and wacky) bands ever assembled.  I remember reading that he and Don Van Vliet (AKA Captain Beefheart) knew each other as teens and couldn't help wondering what was in that California water.  Both had a flair for eccentric, complicated music that was far outside anything anyone else was doing at the time.  But eccentric and complicated- even with great musicians- can only take you so far.  Enter \\"Joy's Garage\\".  By forming these wonderfully wacky songs into a \\"play\\", FZ is able to please a much broader range of tastes.  With this format, he can experiment with wackiness (Central Scrutinizer) then bring it back to more main-stream songs such as \\"Why Does if Hurt When I Pee?\\".  All the while, FZ is creating a masterpiece of a warning against growing government control and censorship (Tipper!) of artistic ideas and art itself.  On Joe's Garage, FZ brings it all together- artistry, musicianship, outright wackiness, and social commentary.  Another plus is the phenomenal recording process itself.  Having sold A/V equipment for 7 years of my life, I have become a \\"recording snob\\".  Once you hear really well-recorded albums on good equipment, it is difficult go back to listening to albums that were slapped together and sent off with little thought for proper engineering.  The best way to listen to this album is in the car, on a long trip with few and far-between stops, at very high volume.  Trust me.

0385742886|4.0|The solar flares bombarded the earth with radiation and intense heat leading to the melting of the ice caps quickly.  This in turn caused flooding on a Noah scale that left millions dead from the tsunamis.  Marc and Alec were in the subtrans when the floods began.  Alec rescued Marc, Tina and other teenagers.<br /><br />The teen group makes it to the 90-story Lincoln Building where they hope to survive the sun flares baking the planet.  Eventually the survivors arrive in Appalachian North Carolina with renewed hope as the water and radiation levels ebb.  A Berg low level flying ship attacks their settlement with a virus that spreads rapidly from person to person leading to insanity or death.  There is only one possible way to prevent extinction, but the obstacles remain insurmountable.<br /><br />This prequel to the bestselling Maze Runner young adult saga is an action-packed thriller in which surviving the apocalypse ordeal supersedes any deep character development; even Mark the narrator who tells the trek to the Appalachian Mountains in flashbacks has limited depth.  Still the storyline is fast-paced and to reiterate filled with action, action and more action.  Fans will enjoy this engaging tale though series readers know the outcome.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

B004CB8JV0|5.0|This is a book written by a courageous woman who risks her life by challenging the authority of Muslim customs which denigrate females who are born into the Muslim culture. The vast majority are doomed to live their lives dominated by males, not only fathers and husbands but brothers and other relatives.<br />In her concluding statements she wrote the following \\" When people say that the values of Islam are compassion, tolerance and freedom, I look at reality, at real cultures and governments, and I see that it is simply not so.\\"<br />Read this book if you want to understand how serious this subject is and how it will affect America as well if allowed to grow unfettered.
B0085RZGYU|3.0|This is a pretty average Camel Club book.  The action is good.  The characters are all present but diminished and Stone/Carr continues his struggle to help the government that betrayed him.  As the story drags on you remain interested but can pretty well imagine the plot twist and the conclusion before it happens.  It's a decent and at times exciting story but it remains standard political thriller boilerplate without rising to the creativity of the beginning of the series.  Felt like I was reading a script from a TV show rather than reading a novel.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is an addictive game. brings back childhood memories of playing the original. also tough to beat the price. get it today!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was really good. It nothing like the previous books that I have been reading. I can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|Wow! I was pleasantly surprised by this novel! While I do enjoy para-romance and urban fantasy, the occult and wiccan's don't really pique my interests. So, I thought I would go out on a bit of a limb in choosing this book and I am very glad I did.<br /><br />While I sat down to start reading this novel, I was thinking,  \\" Oh boy, is this gonna be some emo-goth girl grumbling about her life, meet some hot guy and all the while, get sucked into witchcraft and the occult sort of story?\\"  However, I set that thought aside,  opened up my ereader and began. As I read the first chapter I soon realized this book was not what I expected and I was in for a treat.<br /><br />Author, Rebecca Hamilton weaves such an imaginative tale that it makes one sit-up and take notice of the rich complexity and creativity between the character's and story line. All is not totally how it seems, and as the story unfolds most, if not all is revealed leaving the reader wanting more.<br /><br />The story is from Sophia's POV. She isn't the strange, goth-girl pariah that the small town of Belle Meadow makes her out to be. She is very likable and sweet. Sophia also isn't a push over and she stands her ground on her convictions.<br /><br />There is a buzzing in Sophia's head that forces her to perform a ritual in the hope that it would silence the sound. Instead she sets off a chain of events that lead her to discover who she really is and was destined to become.<br /><br />During this journey she falls in love with Charles. At first I wasn't a big fan. He later grew on me though. My initial impression was that he was a smug, indifferent, I think too highly of myself type. He gives Sophia mixed signals and ,well frankly, it just irritated and annoyed me. However, as the plot thickens and the story progresses. Charles drops his guard and softens into a character any woman would fall for. The reader learns that both characters (Sophia and Charles) have fears and trust issues. Hence, all the tension.But, I won't spoil the plot by revealing what those are. However, know that what's revealed makes total sense and the characters become more personable and forgivable.<br /><br />The Forever Girl spans over time and distance and as the reader we are blessed to get some delicious back story. So much so that it made me say, \\" Well, I didn't see that one coming!\\" I love it when I am taken by surprise by some sort of twist and that's just what Ms. Hamilton did.<br /><br />This story was not formulaic at all and I am in awe of the creative genius that went into this endeavor. Therefore I give this story 4.5 stars.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of Rebecca Hamilton's work!

B002ZCY7SW|4.0|I'm a huge fan of 24. I enjoy every swinging, fast-paced, action-filled, emotionally-intense minute of the show. I loved it so much that rather than retain my copies of the seasons/movie, I feel compelled to propagate this to others by giving my seasons to the 13-year-old who mows my grass each week. There are lots of lessons to be learned from 24 that a growing young man ought to be aware of. :) Anyway, after reading a few reviews and comments on the show, I decided to chime in with a few of my own. I only have one or two minor spoilers. Most of this speaks in generalities 'n stuff; however, I'll mark the sections that may spoil the stew in the 24 pot.<br /><br />One of the more prolific comments is that the viewer needs to suspend disbelief. Why suspend anything? It's better to live in fantasy/illusion than reality. Here are a couple of points to alleviate confusion over the suspension of disbelief and why we shouldn't have to do it.<br /><br />1) One reviewer mentioned that we don't see characters \\"taking bowel movements\\" or eating, for that matter. Well, I have an answer for that. It's because they eat McDonald's, order takeout, and manage to relieve themselves when the show goes to commercial. I'm kind of grateful to the director for keeping that stuff out of the show. I don't want to see the lovely Nadia Yassir (Marisol Nichols, Season 6) stuffing her face with KFC or Burger King. When I envision Nadia eating, I imagine that she eats nothing but strawberries and cream. I want to retain that image. What if, in reality, she eats like a honey badger? We've all seen them eat `cause honey badgers don't give a crap. :)<br /><br />2) Another reviewer mentioned that our heroes never get caught in traffic. The obvious answer to that dilemma is that there isn't any/enough traffic on the road to hold them up. :P Indeed, another reviewer on another season remarked that he had personally driven the probable routes of all our favorite action heroes. Swift answer to that isthey took alternate back roads that were not in place when the reviewer drove them. They likely drove these back roads on commercial break. ;)<br /><br />3) Another viewer criticized that there is a minimum standard for forensics, basic understanding for police work, and realistic weapons handling--quite universal throughout all 24 seasons. Short answers to this are quite apparent. A) Digital and criminal forensics was performed by the enormous and unacknowledged support staff at the Counter-terrorism Unit (CTU) many of whom remain in the background or off camera. It's a shame we don't get to see the brave work these folks perform on an hourly basis--at this juncture in my writing, I would like to honor these brave folks by saying, \\"Thank you for your service.\\" B) Basic understanding for police work isn't seen because the CTU folks are advanced Federal police officers. Why work with the basics when you have advanced stuff? The basics are assumed, right? And C) As to the realistic weapons handling...well, they looked like real guns--minus real bullets, of course (can't have real bullets flying at our actors or they might get kilt [sic] or hurt). As to weapons handling and tactical movement it can be best explained by using a workout analogy. There are a thousand different ways on how to get ripped, diesel, and hulk-like looking. Likewise, there are a thousand different ways to tactically employ weapons handling. Most of the cast adheres to the Jack Bauer Institute for Combat Arms located at the CTU Field Agent Training Ground outside Los Angeles, California, right? :P<br /><br />Okay, there are a few values-sensitive points in the series that trouble our community. These points extend to all eight seasons, please be mindful of that. For instance:<br /><br />1) Torture: Of course, we all know that torture by the state and/or a state agent is in violation of the Geneva Conventions, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and American law. We all know this. Our heroes--particularly Jack Bauer, Tony Almieda, that ol' boy Chase Edmunds, Curtis Manning, Mike Doyle, terrorist scum Habib Marwan (season 4) Abu Fayed (season 6), etc--are simply demonstrating to us (the democracy-loving people of America) that we may have to give up freedoms, liberties, and privileges so that they can engage in torture and murder as a means to an end in protecting our national security. Well, if that's all...ha ha ha! I would argue in the 24 cast's favor with regard to this. I would conclude that when our heroes (and the villains) ruthlessly torture and indiscriminately murder suspects and material witnesses that they are in fact against these actions. So they demonstrate these horrors to us in a largely fictional realm to show us how wrong it is to participate in such behavior. Make sense? In fact, the US military sent representatives to Hollywood to address the torture in the show. These reps noted an increased use of torture among their interrogators in Afghanistan and Iraq. The writers/producers acknowledged this in the final seasons by lessening torture scenes, obviously showing the audience that the 24 cast of heroes were evolving from their mischievous ways. :)<br /><br />2) Insubordinate Behavior: Mr. Bauer shows us the way here. What's a boss? He is an incompetent, lazy, servant of power; that's what s/he is (Tony Chapelle, Season 1-3). A boss is a totalitarian figure who should be subverted because s/he is a liberty-hating fascist and against freedom and creativity (George Mason, Season 1 & 2). So, when Mr. Bauer acts in contravention to accepted institutions of authority, he is in a circumlocutory way, licensing us through the power of the media to follow his example. This happens all the time in real life and it's frequently recorded on camera and posted on the Internet. According to the Jack Bauer Commandments, one should bare this in mind; no authority should leverage a rule, policy, procedure, or protocol against someone's non-evidentiary, gut instinct toward right action (By the way, I love how they use the word `protocol'). In all cases, noble intent must always be assumed. To illustrate Mr. Bauer's concept, if you are hanging out at the local bookstore or coffee shop and you see a person reading a book on Islam or the Middle East, assume that free-will-hating, life-despising serpent from Hell is with the terrorists. It's likely your suspicions should go deeper than that, the dude probably has a suitcase nuke or a radiological bomb in his basement. The ol' boy probably wants to use it on an elementary school or a chicken farm (to piss off PETA). In a case like this where kids or chickens are on the line, ask yourself, \\"What would Jack do?\\" The answer to that is so obvious that it barely merits an answer: Activate yourself as a CTU agent and for the sake of national security, pursue that misguided, anti-American heathen to the ends of the earth based on the evidence at hand--which is he read a book on Islam, that's good enough. That's about equivalent to the evidence Kate Warner (season 2) had on her future brother-in-law; so follow her example. When you catch your bad guy, torture his family in front of him, then saw his head off with a rusted hacksaw. Savvy? ;)<br /><br />3) One-upmanship: The wonderful cast of 24 is demonstrating for us the evolution of our culture. To mask raging insecurity, which we ALL have (including the author), you must engage in one-upmanship. Polite conversation? Ha! What the heck is that anyway? If you want polite conversation, talk to your ATM or listen to the menu options from a banking institution; they're always mechanically polite and use `please' and `thank you'. However, as far as human interpersonal communication, you must one-up or always be prepared to one-up. Chloe O'Brian epitomized this to the hilt. Season 3 comes to mind when she engaged in this type of horseplay with Edgar Stiles and Adam Kaufman. Or in season 2 with Michelle Dessler and Carrie Turner. Or that ambitiously disgusting mole Marianne Taylor in season 4. Sherry Palmer (Seasons 1 - 3) is a reigning queen, providing our pop culture loyalists a host of strategies for insidious one-upmanship. Anyway, nothing beats advancing of the race like attempting to humiliate or actually humiliating your co-workers, friends, and family. They, in turn, will do the exact same thing to you thereby deepening insecurity, masking it, and keeping people on guard at all times. I am a firm supporter of the 24 series accurately reflecting what goes on in actual society, `cause we all know that society influences media not the other way around, right?. :P<br /><br />4) Smart A** Remarks/Demands: Setting aside flirtatious courtships, friendly banter, and co-ed camaraderie, American sass has to be a globally-respected form of communication. In fact, it should be canonized as an art form. In 24, it is demonstrated so well and the results so profound, that the average Joe/Jane would be an idiot not to make American sass apart of his/her own repertoire. Who wouldn't mind receiving one of Chloe's arrogantly snappy one-liners that she frequently gives to peers and superiors in a professional setting when thousands of lives are on the line? Baring the lives on the line thingy, when I deliver snappy one-liners to my peers and superiors at work I always get results. My addressees always remain silent afterward (almost too stunned or stupefied to speak, as is seen on TV), do what I tell `em, and never seek to retaliate against me. If they retaliate against me, I can employ #1, #6, or #7 to get my way. :P ***SPOILER ALERT*** To demonstrate further, let's take low-ranking CTU Field Ops honcho Cole Ortiz's (kewl kidd [sic] extraordinaire and purty [sic] boy Freddie Prince, Jr., season 8) abrupt and quirky demand to a foreign head of state, Kamistan President Omar Hassan, \\"Sir, if you know something you HAVE to tell us!\\" A demand he made after Mr. Hassan implied that he knew the answer to the dilemma beforehand thereby indicating that he would likely reveal the answer (0700 - 0800 hour, Season 8, 0718 minute mark). ***END ALERT*** Bottom line: Forgetting one's place in the professional echelon isn't a bad thing at all. We should all do it more often. Anyone really scared of being fired these days. Sheesh!! You shouldn't be when you have American sass on your side or some other form of patronizing, verbal vomit. Tell your boss and your co-workers how you really feel, or by God, post it on that Facebook site and warm the hearts of a couple hundred people. If you lose your job, you'll at least sleep soundly knowing that your Facebook friends will be there for you. :)<br /><br />5) Dishonesty leading to Disloyalty: To paraphrase Sun Tzu, all warfare is deception. It should absolutely be used to achieve an objective. In fact, Sun Tzu deduced this strategy correctly after a lifetime of witnessing dishonesty, disloyalty, and ultimately, dishonor. Like actual war, social warfare or socializing shouldn't be any different; the difference is one uses guns/munitions the other uses words and verve. Has anyone noticed that many of our favorite 24 characters (and not-so-favorite) make lying their default position in most conversations (by measuring `most', it's about 50% +1)? \\"So-and-so's wife was kidnapped by the terrorists; let's not tell him when we see him next.\\" Or ***SPOILER ALERT*** \\"Special Agent Action Hero (aka: ol' boy Chase Edmunds) has known for a month that he has a child, but he shouldn't share that information with his girlfriend of three months (aka: Kim Bauer). Also, employ a friend (Chloe O'Brian) in the conspiracy to keep the lie going against the girlfriend.\\" ***END SPOILER*** Yeah!!!! You should always do that!! Make your default position in the real world based on lying or exaggeration and long-lasting, quality relationships will follow. I'm sure of it. :P Well, in the high-tech world we find ourselves, I have to agree with that. Nothing beats thetruth better than a well-crafted lie. Unless you become a mole and act against the interests of your family, friends, and profession. That takes a special kind of caring for the welfare of others, as was excellently demonstrated by kewl kidd [sic] Dana Walsh (or Jenny Scott?, season 8). ***SPOILER ALERT (kind of)*** This young lass not only managed to sell out CTU, but turned her back on her past making a full-sprint into the loving arms of her kewl kidd [sic] boyfriend, Cole Ortiz. She doesn't stop there. Dana, why not maintain the lie with your loving fiance for as long as you can? Besides, it's all about you, right? ***END ALERT*** (Note to Reader: The author admits a slight bias against Ms. Walsh/Scott, she reminds me of an ex-girlfriend). Indeed, it takes impressive mental/emotional focus to practice dishonesty that extends itself into disloyalty--behavior recognized in the mole. But hey, treacherous behavior like this appears to be increasingly tolerated in our society, so long as it's all about YOU then dishonesty is a great starting position in all relationships. And why not? If you're caught, then people ought to just understand that outright lying and disloyalty are a part of the game. It's not the liar/betrayer's fault. If victims aren't understanding, then there is something wrong with them not understanding that the lie or betrayal is somehow justified. So three cheers for dishonesty, disloyalty, and hell, let's throw in adultery while were at it (adultery wasn't a major theme of 24, but it deserves an honorable mention). Dag gummet!! :P<br /><br />6) Verbal Antagonism: Mr. Bauer seems to get responses from innocent or guilty people by simply yelling at them. Well, my defense for Mr. Bauer is if it works why not continue to use it. Nothing beats the spectacle of two people yelling at each other in public or private. I'm sure that's how many differences and misunderstandings are resolved. Yelling at people also worked for ol' boy Chase Edmunds, Mike Doyle, Rene Walker, and probably half a dozen others I'm not remembering. Relationship-building, professional or social, should have yelling as a baseline for fruitful communication. Whoever yells the loudest wins the fight. I observed my neighbor employ this same tactic against his dog and it worked. It ought to work with humans. Not to mention, in many cases it's effective at obtaining information before using...<br /><br />7) Violence: The short history of homo-sapiens has shown us that violence works. Mr. Bauer uses it and gets what he wants. We should take that as a queue that if we want something we must be prepared to use violence. Hurting someone to get information or to physically bend them to our will without their consent should be standard operating procedure for every patriotic, red-blooded American. Violence rules! Violence is the answer to almost anything. When not involving work, it's better to use violence when it's personal or it involves intense emotions. Not feeling validated? Lash out at your peers in an emotionally violent way. Jealous of your significant other? Beat the wo/man s/he is flirting/cheating on you with senseless. Frustrated at a spontaneous, uncaring society? Initiate a massacre somewhere. Guilt lies with both extroverts and introverts, but they sure as heck feel better after performing an act of unspeakable violence. Those emotions must find an effective outlet, so why not express them using violence, right? Using violence to avenge a hurt ego (Rene Walker, season 8) or to exact revenge on another for real or imagined crimes (Jack Bauer, season 3) ought to be the rule rather than the exception in America. Also, watching, participating in, and directing violence contributes to the evolution of the species. It's okay because it thins the herd out of undesirables. Those left-wing, wannabe intellectual types who try to teach us about civilized society have gotten it all wrong, haven't they? I mean, what the heck do they know? They're thesame people who banned picking one's nose at the dinner table and had us eating with, excuse me, utensils rather than tearing hunks of meat straight off an animal bone. Intellectual snobs invented civilized society to protect themselves against violence. So damn them. Let's take Jack Bauer's lead and release the savage within each of us.<br /><br />For the most part, I gave the exciting, action series 24 four stars for a few reasons: 1) Because it entertains me and that's the most important thing. With all that's screwed up in the world, entertainment is like food and sex and validation and Far Side comics and I'll stop there (you get the point). I need lots of entertainment; 2) Not boring me with some asinine life lesson. I don't want to change or improve. TV shows like 24 keep me from doing that, thus achieving my personal objective. The day I was able to set fire to all of my bedtime, moral-filled, classic, children's stories and cast the ashes in a porta potty was a great day; :) 3) By God, its cheap entertainment! For less than 20 bucks, I can get almost 24 hours of heart-pounding, action theater (let's hope my heart doesn't give out for lack of exercise). If I have all eight seasons plus the movie, I can set out to accomplish a 24 marathon and invite my friends, so I'm not wasting time by myself. And if I organize it right, I wouldn't even have to leave my couch for a whole week; and, no I would not shower. My home would be declared a bio-hazard by the Center for Disease Control before I quit a 24 marathon. It's quite a feat to accomplish absolutely nothing for an entire week; 4) The entire series is a DVD manual for everyday living. I intend to fully use the interpersonal communications methods and professionalism 24 espouses in the workplace and at social engagements. I have the pleasure of observing on a daily basis that a significant sector of our culture uses these methods--violence to a lesser, but rising degree. Although I don't often see any positiveoutcomes from their use, I have to believe that it works `cause people in our society continue to use them; and 5) It's just a TV show. Many Amazon reviewer comments criticize and often insult our more animated patriotic critics by pointing out, \\"it's just a TV show\\" or \\"it's not real\\". I agree with that. However, the caveat I have, as was pointed out in previous paragraphs is, why are many of the behaviors in shows like 24 emulated by some of our citizens? Apparently, they've been internalized enough for them to be brought from fantasy to reality. It's a concern that some critics have. Not for me though. We should all embrace 24's teachings (and other popular TV shows and movies). Internalize 24's value system, make it the core of your moral constitution. Teach them to our children and codify the more profound teachings into law. Do it quickly because I, for one, will welcome the day when I can pick my nose at the dinner table again; and better yet, wipe it on the table cloth in front of my parents. That'll show `em :P<br /><br />Note to Reader: This review has been deliberately satirical. My intent was to express my view, but to also have some fun with it. I welcome all comments. I prefer comments without insult, but if you feel you must insult then go ahead if it flips your switch. I promise I won't take insults seriously. Have a great day.

B000LCJ4AE|4.0|Many times over the years gazing into the sky I'm sure most of us have blinked , looked a 2nd & 3rd time while thinking , it just must be my eyes , I'm tired & just wrote whatever off. BUT,there comes a time with most people in the outdoors's whatever their given profession or occupation may be & this is not to say that all walks of life haven't witnessed strange phenomena while finally realizing that just maybe something is unexplainable that they've witnessed. In my own case I fully realize along with other creditable witness's that we've viewed the unexplained more than a few times. A lot of stories from pilots , truck drivers, outdoors-man, etc, that just happened to be looking in the right place at the right time be it gazing out a windscreen , a windshield or on the trail, etc. I read this book by Col.Philip J.Corso years back , of course with an open mind. From what I've witnessed in just my lifetime I find this book very believable , it has certainly opened my mind up as to a lot of unexplained so-called man-made inventions. Where did we as human beings come up with ideas of something of which we knew nothing about ? Did we get help or knowledge from a crashed craft that was not of this Earth ? What was with all the secrecy & threats from armed military personal ? Of course I think the majority of the human race realize the Universe is massive reaching into infinity so how could we as humans be so naive to speculate or believe that we are the only fish in this massive sea of planets & galaxies ? This book is an interesting read , the reverse engineering theory really gets a person or at least me personally wondering & what if ? I find it hard to believe that the \\"Powers-That-Be\\" actually permitted Mr.Corso to cast forth his secrets without a flood of ridicule placed upon him & William J Burns. Unbelievable ? Believable ? The reader of course will have to decide but to myself & a more than a few others it all seems plausible ! FOUR STARS.

0142800805|2.0|I don't remember who recommended this book to me.  I wish I could share this review with them, but I'll have to share it with you instead.<br /><br />I have been trying to listen to this book for two weeks.  The plot (I think it's a plot - hard to tell) wanders so aimlessly that I could not remain interested.  I found myself downloading podcasts of random news stories in order to avoid going back to the book.  Finally, after what feels like a million hours of listening, I just checked to see how far I had made it through the book.  Maybe I'm near the end and something will finally happen?  Nope!  I'm half way through (disk 8 of 16) I just can't do it.  Listening to this book feels like work.  Somebody should be paying me to endure it.  But, since no one has offered - I'm dropping this puppy in the middle.  I can't imagine what drudgery it would have been to force oneself to read a hardcopy version!<br /><br />The main character and his friend were fun and funny - which is why am giving the book two stars instead of one - and why I kept trying to find out what happened to them, but even they are not worth the discomfort of this hopelessly meandering story.

Has room to write not thing for each day and a blank lined page on the right hand side to the page which is very useful for shopping and dinner list.  The only thing is that the pages are thin so be careful with the pen you use because you will see it on the other side of the paper.  I found my new favorite planner!!

It took a bit longer to get to the US, but the dealer kept in contact with us throughout. The product arrived intact and in good condition.  It was sturdy and durable and survived a Beyblade tournament. A small toy, but it is adored by 8 year old boys.
B0062HS03O|4.0|The Blu-ray quality puts you there.  Lady Gaga's personality comes through in this concert recording, far more than just on singles.  Interesting blend of New York city scenes in black and white mixed with Madison Square Garden color bulk of the video.  It is interestng and stimulating to hear her hits done in slightly different arrangement, as is done here, from what is heard on their original recordings.  \\"Born That Way\\" does not come till the end, but worth the wait.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|The \\"trilogy\\" is one story strung out in three books to make it more expensive to buy.  The story line was so repetitive that it could have been written without half the pages; I got desperate for something to happen. Unfortunately, the book also told you upfront who the culprits were, so there was absolutely no suspense whatsoever.  If you really want ot read it, borrow it from a friend who has already bought it  or from the library for free. Don't waste your money.

B004LWZW9C|2.0|***Includes spoilers***<br /><br />Well, let me just say I'm glad I rented this.  I liked Valentine's Day (and like that film, I was excited at the prospect of seeing so many talents in one film).  I thought this would be just as cute, but it's pretty forgettable, and unrealistic to boot.  All these people could never fly around NYC on New Year's Eve and never get caught in a traffic jam.  Michelle Pfeiffer's character does all those things in one day? How does Sarah Jessica Parker's character change her clothes so fast right after the ball drops...did Clark Kent loan her his telephone booth?????<br /><br />I couldn't really get invested in any of the characters (especially Katherine Heigl's chef, and Ashton Kutcher's bitter illustrator), except perhaps Halle Berry's. It was a nice surprise to see her get all dolled up after her shift as a nurse, to go sit in front of her computer and Skype with her husband who is serving in the Armed Forces.<br /><br />There were some nice moments...one of the pregnant couples finally seeing the big picture after the birth of their son...the daughter helping her father get his dying wish...Josh Duhamel doing a \\"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\\" impression to go see a woman he'd met a year ago, whose name he doesn't even know.<br /><br />Alas, I wanted to like it, but it's already slipping from my memory banks.  It wasn't total garbage, like some other reviewers stated, but to me it's pretty clear that the actors were just phoning it in.  Two stars.
1416972250|4.0|This was an excellent third book in The Mortal Instrument series. Theres lot of action packed scenes and twisits and turns. Sometimes I felt like Cassandra Clare tried to put in so much stuff in one book that I think she could have gotten away with making the second half of this book a sequel and name it City of Glass part 2. But other than that I loved it. I loved all the characters even the new villian Sebastion. SPOILER ALERT in the end Clary and Jace get to be together and Valentine gets killed in the end. I would have liked to see what he could do in the other books but hey I loved how it ended. Also Alec and Magnas Bane are a riot and I think they're going to have a great relationship as well.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|This is an enjoyable hidden object game. The graphics are good and the music is kicky. I can't say it is worth the 5 dollar price tag because I got it as a free app and don't know that I would actually buy it. If this is your genre it would probably be worth it.

The app doesn't look even close to as good as the ios version. Now I cant get the app to work at all. I have emailed WIS and have never gotten a response.This is a terrible version.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|With The Dark Knight Rises, director Christopher Nolan makes it official: his Batman trilogy is not only the most satisfying Batman film series yet, but perhaps the best trilogy ever filmed. There is no deterioration in the quality of these films from \\"Begins\\" to \\"Rises\\", although I will admit that the second installment is still the best. Usually, by the time a third installment is released (The Godfather part III), the franchise collapses under pressure to top the predecessors. Even Return of the Jedi had to include those irritating ewoks!<br /><br />Nolan even manages to pull off (for the second time in a row) a two villan film, which is usually disaster. What's different about it here is almost a reversal of his two villan strategy for The Dark Knight. Harvey Dent was introduced as a symbol of hope and was turned into a villan. (Spoiler alert from here on) In \\"Rises\\", Selina Kyle travels that road in reverse.<br /><br />Many have claimed to have difficulty understanding Bane's dialogue through the mask. I don't share this issue with them. A couple lines were hard to hear, but that happens with most characters in any film, depending on the score and other sound effects. Overall, Bane's voice is clear and Tom Hardy gives the character a vocal variety that is almost charming and not the cliched booming deep voice of masked comic book villans.<br /><br />Then there's Joseph-Gordon Levitt, who compliments Batman as the everyday example of a superhero. It's risky to make a comic book film where your main charatcer's alter ego is absent for forty five minutes or longer, but Levitt's Officer John Blake is perfectly set up early on to fill Batman's shoes during the film's second act.<br /><br />One problem I have with the film is its occasional sloppy editing. An example of carelessness is when Selina Kyle drive across Gotham on the Batpod near the film's climax. The streets are abandoned and there isn't any traffic. It is pre-dawn when she leaves, yet by the time she arrives at her destination, the sun is shining as if it were seven or eight a.m.!<br /><br />That said, the editing and cinematography actually show improvement when it comes to the fight scenes. Gone are the frenzied close ups of hand to hand (and foot to trunk) combat from the previous two films. Here the audience is allowed, or should I say dared, to take in the full spectrum of each blow. For all the stunning visual effects in this film, from batpods to a jet simply called \\"the bat\\", to bike chases and massive, stadium crumbling explosions, the most impressive and jarring moments in the film are the brutal fist fights between Bane and Batman, the first (and best) of which is presented without any score. Kudos to Nolan and composer Hans Zimmer for knowing music could not add anything to that scene; perhaps only cheapen it.<br /><br />As I write this review the film is still playing nationwide, and my advice is if you haven't seen it im IMAX yet, do so. I've seen it in IMAX three times; perhaps I've gotten my fill, but who knows? The three to four months until the blu-ray comes out sounds like a long time to wait.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|If you have their previous albums, there is zero chance you won't like this album.  BBS are the best Southern Rock band, period.  There are no worthwhile comparisons.<br /><br />The album kicks off leaning a little more country then I'd prefer, but it gets right back on track with some good ole rockin riffs.  Kick back with your favorite beer and crank this at all your BBQs.  Anyone with a lick of musical taste and a penchant for rock music will love it.
B003YOMNCM|4.0|I've been meaning to write a review of Hahn's recording of the Higdon and Tchaikovsky concerti for some time, but have struggled to put in words exactly how I feel about the album.  In a large part, this is because Higdon's concerto is so hard to describe.  It isn't particularly strong on melody, but at the same time isn't particularly jarring, harsh or dissonant, and at times does slip into some tender melodies.<br /><br />The opening movement starts slow and delicate before picking up the pace and taking on a tense, urgent tone, though the delicate early part does return a couple times.  The orchestra surges as the pace and tension picks up, then recedes a bit as the gentler themes return. The second movement is more tranquil, and the piece finishes off with a driving pace in the (short) final movement.  There's quite a lot of tone color, with different parts of the orchestra featured behind the soloist (even the glockenspiel, which I believe I played in elementary school music class). I really like what Higdon did here--it's an expressive piece with a lot of tone color that I listen to regularly.<br /><br />I don't really know what to say about the Tchaikovsky concerto. It's not bad in any way, and the recording quality is good (in, fact there's good production values all the way around this disc, including on the Higdon), but I rarely listen to it.  Again, I don't see any problem, per se, but I already have two other recordings I like (Josefowicz/St. Martin in the Fields and Heifetz/Chicago), and don't feel like I'm getting anything new with this version.  I don't want to sound overly down on it, but I don't feel like it's a reason to buy the disc, though if your collection lacks the Tchaikovky, I doubt you will be displeased with this recording.<br /><br />On the whole, I recommend the CD to get the Hidgon concerto, and I should add that my taste in classical music is NOT particularly avant-gard.  My favorites composers are pretty much \\"standard,\\" if you will:Beethoven, Ravel, Prokofiev, Monteverdi, and Tchaikovsky.  I'm knocking off a star because the Tchaikovsky doesn't offer anything new, nor is it as interesting as the Higdon, so 4 stars total (but 5 for Hidgon).
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I picked this game partly because I wanted to teach my son how to 'tickle' a Kindle.  He can play the easy games though I still need to help him but he has fun.  He also learns patience and to try again.  I play the hard puzzles and I like the challenge.  It can be addicting.
0385339089|1.0|I'm three quarters through this. It's been a trial (pardon the pun) just getting this far. It's so unbelievable. An 11 yr old who can out smart FBI officials? Sure. A lawyer out just 4 yrs, with balls of steel? OOOOkayyy! Just give your readers a break John...this is dreadful! I enjoyed The Partner(except the ending of course- that hurt), and I also liked reading The Runaway Jury (lots of fun there), but this is just slow, painful and I think before the end I'm going to have to get myself a stiff drink...anything to help me wade through these last few chapters.
0307887898|3.0|There were a lot of difficult concepts and I felt it was a very heavy read. It is written to appeal to the Silicon Valley dot com types doing large web based businesses. The examples were mostly of web based companies and difficult for a potentially small business owner designing X Widget/Service in his garage to use on a small scale.<br /><br />While I did learn some things the concepts of Lean Start-up thinking in this book were difficult to absorb through reading this book. I have to admit I cheated while reading this book. I cheated by looking up Eric Ries on Youtube and watching him talk about the Lean Start-up method. His speeches were easier to understand than the book. Before you buy the book watch the YouTube videos then decide if its something for you. If you are planning on starting a business like Facebook this book will open your eyes on how to do it efficiently and use interesting examples that will appeal to you. If you are about to invent a new barbecue sauce in your kitchen that you want to market nationally - not so much for you.

B005LAII3U|5.0|This movie was amazing.  All the elements of cg, writing, screen-play, cinematography, \\"lens flares\\", and acting really created something special with this take on Philip K. Dick's story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\". They threw in little details from the original movie as well, sort of a comedic take on it, and then blew you away with the new updated version written by Mark Bomback, James Vanderbilt, and Kurt Wimmer.  I was very impressed with this movie and plan to buy it on blu ray.  One thing to note is the way the writers of this movie really explored extra dimensional space, be it from holograms, or traveling through the center of the earth with zero gravity fighting, to the hover cars and magnetic platforms.  The over-all concept was that of a cube.. and how to transverse 3 dimensions, all while evading overwelming danger.  It was awesome.  They broke through the barriers of mediocrity and developed a beautiful science fiction masterpiece.  Total Recall is a truely exciting action movie, and a very impressive sci-fi.  The acting was superb.  They really did well with every detail, and choosing great actors for even the minor roles was a wise decision.  5 star experience
B005LAIGPU|3.0|This review is about the blu-ray/DVD, not the movie itself.<br /><br />So I loved this movie and I couldn't wait to get it on blu-ray.<br /><br />I am highly disappointed in this. It's barebones, limited extras, no behind the scenes, no commentary, not even the rare gag reel.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|All I really can say about this book is that its AMAZING!! It touches on great military aspects, scifi, great emotion connections and a whole lot on the line for man kind. Written as a Prequel to the first Halo game, The Fall of Reach is a dive into a universe full of space ships, humans grabing at the stars, new star systemts and human colonies populating the far reaches. Telling the story of Master Chiefs origins and the insueing war with the covenant.  I would recommend this book for scifi lovers even if they havent played the video game Halo.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|What a misognistic story of abuse against a women by an abusive man.  The sad part is how popular the story is.  What's so fascinating about a women getting hit by her boyfriend and a man wanting full control over his partner?  In this day and age I'd thought we'd have more intelligence and humanity then to acclaim this story.  Why is it so popular?  How sad...

B008XBCJ34|5.0|I've enjoyed the original 3D Blu-ray release of Avatar as part of my acquisition in 2010 of Panasonic's initial 65\\" 3D plasma display and Blu-ray player.  Of all the 3D titles I have in my extensive library, none has matched the visual 3D presentation ([[ASIN:B004K4N64E Tron: Legacy / Tron: The Original Classic (Five-Disc  Combo: Blu-ray 3D  / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]] comes close and I'm waiting for [[ASIN:B008QZ5TH0 The Amazing Spider-Man (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] to be released) of the immersion experienced here.  Forget about all of the 2D to 3D conversions (though [[ASIN:B005IZLPME Captain America: The First Avenger (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]] is actually pretty effective) that isn't even in the same league as  and probably has done more harm than good for 3D movie acceptance.<br /><br />The key to a great 3D film experience whether at a theater or in your home ([[ASIN:B006OAXL92 Hugo (Three-disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]]) is never the \\"in your face, coming out of the screen\\" gimmicks but the feeling of actually being a participant within the film itself.  That's immersion just like viewing \\"color\\" is much more natural than viewing something in \\"black & white\\" though I will make an exception for [[ASIN:B006CEKZ4Y Citizen Kane (70th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray Book]]] and [[ASIN:B007XF4J70 Casablanca: 70th Anniversary [Blu-ray]]].  If you have ever wanted to see how involving a 3D presentation can be to the home theater viewing experience, go along for a ride (flight?) as Jake Scully attempts to tame his steed for the very first time at 1hr 11 min 35 sec into the film.  The comparison to the first drop after the peak climb of a roller coaster ride is intentional!  And that's just one small example in a film filled with too many to list.<br /><br />Avatar 3D is simply the \\"Must Own\\" if you have 3D capability in your home theater and looking for thatone Blu-ray title to show it off with.  Enjoy, and I know those of you who didn't acquire this title initially through Panasonic's promotional efforts will find it's been well worth the wait even two years later this October 16th.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|I loved this movie several times since it was created.  I watched it recently with a 7 year old and we were both gripped by the story and inspired by Powder's courage.  His strength as a \\"different\\" individual to me, really talks about evolution.  Mary Steenbergen, the Science teacher, and the Sheriff are inspiring as is Powder himself.

B007SGM084|4.0|I knew the gist of the storyline prior to reading this trilogy & I was skeptical due to the nature of the content. I took advantage of reading the first 6 chapters prior to purchasing & was hooked. There are many layers to this trilogy.
B005FITIDC|5.0|What's not to love it has Gerard Butler in it!!! This is a very intense role for him. Gut wrenching to say the least. He's good at what he does! It's not a movie you  will want to watch everyday (as some of his romantic comedies), but it is a good movie! It's just hard to watch so much blood, guts and bombing when children are involved.

B000002GKT|5.0|For the unitiated, get the CD or download the album. Put some headphones on and turn up as sensibly loud as you dare. Phew...good eh! Well I bought this album after seeing Humble Pie live at Hyde Park in 1971. I'd originally gone to see Grand Funk Railroad but quickly changed allegiance to the Pie camp after experiencing Steve Marriott and the boys strut their stuff. This was a rock band at their peak and the live album did not disappoint either. Their studio albums were quality enough but failed to capture the onstage performance, which the Fillmore album rectified in no short order. Seriously, you had to have seen Marriott perform on stage back in the day to truly appreciate his talent. I don't mean to mock those who didn't or couldn't but it was something to behold. Sadly his later career suffered somewhat from the years of hard touring and substance abuse but the Fillmore album does its best to capture that ability and the powerhouse of a band he was in. Playing alongside the awesome bass and voice of Greg Ridley (what a nice guy too), the burdgeoning talents of guitarist/vocalist Peter Frampton and the young but highly capable Jerry Shirley on drums. I hear that a remastered version of the album is being released shortly and will also include tracks not previously released. Won't that be something!

6305079811|3.0|After watching \\"Ted\\" I couldn't resist buying this DVD to catch up on the joke.  As a product of the 80's, I enjoy some 80's acting with a heavy side of cheese.  This film did not dissapoint me; I laughed out loud at the quarterback turned intergalactic superhero as he fumbled and stumbled his way through his adventure before stiff-arming his oppenents into submission.  The love story seemed underdeveloped and disconnected at times.  I give this film a 3 out of 5 stars.
B0032CVAQQ|2.0|This book is pretty predictable. I can't believe these \\"help books\\" have any value. The author seems very proud of his accomplishments. The problem with help books is they tell you what you already know, or can figure out if you think about it long enough. This is the first and last \\"help book\\" I will buy. This guy is making money off this book and I'm embarrassed I bought it. \\"Five Love Languages\\" is a pat book on how to solve your marriage problems and offers pat solutions that really seem forced and insincere. Really, the best thing is to get some counseling. There is no easy solution.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a good idea to have an app for you to use the Bible. It makes it more easily accessable. This app can help make the Bible a part of our daily lives.

B000002G26|4.0|I wasn't too old when this cd came out.  My brother was really into country at the time, but I was looking for something more exciting.  I found this.  And it was enjoyable back then and I still own it today.  Bryan Adams is a pretty talented musician.  He crafts good soft rock tunes.  And I personally prefer him to Rod Stewart.  The only problem he runs into is that starting his career in the late 70s/ early 80s, his sound on some of his tunes is very dated.<br /><br />This cd avoids it pretty well though.  Summer of '69 is a classic tune.  Heaven and Please Forgive Me (recorded in 1993 for this album) are stirring love ballads that we have come to except from Mr. Adams.  Granted there is a newer version to his greatest hits that has been released, [[ASIN:B001NYTXLO The Best Of Me]].  And there is also [[ASIN:B000BBOV8U Anthology]].  So this is a bit obsolete.  But still a good addition to your collection, especially if you can find it cheap.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|.....back in 1972 while living in San Francisco...really good science fiction films were rare...there was however a Russion film \\"Solaris\\" (NOT repeat NOT the Clooney remake) that was only shown on the \\"Art Theater\\" circuit (read limited time in a small out of the way theater)...as opposed to the blockbusters like \\"2001\\" which were shone on the big screen and in equally big theaters...with huge marketing budgets.<br /><br />...\\"Another Earth\\" which is not Russian...and whose story and characters have little to nothing in common with \\"Solaris\\"...is basically the same movie...that is...thoughtful...provacative...innovative...brooding...filled with..quiet...and well worth a viewing...

B007VUA7VO|3.0|For everyone who rates this 5 stars, have the thought occurred to you that this app, like all apps use your battery? Doesn't really take a lot to go to your settings, or maybe looking at the battery icon to check the status of your battery. Maybe they should have charged for this? ;)

B004FOA84A|2.0|Not worth the short time it took to play this game. Kinda sorry I spent even the ninty-nine cents on it.
B0026GBIB6|4.0|This is a quite good album. Even if not a masterpiece, it is still a lot better than most music out there. Depeche Mode simply cannot make a bad album! This album needs time to grow on you. At the moment I like (not love) almost all the songs, Peace is absolutely the best. In chains is soooo boring, soooo slow...sooo long...and I don't like Jezebel that much. All the rest is good. Corrupt, though a good tune, seems from another album, in fact this seems more like a collection of songs than a proper album.
B008B1VYP0|1.0|Unless you like the cookie cutter teenie pop songs yo hear 10 times a day on pop stations, you will write maroon 5 off as a \\"has been \\" band. It was very disappointing effort for a band that was once a pretty good band. I would rate this album with 0 stars if they let you do this.
B001224Z92|4.0|Good album, I like it but I don't love it...Nevertheless this is a good job with good songs on it, some of them classic. One Caress is spectacular. It is a pity many of the songs could be better with different production.
B00464AAXS|5.0|Very fun way to experience a story. A bit slow at start, but it's worth it as it plays out. Ending was incredible.
B001237AQ6|5.0|Most of the songs are slow...That's true. BUT this is Depeche mode at their finest, creating an atmospheric album different to all they have done until now. The only songs I could live without, and maybe ruin a bit the whole work, are The dead of night and Breathe. All the rest is absolutely fantastic.
1451648537|5.0|A piece of history we can all learn from. Very much enjoyed the writing style used here - told the story very fair.
B001230JXC|5.0|What can be said that's enough for this album? Simply a masterpiece, if not the best, one of the best albums by Depeche Mode.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|Like the title implies, I think \\"Chi Running\\" is a game changer. I have always struggled with running and never founded it to be an enjoyable activity.  I've suffered through knee pain and poor performance in running as far back as I can remember until I read \\"Chi Running.\\"  After reading Chapter 4,  I was able to correct my form to the point that I stopped experiencing knee pain and with every run I become more efficient as I applied the techniques in \\"Chi Running.\\"  I think it is a must read for anyone who struggles with running.
B00123JR0I|3.0|This is good. Some great songs, but you still feel they are maturing, but not yet matured. In my opinion this will happen with Music for the masses. A good album anyway.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a great app. I love how it gives u a detailed &amp; accurate guide 2 where your battery's being used. awesome that u can customize the floors. I highly recommend this app. works great on kindle fire.
B00122OCQI|5.0|The first real gem by Depeche Mode. We could make start their new career here. Since this album, until Sounds of the universe which is just weak, they never failed! Great!
0060229357|5.0|My grandson loved this book and could basically read it my himself with very little help from me.  Once we got through it, he started reading it to his younger sister.  A fun adventure for the preschool to first grade children.
B00122L1GC|5.0|This is one of the best. Nothing to add. A great great Depeche Mode album. I feel it close to Violator and Playing the angel.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I agree with the general criticism that there is too much of the old and senile Thatcher and not enough of the career.  Nevertheless, one does get a better glimpse into her true character watching her not in full control of her public appearances.  There is merit to that.<br /><br />The film, on the whole, is otherwise balanced and gives a positive (in my view correct) view on the woman's character, which did much good (with some harm of course) to her country.  One needs only watch the scene showing her conduct during the Falklands to see my point.  Sinking the Belgrano was not an easy decision, and it was a politically difficult one for her.  She did it, and winning the war makes everybody forget all about it. 30 years before London 2012 Thatcher put the \\"Great\\" back into Great Britain.<br /><br />The special features are a paltry bonus - we can use more of Streep's painstaking preparation to find out how she plays the character so realistically.<br /><br />Did Streep play Thatcher or was it Thatcher playing Streep in this movie?  I can hardly tell, and I grew up watching her on television.  Streep is a stunning mimic.<br /><br />Recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well written. Great back story and erotica. What a combination. I have read the trilogy twice already. E L James please write more!!!
B0042JH0EE|5.0|I have been a Phil Collins fan for years and have never been disappointed.  Seeing and hearing some of the original Motown musicians was great and like Phil I also grew up with many of these songs.  I wasn't too keen on some of the back up vocals but Phil was spot on. I don't think anyone would be disappointed if they purchased either the CD or DVD.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was a very enjoyable as well as erotic series of novels that a woman can enjoy reading and using her imagination to picture what is going to happen. I enjoyed all the twists and turns in the stories and really liked the ending. I HOPE THE WRITER WRITES MORE NOVELS LIKE THIS
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole Trilogy was good.  This book was really confusing at first, trying to figure out where they were going with the story.  It was still just as good as the other 2.  I also think this book leaves you hanging for either an opportunity to add a 4th book or maybe move on to another story about one or two of the other characters in the books.
B000002J09|1.0|I wish to repeat what another review stated which unfortunately I didnt read, this seems to be an import and not the remastered version which is why it is so cheap.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The whole Trilogy was good.  It took a few pages to get into this book, but once I was hooked, couldn't put it down until I was done.  The way it leaves you hanging, makes you buy the 2nd book right away.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|Having just finished the first book in the trilogy I felt compelled to buy the next instalment so in a way I think I fell easily into the marketing trap, ie to find out what happens next, and am eagerly awaiting number three. It a good yarn, an easy read ...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The whole Trilogy was good.  It took a little longer to get into this book, but you still can't put it down, because you have to see what is going to happen next.  The way this one leaves you hanging also, makes you buy the 3rd book right away.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|This was one of those movies that you don't want to end. I thought it was brilliantly done and the acting was superb. The entire movie from start to finish was delightful and I would highly recommend it to everyone! Until seeing this movie I knew nothing about Beatrix Potter and I must say I barely remember any of her stories from childhood except The Tales of Peter Rabbit. I can't say enough good things about this movie so I suggest you watch it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I tried another Mahjong product and did not like it as this one lets you continue the game after finding the available matches. It also allows you to improve your score. More than likely, after I master the levels that I am given with the free version (4), I will purchase the full version.
0553381695|4.0|This book was well written, but was very slow at times and wasn't as action packed or had the twists in plot and mystery as the initial book in this series.  Overall a good read, but I'm ready to go to the next book, \\"A Storm of Swords\\"
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent!  I could not stop reading the trilogy.  A great way to have all three books available.  Kudos to the author and amazon.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The most recent release from Alex & Stephen Kendrick ([[ASIN:B000VECADK Flywheel]], [[ASIN:B000KLQUS0 Facing the Giants]] and [[ASIN:B001KEHAFI Fireproof]]), \\"Courageous\\" recounts a group Sheriff's Deputies and their struggle in not only their day-to-day work lives, but also their relationships at home.  Convicted that he isn't living the life of the godly man that he should be, Adam Mitchell (Alex Kendrick) decides to draft what is essentially a Biblical code of conduct for his life.  He then enlists his three co-workers (and his handyman) to join in this faith commitment and better their lives together.  We then follow the quintet as they struggle through man-made trials (some of their own making) to be all that God had intended for them.<br /><br />The story is heart-warming and family-friendly as they come.  The movie also lays down the gauntlet to men in a similar manner as \\"Fireproof\\" challenges married couples - are you going to continue in your secularized, fence-sitting, mediocre lives where we goto church once a week and \\"play Christian\\" or are you going to make the commitment to devote them to God?  A must-have for all Christian families!!!
1439153663|5.0|I just finished The Kitchen House by Kathleen Grissom.  It is by far the most interesting, rivoting book I've read in a long time.  Kathleen's writing style is very believable - as her topic of letting us know the feelings of those who lived in and ran \\"The Kitchen House.\\"  The reality of day to day life on behalf of those from \\"The Big House\\" and those from \\"The Kitchen House\\" was incredible.  Her descriptions of feelings and happenings on both sides were wonderful, detailed, and graphic enough.  A wonderful story that does not camoflage the truth or skip over the brutality of the times.  As a historical novel, this captures the flavor of the times better than any book I've read!  KUDOS for Kathleen Grissom - I'm looking forward to her next book!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very  entertaining love it would be better if what items cost acorns produce acorns also the theater needs more rewards. other than that great game

0061537934|3.0|The best thing about this book was that it really makes you think about how perceptive dogs are and how they really do relate to humans and emotions.  The crap about being reincarnated as human and coming back to see how things are \\"then\\" makes a nice story but took the reality out of it for me. I kept waiting for the moment I got \\"sucked into\\" this book...where you can't wait to pick it up and start reading again--- but it never happened. It was 'okay' but I was somewhat disappointed.
1400082773|1.0|Back in 2008, I read \\"Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?\\" on the 'American Thinker' website.<br />So last summer when I was given a copy of 'Dreams From My Father', I was looking forward to reading it.<br /><br />But, the book was so uninteresting, after a few chapters, I returned it to it's owner.<br />(And it turns out, she had not read it either).<br /><br />My guess is, a lot of liberals have this book laying on their coffee table, unread.<br /><br />If anyone does plan on buying this book, you might want to avoid reading<br />\\"Who Wrote Dreams From My Father?\\" By Jack Cashill. It might spoil it for you.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am appreciating having a variety of soothing sounds that I can &quot;compose'/mix and match on my own for my meditation times!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a remarkably well-written book.  Imagery, word choice, character development.  All top-flight.  I know there are people who will not like my comments but I have to say 'bad choice for the ending'.  What I find so frustrating about this story is this is a very talented writer and I think the ending is beneath her.  It felt contrived and a bit like 'I want to be different' so I'm going in this direction.  It also was completely contrary to the nature of these characters that the author had built out.  If you want a good read, stop before the last chapter.  I, for one, was truly disappointed because it had been such a good book up to that point.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|Probably watched this film half a dozen times since it was released.  This movie  is just great entertainment.  Satire at it's best.

There is also some sound in there that takes you back to albums like 18. I have always been a fan and will probably always keep buying the music. \\"Rockets\\" is a must have.
B004GIV0QK|5.0|This is a classic film.  Superb acting by Karen and Jeff.  This film has so many elements woven in that I don't think you can compare it with any other film.  This is a homerun in all categories.  Loved it the first, second, third & ...... times I have viewed it.  Will probably view a few more times before I die...  The only thing I can find detracting was the ending, it was too abrupt.  They should have spent a few more pennies to give it a proper ending.

I bought this edition at Walmart.  The additional tracks appear on the Deluxe.  This edition goes one step further by including the 'zine.  This can be bought at the aforementioned store for $14.88.
0743277465|5.0|New review:  When I first read this book, I don't think I was being fair. It's hard to remember exactly what I was offended or unimpressed by, but it missed important points.    Some overriding themes in the book, life will frequently be hard, but these tough points can act as a catalyst for learning. It is possible to be at peace with distraction. And that learning is a life long process.    I still think this book is too subtle, because some of the most important lessons went over my head. And I worry, that I am still missing some gems.     An example of a thought I missed. The key to being able to perform when everything is on the line, is to understand that everything is *always* on the line. One way to respond to this is to study all the time, because learning is important! Waitzkin emphasizes instead the concept of stress and release, by analogy with exercise. There is solid evidence that our ability to concentrate in general is the same mechanism that requires us to concentrate in sports. And, there is plenty of evidence in sports, that breaks between exercise is important for healing and growth.     This is a subset of the only realistic argument I've heard for dealing with procrastination. An extremely common problem for highly creative people.    This is all really subtle stuff, which I somehow ignored the first time I read the book. This perspective on learning, would have been really nice to assimilate, before I burned myself out while simultaneously failing tests.    There are coherent, interrelated themes, which can be talked about and practiced. His website gives a few major connections between some of the most important ideas, as examples.    For those annoyed with how much of an autobiography the book is, think of the stories as evidence for his perspectives. His discussion on how he got interested in chess and tai-chi, for example, are really really important! It's evidence that some things \\"click\\", motivating a desire to acquire experience in something, fueling induction. It's evidence that child-like passion is an essential element in the creative process. A non-obvious point, which is contested by some notable figures, like Mike Rowe. The following back and forth with his teachers, is a prescription for a teaching method that searches for and enforces the heart of this passion, the natural voice.    This book has the potential to be many things, for a lot of people.    If you do anything which is \\"really hard\\" seriously consider this book.     Side note for fellow physicists or mathematicians. You need to get it through your head that vague ideas can be predictive. If you were obsessed with ideas being precise in the 1800s, you would have missed evolution, and consequently, that the universe was billions of years old. Which is huge. The authors discussion of how intuition works is very weak; but, the evidence that intuition is important, and can be used, is very strong. Don't throw out his perspectives because intuition isn't understood yet.      OLD REVIEW -- OLD REVIEW -- OLD REVIEW    Original review:  The Art of Learning is a really fun book written by one of the more interesting prodigies I've seen. Learning how to play and succeed at chess at a rather young age, when it became to emotionally difficult to continue to improve under the lime-light, he switched to martial arts and used his experience to succeed in that domain as well.    The book advertises itself as a great resource for learning how to learn, and I did learn a lot from the book, however I'd say his ideas are especially relevant for games like chess, starcraft 2, martial arts, sports, or any other zero sum game that can be practiced.    A simple example of something to apply his ideas to is Egyptian rat screw(how to: [...]). There is one significant sub-skill in this game, slapping. To win you need to slap in the shortest time possible. Everything else is fluff. This facilitates goals like, \\"I want to slap in less then one second when allowed\\". So one might practice by slapping when they see two face cards. Practice this repeatedly until you instinctively slap face cards (at whatever speed you want). Then time yourself, varying your slap in small ways, so as not to confuse what does and doesn't work. Repeat this process of slapping, taking less time, until you reach your goal. This is roughly the idea behind making smaller circles. The author strongly emphasized that ones mind will understand the essence of a method after sufficient practice. And that when this has happened, the student would then know when some small change didn't break the essence. Giving one the power to iteratively make the method more efficient.    It's unfortunate this process isn't already fairly obvious to people, I was somewhat familiar with this concept from piano. You play scales, chords, and small elements of songs, over and over again to give your mind a chance to understand what it is you are doing. There is a sub-level of your intelligence that understands things without words. Then you can construct more advanced songs, which ultimately, depend on these simpler elements. It is unfortunate that people don't respect theory and instead invest most of their energy practicing songs. They are much simple if you understand them as the sum of smaller parts. Perhaps musical prodigies exist for similar reasons chess prodigies exist. I personally failed to realize these ideas might work outside of music.    The reason I discussed this specific example is because the author's heavy usage of metaphors can be really confusing. For example, he describes growth in learning as like that of a crab that sheds his shell in order to grow. All that means, as I understand it, is that when you have a new theory for improvement, practicing to incorporate that theory into your repertoire will leave you temporarily weak. You'll have to expect loss during this transition. When driving someplace, you might realize that if you take some detour,you should be able to get to your destination faster. The first time you take this detour however, it may actually take longer. That doesn't mean you're wrong, you're just not used to the detour yet. This happens a lot when learning to improve.    The author clearly doesn't have very much respect for being able to put things down on paper. This is evident from his disrespect for philosophers dismissal of concepts that are ill defined. Admittedly, it isn't necessarily fair to expect everything be possible to define, but there is a very real practical goal.    The author is very exceptional. Which means there is something different about him then other people. It would be nice if this was purely a methodology issue. When he makes arguments which involve one \\"understanding\\" something based off of their \\"natural disposition\\" he's leaving in fuzzy room for people to put in their own ideas about what works or doesn't work. But learning is, for the most part, a process of shedding things which don't work. Very rarely are you ever \\"right\\" in an easy sense. Now I think there is something to his ideas, because I have seriously hurt my emotions and intelligence by trying to fit how I think into templates of how other people think. But at the same time, understanding what it is that makes one emotionally unsatisfied vs being mad because you're wrong is important (You can do whatever you want as long as you get results, don't let anybody tell you otherwise).    Some final comments, throughout his life he had wonderful teachers. Consequently I think the discussion on discovering and establishing basic principles is limited, not including making smaller circles. Also in the games he played, it was obvious who the winner was. Hence I suspect the author found forming goals to be somewhat simple. This isn't true across all disciplines. Finding the correct pictures to describe things in disciplines like physics requires a significant degree of patience and creativity. It takes much longer to win in research then it takes in chess. Also in chess, one is always attacking the \\"same\\" problem. There is variability in ones opponent, but really there are significant restraints on the world you live in. In mathematics, the constraints are whatever takes your fancy. This can make it hard to find the ideas one needs to practice. I have a friend who is quite good at both starcraft 2 and sudoku, blowing me out of the water. However at math we are roughly equivalent in intellect(On average we both come up with roughly the same number of solutions to questions). I believe it is because on the periphery of discovery, there is little to practice for, and one is reduced to patient thought.    In the end however there are many things one needs to do repeatedly, in which case the ideas in this book are especially relevant. A summary of the intent of the book, is to make one capable of doing something roughly as simple as walking, as easily as walking. Most people by simply worrying about getting from point A to point B, know enough to walk to some amazing places. This perhaps is not all of learning, but it is definitely a valuable skill and hence this book is definitely worth a read.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I wasn't sure how much fun this game was going to be but I figured for 99&cent; I may as well try it. I definitely became totally addicted to it though I do have troubel with knowing what to do sometimes.  Overall it is a very good way to waste time! :-)

0385742886|5.0|First Impressions: I loved The Maze Runner series so much that I wanted to really love this book. I have a fascination with wanting to know what happens before I find myself in a story, and I love that Dashner has created a world that existed before the first pages of The Maze Runner were penned. I wanted to know more about the sickness infecting the world, the darkness that had enveloped a crazed planet. Well written as always, the opening pages of this book seemed like they were going to answer a lot of my questions. But, it didn't. I will go into that more later.<br /><br />First 50 Pages: Besides the brief prologue, there is not too much that is familiar about The Kill Order. You are introduced to a new group of characters fighting a completely different battle. What this book does well, and instantly, is set up the post solar flare world. Everything changes on earth when a solar flare hits and nearly destroys everything. What is left are small settlements and resilient people. That is, until the ships come from the sky and reign a new kind of terror on the flare survivors. Instead of being their salvation, the giant ships sends Mark, Alec, Trina and Lana on a new, horrifying journey.<br /><br />Characters & Plot: At first, I was a little disappointed that more of the story was not going to be dedicated to the characters I had met in the Maze Runner series. I wanted to know more of their story, for sure. But, Dashner created a whole group of characters that are tough, hardened and yet somehow still vulnerable. Mark, the main character, goes through every emotion possible in the pages of this story. He is hopeful, playful, angry, lost, scared and brave all at once. Alec is a strong support, leader and guide as they try and find their friends and, in the process, discover the dark truth of the disease that is wiping out people and making them go mad.<br /><br />The story is dark, violent and more than a little disturbing. I found myself repulsed and disgusted on more than one occasion, that's for sure. There is a lot of exposition in this one, and a lot of major battles with people who do not really understand what has happened to them. Overall, the plot is well done from beginning to end, but I was shocked at just how dark and violent it really was!<br /><br />Final Thoughts: This was not the book I expected it to be. I guess I don't really know what I was expecting. I think I was thinking this would be more of an immediate prequel to the Maze Runner series, but instead it takes a pretty big step back in time and talks a lot more about the origins of the disease flare and the solar flare that nearly destroyed the world. The Kill Order is a really good book, and fits the world of the rest of the series well. I do wonder, however, how new readers to the series will take to this book, especially if they read this as the first book in the series instead of a new part of the story after reading the rest of the books. I would recommend it, although not while eating because it's definitely violent!ore than one occasion, that's for sure.

B007Y56JDQ|5.0|A Night Out with Friends is worth the money.  When Richard descends into the crowd to perform a number without the microphone / electronic aid, it re-affirms he is a special talent!  The friends are all very complimentary in his music.  Hugh Jackman, Sara Niemietz, & Matt Scannell are the top performances on this DVD.  Richard re-invents his songs and adds subtle changes to help \\"re-tell the story\\".  Hazzard and The Letter with Hugh Jackman prove to be worth the album and dvd.<br />  Unlike his prior re-releases which he went to the many accoustic / strings sounds, he compliments many of his songs by Rocking them back up without the dated original Saxophone rifts.  (These songs could go mainstream today!)<br /><br />Keep releasing music Richard!<br />Richard Marx, a true master at his craft!
0345803485|4.0|A friend gave me this book and once I finished it I went and bought the 2nd and 3rd books.  I liked this book and the second one for that matter (yet to start the last one).  Is it the best writing I have ever seen?  No, of course not.  I am not sure how much the \\"erotic romance\\" categories usually get the Nobel Prize for Literature but this is what the book is:  EROTIC ROMANCE!  It's a sexy story that is unlike most of the romance novels out there (I didn't say only, just most, folks).  I think that unlike the bad reveiws listed here, there WAS a story and it was interesting.  I find it hilarious that people admit to reading ALL 3 books and say how terrible it was! Somehow, I doubt they hated it that much.  I mean, why spend so much time reading these books when you feel so strongly that they are crap?! But I digress.<br /><br />I liked the story between the characters and frankly, the sex was hot. If you want a book that is entertaining, a good escape, a good turn-on, then read it. I think the author writes well - not excellent - but good.  There a few things I found irritating (repeats of Holy Crap etc..) but overall the story it self was entertaining and held my interest.  If you like it, then it's good, is my feeling.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|PG-13 action movies can GO TO HELL because THIS is the way they are meant to be made. Firstly, the plot isn't really original or complex but that doesn't matter because the action is soo well done with gun battles, knife fights and martial arts. Secondly, it's relentlessly gory which makes a nice change from the kiddie action flicks we've been subjected to after the glory days of 1980's action cinema. Thirdly, I just bought The Raid, Total Recall Special Edition and Death Wish 3 on Blu-ray today so I'm in hog heaven. YAY ME!<br /><br />I'd like to stress that a movie like The Raid, one that only cost ONE MILLION DOLLARS to make, is important especially in light of the 200 million dollar PG-13 Total Recall remake that TANKED HARD at the box office and rightfully so. You don't need to spend insane amounts of money to make an action flick these days what with digital technology being what it is. The Raid was shot on HD and it looks FANTASTIC! Also, you might not know it but this movie has a lot of handheld camera work but unlike the strobing \\"shakey cam\\" crap that we've endured in 99% of all action movies made since Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator used it, The Raid uses handheld photography the proper way to create a sense of kinetic action without giving me a headache.<br /><br />There's not much more to say about this glorious movie as it is now my third favorite action flick of all time after Jackie Chan's Police Story and John Woo's Hard Boiled. Oh and I would like to add that if you enjoy The Raid and are a gamer then I would highly recommend Max Payne 3 which is the greatest action game ever made.<br /><br />That is all....

It reaches from one's ears just barely down to one's pants pockets, with no slack left. (I am about average height male: 5'10\\")  If you carry your audio device in your front pocket while listening, this is a massive bother since there is constant tension. (I bought a stereo jack extension cord to supplement this, but it just makes things even more cumbersome.)<br /><br />If you want a short cord, say, for just sitting at a desk with your audio device nearby, or for an arm-band-mounted MP3 player, these headphones would be good. Otherwise, try another brand (or even SONY's other lightweight headphones, the MDR-AS35w).

B0059XTUVI|3.0|When the Soviets coined the title \\"the iron lady\\" for Margaret Thatcher, it was a slur that the British embraced as a compliment. This film takes the opposite tack toward the oxymoron. Rather than the lady's unexpectedly turning out to be made of metal, MT turns out to be made not of iron at all but of mortal and poignantly weak flesh (as are we all)--ultimately dependent on her daughter Carol, without close friends, even without the support and attention of her son (the father of her only grandchildren), who cannot be bothered to visit her. The film is structured as a series of flashbacks experienced by Margaret in old age after her husband Dennis's death. The victories of her past are entirely overbalanced by the compromises she suffers in the film's present. All her triumphs are qualified by the viewer's knowledge that, in her later years, she has become the victim of hallucinations that Dennis is still alive, that she fears for her sanity, and that she cannot be allowed out of her flat to buy a pint of milk (the first scene).<br /><br />One can see how it might have appealed to the makers of this film to exploit the gap between Thatcher's almost super-human strength and her all-too-human weakness. And yet this irony is more than a local effect in the movie, but the repeated and central conceit. Further, the title links the contradiction to her sex, and so it's hard for me not to feel that the film thus exploits the fact of her being a woman. Consider that her dependency is presented as having required her only daughter Carol to serve as her caretaker; the world of the present in which Margaret lives is sterile and constrained. Strong men are not thus portrayed in biopics about their lives, and the title \\"The Iron Man\\" would surely suggest a different implication.<br /><br />While Meryl Streep is brilliant in the role, one cannot help but be disappointed that she did not use her considerable stature as an actress to press for a more balanced view of Thatcher's accomplishments. Thatcher was one of the most influential and admired women of the twentieth century. To see her legacy so diminished--to remember her chiefly as a tormented and prattling dowager should be dispiriting to all women, regardless of the viewer's political persuasion.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|In the last few months I met a lot of people who was reading this book and I read that it is the best seller of the year. So my curiosity pushed me to download it and I started to read it. Oh my good ! This is the most idiot book I ever rea<br />d, a kind of contemporary \\"Pretty woman\\" rewritten for dumb minds and ugly girls dreaming a kind of modern Prince Charming. She is an average not beautiful girl working in a place similar to Ace hardware. He is a young (27 yo) billionaire,elegant, handsome . In the normal life he is cold and obnoxius but in bed is a great lover. They meet casually because she goes in his office to take an interview of him to do a favor to her bff who is a writer but the day of the meeting is in bed because of a flue. She fall in love for him immediately but she believes he is uncatchable. One day he goes to the hardware where she works and.....(I don't say more for respect to people still reading) This book has been written to make dreaming all the average, ugly, social climber, loser girls. The writer intentionally does not even give us a physical description of her, so every reader can see herself in the role. Usually you can find this kind of romances divided in episodes in the last pages of magazines for ignorant women. An erotic book dressed as a fable to strike the fantasies of poor minds. My vote from 1 to 10 is 2

Example areas mentioned by the author in the first chapter are rapid fat-loss, rapid muscle-gain, rapid strength-gain, and rapid sense of total well-being.

B004J4WLB4|3.0|(Warning! Spoiler alert.) With its solid four-and-a-half star rating, my expectations were high for \\"The Language of Flowers,\\" but I was disappointed for many reasons. To be fair, Ms. Diffenbaugh writes with elegance and has created an entertaining (albeit unrealistic) story from serious subject matter. The book brings attention to our incompetent foster care system which doesn't adequately prepare young adults for emancipation, resulting in homelessness for many. She also tackles the issues of single parenthood and attachment disorder, and with its theme of forgiveness, it's not surprising that book clubs have been attracted to The Language of Flowers like bees to...well, flowers.<br /><br />The novel is narrated by Victoria, an eighteen year-old who's been in and out of foster care and group homes in the San Francisco area since birth. Victoria is angry, uncommunicative and hates being touched. Yet none of her troubled background is discernible in her narrative voice, which is inexplicably polished, totally devoid of bad language or slang. The chapters alternate between the present and the past, when she was nine. Victoria describes her life in foster care on a vineyard with Elizabeth, the strict but caring single woman who owns it and longs to adopt a child. Although the relationship between Elizabeth and Victoria is tenuous at first, the two soon develop a bond. It is Elizabeth who teaches Victoria the language of flowers. So, why doesn't Elizabeth adopt her? Why does Victoria end up back in a group home? Obviously, Victoria does something terrible. This is the mystery that keeps the reader turning pages.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh's creative writing background shows, but unfortunately in ways that are far too intrusive in the story's structure. The dramatic events in each time frame parallel too conveniently. The characters and plot points are too incredible. Elizabeth is the most appealing character, but it's hard to feel much attachment for any of them in this narration that comes across as a dream-like fairy tale.<br /><br />The story begins on the day of Victoria's emancipation when Meredith, her social worker, drops her off at The Gathering House, a transitional group home. She gives Victoria twenty dollars and tells her she's got three months to secure a job and prepare herself for life in the real world. After that, she'll be turned out onto the streets.  As expected, the recalcitrant Victoria makes no effort to find work. Instead, she spends her time cultivating flowers in plastic milk jugs. Homeless after her release, she lives in a public park where she plants her garden and wears her blanket as a petticoat during the day. She survives by eating leftovers from customers' plates at restaurants, but after a few days, she realizes a job might be a better plan. Luckily, she happens to have an extraordinary gift for floral arranging, and using flowers from her garden, she fashions an arrangement so striking it lands her a job as a floral assistant on the first day of her job search. Not only are her arrangements inspired, but because she understands \\"the language of flowers,\\" she is able to match the flowers' meanings to the messages her clients wish to express. The implication is that properly chosen flowers have potent capabilities. Her grateful customers agree and she soon generates a cult-like following.<br /><br />Flowers often have more than one meaning, however, so Victoria decides to select the most suitable definitions and create her own \\"Dictionary of Flowers,\\" (which is included as an appendix in the book). She begins by teaching herself photography with an old-fashioned film camera. A digital camera would have been easier and more cost effective, but Victoria--as her name suggests--is resistant to modern technology. She'd rather waste money on endless rolls of film and processing costs. Finally, hundreds of photos later, after mastering the art of photography, she selects the best photos, mounts them on cardstock and hand-prints her definitions in silver ink on the backs. (I'm surprised she didn't throw in calligraphy!)<br /><br />Later, when she opens a business of her own, (appropriately named \\"Message\\"), Victoria's dictionary helps clients select the perfect flowers for weddings and special occasions. Amazingly, her witless customers buy into this grandiose notion that choosing a flower for its \\"meaning,\\" rather than its beauty, will ensure a happier future. Victoria truly believes that her little floral business could potentially \\"alter the quantities of anger, grief, and mistrust growing in the earth on a massive scale.\\" Her \\"bold brides carried ceramic bowls of strawberries or fragrant clusters of fennel,\\" and if Victoria had her way, \\"farmers would uproot fields of foxglove to plant yarrow...the cure to a broken heart...and sunflowers would fall permanently out of fashion.\\" That's right: no more sunflowers because they symbolize false riches! Am I the only person who is bewildered by the idea that a flower's meaning is more significant than its beauty?<br /><br />When Victoria meets Grant, a mysterious floral vendor who is also in tune to the language of flowers, their attraction is mutual. They communicate for a few weeks by exchanging flowers (quite sweet actually). Although Victoria eventually allows the excruciatingly patient Grant to touch her, sparks never truly fly: \\"Even as my body responded to his touch, my mind seemed to hover among the plants, thirty feet below.\\" While he makes love to her, she counts roses...probably because of their unfortunate connection: Grant is Elizabeth's nephew. He owns the flower farm that neighbors her property and Victoria is afraid that he won't love her when she tells him what happened that night at the vineyard.<br /><br />The story takes a ridiculous turn when Victoria becomes pregnant and flees from Grant without telling him. Victoria had longed for a family and she'd found the perfect man--he's even a good cook--but she doesn't think she's capable of loving or that she deserves to be loved. I wanted to sympathize with the difficulty she experienced while breastfeeding, but even this part didn't ring true. What baby feeds non-stop? It would have been more plausible if Victoria had problems with her milk supply or technique. In the end, it's a story of reconciliation with a hopeful message; in other words: nicely written, predictable chic lit...but as for me, I was turned off by the premise that someone else's interpretation of a flower's meaning should influence the way I feel about it. Sorry, sunflowers have always meant happiness to me, not false riches...and this book didn't change my mind.
1469984202|5.0|Not sure where i heard of Hugh Howey or 'Wool' but i'm glad i did. The Wool series are great fun assuming you \\"enjoy\\" end of the world sagas full of death and mayhem.  Maybe i'm twisted but i do love a good post apocalyptic story. They don't all have to have zombies or aliens trashing our planet.<br />Howey has written more than a simple sci-fi tale. There are strong characters in this world of science, politics, family and friendships and of course, survival. The \\"death and mayhem\\" jab is just that.... a jab at only a part of Howey's world. There is much love, loyalty and optimism throughout the silo.<br />Even better, Howey has managed to put together a forward moving narrative that sometimes lapses into flashback but never so much that it drags down the story. The author uses them as they should - to help us understand the motivations of a particular person, or the background of a critical event. Although these are complex characters, Howey doesn't spend long deep rooted passages delving into their psyche which can  r e a l l y  slow down a story. (Something that Stephen King occasionally falls prey to, even though he is still the number one with me).<br />Recommended highest. Be sure to follow up with \\"First Shift\\".
034580404X|1.0|Warning: spoiler alert! I read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" as a joke, to write an amusing review for our community newsletter. When friends and neighbors told me the second and third books got better, I didn't believe it and decided to see for myself. (Thankfully, a friend loaned me the books because I'd have a problem spending good money on bad writing.)<br /><br />Now that I've finished all three, my honest opinion is that the books get worse. The writing is deplorable, the characters are absurd, the plot is ludicrous and the message is downright disturbing. But apparently, women are willing to wallow through 1664 pages of sub-par writing in exchange for lots of steamy sex. Though erotica is nothing new, it seems that James managed to be in the right place at the right time and has benefitted from social networking and the surge in e-book popularity.<br /><br />I have to admit that some of the sex scenes are intriguing, but why so many? They soon become repetitious and lose their impact--total overkill. (And book two has only one scene involving BDSM.) It's as if James made a list of all the places where a couple could have sex--on top of a piano, on a billiard table, in a boat, on a desk, in the shower, in a bathtub, in the boathouse, in Christian's childhood bedroom, in the foyer of his apartment building, in a car, in a plane...and of course, in the red room of pain--and then she wrote a graphic scene for each location, always ending the same way: with Ana's exploding orgasm as Christian shouts her name in the throes of his own violent climax. After a while, just reading them is exhausting; my mind is numb.<br /><br />In between all the sex, James weaves in an outlandish plot involving Ana's ex-boss who has a vendetta against Christian. This gives James an excuse to throw in a car chase with Ana behind the wheel of Christian's expensive Audi R8. (They have sex in the car afterwards, of course.) There's also a ridiculous kidnapping culminating in a comical showdown where our foolhardy heroine gets to save the day.<br /><br />What disturbs me most is that James' fairy tale is a giant leap backwards for women. It's more sinister than the typical innocent fantasy where a feisty, virginal girl is smitten by a wealthy, powerful, handsome man. Fine, she wants to rescue him with her love when she learns how damaged he is...but when she disobeys him, his behavior in the bedroom is cruel, even abusive...and she tolerates it. It's always the same: she cries, he apologizes, she forgives him...and sometimes he even buys her something, like a 30,000 euro diamond platinum filigree bracelet to hide the welts on her wrist. This is not a healthy fantasy.<br /><br />Christian is jealous, needy and totally controlling. He wants to own Ana and control her every move, from the friends she sees, to the clothes she wears, the car she drives and the food she eats. He even buys the company she works for so he can beat up her boss and fire him. And we are supposed to believe that none of this abysmal behavior is Christian's fault, because his birth mother neglected him and he was sexually dominated by an older woman when he was a teen. He's insecure and needs constant assurance that Ana won't leave. Ana has issues of her own: she's always wondering if she's \\"enough\\" for him. Their perpetual self-doubt and whining is grating.<br /><br />Everything Ana does in these books is a recipe for failure, a recipe for what a girl should NOT do: at twenty-one, she marries the fist man she sleeps with. She barely knows him, though she knows enough to figure out he's got some serious issues. But she's convinced her love will \\"fix\\" him. These two want to \\"own\\" each other. That's not love. A few weeks after the wedding, Ana's pregnant. Upon hearing the news, Christian storms out and gets drunk with his old mistress...but not to worry: Ana forgives him and they all live happily ever after. Yes, the final book has a predictable fairy tale ending with an unconvincing message that love conquers all...or maybe it's the sex...or possibly the money.<br /><br />It's only fiction...but disturbing nonetheless.
0307951529|3.0|Guillebeau writes for the layman, which I appreciated since I have no business education. Many of the examples he uses are interesting and somewhat inspiring. He sprinkles in helpful tips as well. However, I had hoped that the example stories in this book would include more specifics. The author says things like \\"...and so Brian (or whoever) decided to scale his business and that enabled him to do X, Y, and Z.\\" Kudos to Brian but I would have liked to hear more about what was specifically involved in this process. And the broad, sweeping statements the author makes and then repeats are blended with a grand effort to self-promote. The author is very talented at marketing himself, making frequent references to his own life, other products, websites, etc.<br /><br />The author also makes several cursory allusions to important business principles, then says something like \\"...this topic will be covered in Chapter 12 (or whichever).\\" But then later on the \\"coverage\\" of that topic is just as transient. That was frustrating for me, that the author excites the reader with an important principle, one which I had certainly hoped to learn from the book, and then never delves fully into it.<br /><br />Still, I give three starts because it IS a good book. The author is genuine, he offers inspiring examples advocating a life of freedom, and he encourages his readers to grow their businesses by thinking about how to help more people. Good stuff. I recommend this book to anyone in the early stages of a solopreneurship or anyone contemplating an escape from cubicle nation. However, be advised that this book does not get very specific about how others found success.

0345803485|5.0|From Reading and Writing Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance Blog<br /><br />At a Glance<br />I think we all know how controversial Fifty Shades of Grey is. Some people love it and some people hate it. There are a lot of things about the book I can nitpick, but I decided to go into this book with an open mind. I focused more on the story and how much it intrigued me. After turning the last page, I was dying to read the next book in the trilogy.<br /><br />The Good<br />Here's the Story...<br />Ana has very little sexual experience, but when she meets ultra-rich, ultra-sexy Christian Grey, her desires awaken. But Christian is not looking for a plain vanilla relationship, he's looking for a submissive to satisfy his dominate needs. The question is whether Ana can fulfill his desires and her own at the same time. Can she go down this dark road for the only man that has ever made her feel wanton and sexy? Or will Christian's horrible past be too big of a road block?<br /><br />Ana...<br />Poor, naive Ana. She really didn't know what she was getting herself into. A 21 year old virgin who hasn't really stepped out into the real world yet. She is days away from graduating college and searching for a job when she meets Christian and her life changes forever. It's hard for her to stand up to him. She both wants him but is weary of his dominate tendencies. Then he introduces her to the world of BDSM (a light version if you ask me). Ana often battles with her sexual desires for things she thinks are forbidden or demeaning. I felt bad for Ana when it came to her sexual confusion, but I also admired her when she stood up to Christian and was even brazen enough to initiate both sex and a relationship. It may have been a rough introduction to intimacy and dating, but Ana really grows into her own throughout the novel.<br /><br />Mr. Grey...<br />Christian. Oh dear. How should I phrase this? Christian is kind of a jerk. A hot jerk, but a jerk nonetheless. But as the story progresses, you realize that his life has not always been so elegant and fruitful. With a childhood like his, it's understandable why he is so closed off and pushy. Becoming so successful at such a young age hasn't lessened his traumatic childhood memories but it has shaped him into a confident (mostly) and self-indulgent man. He knows what he wants and he takes it without a backward glance. He just so happens to want Ana. Her exterior screams submissive, and Christian can't help but want to entertain his dark desires with her. He is a dominate in every way, and he can't wait to exert his power over the lovely, innocent Ana. But Christian starts to feel more for the young woman. He wants her like no other and might just change his wicked ways to keep her close. But can he ever get over his past? Can he be the man Ana needs?<br /><br />Forbidden...<br />I had so much fun watching Ana and Christian's relationship build. It had more ups and downs than any other relationship I have ever read about. They both know what they want, but neither can give the other the kind of relationship they hope for. I also like the questions Fifty Shades of Grey brings up. Should one change in order to satisfy their significant other? What are the limits in which one should explore sexually? Is being dominated or wanting to dominate a bad thing? I can see why this book intrigues so many people. There really isn't another book like it out there. It's naughty, it's rough, it's heart breaking, and it's dazzling. It takes us to places we are not use to exploring but interest us nonetheless. We all wonder about the forbidden, and here, in this book, we get to explore those fantasies safely behind the pages of a book.<br /><br />Flawed Yet Beautiful...<br />Ana and Christian are not perfect characters. They annoy us, they make us cringe, and they make us want to scream. But they also beguile us with their uniqueness. They are so flawed, they become beautiful. I almost felt honored to witness the journey they took together. James has written a story that draws us in and doesn't let go until the very last word. I was emotionally exhausted by the end, which can only attest to the fact that this book is a must read.<br /><br />The Bad<br />I have two big complaints. There really wasn't much of a plot. The relationship between Christian and Ana, their ups and downs, that's the plot. That's it. It still kept my interest, but as a writer it made me cringe. Also, the writing was just okay. It was a little corny, it was often repetitive, and it wasn't up to par considering some of the amazing authors out there. But I often got lost in the story and simply didn't care about the amateur writing after a little while.<br /><br />The Bad but Good...<br />I would like to mention that yes, Ana was a little too insecure, a little too \\"innocent,\\" and an overall pushover. And Christian was domineering, aggressive, rude, and an overall asshat most of the time. But it was the flaws in the characters that I loved. So though this may bother many people, I found it refreshing to read about characters so overly imperfect.<br /><br />The Snuggly<br />This book is not so much about romance but about sexual awakening. It can get romantic, but mostly we got hot sex with some kink. Surprisingly, I didn't think the BDSM was that extreme. Christian may have his playroom, with sex toys galore, but we never get too deep into the kinky sex. We get spanking (not just with a hand), bondage, stuff like that, but I was never uncomfortable reading about it. I'd label this more of an erotic romance instead of erotica--which tends to have more aggressive sexual language and no holds barred sex. Frankly, the most squirm-worthy moment was when Ana reads the contract for her to become Christian's submissive. Yikes. I had a good laugh though.<br /><br />Overall<br />Some of you are going to love this book, some of you are going to hate it. All I suggest is going into this book with an open mind. Don't let either bad or good reviews sway your opinion. Just try it out for the sake of reading such a controversial book. Read this book for the engrossing story...and for the naughtiness. It was fun, it was thrilling, and it was HOT. You can't miss out. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Quotes<br />\\"Your stepfather?

B005LAIIQC|3.0|Apparently not as we keep paying to see them.  And you're going to get a couple of them in this movie with the likable stars Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross and Rachel Weisz as Dr. Shearing doing the running as the big, bad secret government agency tries to track them down and kill them.  Renner, an engaging actor who has shown some chutzpah in a variety of movies including \\"The Town\\", \\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\\", and \\"The Hurt Locker\\", does not play a copycat Bourne here.  Renner's Cross character has his memories and knows who he is and rather likes himself; he's also capable of making his own moral choices.  As such he floats above the proceedings here.  Gone is the jigsaw fuzzy puzzle of finding out his identity which made the original Bourne and it's sequels sharply compelling.  In its place is Cross' need to get his hands on a drug that will keep his mind sharp and he saves Weisz's Dr. Shearing so that the two become a team and accomplish this mission.  But there isn't any real saving the day here as it is about saving the man; it's Bourne lite actually.  It's got a lot of action and some moments of intensity and you can follow it (as it jags back and forth a few times with memory revelations the main story seems to be taking place and progressing as the other Bourne actions were taking place) but there is a lot of throwaway references to Treadstone and Blackbrier and such by a lot of good actors in board rooms that amounts to essentially a bunch of talking heads repeatedly telling us how critical it is to stop the public from finding out the big, bad secrets.  Gone is the dogged determination of the Pamela Landy character's determination to find the truth and the truth here is that the film suffers for it.  Renner gives some cool and light humor touches to his uber-agent and is the real reason to see this film but it does pale in comparison to the Damon outings.  And that, my friends, is the honest to Bourne truth.  3.5 stars, at least for its pedigree.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I remember seeing the commercials for this years ago and thinking that it would be dumb.  I'm rarely wrong in those judgments, but I was on this one.  This movie was not very formulaic, not just copying any previous genre.  It did combine a little bit of Beowulf and a little bit of The 13th Warrior, but it was original in other things and the acting and story and dialogue were good.  This was a really good action adventure movie.
0307387178|3.0|A dreamer goes on an adventure into Alaska and pays a heavy price for his stupidity. The story was written well enough--except for all the fluff in the middle to turn a magazine article into a book--but the subject matter had me scratching my head. A kid throws away a life that most of would want and meanders like a modern day hobo up to Alaska and dies of starvation. Why was this glorified? Yes there is an adventurer in all of us, but the way he completely changed--as if he was embarrassed about his privileged upbringing was grating. It seemed to me that the author tried to get us to believe that there is some sort of nobility in poverty.

030758836X|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008WBHA9S Cheer: A Novel]], I am thoroughly impressed with what Gillian Flynn has done in Gone Girl.  She's created two wildly unlikeable characters and yet somehow managed to get the reader to root for them (or at least one of them, depending on your perspective).  She's done an excellent job portraying seemingly normal but actually sociopathic people, subtly drawing that very fine line between the two.  I finished this clever (and sometimes disturbing) book days ago and yet I can't stop thinking about it.

145162607X|4.0|In The Kingmaker's Daughter, Gregory explores the changing fortunes of sisters Isabelle and Anne Neville, daughters of Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. The powerful Warwick is the man behind Edward IVs ascension to the throne of England, the earl harboring plans to wed his daughters to the king's brothers, George of Clarence and Richard of Gloucester. But when the handsome Edward weds Elizabeth Woodville without consulting Warwick, a conflict brews between the competing interests of the Neville's and the ambitious Woodville family. Elizabeth Woodville reigns at her husband's side, her family voraciously feeding on the king's largesse, while Warwick plots rebellion. As Isabelle is wed to George of Clarence, a union which brings her in close orbit with the court, Anne is married to Edward, son of Margaret of Anjou, who has joined forces with Warwick in an effort to unseat Edward IV. Defeat in battle, both Edward and her father's deaths leave Margaret and Anne at the mercy of the king.<br /><br />Held hostage by those who would have her fortune, Anne becomes a pawn. It is this woman, without father or champion, who makes her way in an indifferent world, at the mercy of others and with few choices. When Richard steps forward to rescue the girl he has known since infancy, marriage offers Anne the safety otherwise denied her. Learning life's painful lessons through one struggle after another, Anne loves Richard and trusts him to protect her interests, even when confronted by unpalatable truths carefully shielded by a spouse who is a nimble politician. Anne can no longer doubt her husband's shrewdness: \\"I knew my husband was a hard man, but I did not know he was granite.\\"As the mother of a son, Anne is content, though continuously assaulted by the demands of a mother who once coldly abandoned her to Margaret of Anjou. It is a tumultuous time, when alliances crumble and betrayals determine the fate of war.<br /><br />While Gregory doesn't ascribe the deaths of the Princes in the Tower to Richard, neither does she shirk from a realistic portrayal of a man who loves his wife, but is acutely conscious of the advantages of their marriage. Anne's son, frail since birth, slips quietly into death, taking his mother's spirit with him. Watching her husband become enchanted by Woodville's beautiful daughter, Elizabeth, must have been excruciating for a grieving mother, but Anne suffers in silence, her dignity unimpeachable in the face of a curious and spiteful court. Haunted by suspicion of a curse on her family by Elizabeth Woodville and rumors of poison, Anne hovers between life and death, even as Richard's most ambitious goal nears fruition. Filled with rage at the betrayals she has endured, Anne turns a placid face to the world as she dies, Richard facing his fate alone on the battlefield.

0739352989|3.0|Very slow start. How much can you say, \\"Oh my!\\"?? The sex gets boring after awhile but hidden when you get past the \\"necessary\\" sex is a pretty good story. If I were reading it book-form, I would have skipped through most of the sex looking for the story. However, I listened to it on CD while driving, so endured. Also, e-mails in detail, i.e., to, from, get annoying.

B0063IH60K|2.0|While solitare is a fun game, playing this gets to be a nuisance, as each game is preceded by a commercial, often a 30 second video ad that you have to listen to before it enters you into a new game. Sometimes you have the option to click on skip, but mostly not. For that reason, I don't play it often. I realize that business needs ad revenue to support programs, but this is way overdone. Force me to see an add about every five games or so, and I'd accept that. But this diversion for me is not worth playing the game. I'd rather buy a game program outright.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|This is a really great game. It's visual novel style like the Phoenix Wright series, but much more serious, and mature. It's really a great game with multiple endings, and choices to make, but it falls a bit short in the length department. I beat it the first time in one day. However since you can't get the best ending in one play through you're more than likely to play through the game more than once. The puzzles require a bit of thought, and if you can't figure them out plenty of hints are given out to you.  It's a really great game, and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a serious visual novel style game.

1401937519|5.0|Prior to purchasing this book, I had not seen the PBS TV show in which the author and her NDE were discussed. So, other than a friend's recommendation and the book's description on Amazon.com I really didn't have any deep insight into the work. As a person interested in spirituality, I have read other books that referenced NDEs, so I had some exposure to the concept. With that said, I have to say that I really enjoyed this work, as I found it to be both thought-provoking and compelling. I resonated with much of what the author shared, and really feel that what she wrote truly came from her heart. Based on my spiritual study, I particularly agreed with her contention that \\"this life\\" is every bit as important as any \\"after-life.\\"<br /><br />My 5 Star rating for this work comes with a couple of qualifications: First, that \\"Dying to be Me\\" is a book ideally suited for people who are on a spiritual path as opposed to a religious path. So, if you strongly identify yourself as, for example, a fundamentalist Christian or a Muslim, it would probably be best that you not even consider reading this book as some of its content could disappoint you, or you could choose to be offended by it. Second, based on reading some of the negative reviews, it's apparently not a book for people who are seriously interested in the science of NDEs, as a few reviewers pointed out that in their experience what she went through didn't even qualify as an NDE. In my view such comments suggest that the readers were more interested in the mechanics of the experience as opposed to the overarching lessons she learned from it.<br /><br />Here's one of my favorite passages in the book:<br /><br />\\"Sweeping statements such as \\"Negative thoughts attract negativity in life\\" aren't necessarily true, and can make people who are going through a challenging time feel even worse. It can also create fear that they're going to attract even more negativity with their thoughts. Using this idea indiscriminately often makes people going through seemingly tough times feel as though they're bad for attracting such events, and that's just not true. If we start to believe that it's our negative thoughts that are creating any unpleasant situations, we can become paranoid about what we're thinking. On the contrary, it actually has less to do with our thoughts than with our emotions, especially what we feel about ourselves.<br /><br />It's also not the case that attracting positive things is simply about keeping upbeat. I can't say this strongly enough, but our feelings about ourselves are actually the most important barometer for determining the condition of our lives! In other words, being true to ourselves is more important than just trying to stay positive!\\"n makes people going through seemingly tough times feel as though they're bad for attracting such events, and that's just not true.

1400032717|2.0|My librarian picked this out for me. I wanted to read and finish it within a couple days. I was happy with the way it looked and I had read a couple reviews on here. Four stars. That isn't too bad--every book can't be five. But, I didn't even finish it.<br />  I was really interested because it had an autistic guy and I haven't looked into autism as much as I should. Another thing, it seemed like just a quick novel I could fly through. Fast summer book. Right? Wrong. That didn't happen.<br />  I was really into the first three chapters, got to around page 80, and then called it quits. The book really didn't pull me in like I thought it would. None of the characters grabbed my attention and I wasn't laughing or yelling at any of them in my head like I usually do in books.<br />  I really don't have much critique about the writing style or the point of view. It was smooth enough. But the plot could have been a little more...well just more of a plot. What I thought was the main plot (the murder of the dog) dragged on a little more than it should have, being as slow and tedious as it was. It's the title and all! Then, low and behold, it totally switches halfway through and goes into his messed-up family business. My only real thought that I had about Christopher (the guy with autism) was \\"poor kid\\".<br />  So, that's my two-cents on this book. I'm glad if it was your thing, I'm just saying I'm disappointed it wasn't mine.

0345803485|4.0|I put the book in iBooks, cause I thought Amazon  couldn't get it to me fast enough. Barnes and noble was out of it. Oh my! I became interested in reading it after a discussion in a meditation group I attend. The subject came up. I went home and downloaded the book.<br /><br />I love Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. This is not the type of book I would read. I am a total Kerouac fan. To say I am obsessed with Christian Grey  and Anastasia is correct. Yet  I laugh at the writing-sub degree of talent. Holy crap, I love the story line which if you go to Wikipedia and type in 50 shades, the book is there in 3 paragraphs, including the end which is brutally boring. I am not quite at the end. I liked it so much I ordered the trilogy.<br /><br />By now you know, Christian and Ana meet in an odd situation, and their dark relationship grows. Go to Wikipedia if you want to know more. Christian has a grey side, hense the 50 Shades title. He has an enjoyment of BDSM. Oh my! A contract is written, very detailed....which drove me friggin nuts cause it's repeated about 8 pages later, or so, word for word. I am saying this cause it will drive you crazy! Holy crap it will make you pull your hair out.<br /><br />I love the book, but the sex scenes are just that. Real terms are used, and occasionally Brittish slang appears multiple times. Referring to a female region sometimes, as, \\"my sex.\\" seriously? That term makes me scream. Ana tends to over think things as any woman would do in her situation. There are times when I can't imagine a man doing that to me. But Christian wines  and dines her. That is what I love. The sex isn't brutal, it's good, but I have read a couple of porn books. The terms, we know them, body parts, I was surprised that no slang was used. Possibly I was turned off. The word butt plug made me laugh. The leg stiffening made me scream. The twitching, if not over used, is an appropriate verb. I do believe the phrase \\"oh my\\" and \\"holy crap\\" is overkill.<br /><br />This book became what it is through over hyped media. Imagine the storyline without the sex. It wouldn't be touched. Yet I read it nonstop. I believe the book is liberating for certain women. It's boring porn, and it's romance. I can't ever imagine me picking up a romance novel. I would never consider this a romantic novel. It is what it is. Some people are content shocked cause they've not been made aware of porn novels. I finally got bored with the sex, by the way.<br /><br /> And oh my, it is good. But not that good. But Christian Grey is extremely hot, but has dark moods. He buys Ana a car, MacBook, Blackberry, and birth control pills. If I had a guy who would buy me a car, I would be smitten. She talks to her inner goddess, I suppose that is her higher self? Her inner goddess appears as often as Kate, her roommate. At first I liked the inner goddess, now i kind of roll my eyes at the term. (Rolling my eyes, don't tell Christian, I don't like his punishment).I love the book despite its drawbacks. Christian Grey with his wealth and his giving side, that is the fantasy of a boyfriend for many women. His dark side is what makes the book interesting. I hope he returns again, after reading the second and third book, which I have no idea the content of. But holy crap, leave the poor grammar and repeats aside, please!<br /><br />Update: 08/16/2012: I finished the book last night, and the ending hung me up on Christian's helicopter in mid air, literally. I felt cheated by the ending. I also glanced at Wikipedia. I don't suggest doing that. The story line is complete there, including the ending. The ending was a marketing genius for the author. Glad I have the series. I already started book 2./>This book became what it is through over hyped media. Imagine the storyline without the sex. It wouldn't be touched. Yet I read it nonstop.

B002VL1CIU|4.0|I absolutely  love and adore the 4 other books I own from these authors. However, today I set out to make Mexican chocolate snickerdoodles (from the KINDLE). The batter was like frosting, it called for 2/3 cup flour stating once mixed it would be a pliable dough. I knew something was off so I began adding some more flour without much success. Finally I remembered to check out ppk for I knew that recipe was listed. It called for 1 and 2/3 cups flour. This was a simple fix. But I'm weary of other recipes now from this kindle book. Fortunately I got this copy from the library.<br /><br />I will not purchase the kindle edition! But will prob get the actual book. The other recipes truly sound delicious but this needs fixed!

B000LB7G00|4.0|I purchased the SpaceNavigator to speed up navigation in Google Sketchup. It certainly does that very well. Without the 3d mouse, you use a standard mouse to navigate through a model, but it's very slow and choppy. Not at all natural. With the SpaceNavigator, you tilt, twist, lift, press, push, and pull the device to navigate the model in three dimensions. It's a very natural way to operate, and makes navigation much faster. If I only consider the operation of the device and its fit with the application, I'd rate it 5 stars.  But installation was problematic.<br /><br />I first installed the latest driver from the 3Dconnexion site (3DxMacWare version 1.7.2). It simply didn't work. No matter what I did, the device didn't respond--in any application.  I then installed the \\"beta\\" 3DxWare drivers (version 10 beta 6), and I was able to get the device to work with Google Earth. But it still didn't work in Sketchup.  After doing some research online, I found that the \\"3DxSketchUp\\" directory was missing from the Sketchup plugins directory.  I created the directory, and added the content of the 3DxSketchUp.bundle.plugin package (found in the plugins directory) to the 3DxSketchUp directory, restarted Sketchup, and it worked.  There have been reports of slow performance with the device in Sketchup, and it seems to be related to the complexity of the model. My models are relatively small and simple, and I haven't seen the problem yet.<br /><br />So if you're looking to improve Sketchup navigation, the SpaceNavigator may be the right choice. Just be ready to experience some installation pain.

This is the one book that I can say has been the most pivotal in making actual improvements to my pictures and skills. It teaches you about everything with an emphasis on exposure, because it really is a huge part of a good photograph.<br /><br />Yes you can tweak almost anything with a RAW file and good software, but it is so much more satisfying (not to mention less work) when you start with a correct exposure right from the original file.<br /><br />Beyond exposure, Bryan's detailed lessons/ideas on Depth of Field and aperture will really make you think when composing a shot and help you become a truly better photographer who understands everything that goes into their pictures.

0553801473|2.0|This was a lousy book. The plot barely advanced, favorite characters turned into \\"please kill them off now\\" types, the faked deaths reached an absurd level, to the point where no one will believe anyone killed off is actually dead until they are being eaten...<br /><br />Aside from the terrible editing and the whole Dany thing, this is three stars. I will not be buying the next book without learning that it is significantly better.
B004KA9VGA|2.0|Being a huge Kindle reader I thought I'd better start contributing reviews, something I have never done in the past. To the point - this novel went no where, very slowly. It's a very competitive field to delve into - witches / vampires etc etc - so you had better bring something new to the genre or have a crackin' story to separate your book from the 1000's of other books that have plied this genre before you. Unfortunately this book did not managed to achieve on either front. Derivative rubbish.
0061714402|5.0|Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir,  This book rocks, I can't put it down,  it's a great read. I love all the history, behind the scenes, personal stuff, the stories are great. what a journey he's been on, amazing he's still alive and rockin'.  Love IT !!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|hummmm, what can i say?  A bit too much trash talk, but otherwise, it certainly wasn't what i expected.  I like murder mysteries and that's what I thought i was getting.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|This is great fantasy and I if had read this when I was 15 I would have loved it. Now it is just a bit too much.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Okay, everybody.  Let's just get one thing out of the way.  Did anybody SERIOUSLY went to see this movie for the intriguing plot, the complex character development, and the stupendous acting chops?  I hate to say this, but if you did, you're delusional!<br /><br />Just watch the trailer.  Most trailers advertise exciting plot, character development, suspense, blah, blah, blah.  This one blatantly claimed that the whole point was that the movie features REAL Navy SEALs.  What does that say to you?<br /><br />Having said all of that, I will be fair and state for the record that, yes, it is now a fact that Navy SEALs cannot act for their life.  But if you think about it, wouldn't you be kind of worried if real SEALs actually CAN act?  What does that say about what they're doing with their time?<br /><br />Yes, one does have to be somewhat familiar with the SpecOps community, and the military in general, to understand all the dialogue.  But come on!  People can have an entire conversation with most military personnel in nothing but acronyms...and we're not even counting the military elite!<br /><br />At the end of the day, I was promised real Navy SEALs.  They delivered on their promise because all signs point to the fact that those guys are the real deal, not a bunch of professional actors posing and pretending.  Ergo, I'm perfectly happy with what I got.  OMG!  For once, we get to see the Teams do their real stuff, not some Hollywood fairy-land make-believe.  What more do you people want?<br /><br />BTW:  I do feel a little bit jibbed because I thought we were promised EIGHT SEALs.  Well, I only counted seven.  What happened to the eight one?  Oh wait, I forgot.  He's probably been shipped off to Afghanistan to get shot at.

1469984202|3.0|\\"Wool\\" is a collection of five stories depicting a dystopian society struggling to survive after some kind of holocaust.<br /><br />The early stories in the collection are short and end in major cliffhangers. As the story unfolds, we learn more about the society, and the secret a select group of people keep from everyone, which we are led to believe is for their own good. The reader will need to decide if the motives were valid.<br /><br />The conclusion brings about a stopping point in the story, but it is open-ended leaving room for the author to continue, which is alluded to at the end of book five.<br /><br />Overall, I found the stories enjoyable, but I didn't see anything magical/special that others rave about.

030758836X|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book, based on the reviews, and at first I enjoyed it.  By the time I got to Part 2, I was so disgusted by how neurotic and pathetic Nick and Amy were, I quit reading.  The book does have an interesting plot and is well written, but the main characters are so unsympathetic that I totally quit caring about what happened to either of them.  He's a pathalogical liar and she's a psychopath - all I can say is that they totally deserve each other.

0441020712|4.0|I am an Alastair Reynolds fan boy. I have read every book and novella Reynolds has written (including novellas like [[ASIN:1596061847 The Six Directions of Space]]). In all of these books, I don't think that Alastair Reynolds has ever written a bad book. Nor is Blue Remembered Earth a bad book. But it is a book without the drive of a strong plot or any real suspense.<br /><br />Reynolds has written some books with strong plot drive. For example, one of his most memorable characters is Scorpio, a \\"hyper-pig\\" who features in the plots of Redemption Ark and Absolution Gap in the Revelation Space books. Coupled with strong characters, there is plot suspense (how will the Inhibitors be defeated, among other things).<br /><br />The drive and suspense of the Revelation Space books is almost entirely missing in Blue Remembered Earth. We have the story of a wealthy and somewhat dysfunctional African family and a tour through a imagined future. The tour through the future takes the form of imagining how the future will work out, along with various ideas like \\"Panspermia\\" (an ideological drive to seed the galaxy with life).<br /><br />Reynolds' experimentation with ideas is one of the things that makes his fiction so good. But when the experimentation with ideas is devoid of any strong plot elements, we're left with a sort of \\"Tomorrow Land\\" imagined by a sophisticated version of Walt Disney.<br /><br />There are also some strange plot elements. Some critical information, apparently from aliens, is scratched in rock. We never really learn much about this, nor oddly, do the characters in the novel speculate much. Was this some kind of graffiti left by aliens passing through? If it was more than Kilroy Was Here, why was the information not embedded in synthetic diamond or metal? Perhaps it was the equivalent of aliens writing on a white board or a napkin (one alien says to another, \\"see, it works out like this...\\"). Yet the characters never find this strange.<br /><br />There is, of course, a plot in Blue Remembered Earth, but it meanders along. Apparently there will be at least three books in the Poseidon's Children books. It almost feels like there is the plot of one novel diluted in three books.<br /><br />In short, Blue Remembered Earth is not a bad read, but it is not the best that Reynolds has been capable of. Being a Fan Boy, I will certainly buy the other books, but I'll be doing this in the hope that we have less \\"tour of tomorrow\\" and more plot and suspense.<br /><br />Later: I just bought [[ASIN:0575090456 On the Steel Breeze]] by Alistair Reynolds, so I am rereading Blue Remembered Earth. The lack of suspense didn't bother me the second time through. In fact, on a second reading I'm not sure why I found that it lacked suspense the first time I read it. Perhaps this was in comparison to Reynold's other books where, among other things, genocidal artificially intelligent self-reproducing automata threaten the human race. On the basis of the second reading, I added another star, since I liked the book more the second time. Perhaps I had a chance to appreciate the book more. Or perhaps it's because I'm different now.<br /><br />I did notice one thing that I had not noticed the first time: The West (the United States and Europe) appear very little in the story. There are a few passing mentions about the European Union, but the major nations are the African Union, China and India, among the terrestrial \\"dry land\\" nations. Perhaps this is meant to emphasize the rise of Africa, but it is difficult to imagine the disappearance of the United States entirely from the world stage.

0547564651|4.0|In How Children Succeed, author Paul Tough offers a wealth of research studies as well as a close examination of specific programs designed to help children reach their potential. Along the way, he discovers that key traits such as persistence, self-control, curiosity, and that elusive quality known as \\"grit\\" might actually be more crucial for success than getting good grades. The author also makes the case that avoiding failure isn't always desirable. In fact, taking risks and weathering disappointments can actually help develop the resilience and strength needed to build a solid path in life.<br /><br />Besides sharing his own account of dropping out of college, Tough includes the personal story of a young woman named Kewauna who seemed to have the odds stacked grimly against her. She not only grew up poor and in turmoil but hated school, struggled to read, and spent plenty of time in homeless shelters as a child. Her life seemed destined to go downhill...but it didn't. How and why Kewauna - and the author - managed to change their lives provides insight into how lifelong learning occurs. They grew up in very different circumstances but had plenty in common.<br /><br />How Children Succeed swerves from the school of thought which focuses only on worksheets, tests, and cognitive training to help children excel. In fact, if Tough is right it turns out that academic success may actually be a small part of lifelong achievement. And what about those who decide to pursue a college degree? Learning how to handle challenges - bad grades, tough professors, fights with friends - could ensure students get through their classes and make it to graduation day. Again, academics may only be a small part of the picture. Character is what counts.<br /><br />Readers who decide to tackle this book shouldn't expect a step by step guide to developing their children's learning skills or critical personality traits. Instead, the research studies and personal accounts are focused on exploring why certain children fail and others succeed. I was enthralled by the information in this book but it wasn't a quick or easy read. I had to reread many sections to absorb terms like \\"allostatic load\\" (stress and how it is managed) and learn how these terms related to learning. Also, I wish there had been more concrete information about how parents, teachers, and others could help children, teenagers, and college students reach their potential.<br /><br />But How Children Succeed is a fascinating new way of looking at how children learn and a contrast to established methods of thought, especially those which stress intelligence as the defining factor for success in life. It is well worth taking the time to read.ring why certain children fail and others succeed. I was enthralled by the information in this book but it wasn't a quick or easy read.

B006LSZECO|3.0|After reading reviews in People Magazine and our local newspaper, I purchased and read this book.  Initially I found it a bit confusing with the jumping back and forth each chapter.  It wasn't until about half way through the book that things began to start taking shape for me - at that point I really began enjoying it.  I simply read for pleasure, so normally if my interest is not peaked right away, I don't continue reading - I'm glad I gave this book a bit longer chance. I still only gave it an average rating as I did find it quite predictable.  It is amazing to me the amount of deception and manipulation that can occur in a relationship and I find that sad.
1586487981|4.0|One of the most daunting obstacles economists and other social scientists face when observing the real world in an empirical way is a lack of control. It is notoriously difficult to establish randomized, controlled experiments in the real world, because unlike laboratory settings, the real world cannot be controlled by setting all conditions equal except for one, in order to measure the impact of that particular factor. There are serendipitous occasions when such randomized trials emerge through happenstance, but they are rare in the developed world, usually because no one has the patience to see them through. In \\"Poor Economics,\\" Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo summarize studies performed by various economists and social scientists, including themselves, of the developing world to see how the world's poorest make decisions, and whether various proposed solutions fit the data. They find that randomized and (somewhat) controlled experiments occur more naturally there, because NGOs, in particular, will often implement new ideas in a piecemeal fashion, establishing programs in some randomly-chosen villages but not others, and allowing for the observation of the effects of the programs. Along the way, they use anecdotal evidence to punctuate, but never override, the broader evidence of the empirical data. The stated purpose of the book is to treat the poorest people on earth like real people, who make decisions about how to spend their limited resources in ingenious and creative, but altogether human, ways.<br /><br />The book approaches the broader subject according to various specific problems, such as nutrition, education, access to capital, or political environment (to name a few). Along the way, they summarize various opposing views of the plight of the extreme poor in various countries, and try to examine the empirical data available to determine which views are more supported by the studies shown. The writing is generally clear and accessible, with very littlein the way of jargon or pointy-headed econ-speak. They don't really come down, overall, on one side or another (between rich world top-down intervention, on one hand, to a more market-based approach on the other), but explore different areas in which a particular approach might work to achieve some ends, but not others. There were many valuable insights to be gained, and lot ot be learned abut the true lives of the poorest among us.<br /><br />The one criticism i had for the book was an oversight that I felt manifested in a few different areas, but particularly in the later chapters on microcredit and entrepreneurship. The authors made some excellent points about the nature of most \\"entrepreneurs\\" in the poorest areas (who take up new businesses out of necessity and rarely grow them into anything lasting), as well as the highly risk-averse nature of microcredit and its limited penetration among the poor. However, they usually cited data that covered periods of three years or less- sometimes, a change would be instituted (in, say, access to cheaper credit) and they would look a the relatively small uptake from the poor over 18 months, and conclude that the impact wasn't as advertised. But of course, it takes time for cultural practices and comfort levels to change, and some of the habits and practices that exist across different countries and continents among the poor are not going to simply evaporate overnight due to a change in policies or capital availability. So it would be a mistake to abandon some ideas simply because they don't have a large measurable impact immediately. Overall, however, I felt that the insights to be gleaned from this book are well worth the time to read it, and at roughly 270 pages, it's a pretty quick and easy read.
0316023744|4.0|I will open by writing that I know very little about the Second World War. Well, I KNEW very little about the Second World War. After reading this book I now know a lot more. I'm not sure I'm happier for the knowing.<br /><br />I did not sit down and read this book through in one sitting. To be honest I've had it for several months and I read it chapter by chapter in between all of the other books I have read this summer. It was too much war for me to take all at once. That does not mean that it was a bad book - not at all! In fact it read beautifully. I just could not take all of that war all at once. I had to pace myself. So pace myself I did and I am a bit later with this review than I promised and I do apologize for that. But this is the first time I've really gotten into the nitty-gritty of WWII and well, it was a lot.<br /><br />The book discusses all of the battles on all of the fronts of the war. That is a LOT of battles. Mr. Beevor goes into detail about commanders, equipment and all that goes into what makes war and battles happen. I was woefully ignorant as to the Pacific end of WWII and now have a better idea of what the Japan/China side of the war was about.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me immensely though, was Mr. Beevor's treatment and descriptions of Hitler. He seemed to be treating him as a puppet rather than as the leader of the Reich. He never has Hitler fully taking charge of, or giving him responsibility for the Holocaust and to write a book about this war and to take Hitler off the hook for that horror is just egregious. I don't understand.<br /><br />I can't begin to write as to whether this is a definitive work on WWII as I have minimal knowledge of the facts as I stated earlier. I can state that it was easy to read, albeit a bit slow at times. I liked that I was able to learn so much as I was reading the book chapter by chapter as to increase my knowledge of this pivotal time in modern history.

0553582038|5.0|Frequently thrilling, these books are always utterly compelling and entertaining. Have just finished Feast, and decided to check these reviews to see what other people think, and I have to say I'm stumped as to how much time and words people seem willing to devote to nit-picking and facile pseudo criticism. So in the spirit of brevity not shared by either G.R.R. Martin (thankfully) or the other reviewers (for better or worse), I urge you to ignore the reviews and simply read this incredible book.

I'm in fairly good shape; My weekly program includes about 100K on my bike, 30K running and some weightlifting. I really worked up a sweat with this program. I use it as a warm-up for my runs, or do two levels in one session to get the maximum benefit. I think it's fun, and it adds an extra dimension to my training regime. I do it with different sets of weights, as my chest muscles are much stronger than my shoulder muscles, but I'm hoping this is the motivation I've been needing to get those shoulders in shape. I look forward to exploring Jillians other DVDs.

B004SBQGHS|2.0|So first off, 2 stars is for how Amazon has handled updates to this game.<br /><br />I've had my entire game progress wiped out by updates twice, and one of the \\"updates\\" was actually a downgrade. On top of that, these updates added nothing to the game whatsoever. I don't know if this is a problem with what Rovio is supplying Amazon, or something with Amazon's app store. Either way, it's completely unacceptable and people have good reason to be ticked off. I had this happen with Angry Birds Space as well (installation of \\"updates\\" = save game wipe).<br /><br />Although it's too late for those of you that have lost your save game data, I strongly suggest getting the app Angry Birds Backup (the app made by Sergio Patricio) from the Google Play store. I've been using the app regularly to backup my game saves to SD card. So when Amazon released their bugged \\"updates\\", I was able to recover my progress. It's ridiculous I have to use it for something other than catastrophic phone failure, but there you go. Also note, the save game backup app is free and I get nothing for suggesting it here... I share because I hate it when I lose progress on anything and am suggesting a workaround for Rovio/Amazon's issues.<br /><br />That said, the game itself is as fun as the other AB versions. You've got the fun levels, the quick levels, and the levels that make you want to throw your phone at the wall when you're trying to get all 3 stars. The additions of some of the goodies from Rio are nice, as well. More levels would be better, though. Good, cheap time wasting entertainment.

0743244249|1.0|I saw the movie trailer for David Cronenberg's movie Cosmopolis, based on DeLillo's novel of the same name. The trailer looked interesting. The main character is a young hedge fund manager. I have a fascination with finance and hedge funds. One person commented that the Cosmopolis movie seemed to capture William Gibson's esthetic, and I'm a Gibson fan. So I checked Cosmopolis out of the library.<br /><br />The beginning of Cosmopolis is all right. There are strange surreal elements, but that all right at first. As the novel proceeds, it completely falls apart and becomes unreadable. The plot goes beyond surreal into incoherent and pointless. After spending an evening reading Cosmopolis, I hated the book so much that I gave the hardcover copy of [[ASIN:B000V6695I Underworld]] that I had sitting on my book shelf, waiting to be read, to the library.<br /><br />I liked DeLillo's novel [[ASIN:0140156046 Libra]]. I think that DeLillo captured in fiction a semblance of what actually happened in history. But I have found everything else that I've tried to read by DeLillo unreadable. His novels follow the pattern of Cosmopolis: they start out all right and then veer into eye glazing, mind numbing, incoherence.<br /><br />I suspect that most readers would have the same reaction to DeLillo that I do. This can be seen in the distribution of the Amazon reviews, where as many people dislike DeLillo as like him. Still, Delillo's books like Underworld are greeted with favorable reviews. And he seems to sell well enough that publishers keep printing his work. And there are Amazon reviews who give DeLillo's books favorable reviews.<br /><br />To some degree I think that DeLillo's success is a scam. I did like Libra, but I bought Underworld because it had a literary reputation. There was a part of me that thought that reading the book would \\"broaden\\" my mind. I think that many book reviewers follow the same path. They feel that they can't savage DeLillo because he's a prominent author of literary fiction. If they write that he's incoherent people might think that the reviewer is not smart enough to understand DeLillo. Therein lies the scam. The truth is that DeLillo is incoherent and he seems incapable of writing the kind of novel that most people would want to read.<br /><br />There is a school of thought that great literature must be a lot of work to read. You have to work, the thinking goes, to understand the great thoughts and art of the great writer of literary fiction. University literature departments tend to be based on this idea. People who subscribe to this school of thought read (or claim to read) writers like Joyce, Pynchon and DeLillo.<br /><br />Perhaps this view is slogging and suffering through literature is popular in University Lit departments because learning science and mathematics is a lot of work. Any \\"serious\\" intellectual endeavor must be hard won. If literature were simply enjoyable recreation, who would take it seriously? Or pay professors to explain it to them.<br /><br />I have a different view of literature. There are vast numbers of books published every year. There are vast numbers of books that have been published in the past. In one lifetime I can read only a relatively small number of these books. If I want to work hard on a book, I'll read a book on computer science or mathematical finance. But I read fiction, history and current events for enjoyment. Recreational reading should be exactly that: recreation. Writers like DeLillo are at best a huge amount of work to read. I have no desire to slog through literary fiction. Especially when I think that it is reasonable to expect a gifted writer to write a coherent novel, with an interesting plot and characters. Delillo fails as far as I am concerned.<br /><br />For those of you who are Robert Pattinson fans, note that the New York Times review of the Cronenberg movie based on Cosmopolis mentioned that the movie closely follows the book. This suggests that you willsee a portrayal of the character Eric Packer getting a prostate exam, while his female colleague masturbates with a water bottle. In addition you can expect all of the bizarre and incoherent plot twists of the novel. So if your idea of a good movie is avant-garde European cinema, then this might be the movie for you. Otherwise, even R-Pat might not be worthwhile enough to justify sitting through this movie. I am certainly going to give it a pass.see a portrayal of the character Eric Packer getting a prostate exam, while his female colleague masturbates with a water bottle.

3551354014|4.0|If you are a native English speaker trying to hone your German reading skills, this is worth consideration.  I had previously read this story in English and Spanish and had seen excerpts from the French translation.  As German is my third language, it has taken some time to become familiar with all of the vocabulary, but given a basic understanding of the sentence structure and having read this story more than once in English, I found this a good exercise.  This was greatly facilitated by the fact that this translation is very close to the original English--probably the closest of the translations I've seen.  The book itself is also physically well-constructed (sturdy spine, intact pages, etc), unlike some comments I have read about other editions.  This would make a good addition to a German teacher's library or to any multi-lingual child's collection.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|\\"Sola Scriptura\\" is a religious progressive rock concept album revolving around the history of Martin Luther and his break from the Catholic Church.  The historical accuracy and point of view may be debated, but from a musical perspective this is a top notch Neal Morse album.  Morse explores a myriad of music styles on this disc and with the addition of guest guitarist Paul Gilbert even ramps up the metal quotient here and there.  A lot of the music on this one reminds me of Morse's early work with Spock's Beard with \\"The Light\\" album being a good reference point.  This album tells a story and is not biographical so the preaching aspect is a bit less here than on some of Morse's other discs.  For me this is a good thing, although people might not find his lyrics as emotionally stirring on this one.  I am not going to get into the debate regarding the religious aspects of the lyrics, since I am far from an expert on the subject matter.  Overall I think this is a very strong Neal Morse disc and ranks right up with the best he has done.
B007857FOO|4.0|I would like to give a review for this and Part 2<br />I am looking forward to watching Part 2 of this series at the movie theater as this is all about the Authors work (Stephanie Meyers) not the entertainers that portray it.<br />I liked the movie very much,  I applaud them for their deep dedication to portray these characters over and over again in the Movie.<br /><br />But maybe some day soon they can find a way to condense Part 1 & 2 together on One Dvd instead of 2?  that way we can give a better Review???
145162445X|1.0|This book is disorganized and self-flaunting. The author jumps around between theories, history of physics, and self-achievement, with no rhyme or reason. The content isn't terrible, but Krauss is a terrible writer. Unfortunately the book is also poorly edited - lots of gramatical mistakes. If he wrote the book with a flow to it (for instance... History and background >> New and exciting theories >> What he thinks about these theories) it could be good.<br /><br />Every 3 pages there's a line essentially saying \\"I said this 10 years ago and I was correct and everyone else was wrong\\".<br />The ending drops the reader like a sack of potatoes: \\"That's it?\\". Kind of like he got tired of writing and just asked \\"How can I wrap this up?\\".<br /><br />There are plenty of other physics books out there that are worth your money and give a deeper understanding of the direction the field is headed. And these other books are less writer-centric, and more subject matter relevant.<br /><br />Sorry. I truly did want to like this book, but couldn't do it.

B008ER9QKG|5.0|This cycle was not perfect. I would like to preface my review saying that, yes, this Ring cycle has flaws. Yet, it is a bold step into the future. The Met's new Ring Cycle has been incredibly controversial and there is some reasoning behind that. Many do not like the use of the \\"Machine\\" and feel that the set and blocking detract from rather than add to Wagner's epic. I disagree with these statements. For the vast majority of the Cycle, the machine is stationary. It transforms mostly (though not entirely) in the scene changes, where the orchestra does a nice job of hiding some of the mechanical noises. These scene changes often help to develop the story. I will point to the first scene change in Das Rheingold as an example. While the Otto Schenk production (the previous Met version) uses a veil of smoke to make the transition from the Rhein to Valhalla, the Lepage cycle is able to change and develop with the music and eventually comes to the Valhalla formation. I loved the boldness of this production and I feel that it adds a level of grandeur to the cycle. It is also incredibly important to note that this ring cycle is set, as Wagner intended, in the World of Wagner's creation. No attempt is made to change the story to fit a different setting as many companies have done lately. This is to the Met's credit, and this alone is deserving of my recommendation of this DVD.<br /><br />Secondly, the music. This is, of course, the most important element, and it is here that some of my complaints with this cycle lie. Granted that this is a live recording and that there is no such thing as a perfect ring cycle, I try to be generous, but I will still voice some of my concerns. Bryn Terfel plays the god Wotan. He does a fair job of this, but Wotan is the meatiest role in his repertoire (not that this is unusual in past Wotan interpreters). Still, he shows some fatigue by the end of Die Walkure and he occasionally seems to be fighting the orchestra more than most other Wotans do. Still, his lyric experience pays off and many of Wotan's most important melodies and moments are soaring and beautiful. Deborah Voigt is one of my favorite singers and I was ecstatic to hear her Brunhilde. She is an inexperienced portrayer of that role, which means that there is development that is yet to come. Still, her fresh interpretation was wonderful and I look forward to seeing how she changes her interpretation over the following years. Jay Hunter Morris's Siegfried had me really worried as I approached my favorite of the four operas, Siegfried. I watched his \\"Nothung\\" on youtube and was dismayed to hear him trying to sing it like it was Puccini, with focus on melodic line and a certain lack of Wagnerian power. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed his interpretation and loved the way that he developed the character. He was not a perfect Siegfried, but he gave a great cohesive performance. Stephanie Blythe is perhaps my favorite casting decision. Her Fricka is strong, independent and well developed. Her singing was spot on and I have no complaints. Jonas Kaufmann is a young tenor to be singing Wagner, but I was amazed at his interpretation of Siegmund. His characterization was perhaps a little indifferent for my taste, but I loved his interpretation overall. Eva-Maria Westbroek was a very good Sieglinde, but she did not meet the high standard set by Jessye Norman in the Met's last DVD. Her voice is appropriate for the role and well suited to sing with Jonas Kaufmann.I really enjoyed Eric Owen's Alberich, which was complex and as sympathetic as Alberich can be. His singing was beyond reproach. The entire cast lived up to a high standard and I was favorably impressed musically.<br /><br />One addition that I would like to make is that with James Levine's unfortunate health problems and Fabio Luisi taking the helm for the final 2 operas, the production gained a slight disjointed feeling and much of the development of the story was changed. The orchestra is the most important character in the Ring Cycle and every orchestra and every conductor approach this character differently. The unfortunate thing for us is that Levine's set up for the story is dark and brooding and full of symbolism (a spectacular interpretation), while Luisi's is more of a storyteller's interpretation, where the orchestra underscores the action and gives the characters room to breathe and come to fruition (another spectacular interpretation). The change from one to the other is my biggest problem with this DVD set. It is unfortunate, yet unavoidable.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I recommend this DVD set. It is a solid Ring Cycle and an approachable production filled with all of the music, adventure, excitement and intrigue that Wagner lovers have come to expect and demand.

0143037757|5.0|Postwar is a remarkable history of postwar Europe by Tony Judt.He admits to being free of an over-arching theory: \\"Fox-like Europe knows many things\\"His writing is remarkably free,concise,lucidand adheres largely to the postwar change to  social democracy,free markets,social welfare systems. He details the way America helped Europe after the war with aid programmes, but Europe increasingly pulled away into its own independent autonomy in its creation of the Common Market,then the European Community,especially in its reaction to the Russian occupation of eastern Europe. The European empires were largely shed and European countries contracted into their own continent. The two resultant great powers were USSR and America.  EC, a necessity,emerged like a phoenix from the ashes.<br /><br />Judt tackles the post-war recriminations against Nazism and Communism and the Holocaust,the former two the major ideologies of the 20th century,whose influence laid down the postwar stabilization of Europe.The initial period of silence,amnesia and people wishing not to dwell on the war or war crimes or their collaboration with Nazism,was followed by trials,written histories,education about the Holocaust, each country acknowledged  its anti-semitic guilt by building memorials to the  Jewish victims.We see the Germans through the unification becoming the powerhouse of Europe, after a period of Ostpolitik and expensive adjustments.EC freed Europe from any more wars.<br /><br />He tackles stepping-stones,1953 Berlin,1956 Hungary,1968 Czechozlovakia,glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union,1989 fall of the Berlin Wall,in the demolishment of Communism and the opening up of Russia to market economics,but not necessarily democracy,with its reserves of gas and oil to hold some sway over the European supplies.Krushchev's criticism of Stalinism led to a thaw. The Cold War began after the 1st WW,not after the 2ndWW. Gorbachev's follies in unleashing forces beyond his control and understanding.With 1989 there was the increasing desire of the post-Soviet  eastern Europeans to join the European Union to become part of civilised Europe.<br /><br />He covers the changes in the sixties,the fashions,music,ideological ferment of 68 and the terrorist organisations like the Baader-Meinhoff group and the Red Brigade.He deals with the post-authoritarian Mediterranean renaissance of Greece,Portugal and Spain in their entry into the EC. His  superb knowledge of European film,the New Wave,Cahier du Cinema,the literary movements and existentialist philosophy,the rise and fall of the French intellectual,its flirtation with Communism.<br /><br />Judt treats  the Catholic church in two ways:in Spain its seen as part of the ancien regime,holding back change, allying itself with Francoism,having exemption from taxation and state interference, allowed to censor any writing or speech to which it objected,with a conservative conflation of the church with national identity.To this it added a new cult of the dead,the `martyrs of the victorious side in the recent Civil War,memorial sites dedicated to victims of anti-clerical Republicanism.<br /><br />In Poland its resurgence comes with a Polish Pope who is charismatic and messianic,seeing the Church as the eastern frontier of the True Faith in its struggle against Eastern atheism and Western materialism;in martial Poland it was the pole of resistance.Allying itself with the non-Party free trade union movement and Solidarity.The idea of `practising society',building links with the Catholic Church,formed staging posts in the rebirth of civil msociety. Individuals like Walesa and Havel were essential to the re-emergence of freely-elected democracies,bound by law and civil codes in eastern Europe.<br /><br />He gives a formidable analysis of  the break-up of Yugoslavia,the Serbian-Bosnian conflict which I found clarified the events.He also gives a good picture of separatist movements like the Catholics  of northern Ireland,the Basques of northern Spain,the Flemish nationalists in Belgian Flandres,also the revolt of the Algerians against their French overlords.His analysis of the underground movements of West Germany,the link between extra-parliamentary politics and outright violence,equating American capitalism with Nazism via Marxist rhetoric,using remarkably Nazi-like methods, is astute.<br /><br />The European Community is multi-cultural as well as multi-religious,with some 15 million Muslims. How much should integration be forced or expected,when there is  a rise in demagoguery with immigration?A magnificent work with ground-breaking sweep and masterly analysis and synthesis of a lifetime. Europe might inherit the 21st century if this work's cautious optimism is anything to go by.This is an amazingly light read for such a weighty tome.An historian with impressive wit,style and intellectual courage,who in this book right up to the present chances in-built obscolescence and says the last word,reaching a journalistic objectivity,that no other tome that comes after will ever match.I was led to reading this by Hobsbawn's praise of Judt's legacy following his death.
030758836X|3.0|I had never read anything by Gillian Flynn (or even heard of Gillian Flynn), but the rapturous reviews this book received convinced me to give it a try.  This book started off very slow for me, and I really had trouble getting into it.  I was thoroughly hooked by the middle of the book, when things became much clearer (actually too clear for my taste).  I have to say, the resolution of a major part of the \\"mystery\\" in this story coming right in the middle of the book was disappointing for me.  After that point, I stayed interested a while, but characters were wavering all over the place, and it became just a game of how far one of the characters could go.  This constant game of kicking it up a notch eventually became tiresome for me, and the book ended up so utterly unrealistic that I was disappointed.  While it held my attention when I got into it, I was not satisfied with this story in the end, and the characters, while occasionally sympathetic, were, for the most part, very unlikeable.
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|I am not one to go into a song by song review of an album because different songs and audio aesthetics mean different things to different people. One thing is for certain with this album that Steve Vai is definitely seeming more in touch with his true inner self than has been the case in some of his previous releases. Honestly for me personally I was beginning to lose hope by the time True Reflections was released. It had started to seem that the quintessential VAI era was getting lost in time after Fire Garden...well OK maybe after Ultra Zone... Anyway, the point I am trying to make is that this album feels a lot like a true reflection (no pun intended) of his musical personality. There are elements in the album that remind me of good ol' Flexable...but remove the rawness of that early effort and add the slickness of Passion and Warfare coupled with the dramatic song-writing structures of Fire Garden and the outcome is Story of Light.<br /><br />After a few listens it is clear that the sonic fabric of the songs overall has a more atmospheric and surrounding feel to them. Talk about Weeping China Doll or Racing the World--> lots of delay on the lead guitar along with semi-80s poly synths make for a very \\"open\\" sound. The beautiful thing here is though that Vai is leaving no stone unturned in showing off his chops. Which is always a guitarists wet dream come true to hear new phrases and licks from this man that totally blow your mind. He does things unlike any other guitar player on this planet (sorry Petrucci, Greg Howe, Mr. Morse, Mr. Henderson you all are great too). I am not drawing a comparison but simply stating that there is only one Mr. Vai. And his playing all throughout this album beautifully shines through.<br /><br />One of my personal favorites on this album is Mullach A'tsi...a very reflective, sad yet oddly uplifting song replete in its strange life-giving energy that stems from something that sounds like a weeping sound of sorts (quite ironic). Exceptional use of volume control, wah and honey-nectar like tone that only a million dollar Vai rig can generate. Anyway, I digress....<br /><br />This album is a must buy for hardcore Vai fans. It has enough layers in it that you will peal off with each new listen. The only reason I give this album 4 stars and not 5 is because as much as it is \\"return to form\\"....and as much as the chops are incredible...and song-writing dynamic and dramatic, it is also a very much like a scene from a memory (:-P) making for a very predictable Vai. A Vai that I have already heard in huge, original doses all over Passion, Sex, Flexable and Ultra Zone. Its almost like I am craving for Vai to blow my mind just as in he did when he came out with Passion for the first time or even Fire Garden. Or how Dream Theater blew our minds when they came up with Train of Thought or Scenes from a Memory...or how Messhuggah destroyed the math metal prog world by releasing Obzen....or how Opeth mesmerized the prog metal world with Watershed and Heritage. I guess you folks get the point. Again, the point I am trying to make is that this is good Vai...this album is excellent Vai...but this is an all too familiar Vai that I have heard and experienced a number of times before.<br /><br />Am I happy with the familiarity? Of course yes...after all it is Vai. And only he can play and write songs like Vai. But was I hopeful for an album to be in someways ground breaking, different yet game changing? A-B-S-O-L-U-T-E-L-Y Yes!!!!! And I feel that the latter just did not happen with this album. I don't feel disappointed...just a little unfulfilled because for Vai heavy lies the crown since only he is one of the miniscule group of virtuosos who have set expectations and standards so high that an audience has no option but to expect to be blown away every time he so much as even farts a note out of his guitar (don't know how one does that but I hope you see what I am getting at). And once again I feel that the album sounded very familiar and return-to-formish...but it also didn't make me feel that I explored or discovered new horizons of Vai's capabilities. It was revisiting a new version of old stuff.<br /><br />That is my take on this album my friends. In spite of all that I still have given it 4 stars and think that it is a GREAT album. For true Vai fans I ask you to please listen to it and think about all the places where you hear uncannily close elements of Rescue me or Bury Me, or Liberty or Sisters or Crying Game.... you will find that that indeed is the case. Not that its a bad thing.... it's just...a little un-fulfilling.
B007SNMYNS|3.0|The author makes some good points, but to cut wheat out completely (unless you're gluten intolerant), at least to me, is a little too extreme. I suppose a book like this could be written about any substance. If you want to find fault with a given food item, even a vegetable, you're guaranteed to find a study - even a whole movement - somewhere to back up your claim. And if you want to follow his guidelines to the letter, you can kiss your social life goodbye, as well as any chance of ever eating out again. Many of his points are helpful, however, such as the case made for genetic modification, our culture's obsession with wheat, it's effects on blood sugar & obesity, and how food companies add wheat where it's not even needed to stimulate more hunger (profit). It was worth the read, for these reasons alone. I'm thankful to Dr. Davis for the information, and I've already begun to make some changes in my eating habits.
B008BRC6NS|2.0|Hits? I have never even heard of some of these songs until this CD. My favorites are \\"If You Had My Love\\", \\"Love Don't Cost a Thing\\", and \\"Waiting for Tonight\\" which are all on my NOW CDs anyway, but I thought I'd give this album a try since I've never owned any of her CDs. Most of the songs feature a rapper which is fine, but MOST songs. Does she really need to do the same type of songs over and over again? I agree with other reviewers that the sound quality of this CD isn't the best either. And this CD frustrated me. I don't know what it is but this NEW factory sealed CD would not play in my car CD player well. It kept showing an error and ejecting it over and over. My NOW CDs never do that so it is NOT my player. I got tired of this CD very quick. Maybe in Jr. High it would have been a favorite, but not now, in my 20s.

B000JJRIP2|5.0|Just got in KISS Alive 1975-2000 box set. Have been looking forward to getting this ever since I learned that both of the first live albums are on one disc each instead of the normal 2-disc spread. Had an opportunity to listen to both<br />Alive! & Alive II last evening. Below is my take on what I've heard so far.<br /><br />So this is going to be a sort of review on KISS Alive! 1975-2000 box set<br />For Alive! & Alive II:<br /><br />I read a review on Amazon where someone talked about the sonics of the set. They stated that Alive! & Alive II sounded even better than the remaster editions of those albums. So I was aware of that before hand.<br />I had a tracking notice in my email so I knew the set would arrive in the mail yesterday.<br /><br />Was really anxious to get home after work and sit down and relax and `Get KISSed!'. So that's exactly what I did. The set is used but looks almost new. Came with the hard clear plastic cover with the extra content sticker on the front and the 75 page booklet.<br /><br />So I throw in Alive! slouch down on my couch and dig in.<br />Well it's true the sonic range has been tweaked. Alive! Now has balls it never had before. Now I have the original pressing vinyl, later pressings also, original pressing CD plus the remaster CD not to mention cassette and even 8-track versions of the album. I have converted it to MinDisc, DAT and even Reel to Reel Tape. I have listened to it just about every way you could possibly do so!<br />I guess what I'm trying to say here is if your any kind of KISS fan like you I know this album top to `Rock Bottom'!<br /><br />So the bass has been improved, actually I think the entire frequency range has been improved with focus on the bass frequencies in particular.<br />So I have it cranked peaking at about 30 watts per channel running through my 500 watt amp and 4 Mach Two three way speakers all with 15\\" woofers.<br /><br />The kick drum and bass are going through the floor up to the couch and rattlingme. I have a lot of albums that can accomplish this giving the right volume. Alive! as we both know it sounds good as it stands in it's original non-tweaked form.<br />Alive! always sounded good on either system I played it on as it was. I have always favored my front room system even though my bedroom setup is no slouch. I never thought it could be improved in any way, but I have to say this new version is a winner in my book.<br />Even with the sonic improvement the bass does not dominate or drown out the rest of the music. It's well balanced and done right in the midst of the `loudness wars' that's been going on in the CD industry for years.<br /><br />Most notably on Alive! is Peter's drum solo in `100,000' years and the explosions in `Black Diamond' even though we know they were added to the mix to make them more present. It will still kick you in the gut, Hard!<br /><br />The real kicker here is the fact that they have almost seamlessly edited the entire concert into one long complete uninterrupted set. So now the only fade-ins and fade-outs you experience are at the beginning of the album with J.R. Smalling's intro and then at the end of `Let Me Go Rock and Roll'.<br />So not only does it sound better and now kicks you straight away in the face and chest as never before it immerses you like never before because of the non stop assault on your ears and senses. The only time there is the slightest distraction is the flanger effect used on the audience between `Black Diamond' and `Rock Bottom'. Where before there was a fade out and then a fade back in now there is an almost seamless edit that splices all that together without any fade at all.<br /><br />As I was listening and really enjoying the experience I kept waiting for the first fade out after `Firehouse' and the fade in to `Nothin' To Lose' but it just kept going and going.<br />I got it then! That was a real surprise. I had no idea, I never read that about this release.<br /><br />Alive II:<br /><br />Sothis new box set version of Alive II is much in the manner of Alive!.<br />The overall frequencies have been tweaked. Alive II already had a great sonic range as it was so it's been tweaked ever so slightly here.<br />It does sound better but Alive! now has more balls than Alive II when before that was the opposite.<br /><br />Alive II does benefit from the tweak here but Alive! is the true winner in my book.<br />Once again they have seamlessly edited the fades on Alive II as well.<br />Making for another immersive uninterrupted experience until the studio cuts of course.<br />The added bass frequencies really make themselves known and more prevalent on `Larger Than Life', `Rocket Ride' and even `Any Way You Want it'.<br /><br />Not to say that `All American Man' and `Rockin' in the USA' don't also benefit, its just the last three songs seem to have more punch than the first two studio cuts.<br /><br />They have added the single version of `Rock and Roll All Nite' as the last track. It's been a long time since I have heard this version. Can't remember exactly when I first heard it or from what source just know it's been along time.<br />This version has a much more quiet audience mix than Alive!. I guess this was done for radio airplay. The lead section has also been edited and shortened and Paul shouts out after the song has ended. I either had this version on a bootleg tape in the 80's or it's included in the CD box set, just don't remember right now.<br /><br />Back in I think the 90's they came out with the `Alive Trilogy' set that I never bought either so I thought this was just another re-packaging with `Bonus Disc' marketing tactics. That's why it's taken me so long to get this.<br />If my memory serves me right I think this is the set that the first pressings were all screwed up. I remember Best Buy had to issue buyers vouchers to receive the correct `Millennium Concert' disc because it was either missing '2000 Man' & \\"God of Thunder' bonus Best Buy only tracks or the entire disc was missing.<br /><br />I felt like a 12 year old kid hearing them for the first time all over again.<br />It was definitely 1975 & 1977 in my living room last night!!<br /><br />`I Wanna Rock & Roll All Nite, and Party Everyday!!'
0670022411|1.0|Whomever gives this book anything more than 1 star, must be high on some kind of drug.  I bought into the hype surrounding this book, and when the audiobook version went on sale for $5 on a monthly special, I grabbed it, and couldn't wait to start listening.  (thank heavens, because if I had paid full price of about $30 for it, I would have been seriously ticked off!!)<br /><br /> After about the first hour or two's listening, over a period of a few days, I began to get seriously bored with the endless descriptions (pages of adjectives!) of the exotic foods and wines (the minutia of every smell, taste, bouquet, reminiscing about what these foods remind them of, etc. got its space on the page) that these two fed each other, and the tortured forbidden love garbage, that made me want to throw my MP3 player across the room countless times.  I'm not looking for action in every book, and I am willing to invest in a story, if it GOES SOMEWHERE at some point, within reason.  I gave up Harlequin romances as a teenager, bored with the formulaic plots that formed each and every one of these books without fail.  So imagine my disgust, when I realized, what I had bought, was essentially an overblown, under-edited, 600 page Harlequin romance!  If you love Harlequins, then this is the book for you.<br />Characters are formula, and SO PREDICTABLE it isn't even funny.  At least Professor Snape kept you guessing until the last Harry Potter!!<br /><br />If you don't - do yourself a favor -- forget the hype, and skip this one.  you can thank me later.

He was unable to find a publisher,although all these years later, it's become a cult classic and it would be a humorless person indeed, who didn't agree that this is the funniest book ever written!<br /><br />Unfortunately, Poole committed suicide in despair; he was 31 years old.<br /><br />His mother haunted publisher after publisher until it was printed and distributed.<br />Along the way, it collected a Pulitzer Prize for Poole.<br /><br />This is not only the funniest novel, but the saddest story of an author.<br />New Authors...never, never, never give up.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was recommended to me by many different people of all different ages, genders and backgrounds. It was entertaining and full of twists. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an easy read that will keep you guessing.
0141040378|5.0|I really didn't enjoy Pride & Prejudice, so I didn't expect much from Sense & Sensibility.  But I found myself truly enjoying Austen's wit and tongue-in-cheek descriptions of silly women and men who can't make a proper decision to save their lives.<br /><br />And the DRAMA!  My God!  Did people during this time really act like this?  With every 18th and 19th century book I read, whether it's Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, I am amazed at how it was so normal to over-react to everyday disappointments.  We have mad people locked in attics and sad people dying of broken hearts.  People marrying out of spite and people running away from responsibility.  It's insane!  If anyone thinks that today's society is any less dignified than 200 years ago, well...we may talk with more slang and have short attention spans, but...well, I guess we are pretty ridiculous in our times as well.<br /><br />At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  I wouldn't call it light summer reading, so I'm not sure what made me pick it up and start reading it (it's August), but I would venture to say that it was just as dramatic and ridiculous as any other book I would have brought to the beach with me.  Fantastic!

1452110581|5.0|Just received \\"I Could Pee on This: And Other Poems by Cats\\" today and have already finished it, wiping the tears of laughter as I went along.  This is the perfect gift for the cat lover in  your life, although it isn't necessary to be one to find the book thoroughly delightful and laugh-out-loud funny.  Kudos to Francesco Marciuliano and his brilliant wit.  He has a fan for life!

0307155102|5.0|My own children loved this book until it literally wore out! The text provided many questions which fostered more of our own question and answer sessions. We were able to move from the literal (How many ___ to you see on this page?) to the hypothetical (What do you think the ___ will do now?) as the children grew. It is such a pleasure to purchase this book now for our grandchildren!

B00846REIS|4.0|Let me say that I did not read Fifty Shades of Grey. I think I read a twilight fanfiction that's like it, but, judging from the number of negative reviews on Amazon, I didn't want to touch that series just yet (#neg reviews almost equal to the # of positives). I heard that this series reminded people of Fifty Shades of Grey, but the rating is better for this one, so I gave in. I bought the kindle edition and finished it 2 days later (on vacation, lots of time).<br /><br />Both of the main characters, Eva and Gideon, have harsh pasts. Both have been in someways sexually abused, but it is curious to me that their relationship is intensely sexual in nature. And it seems that they needed it to be that way. Gideon have control issue: he needs to be in control of everything. His principle is to separate business from pleasure. Eva, in contrast, craves affection and a sincere and open relationship. That's the crux of the problem. Their chemistry is over the world. It's intense and all-consuming, but Eva doesn't want a purely sexual relationship because she would feel like she was being used (trauma). Their desire for each other brought them together despite all warnings ringing through their minds that they might not be good for each other. Explosive relationship ensures. Sex is great, but emotionally, they are fraying at the edges. The story is about them trying to overcome their past, not let it win over them and destroy what they have. The first volume ended with the emergence of a love rival. There are still a lot of things left unsolved (whatever, it's a trilogy anyways).<br /><br />The sex was okay-good, but repetitive. After a while, there's just *so much* sex--I think there was a point that you can't turn a page without reading about Eva moaning--that I started to skim those parts. However, I understand that this is an erotic novel and sex is pretty much a requirement as it is integral to the character development in general. It's kind of weird because I think because they spent 80% of the book having sex, they are not really talking about themselves or get to know each other. Their relationship moved super fast--over the space of a week or so and they were already pretty much living together, with their own drawers at each other's apartment and all. What little they know about each other's past or characters are from other people or from Wikipedia or from private investigation. It's strange. As I write this, I question myself if that's really a problem; probably not, it's fiction and not supposed to reflect exactly what actually happens in real life.<br /><br />I think some people have commented of Gideon's need for control being borderline stalkerish or just stalkerish and creepy. I agree with that assessment. It's just not normal for someone to be that much of a control freak. I would freak out if someone pursues me that aggressively and try to control who I can and can't talk to. Though, given his past (vague) I could maybe understand why he turned out that way. And if I'm as self conscious as Eva is, I would probably be flattered that someone as worldly/handsome/sexy/etc.etc. like Gideon Cross would be so interested in me. It's glossed over, but their relationship is a Dom/Sub one. At one point, Gideon admitted that he is a Dominant and tried to convince Eva that she is obviously a Submissive. It's a pretty mild Dom/Sub, though. With no BDSM. I think later books might explore that a bit more. Anyways, the whole thing about Gideon's need for control and possessiveness -- it really depends on the reader, I think. It depends on what flavor sex life the reader prefer. There are quite a few people who don't like others to control their lives in anyway and thought that Gideon's need for control as \\"creepy\\" or \\"stalkerish.\\" However, there are probably others out there who like a little possessiveness in their relationship (or a lot in Gideon's case). Dominancy in a relationship *can* be sexy. But it all depends on how much people can take/define dominancy. So don't be too taken-aback by some of the comments and let those drive you away. It's about fantasy and how you connect with it as much as it is about literary stuff like grammar and character development.<br /><br />The writing is okay. Nothing to brag about. Though, as I said before, some descriptions are repetitive. Especially during sex. Also I can't count how many times Eva remarked on how sexy Gideon looks.<br /><br />If reading all these reviews didn't help you, then go read an excerpt from the book. I think there's one on Sylvia's homepage.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|To paraphrase what Howard Stern said to Lars Ulrich, how high were you when you came up with this idea? This not only sounds like a bad idea, it was. I commend them for trying different things. The orchestra they had for some performances of the Black Album was incredible. But this should've died in the recording room and never been published. Don't waste your time with it. There is not a redeeming second on here. Move along, their is nothing to see (or hear) here.

0385360169|1.0|This is a poorly written, repetitive and boring book.  I cannot fathom what about it has the public so abuzz.  The sex is a total snore and not at all erotic, perhaps in large part due to the awful writing.  I will not be reading anything else written by E.L. James and will quietly ridicule anyone who suggests this is a worthy read.  I can think of many more enjoyable objects of my wasted time than spending it reading this drivel.  SKIP SKIP SKIP this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have recommended this to many.All have come back and thanked me.<br />Book one is an educational introdution to the other two books.<br />I promise that this book will suck you into the lives of Christian & Ana<br />and you will have to make yourself put it down. My only regret is that<br />I did not buy all three books at the same time and have recommended<br />the purchase of all of them to everyone. I finished the three books in a week<br />and half,but when book three was over I felt empty. Have not been able<br />to find another book that has involved me as the Fifty Shades Trilogy. So<br />I have now read them again and again left me empty.  These books are<br />well worth the time and money and I am left looking for something<br />to read as good as Fifty. Nothing compares.

B004FK8RKG|5.0|I bought these along with a jabra clipper bluetooth receiver for my motorcycle helmet. The receiver slips on to my strap. and the headphones sit nice and comfortable in my Shoei rf1000 helmet. I kind of wish the line was shorter, because I had to tuck it all in the padding of my helmet. All in all it worked out great, The headphones have some nice bass to them. I can hear them fine even at 80mph.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have only awarded the book 2 out of 5 stars. I was quite disappointed in the book. All my friends were reading it, and it received a lot of hype and publicity due to the sexual content, but I felt the storyline and quality of the writing were below average. Much of the dialog seemed repetitive. So clearly, I am not interested in reading the other two books in the series when there are so many other good books out there to be devoured.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was by far the most retarded book I have ever read!  My sister in law who is someone that I took as a very intelligent woman, recommended this to me, and honestly, I see her in a different light now!  Do not waste your time on this crap!  Who looks at someone through their eyelashes all day everyday?!?!?  really, try it, you will feel like an idiot and understand how much more of an idiot the author was that wrote this!  I bet her husband is a twisted old man version of Christian and she just wanted to make his crazy ass sound attractive.  Epic fail! Who could survive thru book one let alone two and three?!??!

B004WKOCP8|5.0|As I have been an Incubus fan since fungus amongus, I feel I am obligated to break the skepticism about this album. At first listen I must say I was somewhat disappointed at the timid nature of this album. However, giving it a second listen really changed my perception of the album and it's lack of adrenaline and heavy distorted guitar so prevalent in thier previous work. All I can say is that the songs are powerful in a soothing manner and although Boyd really seems to take control in these songs, Einziger and Padilla complement his direction perfectly. In short, this album is a must have--for any devout incubus fan.
B008MEM24S|1.0|Paid for the game and it will not let me down load it I tried everything except purchasing the game again
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Firefly was an amazing show - like a spaghetti western mixed with teeny bit of Asian influence, but all sci-fi - and somehow Joss Whedon(sp?) was able to tie all of those elements together and make it so realistic and down to earth that even my non-scifi friends, who were incredibly skeptical, eventually watched it and became insanely addicted like my self. It's better to watch in order, but even then you can watch most episodes and still get a kick out of 'em individually.<br /><br />Every episode has something new, exciting, fabulous - and every character has a story. Not all of it's laid out, leaving you wondering and wanting more out of each show. And that 'more' is certainly delivered. HIGHLY recommend buying the series, and the follow-up film (same name as the first episode, and the craft itself), \\"Serenity\\". It's all wonderful - I've rewatched the series more than I can count, and I'll keep watching them again. That's something I don't typically do, for any material, so it's why I can say without a doubt that it's one of the best shows ever made.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This was an excellent movie for the first movie in probably another bourne trilogy.

B003K16P3M|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Great adventure story with new concepts.  Another strong female lead character that<br />teen girls can read about, and equally good male characters, so it can appeal to both teen boys and girls.<br />Going to give to my 13 year old to read.

1469984202|5.0|In the omnibus WOOL series Hugh Howey creates a science fiction novel that is more grounded in reality and humanity than most.  Like most of the best science fiction authors, the science fiction aspects of the story quickly take a backseat to the human condition and serve to enable us to learn about ourselves as part of the human race.  The last book I read that achieved similar results was the Sparrow.  Howey's series does this brilliantly while at the same time providing an exciting story with many unpredictable occurrences.  Second to the emphasis on human interaction for me, is the overall tone and feel of the book.  I felt a constant aura of weight and oppression throughout the story and the slight claustrophobic feeling of being trapped underground in the SILO was very effectively conveyed.  At the same time the driving force behind the plot is a balance between a building tension and impending tragedy racing a bubbling sense of hope and redemption.  The contrast between both doom and hope excellently creates that elusive feel most readers strive to capture in a story, namely the feeling that they must keep reading to find out what happens next.  Well done Mr Howey.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book. Lots of passion. Exciting all the way through...leaving u on your toes. Very different from others I've read. Not a cheaply romance novel.
B004SRNH10|1.0|I needed to download this app for the graphics on another app. The link was in the desired app, so I downloaded it from the link. What a disaster!!! If I had had the ability to read the reviews, I would have skipped it and not paid for the desired app. Immediately my phone crashed.  I had to go so far as removing my battery to get phone back up and working, just to remove the Adobe Air app. It took quite some time to get my phone back to working order. It's a very, very bad app. Am disappointed that ADOBE is dropping it's Flash, in order to get people use Air. I'll have to use another app. I won't download Air, until they do some major upgrades, and fixes.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I got this book while searching for weight loss solutions.  I have always been a fan of bodybuilding, but was far from the body of those guys.  I downloaded the sample version and read through it in one sitting and had to have more.  Mike's principles are simple to follow and he cuts through all the B.S. that the supplement and fitness industry want you to believe.  I bought the e-book and read it in one sitting.  I implemented his workout routine the next day and lost 11LBS the first week and I feel strong!<br /><br />Mike is personable and wants to see and hear about your success.  It may sound cliche but this book has literally changed my life.
B008MM9630|5.0|I was absolutely thrilled to have my favorite game on my Kindle Fire. If you enjoy fairies, magic,  and cute little animals this is the game for you. Only bad thing with this game is if you want to get far on it your going to end up spending real money.
B005L38QK2|4.0|This is probably the most high-quality mouse I've owned. The cord is cloth-wrapped, the mouse is durable and well-crafted, and apart from the quasi-disturbing nature of the PULSING GLOW the \\"Diablo\\" lettering gives off, it's a great mouse in terms of materials, workmanship, design, etc.<br /><br />The problem I had wasn't really the mouse's fault directly. I wanted to wait to review this mouse till I'd actually played Diablo 3 with it, and I did for about a month (taking a couple Hardcore mode characters up through Inferno Butcher). The problem I ran into was that along about Week 3, my mouse hand, especially the tendons above my index and middle finger, started to feel really inflamed and arthritic, to the point where I had to stop playing for periods of several hours or more, and I'm still getting twinges a few weeks later.<br /><br />I guess I'm getting old, or maybe I play too many video games. Overall though if you're really going to play THAT much Diablo 3, I'd probably recommend getting a more ergonomic mouse (maybe one that forced you to push the buttons with your fingertips) or maybe a trackball. As great as this mouse is in terms of materials, durability, etc., it fell a little short for me in the \\"prevents carpal tunnel\\" department.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this for my Kindle Fire. It is great..glad to finally get it. It works just like my computer and the pictures are really easy to see and I already did some pins.Going to add it to my Toshiba Thrive now, too.
B00009Z574|4.0|I didn't want to write any Tormato Review, but reading here that Drama is superior than Tormato made me laugh so much, that I found myself in obligation of writing something about it.<br /><br />First, I don't have anything against Drama, I have all Yes albuns simply because they can't do anything of low quality! For sure Drama is a three stars album indeed, there is no way of giving more stars to it. You would only do it if either you don't know anything about music technically, or don't know anything about Yes music particularly. Even the weak parts in Tormato are superior than the weak parts in Drama.<br /><br />There are only two songs I think are below Yes average pattern in Tormato, \\"Circus of Heaven\\", and \\"Arriving Ufo\\". Both songs are not that bad. But in Drama, \\"Into the lens\\", and \\"Tempus fugit\\" are complete wasting of time, songs that didn't work in anyway, simply like that, from the beginning, and sometimes they sound very ugly, weird, to be a Yes song as we have been used to, and it is not an experiment, as someone could say trying to defend Drama, in the case of these songs they are a null effort.<br /><br />Tormato has a powerful introduction, exactly what we should expect from a Yes song, extremely well played, fast, beautiful \\"Future Times\\" Chris Squire simply destroys his bass here. \\"Don't Kill the Whales\\" is a song with a very interesting and different sonority, really new, and \\"Release, Release\\", is fast, happy, a positive song, very Rocky and well executed.<br /><br />\\"ONWARD\\", is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever listened, not only talking about Yes, but from any other band I love, such a beautiful song, gentle, melodic, sad, beautifully sad.<br /><br />\\"ON THE SILENT WINGS OF FREEDOM\\", IS THE HIGH POINT, a perfect Yes song, the introduction has Chris Squire showing why he is the greatest bass player of all Rock an Roll history, while the genius guitar player Steve Howe plays fast notes with his already well known virtuosity.<br /><br />So Tormato ends with this high level song, instead of Drama that ends with it's lacking of concentration rsrsrsrsrs.

034580404X|5.0|This is a wonderful romance story about two very different people that come together. One of the few romance stories that continues after the couple gets together. The innocence of Ana and the experience of Christian come together to form a bond. The \\"red room of pain\\" and his life style are part of his character. I'm glad that the author describes it so well.  I'm tired of reading other stories when there is no description of intimacy.<br /><br />Book 2 is my favorite..this is where they discover each other. And yes there is explicit sex in every chapter. You have to look beyond the sex and see how much they love each other. It's about letting your guard down and letting the other person into your heart.  You see how Christian truly loves Ana in his own way. How he loves and cares for her. How he wants to protect her. How her curious inexperience mind always challenges him..but he loves it. Learning experience for both Ana and Christian.<br /><br /> It's suspenseful at times and keeps your interest.

0783240236|3.0|The Birds is the story of a socialite (Tippi Hedren) who gets hit on in the city by a good looking man from a small town (Rod Taylor). He makes an offhand comment about buying lovebirds for his sister for her birthday, and the woman finds them and delivers them to the small town. Because of the budding romance, she stays there much longer than she anticipated originally, and finds herself trapped by an unprecedented occurrence: birds are attacking the townspeople.<br /><br />I went into this movie with big expectations because of its status as a classic, and as one of Hitchcock's best. While my interest was kept throughout, the ending disappointed me and there wasn't a single scene that made me afraid. I've known several people in my life who have claimed a fear of birds stemming from this movie, and now after having seen it myself can only conclude that these people saw it as very young, very easily manipulated children.<br /><br />I have to admit that even though I wasn't scared by this movie in the least, I found myself wanting to copy Hedren's clothes and hairstyle for weeks after seeing The Birds. Hitchcock certainly picked an eye-catching woman to carry this film.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This is a review about the show NOT the product, so if you are looking for answers on how the packaging is, this is not the review to be reading. I feel in love with this show towards the end of the first season, at first the show was fine, but as the show went on it kept getting better and better. Later on in season six it started to lose me, and a lot of people said that the series finale was disappointing and didn't answer any questions, but I was satisfied with the series finale after a little bit of time I needed to figure out what exactly had happened. All in all I loved this show and managed to keep my complete interest and attention.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|Video was such a wonderful update to the VHS version we previously owned. My husband is a history buff and we live close to the Gettysburg Battlefield so it has a special meaning for us. The seller shipped in quickly and it was in perfect condition.  Good movie and historically precise.  A long movie but the history buffs will like that!<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon for offering it at a reasonable price!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I loved this movie for many reasons, the action, suspense, romance, tragedy, and beauty. The movie was well paced and in my opinion cast perfectly. When I saw this in theaters I could not take my eyes off the screen, much less get a refill of popcorn. Along with action The Hunger Games was an emotional journey that took you through the reaping, training, and the games with Katniss and Peeta. The makeup and special effects were great, I did not even recognize Elizabeth Banks as Effie. I recomend this movie to anyone who likes action.

B0051O8Z66|5.0|Progress was amazing and Progressed is even better! If you loved Progress you'll love this, am glad these great tracks were released along with the main album. Best songs in no particular order are When We Were Young, Eight Letters, The Flood, SOS. Kidz, Pretty Things, The Day the Work Is Done, Love Love, Beautiful, Happy Now, Underground Machine and Flowerbed. 'Love Love' was featured in the movie 'X-Men: First Class' and 'When We Were Young' was featured in the movie 'The Three Musketeers' both released in 2011.  Take That also went on to win Best British Group at The Brits (UK Grammys) in 2011.  Fun Fact: The tour accomplished many accolades including selling 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours and with demand for tickets a reported 30 times higher for Progress Live!  Album (weekly): UK #1 (6th) / Europe Hot 100 #1 (3rd) - World Chart #1 (1 week).
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Come on. It isn't Brave New World, but what did you expect? As far as I'm concerned, I only crave an interesting story that can get me through the time I'm burning behind the book.<br />The Maze Runner delivered. A bunch of whiny boys in an impossible situation without solutions or resources, and no true love interest or love triangle in sight (although, I'll warn you, it's a possibility).<br />No memories, no certainties, no answers. Just the desire to live.<br />The book unfolds itself as Thomas does, exploring surroundings and asking questions of the circumstances that brought him there. When it seems as though you are on the cusp of understanding, the world continues to change and shatter, which ultimately leads to further reading. What is the point to a constantly changing maze? Why him? Why the others? Why her? - All will be revealed...won't it?<br />I thought it was intriguing enough to continue in the series, and now on the third novel, all I want is answers - the same I imagine of Thomas.

B008N1LL42|4.0|Good movie, lots of special effects.  Neeson was<br />not in command of any of the action, he did not<br />say 'All of them\\", to fire the weapons.<br /><br />That was just a sucker play, to get people to watch the movie.  I was a bit disappointed he didn't take a more active part in the movie.  A little like deceptive advertising.  And that is against the law.<br /><br />I guess it would have cost to much.  Maybe he is getting to old to act.<br /><br />Still a good movie.  But, why lie about it?

B00005NI5Y|5.0|You'd think that some of these people crying about his voice had never heard the Blues or something. Good lord this album is easily one of his top ten albums imo. Nothing about these tunes are weak. The old-fashioned sensibility shines through with some very well written lyrics. Clearly Dylan was in a certain mood here and the band is just phenomenal backing him up. The bass is so deep and sumptuous and a proper stereo system reveals all the layers on offer. As others have said the guiding light behind this album is the crackling voice which brings you back to another time. No idea what the negative nancies are smoking or not smoking to give this album one star. Amazon is hilarious and this album will be remembered as one of his best. Cohesive in theme and music everything comes into place at the right moment in his career as a songwriter and singer. Check it out.

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|To preface my review, I have read \\"Jane Eyre\\" the book and seen at least 5 adaptations of it in movies... I can  can safely say - this is one of the worst. Granted Timothy Dalton's version is cheesy to an extent, but given special effects at the time.... but I digress.<br /><br />In a nutshell - Mia Wasikowska is terrible. Literally she spends the majority of the movie with 1 of 2 expressions on her face: apoplectic fear or menstrual cramps. I am not saying she is experiencing either, but that is what her face reads throughout the entire film. It really is quite bad and is so distracting, that you can't give any creedance to the strong and epic role of Jane Eyre. Michael Fassbender in the part of Mr. Rochester isn't bad, just not as believable in either his fierceness or his ardor as I have seen other actors do better in the role.<br /><br />And by the word \\"film\\" - I mean that the directors decided to take that approach with the story. Perhaps this was their way of recreating the wheel with a spookier environment and feeling of unease with the odd angles, limited speech, inconsistent lighting, etc. In my opinion - the story speaks for itself when well acted, you don't need to embellish or flourish with \\"artsy\\" interpretation. It was more distracting than enhancing.<br /><br />The only twinkling spark in the film is that the scene BEFORE Jane runs away was included. This is in the book and can seem anti-climactic to the tragedy of Mr. Rochester's big secret being revealed - so it's not often included in movie versions of Jane Eyre. I was happy to see this scene included in this adaptation - because it is poignant and heart wrenching. However, it was ruined quickly by Mia Wasikowska's lack of acting and facial contortions.<br /><br />I will neither buy or ever watch this version again. The Toby Stephens one is sooo much better!

0486295559|5.0|Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth once meant a great deal to each other. But that was years ago before Anne's well-meaning friend and her less-than-good-intentioned family discouraged the acquaintance and Anne was convinced to give Frederick up.<br /><br />With years to think of her decision and years to consider all that Wentworth has accomplished without her, Anne has little hope of seeing him again or changing things between them.<br /><br />That is until a change in her father's circumstance forces the family to rent their estate. Given the identity of the new tenants, it seems inevitable that Anne and Captain Wentworth will see each other. It even seems inevitable that Wentworth will be angry and Anne hurt. Only time will tell if they can once again be something more to each other in Persuasion (1818) by Jane Austen.<br /><br />Persuasion is Austen's last novel. It is also a favorite among several of my friends.*<br /><br />With a book that is already such a large part of the public consciousness and the literary canon, there isn't a lot to say in a review that hasn't been said before.<br /><br />Jane Austen is one of my favorite classic authors so it is not, perhaps, especially surprising that I enjoyed Persuasion. In addition to a story that kept me on my toes,** Persuasion features a lot of strong, or at least interesting, characters. Wentworth is appropriately dashing even at his worst. Then we have Anne who is a delightfully forward heroine for a novel from 1818. It was invigorating to watch Anne come into her own as the novel progressed and she developed her own agency and the wherewithal to pursue her own wants and needs.<br /><br />Like many classics Persuasion is a book many people will read on the merits of its reputation (or for school) or it's the kind of book they won't touch. One review might not change whatever opinion you might have but Persuasion is an obvious must read for romantics and anyone who likes their heroines level-headed and ready to stand on their own two feet.<br /><br />*Though one does add the caveat that Pride and Prejudice first has to be taken out of the equation as Pride and Prejudice is arguably everyone's favorite Austen novel.<br /><br />**My only experience with Persuasion before this reading was Diana Peterfreund's post-apocalyptic retelling For Darkness Shows the Stars. I had never even seen a movie version so I really had no idea what to expect from the story. At. All. It made for a pleasant surprise while reading.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Graffiti Moon by Cath Crowley, Middlemarch by George Eliot, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banksby E.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|All I could think of this while reading it, that this was once a Twilight Fanfiction, and its quite evident that it is, as Ana could easily be Bella, Christian as Edward.<br /><br />The one and two star reviews about this book are spot on.<br /><br />I got 75% of the way through this book and started skimming. It was so so repetative, so many eyes rolling, and breaths hitching. I wanted it to be over, so much could have been cut out of the last quarter of the book, although I did really enjoy the gliding scene.<br /><br />There were so many repetative scences, it got so boring! Ana rolled her eyes, bit her lip, and it made Christian go nuts. It was ridiculous how many times the story repeated itself, couldn't the author come up with someing else. All Ana did was roll her eyes, blush, cry, freak out and bite her lip.<br /><br />The inner goddess and subconcious parts of the story were equally annoying.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this two stars was because Christians characters intriuged me. Although he comes across as a Gary-Stu, the fact that he's so messed up, and we don't yet know why makes the character interesting.<br /><br />Ana got on my nerves, and I've read some reviews where she doesn't grow and learn, but stays a whiny, insecure little prat. Ugh, not sure if I want to read any more of this series.<br /><br />I would have liked it better if Ana wasn't such a contradiction.

It took me a little minute to finish it but I hated putting it down.  It was filled with amazing findings and I just couldn't believe with every turning page that Henrietta Lacks and her family actually lived through all of this.  I recommend this book to any and everybody.  I is definitely a must read.  I believe that all scientist should have to read this book at some point in their studies!  This book sparked my interest to read more!!!

B006Q1SQCQ|2.0|I only found the first section of this book helpful; the part on association.  I'm not saying that the rest of it wouldn't work.  I am saying that it would be a Whole Lot of Work; more work than I want to put into remembering things.  I also think that to use the systems in this book you have to be a very creative person.  Even the first section on association requires a lot of creative thinking.  I would have to come up with a creative, outlandish mental picture for every single thing I'm trying to remember.  A Lot of Work.  So, maybe these systems work, but you need to be prepared to work very hard at them.

0802130208|5.0|Ignatius J. Reilly is thirty years old, has rarely left his home of New Orleans (and don't even get him started on the story of his bus ride to Baton Rouge -- it was a horrible experience) and lives with his mother. Although he doesn't work, per se, his time is consumed with writing his opus, disdaining pop culture, and being a cross for his mother to bear.<br /><br />When his poor mother begins to indulge a little more than usual in her drink of choice (currently muscatel), she crashes the car into the side of a building. The financial distress from the accident necessitates Ignatius's getting a job to help support his own expenses for the first time in his life.<br /><br />What follows are a serious of hysterical and unbelievable events starring Ignatius as he goes from job to job (including a stint in the office at Levy Pants and a hotdog salesman (though he mostly just eats his product)) and from one unexpectedly comical situation to the next. Reilly vacillates between being a detestable and a merely pathetic character, but either way his exploits will keep readers wanting more.<br /><br />Author John Kennedy Toole wrote the story of Reilly pulling from experiences in own life, and partially based the character on a professor of his at Tulane University. After being rejected by Simon and Schuster for publication of A Confederacy of Dunces, Toole, who had suffered from paranoia and depression for much of his life, committed suicide. The book was posthumously published some 11 years later and Toole was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1981.<br /><br />In contrast with the unhappy story surrounding the publication of this novel, it is brimming with comical and unforeseen scenarios. I actually picked this up accidentally, mistaking it for Confederates in the Attic (a very, very different book) and was happy I did.
B0064SHI9I|1.0|I bought two licenses of this app to migrate two Samsung Epics to Samsung Galaxy S3's (mine and my wife's). I realized that I might have some difficulties but I would have been better off sticking to Gmail and Dropbox. It dropped a month out of the middle of my phone log files. It did not restore all my wife's apps. It was not consistent on what it did miss or capture between the two phones. On neither phone did it capture any app data such as notes, game status or lists. It may be great for backup but seeing what it did not capture I would certainly be wary of relying on it.
030771652X|4.0|Beatrice was always kind of the lesser sister; less beautiful, less impulsive, less engaged in her life. Tess, at only 21, lived hers to the fullest. Bee's dull, corporate job paled in comparison to Tess's artistic passions, flinging bright paints onto large canvasses to make people feel something. And then Tess is found, dead, in an abandoned rest room, alone, cold, and presumed to have committed suicide after giving birth to a stillborn child.<br /><br />The story of each sister's lives unfolds through Bee's narrative. Whereas Bee had always scoffed at Tess's tiny apartment and job waitressing, she now lives in the apartment and picks up her sister's shifts. She befriends her sister's friends; the elderly landlord who Tess ate dinner with once a week, the Polish immigrant who Tess bonded during their pregnancies, even the mangy cat that Tess adopted. Bee, who never understood these relationships before, now leans on them heavily, and allows them to lean on her.<br /><br />Bee becomes closer to her sister than ever before, but also begins to question whether or not she had really known her. As she learns more and more about Tess's life, she also begins to unravel the mystery surrounding her death. Bee clings adamantly to the fact that her sister valued life too highly to have taken her own. This belief gives her the strength to search for her sister's killer, despite losing her job, fiancé, and life in New York City in the process.<br /><br />Lupton's debut novel is filled with twists and turns, and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page.

0307946711|5.0|One Day is the story of a blooming love affair, although a very slowly blooming one. Dexter and Emma meet on St. Swithin's Day (a British holiday that falls on July 15th) in 1988, and spend a lovely night together. They've just graduated from college and Dexter is about to head out of the country to find himself for a while, so, despite the obvious connection between the two, they part ways. Somehow a friendship grows out of their brief encounter, and they keep in touch through letters while Dexter is abroad.<br /><br />Our next viewing of the pair is exactly one year later, on July 15th, 1989. And so goes the book, showing us where the two stand on St. Swithin's Day each year for twenty years. We watch as they support each other through jobs, relationships, and life, both the good and the bad. Their friendship has its own ebb and flow over the years, and the snapshots throughout time allow the reader to see an overarching picture of their relationship over the years.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written and switches its narrative between the two characters, giving different perspectives of the same events for a fuller picture of Dexter and Emma's lives and encounters. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, One Day was a treat to read. You'll find yourself rooting for their relationship to finally find its groove.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I must say, I only went to see this because of a love for classic science fiction and fully expected a lame treatment by Disney.

0375842209|5.0|Although the target audience for The Book Thief is young adult readers, this novel has been a really popular one among adult book clubs over the last few years, probably because it's amazing and has won awards all over the place.<br /><br />The story is told from the point of view of an unlikely narrator: Death. And set in Germany during World War II, Death has seen a lot. He becomes interested in the story of a young German girl, Liesel Meminger, as she steals her first book - the Gravedigger's Grave Digging Handbook - from her brother when he dies. With a communist father, an ailing mother, and a dead brother, Liesel is placed alone in the home of Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Her new foster father teaches Liesel to make sense of the jumbles of letters in the book, and as her reading improves, so does her book thieving.<br /><br />The war and its effects on Liesel and her friends and family (including a Jewish man the Hubermann's take into hiding) are prominently seen throughout the book, but are a back drop to the real story - that of a young girl growing up in a hard time and becoming her own person in spite, or perhaps because of that. The book is somehow gloomy and uplifting at the same time.<br /><br />Also try Zusak's book I Am the Messenger.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I like almost everything that David Baldacci writes but I thought this moved a little slow in the middle of the book.  On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 6.
1594203334|4.0|Okay, yes, this is sort of a parenting book, and perhaps not the type of book that you'd generally just pick up off the shelf, but it's a really interesting read, whether or not you're a parent. (Of course, since I am a parent, that's easy enough for me to say - I'm game for pretty much anything that might make my kid more awesome.)<br /><br />Pamela Druckerman was an American journalist living in Paris when she and her British husband started their family. Druckerman was immediately struck by the differences she saw between American and French parenting, and the resulting kids from each of those styles. French kids seemed, in general, to be calmer, less prone to tantrums, and to eat the same meals as everyone else (the concept of the \\"kids meal\\" being practically non-existent there.) American kids, on the other hand, are often more outspoken and confident in school, and... um, that might have been the only plus about American kids.<br /><br />The book really isn't anti the way we raise our kids in America, however. It shows both the pros and the cons of the French styles, and lets the reader make their own decision about what we might deem \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\". Some things I'd steal from the French in a heartbeat (wine list in my hospital room? Well, hello!) and others I'm less inclined to take part in, like what Druckerman refers to as \\"The Pause,\\" where French parents wait for up to 15 minutes before tending to their crying infants, to try to understand what they need.<br /><br />All in all, this was an interesting read, and I learned not only some new techniques I might try when my little one gets older, but also cultural differences between French and American adults that stem from the way we as a society raise our children.
1476712042|1.0|This writing is well done and pretty descriptive. It made me want to like this novel, and I did at first. The characters are fairly well-rounded. At least, I felt as though I got to know the central characters in this book, though the supporting characters aren't as dynamic and mostly felt as though they were inserted at strategic points in order to further the plot of the story. Still, I was enjoying the novel for the most part until the characters' did things that I couldn't agree with. After that, I clicked at Kindle and skimmed the pages until the book was finally over, and I could present my honest opinion on the book, able to say that I had read the whole book.<br /><br />Abby is a smart girl. She goes to Eastern University in order to get away from her past and start a new life for herself. Then she meets Travis, and Abby's best friend America tries to push the two together despite her promise to help keep Abby's past from catching up on her, which annoys Abby though she secretly enjoys the chances to hang out more with Travis. I agreed with Abby's decision to give the smart guy a try, but then she ends up dumping him for Travis. Nevertheless, she is constantly doing things against her better judgment. One could say that she's in love, but is that really an excuse? Where should we draw the line when we say we're doing things for love? If she really loves him, should she stay with him or should she let him go and let him grow and learn from the lesson of why she broke up with him? What finally broke the story for me was when Abby got back together with Travis after all the things he did to her.<br /><br />Travis is a sweet guy when he's in love. He calls her by an affectionate nickname (though I wouldn't want to be called Pidgeon... sweet as it is, I'd constantly think about the bird). He does a lot of things for her. Actually, he does so much that he seems obsessed with her--and insecure and untrustful. He's a controlling boyfriend. He told her to change, not approving of the way she dressed for a party, and he doesn't approve of her hanging out with guys he doesn't know and  trust. He didn't listen to her advice on a job offer he received, thinking that she'd really be all right with it. (Yeah, she broke up with him because he was going to accept it no matter her opinion on the subject. She came to Eastern to get away from that kind of life.) Then he begged her not to break up with him, telling her that he couldn't live without her. He was dependent on her. While they weren't together, however, he secretly kept guys away from her. So if he can't have her, no one can? Plus the thing he does right before they get back together.... I think that's grounds for a restraining order, if him almost stalking her in the first days after their breakup wasn't enough.<br /><br />There are people who are going to love this book because a beautiful disaster of a relationship works itself out. However, I just can't like a book where the girl gets back together with the guy in spite of all these things he's done to her. She's only nineteen, and he's not that much older. There is time to sort out what you want in life and what you want in the long run. Abby had thought about it, which is also why she'd broken up with him in the first place.<br /><br />Content: Cussing, violence, blood, sex, gambling.approving of the way she dressed for a party, and he doesn't approve of her hanging out with guys he doesn't know and  trust.

0061120073|5.0|How have I never read this book before? Why didn't my high school force me to read it, as they did other novels that so impacted my life, like Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, or The Great Gatsby? I wish that someone had made me read this book long ago, but I'm also excited to have discovered the beauty of Smith's book on my own, as an adult, when I could appreciate it for its own merits and not because I was supposed to.<br /><br />A Tree Grows in Brooklyn has been on my `to read' list for the last year or so, and I have to admit I was kind of dreading reading it. Sometimes \\"classics\\" do that to me. I finally picked it up on audio, considering that to be a compromise - I could listen to it in my car driving to and from work without devoting my full reading time and attention to the novel.<br /><br />From the very first words that narrator Barbara Rosenblat spoke, I was completely hooked. Smith's story follows the life of Francie Nolan, a little girl growing up in Brooklyn during the early part of the 20th century. Though mainly a coming-of-age novel, the book winds its way throughout decades backwards and forwards, and into the lives of Francie's parents and extended family.<br /><br />Although Francie grew up poor in Brooklyn, concerned with the entry of the U.S. into the first World War, her father's alcoholism and where her next meal would come from, she is a character that can still be related to today. I thoroughly enjoyed this classic, and would whole-heartedly recommend the audio version.

0316098329|5.0|Jack is your average five years old kid; he loves his mom, his city made out of paper towel and toilet paper tubes, and he especially loves watching his shows on television. The big difference between Jack and five-year-olds you know is that Jack has lived in a 11x11 foot room (endearingly called Room) for his entire life and has never once left it.<br /><br />Jack's mother (known to the reader only as Ma) was kidnapped at 19 and has been imprisoned for the 7 years since. She gave birth to Jack (and to a stillborn baby before him) in Room and has done her best to raise him there ever since. In fact, since Jack has never known anything different, he thinks he's a normal kid. His days are filled with activities that his mom has invented for him - they always make time for exercise, clean Room thoroughly every week, and have specific times for meals and play. And then there are the nighttime visits from \\"Old Nick,\\" Ma's captor and Jack's father, which bring groceries and treats on Sundays, but also anxiety for Jack, who sleeps in the wardrobe so that Old Nick can't see him.<br /><br />As Jack's fifth birthday comes and goes, Ma decides he is old enough to help her plan for an escape from Room, and from the life that imprisons her but is the only one her son has ever known.<br /><br />The book is wonderfully written and, despite its dark material, is made funny and touching through the eyes of a five year old.

0060899220|5.0|I've been hearing about Anthony Bourdain's book Kitchen Confidential since it was published back in 2000. At the time, I was working in a high-profile restaurant in Washington, D.C. whose chef and owner is cited in the book. Somehow I never got around to picking it up until recently, after having watched more than my fair share of cooking programs on the Food Network and catching up on some other food memoirs I've missed throughout the years (check out my review of Toast: the Story of a Boy's Hunger by Nigel Slater from earlier this year.)<br /><br />Not only does Bourdain share some handy tips to keep in mind when eating out (never order fish on a Monday, eat out Tuesdays through Thursdays for the best food and service, steer clear of Sunday brunches, etc.) but he delivers stories about the restaurant industry in a sometimes shocking and always hysterical style. Bourdain worked himself up from lowly dishwasher more interested in his next drug score than in the food he was wiping from the plates to becoming executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in New York City. This book chronicles his years of work at dead end jobs, under horrible head chefs, and in the world of vice that often surrounds professional kitchens.<br /><br />Although Kitchen Confidential is his first, Bourdain has written other food memoirs including No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach (the premise of which was turned into a show on the Travel Channel with Bourdain as host) and Medium Raw: a Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook. Bourdain has also written some culinary mysteries that I'm looking forward to checking out - start with Bone in the Throat.
B008B7OQHM|4.0|For me Slipknot is the best band in the planet! But I hate when bands release their Greatest Hits with nothing new (new tracks or re-edit versions) I have to say it. Sorry but looks pretty awesome in my CD - DVD Collection!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This review is from the AUDIOBOOK, which is very well done. The many characters from all over the world are played by actors such as Alan Alda, John Torturro, and many others, and their performances are great. As far as the book goes, I was impressed by the many angles explored in the book, as far as world view. The Zombie apocalypse is seen from some truly creative angles. BUT, the zombies as described didn't seem to warrant much threat. They are slow, stupid, and can't even open a car door. They are slaughtered until they are stacked like wood twenty feet deep. Supposedly, these impotent Zombs overwhelm the US military at the start of the war. Um-hmm. Entertaining book, nevertheless, especially the AUDIOBOOK.

0385342063|1.0|I loved the first few \\"Shopaholic\\" books, and even reread them. I started to get annoyed with the latest ones, however, and only lasted about 10 pages into the most recent one (with the baby, I believe). Sophia Kinsella is a very talented author, but the characters and plots she sometimes creates are beyond likable.<br /><br />I listened to this book via audio book, and I was annoyed from the get-go. First of all, if you lose your phone, you just can go get a new one and have your number transferred to the new device. It's quite simple. The fact that Poppy never even THOUGHT of this was completely unrealistic and maddening. Instead, she's going to take some business phone that she found in the trash and hand that number out to everyone? And then deal with all the business texts and emails that come into the phone? I cannot support or like stupid characters.<br /><br />Then, to explain her missing ring, she shows up wearing ridiculous Christmas gloves with pom-poms and says she has a burn? It's just so idiotic and stupid. The constant lying and deceit is not funny or cute anymore, as it was with the original Shopaholic books (only on the first read, however). Kinsella's characters are never confident in themselves or their opinions, they are always lying and faking in order to impress other people. It's extremely annoying.<br /><br />I couldn't even finish this book. I am not reading any more Sophia Kinsella.

1468161660|2.0|This book is not a literary masterpiece. The word cry appears 37 times, it is not plausible, and revolves around young adults who are over emotional. I wouldn't recommend it and found it just...dumb. I will say that it is a quick and easy read, but there are so many young adult books with better protagonists and story lines.

1469984202|5.0|I've never submitted a review on Amazon before, but I so thoroughly enjoyed these stories that I had to post something.  I found it very difficult to put this book down and haven't been so enthralled in quite some time.  Although the novellas can stand alone, they dovetail nicely to give a 360 degree view of life in the silo.  The characters and their actions and motivations are believable, with no terribly jarring and unrealistic moments where I had to forcibly choose to maintain my suspension of disbelief to go along with the story.  I also enjoyed Howey's writing style - the dialog was natural and he provided a good amount of detail and suspense without being overly verbose.  I bought this book on a whim because of the great price, good reviews, and desire for some light vacation reading.  I was astounded by how much I enjoyed these stories and will definitely start reading Howey's other books.
B008JAG9BW|4.0|I was expecting a terrible 4th movie with the original cast since they slowly but surely got worse as they went along but was pleasantly surprised. They did well with the plot and the humor adjustment from the original of 13 years ago. I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Many of the reviews were written before the BD even released so figured I would write a review.  First a few key points so you can decide if it is worth your time to keep reading or immediately decide if this movie is not for you.<br /><br />- EXTREME GORE (Think Saving Private Ryan, then go beyond that)<br />- Little to no plot (it is a pure action movie)<br />- The Martial Arts is great, but its NOT a martial arts movie<br />- It is a foreign film so the English dub is horrible<br /><br />When I say extreme gore, we are talking brain matter, long vicious cuts and just generally extremely violent scenes.  If this level of violence is beyond your tolerance level than I don't think you will like this movie at all.<br /><br />If extreme violence does not scare you off than the action in this movie will reward you.  But let's be clear, despite it having an Indonesian martial arts star in it and featuring martial arts this is not a martial arts movie as most view them.  The movie is based on the police raiding a crime lord's apartment building so various forms of weapons are used in this movie so its not all just Silat.  In fact, more people are taken out from guns than from martial arts.  The martial art used in this movie, Silat, is some of the best you will see filmed in a movie.  If you train in martial arts you will instantly recognize many of the attacks you train and drill in, and you will see reversals as good as the attacks.  This movie has a very nice blend of pure action scenes and martial arts scenes so people that typically aren't into martial art movies should like this movie, but since the martial arts in this movie is very good the martial art fans should love it from that point of view.  Best blend of both worlds I've seen.<br /><br />The English dubbing is dreadful and will make the movie feel off because the voices just don't match.  If you are ok with subtitles than I highly recommend switching to it in the Audio options (called \\"Original Music\\") and selecting your choice of language subtitles.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good, it is actually better than most of my Blu-Ray movies.  Though it does look as though it has had some post production editing as it appears a bit unnaturally polished.  I'm guessing this is to smooth out the grainiess most movies have.  I noticed it but honestly it works and I doubt most will even see it.  For a foreign movie the extras on the disc are pretty decent, but it is standard fare for most movies.<br /><br />My PS3 couldn't play this movie by default - it was at 3.61.  It had a version of 3.65 on the disc, but then it complained I needed to download a newer software version to validate my encryption key. So I downloaded 4.1 from Sony and it worked.  Not sure if dedicated Blu-Ray players will also need to be updated, but I figure it is worth mentioning so anyone thinking of buying this is prepared.<br /><br />Outside of having to update my PS3 to play the movie, the only other annoyance I had with the Blu-Ray Disc is that in order to skip the commercials, I couldn't simply hit the Title/Pop Up Menu button ...I had to keep hitting the Next Chapter button.  Though since it was general Blu-Ray movies being advertised and movies coming to theaters soon this \\"feature\\" might affect all Blu-Ray movies.<br /><br />Overall this is a great movie for anyone looking for a pure adrenalin rush (remember gore disclaimer).  There are other movies to give the mind a work out.  This is the kind of movie you sit with your munchies out and enjoy!selecting your choice of language subtitles.<br /><br />The picture quality is very good, it is actually better than most of my Blu-Ray movies.

B002FGU3YU|1.0|I have worn several pairs of Terra Fi 2 and 3 over the years but, sadly, Teva changed the footbed and arch design making the currently available model unwearable. Fortunately, I saw another review that mentioned the Teva Toachi 2 model. I bought a pair and they fit perfectly.

0099572834|5.0|A story of a young autistic boy as he tells it himself.  It's powerful indeed, to feel the thought processes and Haddon has the main character blossom to life.<br /><br />It's a mystery of sorts, but it's a story about difference and hope and love and perspective that I think anyone would love.<br /><br />I'd challenge any adult to read this and not be completely engaged.

0345803507|1.0|I knew this series was going to be bad. I saw all the reviews on Amazon and typically people loved it or hated it. I hated it within a few pages. I knew I was going to write a review about the book within the first few pages too. While I have never published a book, I am a writer and I know what good writing looks like- and it's definitely not this series.<br /><br />I kept thinking what the worst part of the series was? What was one thing I would change that could legitimately make the books worth reading? Why did I hate it so much? Finally I've come to a conclusion- the repetition.<br /><br />If James would take out all of the repetition (biting of the lip, \\"Holy crap/cow/f***/etc., Mr/Mrs. Grey (third book), emails) and much, much more, then the books would definitely be better off. The sex scenes were even repetitive and thereby boring. Different instruments used but I always thought, \\"wait a second, I just read this scene three pages ago!\\" It's infuriating. Use different words too! Have you ever heard of a thesaurus?! It's a writer's most helpful tool when they're stumbling with creativity!<br /><br /> Don't get me wrong, the repetition is just one of the many, many annoying qualities of the series (Grey's abusive nature, Ana being so easily distracted in an argument by sex, Grey using sex as a distraction in an argument, etc.) but in general there's so much repetition that James could've done without some sex scenes and taken out her handy-dandy thesaurus and made this series at least 20 times better.<br /><br />I have agreed with all the other negative arguments and won't spend any more time bringing up my complaints- I have a friend who I forced to read the series too to make sure that I'm not being overly judgment about Fifty Shades (I'm not, just for the record).<br /><br />To those who question why I read the entire series even though I hated it: I can't start a book without finishing it. And I can't start a series without finishing it. I also wondered what all the hullabaloo on Pinterest was about (by the way can we get some haters of Fifty Shades on Pinterest that I can repin??) and figured, why not? It was awful and I wanted to throw my iPad several times because I was so frustrated. But I made it through alive *applaud*.<br /><br />I hate the idea of having a movie to go with it. Every book to movie ever created (with the exception of the Harry Potter series and Lord of the Rings, respectively) has always been a bastardized version of the book. So, let's imagine how awful the movie will be.
0425263908|5.0|Very Good!Great details about the extra people! If you liked \\"50\\", You'll Really enjoy This One!<br />Oh,Yea! Get This One!
145168939X|2.0|It's ironic that you have a film and book, which has undertones of anti-capitalism, depending upon its own success on capitalism. Perhaps if the producers, artists and writers are really against the free market they should just avoid any marketing of the book or film-no promoting, no funding or even profiting - since all these activities usually associated with capitalism have no redeeming value.  Now that might have made a more interesting statement than this vapid novel.
0345803485|1.0|This book was the worst purchase I ever made in the literari world, after reading half this trash<br />I tried to give the book away, no one wants it.

0618918248|3.0|Obviously an Amazon review isn't the best place to address belief in God so I'll limit my review to the effectiveness of the book.  This book seems like it's addressed towards people who feel that most organized religion is based on fiction but still serves a grand function (I don't think anyone who believes in the inerrancy of the Bible is going to really bother reading this).  So the question to me is does Dawkins answer two key questions: does religion do more harm than good and without religion in our lives in general, can we expect humans to act morally and advance society.<br /><br />I think he clearly fails to answer the first question properly.  He wastes too much time with anecdotal attacks of the likes of Jerry Falwell...pretty much everyone who reads this book is going to have a negative opinion of the hypocrisy of certain religious people, why even bother with these examples.  His addressing of the question of the evils of the atheistic Stalin also don't pass the sniff test for me.  He basically says \\"Stalin was atheist but it's wrong to assume he did bad things because he was an atheist\\".  Fair point...but then shouldn't we give the benefit of the doubt to evils done in the name of religion as well.  He kind of touches on this point but doesn't do enough to satisfy the answer.  Any good that comes out of religion would have come anyway, any bad that comes is because religion makes people do bad.<br /><br />I also don't think he does an effective job of addressing how a moral society can exist without some belief in a higher power.  He constantly brings up Thomas Jefferson being anti-religious, but doesn't ever seem to mention that Jefferson himself wrote about rights being bestowed to us by \\"our Creator\\".  He provides some good biological evidence for why we may act selfless, but I just think he fails to answer the grander point of what a society without religion would look like and if it would be truly be better.<br /><br />Don't get em wrong...most ofthis book is an effective argument and I thought he does a nice job laying out the facts.  But it seemed incomplete to me and I still remain unconvinced that religion does more harm than good.  I can see how he can convince an individual that being religious is silly and just focus on morality, but I think anyone reading this book in the first place feels that way to begin with.  I'm not sure he really changed my mind about anything which means the book is somewhat of a failure to me.
0061438294|5.0|Joe Navarro brought the most incredible real life scenarios about lie detection, stress, body language and interviewing (not interrogation) techniques. This former FBI agent came from Cuba to the US without speaking a word of English as a small boy. He observed people and used gestures to communicate. It was the strong basis for leading him into a career of law enforcement and now motivational and educational speaking.<br /><br />Though there are bound to be a considerable amount of people interested in Navarro's teachings for improving their poker skills, I'm more interested in the criminal behavorist. You can look up Navarro to find out about his poker lectures and books.<br /><br />This book is one of the best cited culminations of research I have ever seen. I never once felt that I was reading a thesis as I have with other books that had far less source material. WHAT EVERY BODY IS SAYING has two and a half pages of source material backing up what Navarro said.<br /><br />Another impressive point to make is that Navarro repeatedly reminds people that every body flinch, twitch and shrug is not a sign of deception. People move. They adjust. They blink. Every movement can be taken in context after a baseline is established. I believe most people who conduct interviews, such as HR hiring managers and law enforcement or investigative journalists, honestly don't care about the truth; they care about the answer they want. Whatever will provide cause to have someone fired or indicate that a person was uncomfortable when asked about their kidnapped child is information that will close their cases. Navarro, however is interested in the truth not the best story.
0425263908|5.0|I loved this book I read it in 5 days I couldn't wait to find out what happend next. I love these types of books they hold my interest if a book doesn't keep my interest it'll take me forever to read it.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Below is my original review for Rock of Ages.  I just want to add one small note:  I bought the DVD and I also downloaded the movie to my Apple TV through iTunes.  The difference is that the DVD was just like the movie I saw in the theater.  The one I downloaded was the extended version (about 15 additional minutes).  (On iTunes you have both versions to choose from) Either way it's a great movie, but the extended version has 2 scenes that were left out of the theater version, along with several \\"little\\" things that weren't in the theaters.  The 2 main scenes were of Julianne Hough dancing in a \\"dream\\" sequence with Diego Boneta, and Julianne and Tom Cruise dancing and singing together.  The dancing actually is a little risqué, but I still think it is really great.  I definitely like the extended version the best.<br /><br />I went to this movie last night for the 4th time.  I loved it the first time, and every time I see it I love it more than the time before!  I would go see it every day if I could.  Ever since I first heard about it over a year ago I've been counting the days until it came out, although I just couldn't wrap my mind around Tom Cruise as a rock star.  Well, he certainly is!!!  He was sensational as Stacie Jaxx.  Who knew Tom Cruise could, not just sing, but  PERFORM  like that?!?!  And Julianne Hough is amazing!  I've always been in awe of her dancing, and now we find out she can sing and act also!!!  Actually the whole cast was incredible!  I thought the character played by Paul Giamatti was somewhat despicable (I suppose someone had to be) so I could have done without that, but he did play the role really well.  And Russell Brand was hilarious!!!  As for Diego Boneta - I don't know where he came from, but I bet we'll be seeing, and hearing, a lot more of him!  He was GREAT!  Alec Baldwin, Malin Akerman, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mary J Blige, they were all magnificent - as was the movie as a whole!<br /><br />I thought this movie was beyond GREAT!The music was already great, but even greater in this movie since all the actors did their own singing!  It's a real \\"feel good\\" movie.  Not only is it hard to not just get up and dance and sing along while you're watching it, it has you dancing and singing out of the theater!  My mother (who will be 85 next month) even loved it!  She's seen it twice herself!  Everyone should see this movie!  As for the not-so-great reviews it's gotten, either the critics didn't actually see it, or they have a twisted idea of what is just plain ole make-you-feel-good, uplifting, fun - and funny - entertainment!  Believe it or not, there actually are a lot of people who would rather watch something as magnificent as Rock of Ages than a bunch of violence and gore!  I learned years ago not to listen to what critics say.  99% of the time they don't have a clue what they're talking about!<br /><br />So to wrap it up, it was INCREDIBLE!!!  I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I thought this book was alwful.  It was so degrading and very disturbing to me to read about this young girl who would allow a man to dominate and control her without any explaination other than because it was what he wanted.  I couldnt wait to finish it...if I hadnt been reading it on my Ipad I would have thrown it in the garbage!

Even with the apologia at the end of 4, it was still not a very good book. Book 5 is getting back to speed ... we'll see...it's getting back to the characters I want to know about (tho, C1 totally baffled me). Oh. I'm a Tyrion fan.

030758836X|1.0|I don't understand why so many people love this book and are recommending it to others to read. There is no point to the book. The main characters are horrible people. How can you like a book with no one to root for? It got better in the second part after the \\"twist\\", which I saw coming. SPOILER ALERT...But then ended almost the way it started off, 2 miserable people not in love with eachother anymore, but are still married for some reason. The book didn't make sense. Why would someone want to be with someone so crazy? The author just focused on the \\"twist\\" in the story and didn't care about how the story turned out. Why are people buying her other books? I will never buy another one of her books! What a waste of my time and money!
B0088XXCZ6|1.0|I have always been a Fiona fan, so when I found out she was coming out with a new album, I was excited.  I finally purchased it only to have one of the biggest disappointments of all times.  Half of the album makes no sense, with her trying to be \\"artsy\\" releasing an album of random noises and in the words of Randy Jackson \\"Pitchy\\" lyrics.  I had the album for a day only to give it to my mom who returned it to me after having equally negative reaction.  DO NOT BUY.  It sounds as if she is on drugs throughout most of the album, leading to serious disappoint from a now EX-fan.
034580404X|1.0|all I can say is this is probably the worst writing i have ever encountered...and it's quite boring...I skimmed through most of the book and never finished it. Read it out loud if you want a good laugh!!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This is just an amazing book. Not worth Missing :) it keeps you hooked to the book till the end :)
0385737955|5.0|I love this book and recommend it heartily, but there is one glaring mistake which is repeated throughout.<br /><br />Mr. Dashner, unconscious people cannot eat or drink.  They cannot be spoon-fed anything.<br /><br />Eating and drinking are not reflexes that happen without conscious control.  Putting food or liquids into the mouth of an unconscious person can kill them.  Nothing you put into their mouth will end up in their stomach, but it could get into their lungs.
1476712042|4.0|The First 20%<br />This book goes straight in at the deep end. Abby visits an underground fight with her BFF America and America's boyfriend, Shepley. Shepley's cousin and flatmate is Travis. Travis wins the fight but not before he hits his opponent so hard that the blood flies all over Abby's cardigan forcing him to look in her direction. As soon as eye contact is made he approaches her. From here on in Travis and Abby begin their connection. It's not a relationship nor is it friendship but its clear they enjoy being around one another. Within the first 18% of this book my emotions were all torn and twisted with the angst and hurt that these two main characters managed to fling at each other but it was actually enjoyable that I couldn't stop at any cost.<br /><br />The Main Characters<br />Abby has a past which doesn't really get discussed in great length until midway through the book. She's turned away from her old life and is sincerely trying to be everything that her old life wasn't. I liked Abby a lot. Her weakness wasn't that she couldn't resist Travis because she could and did. Her main weakness was that Travis reminded her so much of her old life that she began to miss it including the high's and thrills that came with it (I won't tell you what they are for spoilers sake!). Abby could cope with Travis because she'd lived with people like him all her life. A very strong character.<br /><br />Travis is all about the now. Fighting is something he's good at, and it helps pay the rent and pay for all the nice things in life that a student needs. He drinks a lot, has sex a lot with a different woman every time and seems unable to make any sort of female emotional connection at all. We find out later why that is and it isn't as bad as the story tries to imply. But because of Abby's attitude towards him and the fact that she actually seems to enjoy his company rather than his looks or charm something in Travis changes. He lets her into his life. But unfortunately his possessiveness becomes his undoing.<br />Travis isn't written as a character that you should really like or hate. Most reviews hate him, others love him. Either way if his character and attitude affect you then it says something about the author and her ability to make you feel something. As I was reading I had a soft spot for him but he is such a dangerous person I did feel uncomfortable sometimes and worried for Abby.

B005RUUUAI|5.0|The Walking Dead, is an amazing story, which contains so many twists and turns.....It hooked me from the first episode.<br />The actors, portray their characters, flawlessly....so much so, that it made me question what I would do, if this happened, in reality.  The Walking Dead, truly has all the emotions.....you'd want in a great story.  The emotions you'll feel, while watching, can overwhelm you, as you begin to identify with the characters.  And this story DOES make a person contemplate what would happen to society, and it's morals, as things like this, might happen.  We discuss this series and what we would do, at my employment....everyone is hooked.<br />I can't wait until the third season comes out.....the continuing saga, of a handful of survivors who hold hope in their hearts, despite the enormity of their situation....is enlightening, in ways you can't imagine until you see this series.<br />Awesome effects, picture, and sound quality.  Can't get enough.  Hopefully, the second season of The Walking Dead, will be out on BluRay real soon.  I downloaded that season on my computer.  Shared the first season with my family, now they are addicted....but it is difficult for a large group of people to sit around my laptop...lol.
B007XF0VW2|4.0|I bought the blu ray after seeing this film on a transatlantic flight and embarrassing myself silly by laughing out loud (which I just don't do on a plane). I could so identify with these losers as I was one, too in high school (I grew up well-adjusted and happy, thank you). I didn't like the Hangover yet I love this. Why? The directorial style: It just feels so much more natural and unforced; there's a sense of immediacy. And the three unknown leads are simply terrific and likable. And never have I felt I was at a party in any film as I feel it with this one (this really kicks in with the blu ray 5.1 surround sound). Yes, the story gets outrageous near the end but that was also the fun of it. The film has absolutely no moral or redemptive value (the music is so sexist but so very right for the film), yet there was something about it that made me feel like a teen again!

B0079XPUOW|2.0|Set on a bad 21st century rip-off of Star Trek, the young ensigns aboard the starship Intrepid discover that their ship has an astonishing turnover of junior officers.  They soon set out to investigate why so many of their shipmates are destined to die, while the senior officers (and one dashing young lieutenant) survive unscathed. The answer leads to a breaching of the fourth wall and a quest that draws its cues from a certain Star Trek cliche that I won't reveal here.<br /><br />There were two ways John Scalzi's Redshirts could have gone: 1) it could have been a brilliant and clever deconstruction of the plot contrivances of Star Trek; 2) it could have been a one-note satire, too smug and self-satisfied for its own good. Unfortunately, Redshirts takes path #2.<br /><br />I really wanted to like the novel (and three codas) -- in the hands of a stronger writer, this idea could have become a multilayered satire, but Scalzi is unfortunately not up to the task. Instead, the Star Trek jokes are obvious, and the pseudo-Trek universe of the Intrepid is significantly less inspired than the film Galaxy Quest, to which the novel has more than a passing similarity. Unlike Galaxy Quest, which was a loving send-up of Star Trek (and indeed is more entertaining than the Next Generation films), Redshirts seems at times to have a smug contempt for the source material. It focuses on the bad science and plot problems of Trek, rather than the sociopolitical commentary and iconic characters that made Trek great.<br /><br />In many ways, Redshirts feels like something Scalzi wrote for fun and never intended to publish. It lacks the creative heft of much of his other work and is probably not worth purchasing at full price. It's not terrible, but it's not worth the brief amount of time it takes to read it.

0416615902|4.0|This was a nice story, and a lot different from the animated movie. This surprised me, because I really liked the movie and in my experience, the book is typically better. If you are not familiar with the story, it is more of a young adult read, and filled with fantasy, magic and good humor. The main character, Sophie, is well-played out in the book, as are Howl and the other characters. I really appreciated the imagination put into this, that included the seven-league boots, and the door that you could use to go to one of four different places. Highly recommended.
031237593X|3.0|History enthusiasts and those who enjoy Hillary Mantel's best selling historical fiction novels Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies will almost certainly enjoy Sharon Kay Penman's The Sunne in Splendour.  Whereas, Mantel presents a more plausible rehabilitation of the often vilified Thomas Cromwell in her two novels of the early Tudor court, Penman attempts to go much farther with Richard III.  This novel is interesting and extremely well written.  With about 930 pages, this novel will entrance history enthusiasts with a \\"can't put it down\\" lure.  According to Penman's mostly plausible assessment, Richard was an honorable, brave warrior and sensitive, loving husband, brother and father.  What she also reveals on almost every page is the savagely cruel and unforgiving atmosphere in which Richard grew into manhood and in which he came to become a more than effective participant in the game of power politics.  Where Penman stretches her assessment far beyond the point of plausibility is her elaborate and unconvincing moral/legal justification for Richard's seizure of power and his acquittal for the deaths of the \\"Princes in the Tower\\" (his nephews, King Edward V and the Duke of York).<br /><br />Upon the sudden and somewhat unexpected death of 40 year old King Edward IV in April 1483, the King's only surviving brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became Protector for 12 year old King Edward V.  The mutual antagonism between the dowager Queen, Elizabeth Woodville, and Richard created a situation where Richard had good reason to suspect that the new King and his Woodville relations would dispose of him and his family (wife and son) as soon as they achieved effective power.  Richard seized power in June 1483 by declaring the Queen's marriage to the King to have been unlawful and all of their offspring to be bastards and also by the bloody elimination of all Woodville allies and relations.  Richard declared himself to be King and had the two young sons of his elder brother committed to the Tower where they were murdered (probably with the tacit approval of Richard) before the end of 1483.<br /><br />Penman's depiction of Richard as a thoroughly honorable fellow who was surprised by the marriage irregularity and took the only honorable course open to him of seizing power - and who was completely baffled by the murder of his nephews - stretches the imagination beyond the breaking point.  Edward IV had been married to Elizabeth Woodville for nearly 20 years and it is ridiculous to imagine that word of such an irregularity would have remained a deep, dark secret until 1483 when Margaret of Anjou, the Earl of Warwick and/or King Louis XI would have dug tirelessly for such dirt (and used it) many years before in their battles against Edward IV.  Richard had been pledged to protect young King Edward V, but realized that deposing him and the Woodville regime would be the only alternative to death for himself and his own family.  Some pretext for the illegitimacy of Edward IV's offspring was a necessity for Richard to claim the safety and security of the throne for himself and his family.  The death of the princes was also a necessary security measure.  However, with the death by disease of his son and heir and his queen in 1484-85, Richard was seeking marriage with Edward IV's eldest daughter (Elizabeth) as was Henry Tudor in his claim to the throne despite her alleged bastard status.  After Richard was killed in battle at Bosworth on August 22, 1485, Elizabeth married Henry VII and was mother of Henry VIII.  So much for the \\"pretext\\" of illegitimacy for Edward IV's children that afforded Richard's right to seize power.<br /><br />Penman's whitewash of Richard III is both entertaining and plausible up to a point, and it certainly refutes the total vilification presented by Shakespeare and other Tudor sympathizers.  But the bottom line is that this is an extremely entertaining and readable book.  You will have to do your own research and makeup your own mind as to its plausibility.  That is also a major attraction of this book.up your own mind as to its plausibility.  That is also a major attraction of this book.

B0040QDMBE|4.0|Economics is not science. These are some of the first words echoed by my economics professor. True at the time, and more or less the same now. However, we now have the history, results and data to support, either good or bad policies proposed by both economist and politicians today. This is where this book hits its stride.<br />Unlike Paul Krugman's, thoroughly enjoyable \\"The Conscience of a Liberal\\" which concentrates on the inequality and distribution of wealth, Mr. Chang's book is much more comprehensive. Indeed, this book looks at the \\"Golden Era\\" and the distribution of wealth, but goes much further.<br />The core to this book, for me, is the first chapter. It dispels the myths about what a free market really is. The best and most obvious example is the crisis of 2008. Left to its own devices, without regulation, the financial markets nearly took the world to the edge of collapse. In the same chapter he blows up the theory of trickle down economics and why is does not work. This sets the tone for the rest of the book.<br />There is a lot more. Particularly interesting is his ability to look at economics through a global filter explaining how government policy shapes economies. Policies on labor laws, immigration, government support, protectionism etc. are all discussed with comparative and historical facts.<br />The book is far reaching and comprehensive in its approach. Anyone with a basic or past interest in economics should pick this up. Economics is still not science but we now have the evidence and history to debate any new proposals from our politicians and economist.

I always find myself trying to find the right words to articulate how running has become a part of who I am.

I first learned of Scott, like many others, through reading Christopher McDougal's \\"Born To Run\\". His story resognated with me and inspired me to continue running and to expand my food knowledge. I love how at the end of each chapter he includes a recipe and a story about how that recipe came about. \\"Eat and Run\\" is a book that runners and non runners can enjoy.

145162607X|5.0|I really enjoy all of Philippa Gregory's books.  It is amazing that I can read this book about Anne, and I am wholeheartedly championing her cause.  Not even a year ago I read Philippa Gregory's book about Anne's nemesis Elizabeth Woodville, and I hated Anne (That takes a truly talented author to pull off).  This book really opened my eyes to Anne's dilemmas, and I saw a whole new side to her that I had never considered.  The book grabs you from the very beginning and you cannot put it down.  Someone else mentioned that because Gregory has written many books about this time period some of the stories feel repetitive, this was not the case for me.  I enjoy reading about the same battle, but seeing the point of view from the other side.  Anne lived a truly amazing life and she was not just the Kingmaker's daughter, but also she had to stand on her own two feet and work to get the life she wanted.  This book is a must read!

B0034G4P1W|2.0|IMHO a certain bare minimum of logic is required by even the silliest of stories; this astonishing embarrassment doesn't even come close.  How could the people responsible for [[ASIN:B002DPVI0Q Wallace & Gromit]] and [[ASIN:B000M343BC Flushed Away]] have produced this disaster?<br /><br />Let's start with the utterly unengaging hero, The Pirate Captain (That's his name not his title).  Utterly incompetent and a good deal less intelligent than the pet Dodo Bird he thinks is a parrot, The Captain (for short) is nevertheless beloved by his crew for no discernible reason other than the fact that he is willing to tolerate their own incompetence.  (They make [[ASIN:B00005JM6A The Pirates of Penzance]] look like the undead pirates of [[ASIN:B00005JM5E Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]] in comparison).<br /><br />The Captain's pirating life of beard growing, singing sea shanties, waving shiny cutlasses, futile attempts at gathering loot, and Ham Night is finally exposed to his own eyes as the laughingstock it is to real pirates by the sudden realization that he's never won and never will win the annual Pirate of the Year contest because winning is based on the amount of loot gathered, and he hasn't gathered any.  EVER.  However, the ridicule from other pirates provokes him into entering the contest again anyway, and what follows is the single most ineffective voyage in the history of piracy until he captures Charles Darwin who recognizes that Polly is a thought-to-be-extinct Dodo Bird and assures The Captain that Polly will be sufficient to win the Scientist of the Year contest and \\"untold riches\\".  Putting two and two together and coming up with five, The Captain allows himself to be conned into sailing for England, despite Queen Victoria's virulent hatred and prosecution of pirates where only Extremely Stupid Luck (The Captain isn't bright enough to have Dumb Luck.) saves him (and Polly) again and again from the ludicrous yet unfunny (hard to do but the movie makers manage) evil schemes of Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria (?).<br /><br />Though the occasional joke or running gag works, which earned it an extra star from me, this movie is mostly a collection of unfunny bits, mistimed jokes, inappropriate humor for children, forgotten plot elements (The reason one of the pirates is a woman badly disguised as a man?

In an Adventure with Scientists: A Novel]], except that it turns out he WAS the screenwriter so instead I'll be deleting all of his books from my Wish List.  Frankly, the best bit in the entire movie is Bobo the Man-Panzee, a chimpanzee Darwin taught to communicate with note cards.  The gags involving said note cards are invariably hilarious.<br /><br />Not recommended for either children or adults.
B0086700CM|5.0|I just keep playing this game. The graphics are very good and the game just makes you keep coming back for more. Mean,maniacal,monster monkeys, What Fun!
B005ZUR724|4.0|other than not having a proper guide to controls, its a great game. a solid mmo that is portable. ill change rating to a five star if they add a guide book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A very fine novel well written and entertaining throughout. I hope the next book will be available soon so the adventures can continue. Character development was excellent as was the dialogue and interwoven plots. I will purchase the next book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game and play this game all the time and it is really fun to play all the time
B005LAIIPS|4.0|I wanted to see \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" but lost to this picture. It turned out to be nicely presented.<br /><br />This Bourne refresh does a fine job of living up to its legacy partly through the acting abilities of Jeremy Renner who does a great job of playing the guy who can emotionally disarm people and/or even calm them down, as well as through the acting abilities of Ed Norton, who  plays the main antagonist trying to shut down a special operation gone bad. Norton's character keeps the pace moving when we are not focused on Renner's \\"adventures\\" in the film.<br /><br />It's a fun, sometimes introspective cat and mouse picture that spans all over the globe with some definitive focuses in various parts of Asia which felt like a fresh enough touch.<br /><br />Action scenes are creative enough and the story is pretty good for its plotting and payoffs (look for the gold watch he gets off the Aussie and then changes wrists at the end) rather than its overall idea. That's probably a good thing as the really good ideas of Hollywood are sometimes poorly executed. Stringing the various elements together is much harder to pull off.<br /><br />It's hard to talk about the story without giving things away so I won't say much of anything. That said, if you want spoilers read below. The trailer talked about DNA and genetic manipulations so you should go in without any general surprises in that area.<br /><br />Ed Norton's character, one of the distant antagonists, had the best metaphorical dialogue. It also starred a number of known names which included: Albert Finney, an older Rachel Weisz and Joan Allen.<br /><br />The budget for this film was $130M and after only several days it has already made a bit over $88M at the Box Office. Impressive by Box Office standards but don't expect it to get Best Picture.<br /><br />The Jason Bourne character incidentally was created by novelist Robert Ludlum though this particular move title was based on a novel by Eric Van Lustbader. Themovies deviate greatly from the actual novels.<br /><br />There are number of homages to the movie trilogy especially in the music. Notice the ending song by Moby.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; ACTION SCENES: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2012 (at the movies); OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus.<br /><br />SPOILERS: I liked the idea with the pills and how the special ops needed them to survive (though this is by no means a super original idea). The ending finale had a good enough action scene in which the female lead got to control how things would go down versus the enemy special ops dude. Obviously, these special ops were all modified. I liked how the enemy special ops actually stopped to sniff for the main character and then tracked him on scent.<br /><br />I suppose I will always know Rachel Weisz from the first two \\"Mummy\\" movies of the trilogy with Brendan Fraser so that look has stuck with me. I didn't recognize her until the credits rolled. Sorry, Rachel.<br /><br />Like Jason Bourne this character is clever and fast to take in information and the environment around him.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Great cast of characters and a good murder mystery especially with a ghostly twist.  I love the Louisiana bayou setting.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Good free game to pass the time. Just wish they offered more puzzles for free. Or at least less femanine free puzzles
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like it very very very very very much but the control take some getting used too otherwise its fun
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|this game is keel but it was to much money it got boring because I lost all my money that I paid real money for when I was always getting hospitalized but back to the subject it fitted on my kindle fire with out deleteing any games and I have a lot of games
B005UBNKWO|2.0|I wanted to install a new fan on my phenom II 555 black edition cpu.  I accidentally bent a pin so decided to buy this processor since I figured it was a good way to futureproof myself at a good price point.  Wow!  I haven't seen any increase.  Honestly, my system seems slower.  Granted, I am running Windows XP sp3 but surely the addition of 2 cores and 14mb of cache should have increased performance.  Am I missing something here?  If so, let me know.  Yea, yea, I know I'm running XP but it recognizes all six cores but I can't tell the difference in speed or performance.  Boot time seems slower and shut down time drives me nuts so I just turn it off with the power button.  This will be my last AMD product.  I am moving on to Intel.  They seem to really have their act together these days.  AMD?  Not so much.
0425263908|2.0|I wasn't too sure about reading fifty shades of gray because if the reviews it had. But all my friends said it was good so I gave in and read it, and was surprised how page turning it was. When reading the reviews to this book, I was uncertain but bought it anyway. I'm not even 20 pages in and there are so many similarities to fiftyy shades of gray it's pathetic.
B008BHH606|5.0|This is another outstanding album by The Offspring.  There are many songs that remind you of classic Offspring songs and some new songs that fit right in with today's music.  Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk) is a classic Offspring comedic song that has a modern beat and a funny theme.  OC Guns has very catchy lyrics and riffs.  My twin 5 year olds love to sing parts of this song and make me play it constantly.  Luckily they don't speak Spanish since there are some explicit Spanish words.
B000B5MI3Q|3.0|I wanted a simple divers watch and while searching amazon became quite fascinated with automatic self winding watches.<br /><br />After narrowing down my search by color, size, price, strap type etc., it came down to two very similar watches - this Seiko watch and the Orient Men's CEM65004B 'Black Mako'  watch (also sold on amazon) which was half the price.<br /><br />I finally settled on the Seiko since its a more known  and trusted brand and seemed worth the extra hundred bucks. I bought it well aware that self winding watches have trouble keeping accurate time.<br /><br />But I was quite shocked after having this watch for a month or so and noticing that the watch is gaining about 5 minutes every week. I don't know if thats the average, but it feels like a lot and I now have to set the time back ever so often. I'm even considering returning the watch.<br /><br />The watch is great otherwise. It looks nice (simple and uncluttered) and works as described. I'm particularly happy with its glow in the dark capabilities. Even after several hours of darkness it retains its brightness unlike a cheaper casio I previously had which would go dark in an hour. The movement of the rotating bezel is smooth and firm.<br /><br />Love it, but I wish it didn't gain so much of time or came with a way to caliberate it.
B007R41E8O|5.0|It is a good game.  I got hooked on it from the start.  It's worth 99&cent;.  If you are playing on a kindle fire you can enlarge the hidden object scenes so that you  can get a better look.  Just tap the screen.
B003YDXCZU|5.0|I was looking all over for a book on how to use a whiteboard more effectively.<br />I've found that in my workplace in silicon valley, everyone appreciates people who can use the whiteboard effectively to demonstrate ideas, track status or discuss problems. Interviews, meetings, trainings, demonstrations - you can express yourself so much better if you use a whiteboard. But information with some basic guidelines and a framework on how to draw was hard to come by - and almost all the folks I've worked with are no better at drawing or explaining themselves visually than I am.<br /><br />Then coincidently around the same,  Dan Roam was invited in to give an hour long lecture at my company. I was quite fascinated when I watched the lecture- this guy really knew how to do it! As soon as I learned that he had books out there, i bought em all and I'm now half way through the first one.<br /><br />I really really like the way the book is structured and the examples he's used. Like any new skill one learns, you have to make it a point to practice - even copy the diagrams in the first few chapters that he uses to get you used to drawing.<br /><br />The layout and design of this book is very well done. You do feel like you're reading a book written by someone with a design background. The material is very lucid, non-academic and the examples are compelling.<br /><br />Will add more to the review once I've completed the book.

B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love this series.  It captured me with the first book, The Outlander, and I will be waiting for the promised 2013 new book release while reading all in between!!  I miss the character Ian, but I am sure he will surface again somewhere before the story is finished.  Very skillfully written, rich narrative dispersed with historical facts as well as just enough science fiction. :-)  Try it, you'll love it!!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good game. I really enjoy playing. I would like to see it get a bit more harder to keep me thinking.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Not your typical golf game. Lots of strategy and challenges along the way. Plenty of different courses to keep you occupied and entertained.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I usually do not read fiction, but I found these books beyond entertaining. Regardless of other's negative reviews I read them. Some words/phrases were redundant but other than that excellent. Plus at the end of book 3 it says, 'that's all for now'... People who call it porn do not understand what porn is. In my opinion, this is not porn. Real page turner, at the end of book 1, started book 2 right away-wanting to know what's next!! Same when I finished book 2.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing solitaire on my Kindle Fire.  Such a challange to win every game even though I never do.  The colors are good and the game moves along very fast.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What a great calculator!  So easy to use.  The large font is particularly nice.  I recommend this app to everyone.
B003TH3K6W|5.0|Mr Fillion fits his character so well he's not so much acting as he is having fun in front of a camera. The writing and acting of even the bit characters in this series is top notch. If you are a Firefly fan you might even catch a few references thrown in a few episodes.
B007MJKOY4|1.0|so slow, so boring. surprisingly dull given the accomplished cast. Watched about 40 minutes (twice due to loss of connection) before giving up due to boredom stupor.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|By far best full fledged photo editing app I have used that is also simple and not at bloated app. If you like instagram this has those type effects and more.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|Four stars, the ONLY reason for this injustice is because the episode 'The Old and the Beautiful', is totally screwed...is any one else's like that too? I just received this in the mail, so it has nothing to do with neglect of any of the DVD's. Other than this minor annoyance, I completely and utterly love Daria.<br /><br />BUY THIS FOOLS!!!
B008MM9630|5.0|I have a lot of fun with this game.For the frist time I bought extra things. And I'm still playing it every day after a week.That's a first also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good way to waste time and it was fun. Just started playing so I'm still on the first few games so I'm hoping it gets better.
B002RI90WM|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was a joy to read that brought tears, laughter and a new appreciation for those doggy pets. I now wonder what cats are thinking...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really fun and very addictive. cool gameplay. if I had anything bad to say it would be that your energy takes forever to replenish and it drives me crazy but other then that I love it.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Absolutely excellent album.  I wish it would last longer.  Hopefully it won't wear out as I play and replay.  Mellow and earthy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|As my subject indicates, I was plesantly surprised that there is a romance story entwined in the lines of this somewhat graphic, sexual story.  Having heard comments and reviews through the media, I was hesitant to read or purchase the book -- thinking it would be much like a pornographic movie, of little susbstance.<br /><br />Pleasantly surprised to find that it has a legitimate storyline and invoked me to order the second of the trilogy, which I am currently enjoying at least as much as I enjoyed the first.<br /><br />The author did a great job.
B007JOM7C4|3.0|I must say that as a 29 year old indie rock fan and I think that Katy Perry is a wonderful, talented singer.  Her singles get my old ass moving.  The singles 'California Girls,\\" \\"Part of Me,\\" and \\"Firework\\" are amazing pop songs and make me actually believe in the future of pop music.  However, this is somewhat deflated when I hear songs like \\"Peacock.\\"  I wonder if Katy Perry herself was totally behind that song or if she thought, like I do, that this song was a shock song meant to cater to an increasingly sexually explicit pop audience.  I bought the whole album, but slightly less than half of this album made its way to my iPod.  Dear Katy, stay true to yourself in your songwriting, please.  When I listen to some of the filler songs, it makes me wonder who's really behind them?
B0000CFW87|5.0|Have been adding approximately 1 Josh Groban Cd every couple of months to my collection. So, this was, as always, a wonderful addition.  He is so fabulous, I can only give positive input on any of his releases.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Better story line than the first one. Have to finish the trilogy. Still steamy, but not as much s&m. Enjoyed it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book! I bought it a few days ago, and I've already read it twice.  There's just something about Travis & Abby that I've fallen in love with...even after I've put the book down I find myself thinking about them, as if they're real people and I know the, lol. Seriously, this is a awesome book! The sex scenes aren't like your typical romance novel either, the love feels right, and you go threw the emotions with each character. I can't wait until \\"walking disaster\\" is released in April!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good time waster. worth the dl. I'm not very far yet but so far so good. enjoy!
1881273156|5.0|I heard good things about this book from a medical doctor who is a leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He taught a lesson largely based on this book. That's why I ordered it and I am reading it now. The copy you shipped me was everything I hoped for! Thanks, -Eddy
B002N2SYWE|5.0|The movie came on time and with no problems. It was in one of those bubble wrapped lined manila envelope. The movie itself was still in its plastic wrapping so obviously, being that it was unopened, the disc has no troubles playing and no skipping or anything like that. I personally hated the movie but it was for my boyfriend and he was happy so that's what counts.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are my first headphones from AKG and I must say, they are fantastic! I'm hearing instruments that I've never heard before even on Bose QC15s.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|1. it had lots of bugs such as sometime the game freezes and you some how are level 23 and yet you have to start the game all over from the beginning<br />2. it is very hard to find the bombs because of a glitches the might not even be there until you go back there again which kills your point value<br />3.the web slinging is hard<br />4. and it doesn't cat h until the 3rd time you press it<br />5 the combos is not really well explained and even though you unlock it you still don't know how to do it<br />6. it is sucks worst than a windows 95 when it came out
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Martin in this book keeps his power as an outstanding fictional world creator with strong characters and subtles attitudes. The \\"game of thrones\\" serie is an excellent reading also to understand some of the human values and society.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|most levels are pretty easy and it makes time go by faster...great buddy game....very colorful and easy to use ^.^
B000005RUV|4.0|The only thing that i dindt like was the extended version of Everything she wants, it's the extended version not the radio version.  But it's cool though.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Big time fan of Alien and Aliens and the other two are just okay. But as a collection and the presentation/quality of the content as a whole, make up for the lack of power the last two films have. The five stars go to, Alien, Aliens, the content and the packaging, which is beautiful.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app for planning ones day.<br /><br />some time your a bit low on the temp.  but over all Great
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|We replaced 60 watt bulbs in an open 5-light fixture in a dining room. The fixture's bulbs point downward. We are very very pleased with the new bulbs. Very good lighting.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This trilogy is worth reading. I couldn't honestly give this a 5 star rating because the writing is awful and the editing is just as bad. If the eyeglass wearing conscious, the inner goddess, and all that smirking had been removed I'd have given 4.5 just for that. One thing that allowed me to read all 3 books without grinding my teeth is that fairly early into the first book I realized this reads like a teenager girls diary. That made it much less painless for me when I approached it that way.<br /><br />If you can get through the first 2 books, and you must read them or you will be completely lost, I think you will agree this was worth it. Finally you get the rest of the story. Christian's childhood is filled in more as well as what really happened with him and Mrs. Robinson. You find out why a person has targeted Christian and Ana, who the accomplice is, and why they help. I won't go into book description because too many others have covered that very well and I won't give spoilers.<br /><br />I would like to comment on the mommy porn thing. While there is some BDSM and some sex, there really isn't as much as you would think from all the comments. There is actually more talk about the BDSM than the actual practice of it and the sex is mostly vanilla. If those topics bother you and you're still a bit interested, this is a fairly safe book to try.
160309007X|2.0|Such a weak effort, the characters at least don't have to submit to Moore's law (everyone must have sex with everyone else but not enjoy it), but then they don't do much of anything. Leave aside the deus ex device, and ignore the poor characterisation, and you are looking at Moore's dialogue. This is Alan Moore, once elegiac and stirring in his writing of Promethea, a wordsmith who could equal Tolkien... and yet where is the high art of language in this finale? GOD herself talks about \\"the women who paste up the stars\\". What? Is that meant to be the sublime speech of the creator? A teenager could write better script, this is just lazy and trite where it could easily have sent a shiver of delight out of the page. Lazy, disappointing - let these great literary figures fade back into their own worlds, please.
1400052181|5.0|I don't know how long this book has been on the best seller list although it has almost 1,200 reviews on Amazon with some 75% granting it five stars just like my review. Rarely do you find a book based in part on science and race something with such strong reader appeal especially one that is about cells, DNA, and cancer. But this is a home run I think because Skloot has combined a very interesting science story with the very personal story of Henrietta Lack's family, especially her daughter Deborah.<br /><br />For those yet unfamiliar with the story it is about Henrietta Lacks who in the early 1950's dies of cancer. During her treatment some of her cancer cells are harvested for research and for some reason are the first to grow and multiply to the point that today some 60 years later they are still being used in all types of research. Over the years they have grown in number into the billions while also becoming a multi-billion dollar plus business while helping with the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping to name just a few.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that Henrietta Lacks did not consent to having her cells used for research and her family not only did not know for years that they had been harvested, but never received any compensation for them to this day (while many others got very rich). So the book sets about telling the history of medical research in the United States which in many ways is rather god awful. I'll leave it to you to read and discover what I mean by god awful. (Skloot gives a brief history of the experimentation on African Americans along with the fear and paranoia this created in that community.)<br /><br />This is a study of ethics, morality, economics, and the needs of medical science along with their grand results through research over the past 60 years. And in a splendid \\"afterword\\" the current legal, ethical, and economic problems medical research faces moving forward. If nothing else I recommend you visit a book store or library and read this section of the book.<br /><br />I was surprised a bit by the fact that at least half of the book is somewhat a memoir with the author driving daughter Deborah around trying to find records and \\"the truth\\" about her Mother, Henrietta Lacks. They also discover along the way what happened to a sister who was sent and died in a \\"Hospital for the Negro Insane\\". This really humanizes the science and the empathy Skloot shows for the family makes for entertaining and emotional reading. Bottom line, this is a must read!
B0086700CM|4.0|I was so excited that this game became available for my Kindle and yes, it's really addicting but it lags A LOT. It gets frustrating because it causes me ( my character ) to die so please fix this asap. I always aim for a higher score but it makes it almost impossible due to the lag. Thanks.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just started using this DVD a week ago and...WOW! You work up a true sweat! I'm already staring to see changes in my body. I bought this because regular diet and walking havent helped with those few last pounds and I really wanted to get toned. My abs are starting to take shape just after a week!! Try it!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|great app; but needs to be updated as far as the &quot;apple&quot; products. needs star fruit and star fruit upgrades.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Ilike the game but the only down side is you have to wait for one of your friends on facebook to answer and it can sometimes be a while for who ever it is to respond.Over all its a good game.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|what a great read loved every word will be very sad to finish the series. i would love to be the female characters in the book and be that close to Jack. Yummmmmmm
B0086700CM|5.0|OMFG I love it but I agree when I try to jump it doent then I die I'm like,&quot; wtf just happened?!?!?!?&quot;
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These are great books. I would read them over and over again. Anyone that doesnt read you will read this.
B003LXSY60|5.0|Great stuff Love the music<br />Used the Cloud to download had a small issue but it was settled quickly no problems on this end
1451627297|5.0|I got this book for christmas and just recently got around to reading it and I'm sad I waited as long as I did because it was fantastic. There is a lot of \\"fluff\\" throughout the book which makes parts a bit of a bore but King brings everything together again and again keeping the reader on edge up until the very last pages. Great read
B005IQZB14|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Cheryl's journey on the Pacific Crest Trail.  It inspires me to walk the trail (or a portion thereof) myself.  I finished the book camping at Trillium Lake, Mt Hood, Oregon.  The next day I drove up to Timberline Lodge and walked on the trail for a ways thinking about Cheryl and her journey.  Great book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally my Kindle Fire is complete! its a great app and worth the wait! the pictures are clear and there is no residing and squinting to see anything.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I think it was worth it. Has its ups and down but I still enjoyed it just as much regardless other peoples assumptions.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|The teen characters are so easy for every kid to relate to.  From Allison the misfit, Claire the spoiled brat, John the criminal , Brian the geek, and Andrew the jock (we all had a crush on him).  It captured a real drama for almost anyone that grew up in a suburban high school and had to serve detention sitting in a library on a Saturday.  The dialogue also was perfect.  No censorship of bad language that would have been used back then.  In sum, well written, well acted, well portrayed and overall excellent film.
1468161660|4.0|Quick light read! Perfect for a beach day or quick vacation read. Loved it though! Fell in love with the characters and their chemistry!
B000G6R7B8|3.0|Gains 1 minute + per week. Pleased with appearance. Band is comfortable. Dial does not scratch. Band easily cleans with toothbrush and hand soap.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Lamaze makes quality toys!  This is my third Lamaze toy and I only wish I got them earlier.  I hang it on my boy's car seat and he just loves to play with it.  Those two little plastic rings on the tail are great for him to chew.  When it gets dirty I just threw it in the washing machine with dirty baby clothes.  Easy!
B004YOEFG8|4.0|I'm a big fan of 3D Blu-Rays. I have about 65 total so far and decided to check out a few of the IMAX titles since the prices have recently gone down and they're generally rated pretty highly.<br /><br />To start, HUBBLE is available in 4 different packages:<br /><br />DVD (2D-only)<br />Blu-Ray (2D-only)<br />Blu-Ray 3D (3D and 2D versions.. note that while described as a 2-disc set, it's a single disc with both versions)<br />Blu-Ray Combo (3D + 2D + DVD + Digital Copy)<br /><br />Make sure that when buying it you buy one of the releases which says \\"3D\\" on it. Also note this is a real Blu-Ray 3D (requiring a 3D capable Blu-Ray player and 3DTV.. not the red/blue glasses)<br /><br />With that out of the way, HUBBLE 3D clocks in at 44 minutes. At first I was a bit concerned as that didn't seem very long at all -- in reality, that's a bit of a mixed bag (at times I wish they went further into depth on some parts and at other times felt it dragged on too long).<br /><br />I did know what I was getting into with this release - a 3D IMAX film about the Hubble repair. I wasn't going into this expecting to see 45 minutes of amazing footage captured by the Hubble, but I still left somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />The film uses a variety of media - some of it being recent (2009), some being very old BBC clips, some being what looks like 1990's webcam footage and some being footage from around the original launch of the hubble. Most is presented in a way that fills the widescreen, some is presented as a small portion of the screen (sometimes what seems like 1/4 of the screen size, other times closer to 1/16 of the size), fortunately these are small.<br /><br />Despite the mixed media types, most of it is presented in 3D (I'm assuming some of it was post-converted, as it looks like it was filmed with a webcam, but it does still look good. Just not \\"as good\\" as the IMAX 3D footage from 2009).<br /><br />The video footage is very clear (2009 footage) and shows amazing detail.. this makes the 3D footage just that much more impressive. The other footage is passable.<br /><br />* THE 3D * footage is the reason you'd want the release. This title uses some amazing 3D (the credits and space footage where stars fly right towards you (probably more popout than any other release I've seen), the couple of shots of \\"hubble footage\\" are equally impressive and go on for about 5 minutes a piece (zooming in and navigating through the footage). These combined 10 minutes of footage are the reason for the 4 star review.  Lots of popout (opposed to only depth, which is very popular with many titles) and the fact that IMAX really pushes the footage (where some might have the footage barely popping out, this one is very in-your-face are the reasons to own this.<br /><br />The film itself.. I found kind of boring at most times. I didn't need to see the random cuts of the space crew just hanging out in the shuttle (in-between amazing 3D footage) - that seemed more like something that belonged in the outtakes/bloopers section of a DVD.<br />The other gripe are that they mention some troubles (a bolt is stuck or part of the camera won't go into place) but due to the odd, fixed-camera angle you can't really see what's happening (and it just immediately gets resolved. It would have been nice if there was another camera angle or more time spent on each \\"problem\\" rather than \\"Here's a problem.. and now it's fixed after several hours\\"  -- I do understand that's not the easiest thing to do in space.<br /><br />In the end, the 3D was great. Some of the best I've seen. Of the 45 minutes of footage, about 10-15 were worth watching and the other 30 seemed to drag on or were just plain un-interesting.  With that said, due to how well the 3D was, I'd still give it 4-stars as a demo.<br />If you only plan to get the 2D release (DVD or Blu-Ray) I'd give it about 2 stars (out of 5).<br /><br />If looking for the 3D release, I wouldn't suggest paying extra for the combo pack (3D+ 2D + DVD + Digital Copy) for the same reason.. the DVD/Digital copy you spend extra on will likely never be used due to the fact the 3D is what makes this release.+ 2D + DVD + Digital Copy) for the same reason.. the DVD/Digital copy you spend extra on will likely never be used due to the fact the 3D is what makes this release.
034580404X|5.0|Many of my friends had read or were reading the Fifty Shades trilogy and told me I should read it.  Of course they mentioned the bondage thing and it being erotic which didn't turn me away.  But I heard from one friend that she stopped reading it when she got the the contract part.  When she told me about it I was a little put off and didn't know if I want to read anymore.  But then another friend said I needed to get past that part and continue as it does not turn out that way and it really is a love story.  I had issues with the writing because if it would have been set in England then the wording the author used would fit in.  But being they are supposed to be in Portland and Seattle I really don't think many people their say trousers, they say pants.  Over all though I did fall in love with the books and with the characters.  I'm actually contemplating re-reading as I sort of miss Chirstian and Ana.  Silly I know but true. :)
B0012909NQ|5.0|I'm one of those \\"loved Genesis more when Peter Gabriel was with them\\" fans. Really don't care for their newer stuff. But this show was superb with plenty of their older work, well executed. Great DVD for both the Gabriel era fans and newer fans.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|A nice, solid, little gem that did not get the warm reception it deserved from the community that have celebrated much worse. Perhaps it will gain a cult status in time.
B007X15GRQ|1.0|but awful. Logic be damned. Get drunk or drugged, because then it might make sense to you. Otherwise, abandon hope. It could be a primer on what not to do.

B00005YXZH|2.0|Over a decade ago, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was my first exposure to Wilco. I listened over and over, trying to reconcile my discomfort with the critical accolades. Couldn't do it. In fact, this album turned me off to the band for a long time.<br /><br />Flash forward. Wilco is now easily one of my Top 10 favorite bands of all time. I adore the late (The Whole Love) and the early (Being There) and frequently listen to everything in between. But YHF? Still no. My least favorite in their catalog.<br /><br />I still try every few months, as some of the songs have a lot of promise. But they remind me of Altman's film \\"Popeye\\" - songs start off well enough, then sink down a druggy, self-absorbed hole. Thumbs down.<br /><br />Can't understand the enduring raves. Listen to Wilco, if you haven't. Start anywhere but here.<br /><br />Addendum Sept 2013 - so much of one's relationship with music is contextual - what's going on in your life and the culture. Music I loved once I now find unlistenable, and vice versa. This week YHF clicked in for me after more than a decade of disliking it, as discussed above. I came to it this time in the context of listening to opera, Nine Inch Nails, The National, and other Wilco...and suddenly it makes brilliant musical sense to me. I understand why I disliked it, and I understand why I now love it. Isn't that what real art is about? Not changing my rating because that was an honest evaluation at a point in time, but if I were writing a fresh review, I'd easily give 5 stars.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|loved the book it answers many questions while still involving different characters and a great story. probably the best prequel i have read.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|Bought for a friend's birthday and myself at the same time.<br /><br />What else can be said? Its the same great songs we all love (anyone with ears and a heart that is) from Coldplay, but live, and with an artistic and well shot concert video to boot. If you like Coldplay, and still collect CD's then this is for you.
145162445X|3.0|I found this book to be very interesting and stimulating, although I don't think the author proved his thesis, which was simply the universe could have come from nowhere, and therefore there is no God.<br /><br />Why are scientists so anxious to prove that God is not a plausible explanation for the beginning of the universe? First, plausability does not equate with truth.  Many things that are plausible are not true, and many things that appear to be highly implausible are in fact true, for example quantum mechanics. Demonstrating that science is more plausible than theism, even if it could be done (which I don't think is possible) does not prove theism to be false. Scientists will readily admit they can't prove theism is false.  This an interesting and well-written book, but it is marred by it polemical attack on theism.<br /><br />The author doesn't start with nothing, so he can't prove that the universe arises from nothing. Nothing means the total abscence of matter and energy, and a spatial, temporal environment. Absent these features there is simply nothing for scientific laws to operate on, hence their lack of existence, a true nothing. Nothing is not unstable because it lacks any potential for instability or stability. It is not a state but a total absence of states.<br /><br />I still recomend this book because it forces us to think, and defend our basic beliefs. I'm a Christian theist and I enjoyed reading this work.  The author is talented and brilliant, and I hope this isn't his last book.

For those young at heart, old at heart, single, attached or whatever...this book fills you with young lovers angst (the best kind). Not to mention, who doesn't love the Avett Brothers?! I found myself continuing to sing the lyrics from the chapter's start. A perfect summer read, highly recommended! Now to POINT OF RETREAT...

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished Wool (the Omnibus edition) which contains the first 5 installments in this story.  What a great read.  If you like science fiction infused with a great deal of humanity you will enjoy these books.  The world is painted well, and you won't be able to put it down.  I devoured it!  I am so happy to discover there is another installment, and could potentially be even more.  This book illustrates one of the best things about Amazon and this age of digital self publishing.  If your books are good, people can find them and read them and decide for themselves with no middle man publishing house deciding for you.

1476712042|1.0|So, yet again it seems I was late to the drama-llama party surrounding a book (how lame am I?!). I didn't realize there was any drama or such strong feelings surrounding this book until after I got it from Netgalley and started reading it. After I finished reading this book I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to even post my review, knowing it would be a negative one. I suppose I was hesitant to get mixed up in any of the drama. But then I said to my self \\"Hey self, you sexy smart beast you, you took the time out of your busy schedule to read this book so you totes deserve to put your two cents out into the world. So what if your review offends someone?\\" Well how could I argue with me being all smarticle like that, right?!<br /><br />Abby Abernathy, running from her dark and mysterious past, ends up at Eastern University with her BFF. At EU, Abby reinvents herself as the cardigan wearing good girl who avoids trouble. But uh-oh! trouble finds her in the form of super hot Travis Maddox. Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox earns money as a fighter in the underground fight club at EU and spends the rest of his time being the big man-slut on campus. The two meet and frustrating sparks fly and when Abby loses a bet against Travis and must live with him for a month, things get cray-cray (like seriously buckets of crazy!).<br /><br />Ok, so you can already obviously tell that I did not like this book (and for good reason). But why? For so, so many reasons. But before I get to those, I will say that the actual writing isn't horrible, nothing mind-blowing or tattoo worthy, but not bad and the author isn't an ineffective storyteller either. I just really didn't like the story being told. The book is 361ish pages, but felt much l o n g e r. The last quarter dragged on in a way that had me asking \\"Isn't it over yet?!\\"...yeah, that's never a good thing *sigh*.<br /><br />My biggest issue, and not necessarily for the reasons you may think, with Beautiful Disaster is unfortunately the most important aspect of the whole book: the relationship between Abby and Travis. Where do I start? Well, first the the actual event that brings these two together, the \\"bet\\", is incredibly contrived and unrealistically convenient. Then there's the fact that several times in the story Abby considers leaving but doesn't because she never backs out of a bet...again, this is too convenient. And Travis is oh, so conveniently in one of Abby's classes, which she just one day suddenly realizes O_o<br /><br />Then there's the actual relationship these two have, from being friends to becoming lovers and more. Seperately, these two characters are each unlikable enough, but together they are a hot mess. Before dating Travis, Abby is a contradicting jumble of sweet one moment and completely bitchy the next. Her sarcastic-I don't care-I'm so tough-I can take care of myself attitude is laughable and fails to make her relatable or worth rooting for. And of course after Hurricane Travis blows into her life she transforms into One Of Those girls who makes unbelievably stupid descsions because of her BF and turns into a mere puddle of lovesick goo.<br /><br />Travis is just an absolute unbearable, eye-roll inducing, not swoon-worthy in anyway character. He treats girls like crap, has a huge ego, is terribly violent and any vulnerability or softness the author tries to give him failed to make me care about him one bit. I honestly do not understand his appeal at all. And Oh. My. Gerwd. the way EVERY single female within a ten foot radius of this guy turns into a eye-lash batting, hair flipping, flirting puppet is just absurd! I kept imagining either cats rubbing against his leg or very eager puppies humping his leg...that's seriously how absurd it got. And of course, once he fell for Abby he became scary obsessvie and abusive...<br /><br /> I want to briefly discuss that word: abusive. I've seen other people argue that Travis isn't abusive because he never hits Abby, and he doesn't. But hedoes tell her what she can wear, who she can see, where she can go and he's manipulative and dangerously obsessive and possesive (he gets her name tattooed on him, as well as admiting that he wants other guys to know that she \\"belongs\\" to him)...that's emotional/psychological abuse. Whether he was created that way intentionally or not, doesn't make it any less true. And worse, after being with Travis for a while, Abby actually encourages his violence, prompting him to beat up another student in the cafeteria...and after just one (there are a few) brawl in the caf, you'd think Travis would be expelled, but no he never is.<br /><br />Now, to avoid being accused of just not \\"getting\\" this story, let me say that I do \\"get\\" it: this is a story about two dysfunctional, emotionally scarred, kinda effed up people who fall in love and fall into an equally dysfunctional, hard, totally effed up relationship. I have no problems with effed up characters or relationships; there are plenty of screwed up, scary, broken, violent, dangerous and complex characters that I've loved and been absolutely captivated by.<br /><br />My main issue is not their effed-upness; I don't dislike them as characters because of this, I dislike them because they are flat unlikable characters who have no real layers, dimension and who aren't particularly well developed. And my issue isn't even with their violtile, violent, effed-up relationship...No, my main issue is with what this relationship and these characters lack: depth, meaning, growth, poignancy or anything profound.<br /><br />(I'm almost done, I swear)<br /><br />A few other things I want to briefly mention are the supporting characters and all the girl-on-girl hate.<br /><br />Abby's BFF, America, is another unlikable character. She's over the top dramatic, whiny and really kind of all over the place in terms of personality; one minute she's telling Abby to dump Travis, the next she's telling Abby she's a bitch for breaking his heart.<br /><br />One of the supporting characters I actually liked (and who was the one sane, rational beacon of light) is Kara, Abby's dormmate. Kara has one of the only insightful and rational lines in the book: \\"Do you know what codependency is, Abby? Your boyfriend is a prime example, which is creepy considering he went from having no respect for women at all to thinking he needs you to breath.\\" Yes, yes! A thousand times yes! Unfortunately, this one sane character was created to come across as an unlikable bitch, something America is always willing to point out.<br /><br />Which leads me to all the girl-on-girl hate in this book, particularly done by America and Abby. These two are constantly calling soriety girls or ANY girl who flirts with or sleeps with Travis a whore, slut, stupid, vapid, bimbo, STD-infested, bitch, etc. Basically any girl other then the two of them who ever has sex, flirts or dresses sexy is obviously trash...PUH-lease! Can you say jealousy and insecurity? And of course these are issues never explored or mentioned.<br /><br />I won't spoil any of the main plotpoints, but let's just say there's an unnecessary trip to Vegas, an out of nowhere fire, another trip to Vegas and a cheesy, disappointing end.<br /><br />MY FINAL THOUGHTS: I don't think there's anything more I can say that I haven't already covered. Beautiful Disaster is certainly a disaster but far from beautiful. This is obvioulsy a book that will evoke strong feelings in readers, unfortunatley all my feelings are negative.

I love the first song so much, it reminds you of Our Prayer which is one of my favs of the Beach boys catalog. This was a great album as well as a great Concert expierence to get to see all of the remaining Beach Boys together again. Cant wait for the remastered albums to come out in September. I will be getting them all and I suggest any real music fan do the same! There will never be another band like them, Thank you Beach Boys for all your great music!!!!

Enzo loves his human family and is especially loyal to his owner Denny who is a race car driver.  Occasionally Enzo, while narrating the history and stories of his life and his people family,  shares witticisms or advice on the importance things in life.  He uses race car driving as a metaphor for speeding or racing through the days and years of your life cycle.  Put your seat belt on and bark once to slow down or bark twice to go faster.<br /><br />\\"How quickly a year passes, like a mouthful of food snatched from the maw of eternity.\\" pg. 240  The Art of Racing in the Rain is a heartfelt story that will capture your heart and make you laugh out loud because of the thoughts of a dog.  If you are a dog owner you will recognize particular traits that Enzo exhibits that relate to your beloved pet and best friend.  Enzo's family goes through some very rough times, a death, a custody battle and the story may bring tears to your eyes but through it all they had a dog who loved and supported them unconditionally.  A dog is a friend when you need one, a shoulder to cry on, a pal to play ball with and is so happy when you come home.<br /><br />\\"That which you manifest is before you.\\" pg. 41  Enzo saw a TV show (he likes to watch TV when his people are gone) and believes that when a dog dies he will return in the next life as a human.

There are some swear words and a little inappropriateness for younger kids but my 11 and 14 year old kids absolutely adored this book.  When it was finished and we were only 20 miles from home my daughter said, \\"This book is a 5 star read for me.\\"  We were all crying and laughing and it was a wonderful moment that I will cherish forever and it's all because we love dogs and books.<br /><br />This is a story worth listening to.

B000W7JWUA|4.0|I got this game because I had heard such good reviews. The one downside I heard is it has a cardboard game board, so it may not be durable for a lot of games for the price. And there is no longer an online Catan game like it claims in the manual's extras. However, I have enjoyed the few beginner games I played with it. It's a little long when you are learning the rules, but can get faster and usually lasts us 1-2 hours, which is just enough to enjoy a good game, but not become too bored by the monotony like some other games.<br />Some of the extras, like training, are good to get the basics down. I even won a game. And even at the beginner level, it's never the same twice. You have different strategies to try to get 10 victory points. I like that once you know the basic rules of the game and get bored with the beginner set up, you can vary it and try again.

B0055S348W|1.0|I purchased this app for my Kindle Fire, and it worked fine for about 60 days.  It would detect local printers over WiFi at home and at my office, and it did a reasonable job of finding the appropriate drivers.  Printing was quick and generally accurate for Word documents.  I didn't try other types.  After about 60 days, the rendering document screen showed only a blank page and only a blank page would print.  I tried reinstalling the app, but that did not change things.  I tried different printers and different documents with no success.<br /><br />Of note, it appears there was a recent update to the document rendering function.  This automatically installed when I started the app.  I am suspicious that the update broke the app on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Update to my review:<br /><br />I have be contacted by technical support at Dynamix.  They asked that I try some new Word documents, which I created on my PC using Word 2007 and side loaded.  The documents would still not render and print.  They asked that I send them copies of a document that would not render and print.  They said they were able to render and print the document using their test Kindle Fire devices.  They sent me an app crash log application that I ran after not being able to render or print.  I emailed them a log file.  I have heard nothing for a week.<br /><br />Be aware, this app may work with some Kindle Fires, but there is apparently something with either my particular device or my installed applications that causes it to fail to render Word documents.<br /><br />Additional update:<br /><br />I still have not heard back from Dynamix.  I have tried additional steps to correct the problem, including stopping and uninstalling all unessential and 3rd party apps, clearing the cache and reinstalling PrinterShare and trying documents created with different versions of Word.  Nothing has helped.  I can render and print jpg's and contact information, but nothing else.  I have asked for a refund, but have not received a response.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved reading this book and the characters! It is super unrealistic and cheesy, but it sucks you in and is very entertaining.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I guess I am easier to please than the other reviewers.All I ask is for a lot of action,suspense,a few thrills(which I got).This is the first time I have seen a \\"Bourne\\"movie.I will be ordering the Bourne trilogy(I like Matt Damon,especially in \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\")since this movie piqued my interest to watch the other 3.This is the first time I was exposed to Jeremy Renner--liked his portrayal,believable,not some young,built stud.I kept thinking,\\"Who is this actress who looks so much like Rachel Weisz\\"?I couldn't believe it was actually her!!She looks much younger!I always enjoy her performances.If you like action films,you won't be disappointed
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I really loved the first two books and I'm trying to forget about this one. I'm one that can get past things being completely unrealistic and enjoy the occasional cheese, but this was just like watching an episode of Gossip Girl. Christian basically loses his masculinity and turns into an adolescent child in this book while Ana goes from being smart, witty and open to new things to just boring and vapid. Again, I loved the first two books and if for some reason the author comes up with a fourth book I'll read it, but I'm trying to forget this one.
1612183956|4.0|After I was about 1/4 through this book, I found myself not wanting to put it down. Read the entire book in one evening! This thriller keeps you on the edge of your seat! The middle of this book (where many books tend to lag) is fast-paced and you can't flip the pages fast enough. I've read a Blake Crouch short story before, so I kind of knew what I was getting in to. This book, as a whole, was better than the short story I'd read and is definitely worth your time.<br /><br />I'll admit, I peeked a glance at the titles of the reviews here on Amazon, BEFORE I read the book, so I knew the ending was going to be a mixed bag. Some liked it, some seemed to be disappointed. Unfortunately, I fell into the second group. Read below to find out why:<br /><br />You don't know how badly I want to give this 5 stars, but the ending left me unsatisfied, however, this would not dissuade me from recommending this book to others. If someone wants a good read on the beach or in the dead of winter, this is an excellent read!<br /><br />This book was totally awesome -except for the ending- and truthfully, I wish the author would have just ended it about 30 pages sooner. That would have made me have to figure out the ending for myself and what it all meant. I felt a little let down by the explanation. The lead-up was so incredibly good that the ending just didn't live up to the rest of the book. I still think this book would make for a terrific movie if they end it before they reveal all. When your lead-up is that good, you need a spectacular ending or to leave people hanging and this book did neither, however, as I stated above, this would not dissuade me from recommending this book to others because it is such a good book all-in-all.<br /><br />I hope to read more books from this author in the future.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I Love the characters in these novels, love the action sequences and multiple story lines, all in all I love the series!!!
0425263908|5.0|Loved this one sooo much more than 50 shades.  The characters were better and the story line was better.  Not sure why the author made the story sooo similar to 50 shades, i thought that was weird someone would basically rewrite another book.  Loved it, already pre-ordered the 2nd one! Cant wait!
B00785P2QC|3.0|this app is pretty good and can keep you entertained for awhile but I do wish the in app purchases we not so much
B008BM9L72|5.0|Could not put it down, but found it also confronting and self accepting the dark is well balanced with the lighter side and the way events where also described in the past tense was just brilliant as it stopped the book becoming bogged down and boring.
034580404X|5.0|My sisters and I got Fifty Shades of Grey for our mom.  We were shocked to find out that she has read the entire trilogy in three weeks.  She told us that she has enjoyed them and began passing it to my sisters.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|awsome + epic. best game ever. I have it on my kindle, phone, and ipod. I love how you can get color packs too.
B008BIZ06M|2.0|Didnt think it was possible for offpsring to have an album such as this. its so pop culture bad<br /> Best song on here was the rerelease of black magic
1933633867|5.0|I thought I knew a little about money and economies, Dr. Graeber showed me how little I know. I would reccomend Debt, the First 5000 Years to anyone interested in learning how we got to where we are today.
B0085A9J18|5.0|What can I say about this film that others have not already expounded on?  No real plot, no character development, no budget.  However, what they may not have all said is that THIS DOES NOT MATTER!  The intent of the film was not to win an oscar for best drama (I mean... best picture!).  The intent was to entertain and to be remembered for balls-to-the-wall action.  In this, we have success!  Gareth Evans has created a claustrophobic action masterpiece with intelligent characters, amazing action choreography, and intense atmosphere.  These are the selling points, and the film lives up to each of them beautifully!<br /><br />Action lovers must see this.  Horror fans could see this too, as there are some very tense scenes that feel like they were picked out of a horror film.  Martial arts fans, absolutely see this.  Silat is on display and looks great.  Overall, one of my favorite action films of all time!  Can't wait for the sequels that have already been announced!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|but not as good as throw Rio one. I played this for 5 houers straight. I recommend it a lot.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|it is so cute I wish I had a pet like that.they are so cute.if I ever had a pet like that I would b holding it every day of my life
0345803507|5.0|I had read the first books of this series and ha dto buy this one to finsh to see how it all played out.  Some of the sexists books I have read.
B0086700CM|5.0|Now they have temple run for kindle!! this is a great app. But, it is very addicting..<br /><br />Everyone should get this app
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun and enjoyable.  have had no problems. play on a kindle fire. seems to play smooth and clear no lagging while playing.
B00785P2QC|4.0|graphics are decent. the game play isn't bad either. the investment. portion can get difficult to deal with. However,  the game moves along fairly well. not bad for a free game,  definitely a time killer.
034580404X|5.0|i have never been much of a reader. my collegues at work just kept talking about these books so i figured i would check them out. i read all of them in a weeks time and now i am reading them again. the author is awesome and she makes you feel like the characters are a part of your life. crazy but when i was done reading the books the first time i felt like i was missing them lol.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was my absolute FAVORITE book as a kid.  I read it a dozen times.  Friends I have recommended it to since have loved it as adults.  Love it.
0446547654|1.0|I will never break my \\"don't read or watch a movie that has Nicholas Sparks attached to it\\". I thought maybe for once he would give us an ending that was not convaluted. Just once could the good guys win, experience healing , start over without some gut wrenching twisted interplay that is supposed to leave the reader feeling good. I have never felt good or satisfied after finishing one of Mr. Spark's books and I only subjected myself to one of his movies and I walked out before the end. I thought this book might be different but it wasn't. I was so mad that the villians lived, yes in jail, but still lived and everyone else was left in tragedy. Are we really supposed to buy that a 19 year old with a heart transplant would live a normal life? What planet was Mr. Sparks born on! And the heroine would be fine with losing the love of her life since her son now had his heart. Who would buy this logic? The kitchen trash was not good enough for this book..it went in the outside garbage can. I am so mad I wasted 4 days reading this piece of trash. Never again!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Abby and Travis, Travis and Abby these two totally meet their matches in this story.  I love both of these characters, although Abby can be quite frustrating at times.  So much happens in this book that I think I will have to re-read it just in case I missed something.  The only thing that is missing is the insight into Travis' character, but I believe that is to come in the next book... I can't wait!  Totally recommend this book!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I though those elude be a ripoff but is not it is soooo awesome.  I am supirsied it was free 5 stars fitly!!!!!!
0375507256|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It's definitely one of a kind.  I really got to know and love the characters.  And, what a story!  It pulls you in!  This is one of the VERY few books that I know I will re-read many times.  All that I can say is:  OUTSTANDING!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Peps world is just like super Mario brothers!!! And it's a really fun game. even though you canxget a little frustrated with it sometimes...............IT IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B007STBUIW|5.0|WOW!  That's all I can say.  The picture and sound are 100 times better than any previous versions (and I've bought them all).  There are literally hundreds of fascinating details in the blu-ray that I've never seen before.  The sound is unbelievable and the rear channels get a huge workout.  Williams score never sounded this ominous.  I guess someday there will be an 8K resolution that will blow away this version, but for now, this is as close to perfection as anything I've seen from the 70's.  I watch it on a 58 inch Samsung plasma and it's truly a beautiful thing.  The new documentary \\"The Shark Is Not Working is fantastic as well.    Tired of typing - just buy it and enjoy your life.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Truly magical. I was captivated by the beautiful soul of the story, the depth and authenticity of the characters, the imaginative plot devices ... the sheer creativity of the thing. In an age when pablum is a frequent loiterer on the NY Times Bestseller list, The Night Circus is refreshing, and Morgenstern is a true artist.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This album is amazing, and the songs very soulful and meaningful. His music is inspired by his personal downfalls with drugs and love, along with personal feelings about the social/political aspects of city life.  He condemns the distasteful materialism of the wealthy, and sympathizes with the inner-city poor. Rodriguez is such a humble and shadowy figure, and he deserves much more recognition for his brillant music. He never knew just how signficant of an impact his music has made on people until recently. He approached his success with humility, prefering to donate most of his money earned from sold-out concerts in South Africa to his family and choosing to live obscurely in inner-city Detroit. To sum it all up, this album is excellent. Support Rodriguez!!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|My grandson,who is six liked it.It wasn't too fast for him.<br />I wish the screen was larger.<br />Having to move the screen all the time to see  what<br />you have is inconvienant.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The app is great.  On the normal I fall asleep reading my bible; thanks yo this app I can listen to the bible.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|I knew there would be action and adventure in this film, but I didn't expect such terrible writing and lousy acting! The film moves quickly and has lots of stupid one liners. Even the action or fight scenes leave you wondering.... \\"why they did that\\", or \\"why didn't they do something better\\" with that scene. Overall, one star was generous for such a poorly directed, poorly written and poorly acted film!
1926778103|2.0|The ONLY reason I gave this 2 stars is that the publisher so badly dropped the ball on the binding on this book.  There really is no excuse other than being cheap, or there was a defective batch of glue, in which case they should have given their paying customers a new book.  Other than that glaring issue (I'm still bitter) this is an absolute MUST HAVE for any Mad! fans out there...only, now this book is pushing $300?  I'm not sure what is behind that inflated price other than they probably stopped making them when the covers of the book where ripping from the spine.
1934030198|5.0|I thought this book was really great, particularly for the price. It's jam-packed with really useful information.<br /><br />This book is about how to structure your life around being a triathlete. It's about how to work up a training plan for each year that will help you achieve your goals and reduce your \\"limiters\\" - those parts of your triathlon you might not be strong. It goes into incredible detail about how training works, particularly the ideas of periodization and building fitness by varying intensity and volume, and the idea of the three basic parts of fitness (force, speed, and endurance). It talks about identifying your limiters and developing plans to fix them. It also goes into great detail about the differences between training for a sprint triathlon and an Ironman triathlon (it's not just \\"more hours\\").<br /><br />It goes into some detail about how to race, what nutrition and hydration you'll need to bring along, checklists for things to bring and all that - probably stuff you've already got a handle on. It has some information about nutrition outside of racing but it is mostly just an overview. It has essentially no information at all on technique, though - don't buy this book thinking it will make you a better swimmer.<br /><br />Other than that there's really nothing negative to say about the book. It's very well-laid-out, lots of charts and sample training plans. It doesn't over-explain things but doesn't gloss over them either - it's a good balance.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: This book isn't a \\"My First Triathlon\\" book. It's not a \\"Triathlon for Dummies\\" book. As the intro says, it's basically a cheap replacement for a triathlon coach. If you've signed up for your first sprint triathlon and you just want a couple of not-too-detailed training plans to get you into shape to finish it, this isn't the book for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games. easy fun and time consuming. love the challenges and the number of games to be played. Can not wait until I can unlock more games by earning more points.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|you have to get from point A to B and you aren't in control of anything but walking on the ceiling or the floor.  As the screen scrolls from right to left you are presented with obstacles to navigate around while being chased by a robot that's trying to shoot you.  It's like a side scrolling puzzle.  Graphics look good.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This app is addicting! Perry is so cute and I love him from Phineas and Ferb! It is worth paying the 99 cents especially If you like the original game Where's My Water.
B007712XAU|5.0|A really fun series on British Aristocracy at the beginning of World War I. The series is both entertaining and pleasant to watch.
B002PA8Q1S|4.0|what a movie.<br />This movie, though not for any softies out there, kicks ass. Christian Bale proves in this movie that he is not just a handsome meathead, he is a true talent. He is so slimey and believable in this his character still creeps me out when I think of it. What a statement on US culture too. I need to read this book. Bale character is funny, sadistic, and witty. however, im still confused about the ending (fake, real)?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very nice app it works really great and I use it for my kindle fire. I especially like the feature that tells you how much tome is left for different things.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I had heard all the hype...friends had oohed and awwwed over it.  So I thought i was in for a great read.  NOT!  I read book one and book two and found it yawningly boring...  Very repetitive...  all the requisite sado/masochistic tendencies run amok...amongst erotic passages and a young woman giving herself for the good life.  Yech..Meh!.....  not impressed.  I wanted to slap the young woman for being such a ninny!
1427200874|4.0|My friend ask me this gift. He heard about the audiobook. I don't know about it. But my friend recommend it. I received the product on time. The seller  is dependable and I thank for attention. I like Amazon.com because amazon site is amazing. Thank you
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first two books left me cold and annoyed at the female lead...  she's such a wimp!  This last book does give one a bit of a plot line tho'..so of all of them liked this one the best.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I was surprised with the entertainment value of this game. After playing DragonVale religiously on my first gen iPod touch before the race update I didn't think this game would come close but it is not too bad. definitely worth a try if you are a fan of these kind of games!
B005LAJ212|5.0|AGAIN THEY CANT GET THE INFORMATION RIGHT. 5 DISCS AND ONLU 44 MINUTES VIEWING TIME. COME ON LETS GET IT RIGHT
B003THN74M|4.0|I previously didn't know anything about this show and I got it just because I loved Nathan Fillion in Firefly.  This is a pretty good show if you like cop shows though.  I currently watch \\"Monk\\" and \\"Psych\\" on Netflix and watch this when I get bored of those.  I don't know if I will buy the second season, but I probably will if I run out of better, free-er stuff to watch.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|best app ive ever downloaded. I love all the different choices and you can play multiple ones so I play the crickets and the river one and it reminds me of home. absolutely perfect. 10 stars I love it. ill be asleep in no time!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Wow!  This is wonderful!  We moved to the High Plains where it never rains.  I really miss the sound of it especially at night.  The sounds on this app are pretty natural and soothing.  Nice to nod off to!<br />Now if only this app could make REAL rain.....
B005HSL626|5.0|I am speachless. this app Rocks! even though all u do is slay food it sounds boring but its really awesome.That's all I'm gonna say. That's it. It just freaking ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000YABIQ6|3.0|After having heard a lot of hype about how great Mad Men was, I decided I'd give the show a try--right from the beginning, which is generally where I like to start things.<br /><br />I finished the first season last night, and I find myself in a position of neither loving or hating the show. Just a feeling of supreme ambivalence, and a healthy dose of disappointment. What can I say? The acting is solid, the wardrobes are gorgeous and so are the elaborate sets. Mad Men exudes an aura of the sixties, completely with music and the omnipresent haze of cigarette smoke.<br /><br />Unfortunately, once you get beyond the pretty packaging, there's not much there. The characters seem to be vying with each other for how unsympathetic they can become, and many of the plot lines(particularly those involving the main character, Don Draper) just don't hold together. I had expected the advertising world to provide much of the drama, but the show hops and skips from one client to the next, often with no resolution.<br /><br />Another issue is timeline--there is no coherent sense of time or exactly what's going on. Sometimes an episode covers a single day. . .and then the next episode picks up six months later, and you learn that the affair which was \\"never going to happen\\" in that episode, has been going on for the entire six months. It's very jarring.<br /><br />I might give the show one more try with Season 2, but not for a while. Too many good shows on my list at the moment.
B008ULRY78|5.0|Keeps you glued to your seat.  Superb choreography, fantastic photography (exciting POV throughout); and decent character development considering.  Stays within the laws of physics (no stupid wires and people that get hit hard seem to feel it).  Good enough to cross-over from martial arts to mainstream action.  Dialogue is sufficiently sparse so subtitles never become tedious.  Do not be persuaded by the negative reviews.  The guys are either idiots or have some interest in bashing the film because the things they say are not right at all.  For someone to say the martial arts was bad is just plain foolish.  It was awesome.  Highly recommend.
B000BQV52A|5.0|Simply stated, this is one of my favorite recordings in my large CD collection.  It's unfortunate that Gulda, Argerich's teacher, has been somewhat pushed to the side in the reception of his recordings.  This is an important collection that a serious listener may want to have.  Gulda's technique is of the highest cleanliness and precision; I almost wonder if a human being was behind the piano when I listen (in a good way, of course).  Though perhaps not of the stereotypical rawness that often prevails Beethoven recordings, we find a very different vision -- one of idealization and perfection.
B007SGM084|5.0|Really great book, read all three books in like three days!  Not as dark and twisted as some people think.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I find this series of books fascinating. The first book does a good job of hooking you in a way that you can not help want to read more, it's really hard to put the book down. There is the problem of following all the characters and the many places, particularly because many are identified in different ways or by slightly different names, this is particularly so when reading with a Kindle as you can't go back and forth as you would be able to with a regular book. What I did is I went on line and downloaded a map and a list of characters, printed both and used them as a reference. Once you become familiar with all the characters and the various places, the story becomes easier to follow. Regardless, it is a remarkable series of books that won't let you down for a second. Great read!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|the game is good. i am only unhappy about amazon update their apps slower than play store. The new version is available on play store a week before than amazon appstore.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think its awesome it helps me know when it is time to shut it down and let it charge every one that thinks its bad u need to look a little more
B007L3BMGA|3.0|A cross between Harlequin Books (a step up raunchy from Mills and Boon), and 9 and 1/2 Weeks (the 80's film with Micky Rourke and Kim Bassinger, that was ground breaking sensuous/forbidden for it's time).  An interesting delve into Christian, but more so how Anistasia learnt how to cope (in many ways). Sex every third page got blase. The Emails were most interesting.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am 46 and loved this game so much I pretty much took it over from my 9 yr old. :)
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I just needed to see what all the fuss was about so when i got my kindle, the first purchase i made was Fifty Shades of Grey. It was an enjoyable story but with a lot of repetitiveness and not very realistic. Grey is a bit too good to be true/real. I did enjoy the story though and had to finish the trilogy so i guess that speaks volumes!!<br />As a birthday present i asked my husband to read the book instead of buying me something. It was the best pressie he could ever give me especially since Grey can add so much more spice to any relationship!
B005QUQP76|3.0|First of all. This is not a FPS mouse for sure.<br /><br />The DPI setting is totally different from my [[ASIN:B002J9GDXI Logitech G500 Programmable Gaming Mouse]]or [[ASIN:B002NIGDIA SteelSeries Kinzu Optical Gaming Mouse (Black)]]. DPI is actually 400 when the setting goes 800, its 800 when the setting goes 1200. The sniper button they copied from [[ASIN:B003CP0BHM Mad Catz R.A.T.7 Gaming Mouse for PC and MAC]is useless. It kept getting my way when I'm browsing the internet.<br />Side button cannot adjust volume which I usually set my G500 to do. I dont know what else these two side buttons can be used for.<br /><br />The good part is:<br /><br />Solid design. Steel design makes this mouse durable.<br />Good grab. I feel good when I use this mouse.<br />Nice scrool. This scrool feels better than any mouse I've ever used.<br /><br />Overall, This mouse worth 40 bucks for its solid build steel. But if you wanna a FPS head-shooting mouse, go for some other mouses.
B002R27J1W|5.0|Our family greatly enjoyed Wait Until Dark.  It is classic, filled with suspense and very intense.  Lots of fun.  Very decent except for a low-cut dress worn in the opening scene, which is not shown long (the woman puts on a coat over it).  I was glad I bought it.
0345803507|5.0|Wonderful! A must read for any woman. Makes you keep wanting more. Buy all three at once, so you don't have to wait for the next book to come in the mail! You won't wanna wait!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love that it is just like where is my water but with more features. Get this game if you have not gotten it yet.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Only half the first book was read.  I'm not reading any of the others. The story line was there amongst repulsive and unnatural sexual attitudes of the characters.  The content so distracting I did not want to ready anymore. I'm no prude, enjoy a good plot, good writing, and being left with a 'I want more' feeling.  This book did none of those for me - hence its now deleted.  Authors who say the general public need to know about submissiveness to another persons will, especially sexually, and about sexual deviancy in any form, is not moral as does not promote positive thinking. This book was written to shock the reader, it did.  I know these deviancy's exist and abhor the negativity promoted.  Where are all the happy stories?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very helpful app. I like being able to know how mucg battery power I have remaining while reading a kindle book or just checking email. it is also very simple to use.
0756407125|5.0|Mr. Rothfuss has done a fantastic job on this series.  These books are absolutely fabulous.  I highly recommend this series.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I purchased this app for the kids to play, and they love it.  I found out after the fact, that they purchased $100 in extra points while playing the game.  Thanks to the Kindle support, the $ will be credited back to my account, but not until after all of the bills bounce!
0143121006|4.0|I really enjoyed this. Though it is a tragic story it is immensely readable.<br />It is well written and the photos are well chosen.<br /><br />I thought that it had just the right amount of background material.<br />Occasionally the author does seem to recreate a couple of conversations and sometimes guesses what people would have been thinking. Some might find this to be quite irritating. I didn't really mind it. Though it does leave a nagging doubt in my mind as the book's accuracy.<br /><br />The book does a very good job in recreating for the general reader 1930's China and the life of expats.<br /><br />The story itself is fascinating. The British authorities come out of it very badly
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is challenging.. and fun. starts super easy... but as the levels go... the circles get smaller and harder to conect
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The functions are basic math but great with my needs. I use this all the time for my bills and simple calculations.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An  enjoyable historical fictional novel . .Good characters & well written. Keeps you engaged to the very end. I would recommend this to friends & as a great book group pick.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the better books I have read this year.  Loved it =- Read many books regarding the war from the Jewish standpoint but have never read one from the german standpoint of the people during that time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very simple and helpful. There was nothing wrong with it, everything worked great! The way it shows on the background whether it is night or day makes the app even cooler :)
0345803485|1.0|This book is very repetitive to the point of being truly boring. The writing is generally poor and the story is barely existent. It's a wonder that it has been so popular!
0345803485|1.0|I ordered this because of all the fuss, and apparently all the fuss over this book was that it wasn't a good book at all. I'm not sure why my coworker that obsessed over this book would recommend it to me. Its lacking a lot. What annoyed me the most was the repeated uses of 'holy crap' and 'double crap' and a few other words that could've easily been offered synonyms but made the writing boring and limited. The main girl of the book isn't very interesting and neither is the guy that interests her. I admit I was into the first few chapters, trying to ignore my inner frustration for it but I have stopped reading it now. It's not a good book at all, I didn't enjoy it and cheers to those who got to the end and read the other books in the series.
B0088UG8AU|5.0|Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.<br /><br />This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.<br /><br />A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.<br /><br />Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.<br /><br />I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]]
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|After reading a very good trilogy this summer I was looking for a book that would keep my attention.  After reading quite a few This one did it!

B000784WMW|1.0|I only continued watching it because I paid for it.  The acting was very poor and unconvincing.  I was shocked and so disappointed with actor, Timothy Dalton.  His acting was the worst of all.  The Physical appearance of this Jane Eyre was very unappealing and unconvincing as well.  I found myself getting upset at this rendition of Charlotte Bronte's novel as it rearranged some scenes.  I thought this was a movie, but it was a series of episodes, which made watching it disturbing with all the stop and go of introduction and credits!!  What a waste of money!
0143038419|2.0|\\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" was as bad as I thought it would be, but unraveled a lot of what I have been thinking about lately concerning idolatry, worship, and God. There was a quote in the book and in the movie that was pivotal for me in illustrating one of our greatest obstacles to our understanding of God and ourselves: \\"God dwells within you as you yourself, exactly the way you are\\" (p. 192). In other words, God is like you. This is basically saying, \\"You are God,\\" or \\"a god,\\" and this is simply and profoundly false!<br /><br />In the book \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" this idea is expressed this way, \\"We don't realize that, somewhere within us all, there does exist a supreme Self who is eternally at peace\\" (p 122). Is the author saying that this \\"supreme Self,\\" is God?! Is this god, little \\"g,\\" dwelling within us ourselves?! Nothing could be further from the truth; however, I believe that many people think this way. Many think they are looking at God, but in fact they are looking at, and to, themselves.<br /><br />If this is true that God is our \\"supreme Self,\\" then god is no bigger than our selves, illustrating the saying, \\"God has created humankind in His own image and we have returned the favor.\\" This sin is as old as Adam and Eve in the garden, and their wanting to be like God at the fall of humanity (see Genesis 1-3).<br /><br />I have noticed a boredom with God, which is affirmed in \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" My suspicion is that this boredom is not boredom with the one true God at all. This boredom is with a lesser God, a self made and self resembling idol. If it is God that we are worshiping and following, we will not be bored at all. To paraphrase a quote from Saint Thomas Aquinas, \\"If you comprehend God he is not God.\\" If you are bored with God, this is not God that you are dealing with at all. It looks like most of the boredom that is being experienced with God comes from the same idol worship of a self made, self resembling, little god, or idol of self, as represented in this book.  This is illustrated in the above quote from \\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" \\"God dwells within you as you yourself. . .\\" So in effect, we are not bored with God, we are bored with ourselves and our idols because we have made \\"gods\\" of ourselves and of other lesser things.<br /><br />While this book may be entertaining, it is also dangerous in its elevation of the self.  While the book is well done, the subject matter is less than helpful in an already narcissistic culture.<br /><br />This review was adapted from my blog, My Two Mites, and will also be posted on goodreads.book.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a really nice app., both in free version and even better in Premium.  You have all these sounds (way more in Premium) and you can choose as many as you want, adjusting the volume of each to create a custom mix (try train with rain on the roof and lightning for instance or crackling fire in a cavern).  You can also choose different Hz for different wave lengths (Premium).  It's really soothing and you can mix it to whatever mood you are in that day/night.  There is also a timer.  I would like to see this have \\"skins\\" as simple screensavers built in (Kindles do seem to want to burn images or leave traces).  However, I did find that you can leave the app. running and do something else (like check email or FB) OR run a screensaver app. you may have.  So, plugged in, conceivable I can have my fireplace app on dimly or my thunderstorm and then also this sound running.  It's more convenient to have skins within the one app., but I am pleased to have access to this sound and a screensaver app. at the same time which is certainly do-able.  I like this app. a lot.  I quickly upgraded from free to Premium and it is worth it.

0071762345|5.0|Disregard my rating, b/c I haven't read the book, but need to get to some valid concerns and questions before I do buy it.  This is an inquiry, and I don't feel badly about it, b/c amazon has yet to separate bona fide reviews of books from reviews on service delivery, which is beyond irksome and frustrating to say the least.  Come on.  Many of you know what I am talking about.  People rate the delivery service and book condition, rather than using the review to rate the book content--yet it all gets summed up in the same numeric rating.  Please.  It is beyond logical that there should be two separate areas for rating--one for amazon and book condition services, and the other for book content.  Amazon. Please catch on to this!  It's like using an apples and oranges review system.  These are two different metrics.  No, it's not just me.  Anyway. . .<br /><br />While this is unrelated, I was flat out impressed by over 200 reviews that said five stars.  At the same time, I do have a skeptical streak; thus I know there's always the potential for \\"sheepleness,\\" I guess.  But that can't be the whole thing, b/c I buy a lot of books, and the the reviews for that number of people are usually not that highly consistent. . .so numbers have some impact.<br /><br />Look, I just want to know if this book will help me with social networking, b/c frankly, I have been a bit paranoid and skeptical over it.  Seems like everyone in the world--major experts--are telling me to get over it and get with the program.  I think I logged in to FB twice.  Saw a lot of idiotic nonsense; plus read that HR people and the like can go and check out things, and God forbid one of my \\"like me's\\" decides to be unfair or somehow disparaging.  Frankly, I am a very friendly person in person--but otherwise, I am private.  Learned the hard way to keep things to myself--especially in school or work.  People are complicated and very human, and that's the way it is.  There's a lot of insecurity that makes peopleroll the way they do, and you can get screwed by it.  Who hasn't at one point or another????  Don't get me wrong.  I don't give up hope for any one individual or people in general or myself for that matter. But reality is what it is.  The irony is that to most people, perception becomes their reality, rather than, well, reality.<br /><br />So I want to get some kind of grip on this social networking thing, but I don't think I will be the kind of person to lay out my whole life online.  I share such things with those that have gained my trust.  You have to be wise about such things, and tons of people aren't.  Oh and dear Lord, there's all that nonsense of fighting that goes on with people on FB.  Really? ???!!!!! Some of it is like Jersey Shore, and mean as all get out.  So I blew off FB and chose to sign with Linkedin.  It just seemed more professionally-oriented.  Whatever, I need a book that will help me figure this out and find some balance with using it.  So is this the book for that--I mean for a person like me--who doesn't twitter or FB, and who barely puts anything on Linkedin? ???<br /><br />I would deeply appreciate any advice on this matter.  And looking at the realistic side, I ALWAYS look at the sub-optimal reviews--even if they are skewed or possibly imbalanced.  I have to weigh things in the balance--and no, I am not a libra.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.  BTW, I think I will post this also in the review section, and see if more people will give me some solid imput.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great application to mix sounds and control how you want to hear them. Amazing application totally worth paying for it to get all the rest of the sounds.l
B007ZKY7XO|4.0|This is a really difficult album to review. The positive is that each song, taken individually, is either good or excellent. The negative is that there is no coherence to this album. I definitely appreciate artists not producing the same album over and over, but it's almost like this one was pieced together from maybe 4 different albums. In fact one song - Shady Love - sounds like it's performed by another artist altogether (I cannot identify either Jake or Ana as singing anywhere on the track perhaps other than the chorus - am I imagining this?). And some of the tracks do harken back to older Scissor Sisters sounds, so it's not like the entire album breaks new ground for them. But honestly - this has been playing in my car continuously for the last few weeks, so they must have done something right.

1609611543|5.0|I'm \\"that guy\\" Don't have sugar drinks ever, eat low fat, no fat, chicken. Work out 3+ times a week.<br />So why can't I lose the 10-15 pounds that I have been working at for years to get rid of?  Why am I always hungry even when I had a good breakfast at 9am I am starving again? I roll my eyes at fad diets believing eat healthy exercise and the weight will come off. For some reason this book caught my eye and I read the look inside and started to think what if the wheat is the reason I am always hungry?<br />So I gave it a try and have not had wheat for about 3 weeks now.  The first week was actually tough, I was shocked how much I wanted stuff like a peanut butter toasted bagel.<br />I stuck it out and the constant all day up and down always hungry person is gone.<br />I have lost 13 pounds<br />The only thing hard about this is being prepared, making and yes cooking my food.<br />It takes more time to cook eggs vs toasting some wheat bread, making sure lunch and dinner are wheat free takes time.<br />The magic? The 2 mid day snacks are gone, I don't have hunger pains.  I could go all day without eating and not feel as hungry as I did before by 9am.<br />Good luck if you decide to give it a try.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you're new to the internet, there's a scene in one of the episodes that depicts a few heads up on spikes.  Good old fashioned medieval fun.  However while the studio was looking around for prop heads to put on said spikes they kinda grabbed whatever was handy.  One of those heads was modeled after G.W. Bush for some other movie and they figured if they put enough dirt on it no one would notice.  I certainly didn't.  The internet did though and then it became a mild, completely meaningless controversy that no one with a brain cared about but since TV producers typically don't have brains they decided they'd recall (or at least make a statement saying they would) all the copies of the DVD and Blu-Ray that had this scene and would replace them with an edited version.<br /><br />Right about now you're probably wondering who the hell cares, right?  Well this Blu-ray was $36 when it was up for pre-order.  It was $45 when I bought it the day after HBO released that silly statement.  Now it's about $55.  See, while this may not be a collector's item, people are certainly going to speculate that it may be one and it's price is going to go up accordingly for a while.  If you don't care about having a digitally edited version down the line then wait about 8 months and I'm sure like all other over-priced HBO box sets this will go on sale for about $20 on some lightning deal.  If you do care to not have some clumsy digital affects animation edit out G.W.'s head on a spike, then by all means buy this before the speculators get out of control and the price goes up another $10-40.<br /><br />While I'm at it it's worth mentioning this is one of the best series HBO has produced and it's an amazingly rich fiction that grips you and keeps you wanting more.  ;)
B008COII1Y|5.0|Great back story to a zombie movie I recomend this movie.Also the acting was very good def. not a low budget film.
1592536913|5.0|This is the best steampunk picture book by far. If you want a lot of text and history on steampunk, this isn't the one you want. But if you want scores and scores of high resolution photos of great steampunk works of 3-D art, this is the only one you need. Out of several steampunk books I have, this one is my favorite, just packed with pictures, and steampunk is, if nothing else, a very visual medium, whose work stirs the imagination. If you want text, get another book, if you want the best representaiton of what people are creating, this one is the definitive one.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I'm only about 35% through the book and holy crap! It just tossed a fricking curve ball at me! I never get tense or nervous when reading a book, and after that I'm DYING to know what comes of it. Bravo, Author. You are now among my favorites.
B007LB1BPE|2.0|Madonna's albums are continue to become less consistent.  There are high points here, but not enough to justify the album purchase.  Something went deeply wrong between Music and American life.  The catchy, thoughtful tunes are long gone - leaving an uneven mixture of sound, including some that are unremarkable and aren't worthy of Madonna's legend.
1572816112|5.0|These cards caught my eye and I totally fell in love with them. They are so abstract and dark.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I deleted this novel after getting but a third of the way through it. I found no characters whose fate I was interested in. The writing struck me as forced and harsh. And what finally turned me off was when the author had her principal character, the husband, Nick, tell totally unnecessary and weakly motivated lies to the police. She might as well have hung a sign on him saying, \\"Hey, I am supposed to be prime suspect.\\" x

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the trilogy but was disappointed that last book didnt seem to flow as well as the other two. I also felt that the main character didn't grow much throughout. The ending could have been better also. Still I am looking forward to seeing the movies.
0765324857|4.0|Easy and fast to read, but apparently you'll need to pay the game to finish the story. Think of this book as a bit of candy, but with a really good message about the power of unregulated capitalism.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book and kept wondering to myself, \\"what in the world is all the hype about?\\"  I certainly can't figure out why SO many people are in love with it.  I believe it could have been way better written, there could be more of a plot, and the story itself could go more in depth. It seems like the only thing written in any detail is the sex scenes; the parts that actually tell the story are rushed through to get to another sex scene.  To me, a book needs more than that.
0553593544|5.0|The book was incredible. I stayed up all night because I couldn't put it down. And i read all of his books!!!  The movie is a sacrilege and an insult. In the great book series. Jason Bourne is a retired veteran now with the CIA.<br />The woman he meets and falls in love with is in international banking.  Neither of  these<br />People could be played by 30 something actors. Jason Bourne is closer to 50.<br />  I bet Robert Ludlum is rolling in his grave over what Hollyhad has done to his novels. But I suppose that Illiterate cretins deserve no better and will never know the pleasure of reading a great book.<br /><br />Forgive the typos...this was done on a kindle.
B008IEFJAQ|3.0|Ok, so a lot has already been said/written about this album, but the polarizing reception made me curious from the beginning.  Is this the kind of album we have come to expect from M5, or something else?  Sadly, it's the latter.  Here's my take on each song in this deluxe version:<br /><br />#1 One More Night--this one's ok.  Nothing particularly noteworthy, but nothing overly offensive either.  It has that traditional M5 funk sound we've come to enjoy, even if the phrase \\"Cross my heart and hope to die\\" is cliche.<br />#2 Payphone--really good song, really liked it the first time I heard it on the radio.  Unfortunately this is NOT the radio version, and as stated in other reviews contains some useless rap in the bridge.  The rap is completely irrelevant, doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the song, and conforms to the traditional problem with rap--as long as the words rhyme it doesn't have to have any real message.  Too bad, the song is much better without it.<br />#3 Daylight.  This one's decent.  Again not particularly great and a tad repetitive, but at least it lacks the pop/dance elements that make many of the other songs downright awful.<br />#4 Lucky Strike--Has a fast, driving tempo and beat and...well...that's about it.  Passable, but definitely not one of the better offerings here.<br />#5 The Man Who Never Lied--Pretty good. Sounds more like a M5 song than many of the others, has a good beat without being too much into the dance/techno area and the vocals are typical Adam--in other words very good.<br />#6 Love Somebody--The music on this one is ok, but the lyrics are really too cliche to be taken seriously.  Phrases like \\"fall for you\\", \\"dance the night away\\", \\"take me all the way\\", \\"I think about you every single day\\" sound like they came straight from a grade-school student's attempt at a love letter.<br />#7 Ladykiller--nothing special here.  Nothing particularly interesting about the music, and that high-pitched \\"How could you do it\\" toward the endof every verse---am I listening to M5 here or Earth, Wind & Fire?<br />#8 Fortune Teller--could have been pretty good.  Unfortunately they decided to add the heavy techno beats and synthesizers to the whole thing and it overshadows the lyrics and the rest of the music.  Not terrible, but far from great.<br />#9 Sad--This could well be the best track on the album.  It's just Adam and a piano--and it's great.  No flashy techno beats, no cliches surrounded by dance music, just nothing bad to say about it. I can listen to this one all day and not get tired of it.<br />#10 Tickets--just bad.  Sounds like it should be sung by Lady Gaga.  Given her success maybe that's the point, but it just doesn't fit with M5 at all.<br />#11 Doin' Dirt--I didn't even know what that phrase meant until I looked it up, and I'm still not sure it makes any sense with the rest of the lyrics.  Worse, this is another track where they just pumped up all the dance beats and hope you won't notice the nonsensical words.  Not great to say the least.<br />#12 Beautiful Goodbye--ok, but the music just doesn't seem to fit with the band.  It sounds more like something that would be sung by Jason Mraz.  There's nothing really BAD here, but nothing to write home about either.<br />#13 Wipe Your Eyes--I really like this song, but why add another song on top of it (or rather this song sounds like it's on top of another).  At first I thought they were trying to take a page from Coldplay's \\"Charlie Brown\\" where they have the chorus in a much higher pitch at the beginning of the song.  Turns out it's actually another song called \\"Sabali\\" by Amadou and Mariam.  Go listen to that song, then this one again.  It's almost the exact same song, just with Adam's lyrics on top of it and the tempo sped up a bit.  There's another version of this song that has \\"Oh ne ne ne\\" instead of the Sabali lyrics, but both make it a little weird.  Get past that and this one's a good one.<br />#14 Wasted Years--more like a wasted song.  The whole thing just repeats itself for 3.5 minutes and then it's over.  The music repeats, the lyrics repeat, and it seems you could just replace all the words with \\"dum da dum dum dum dum dum\\" and it would be just as good....or bad<br />#15 Let's Stay Together--as my wife said when she first heard this song:  \\"Why are THEY singing THIS song?\\"  Enough said.....<br /><br />So it's hard to sum up this album.  I've been a fan of the band since it's inception, and I always get excited when a new album comes out.  Unfortunately this is the worst of the 4 main albums they've released.  There are some really good songs here, but some really bad ones too.  Hopefully they will get back to their old sound and stop trying to be something they're not.

0312427646|5.0|This is a perfectly delightful little book by one of Britain's best known writers, Alan Bennett.  The \\"uncommon reader\\" of the title is Queen Elizabeth.  In this very clever fictional account, Bennett has her accidentally stumble upon a mobile library van that has parked near the palace kitchens (she was chasing her barking Corgis).  When offered the opportunity to check out a book she comments something like \\"one doesn't have much time to read\\" but out of politeness lets a young kitchen staff member pick out a book for her.  And, of course, out of politeness she has to read it and return it and get another.  She becomes quite hooked on reading and the consequences are delighted - it will have you laughing out loud.  The tone, plot and dialogue are perfect - it feels so real.  I don't want to give away anything else about the plot but I HIGHLY recommend this book.  It is very short and you can devour it in one or two readings.  Now I am trying to decide which friends deserve it most when I pass it around.  The ending is perfectly delightful.  I guess I will now have to look at some of Mr. Bennett's other books.  And BTW I would love to know if the Queen ever read this book!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Was thinking of only buying certain tracks of this CD and am glad I purchased the whole CD as I would have missed some great music.
0761158820|5.0|Sent as a gift to a precocious 10-year old, who was thrilled with it. His 12-year old brother was also duly impressed. They did not have any problem with cutting or assembling the models and found them sufficiently challenging. I sent him a roller with glue dots as well, as I had read that the dots work much better than wet glue to get that \\"instant hold\\" required when working with 3D paper models. This strategy did indeed pay off in making the models more easily workable (and thus less frustrating for kids), so I would definitely recommend picking up a glue dot roller at the same time, particularly if you are giving the book as a gift.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a fantastic game. I first played this on my granddaughters Ipad. I was so happy when it came out for my Kindle Fire! Very challenging. Enjoyable for young and old alike. Be careful though. It's habit forming.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The reviews and mentions of this book in the press encouraged me to give it a read.  While I thought the writing was excellent and the style very interesting, ultimately I felt cheated because the story ended in a way where no one had any redeeming qualities.  In the end I felt manipulated, and perhaps that is the point.  Readers who enjoy the overly manufactured and edited reality/drama television (Real Housewives, soap operas, etc.) may enjoy this, but if you are someone who looks for the human in humanity, I suggest skipping this book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is like Mitt Romney, the worst kind of tease. Either you see thru the BS so quickly you can't understand why it's not obvious to everyone, or you're so desperate for some kind of sensation that you probe deeper and deeper into nothing.

B003TJR2HS|5.0|Long story, but here it goes.  I have a 2005 vehicle and when I bought the car, I decided to install an iPod adapter for the audio system.  The iPod adapter worked fine, since in 2005, the iPod classic Gen 2 with 40GB drive was the only game in town.  The key was that the charger for the iPod was a Firewire charger, which uses 12 volts to charge the unit and the car adapter was designed to match it.<br /><br />Well, after 7 years of using the original iPod, it was time to change the unit, mostly for wireless sync function where I can change the playlists of the iPod in my car while it's parked in the garage, without unplugging and syncing it through my PC.  We upgraded our iPhones to 4GS, so I decided to use the older iPhone 3Gs as an iPod and take out the phone SIM.  All was going well, until I plugged the iPhone 3Gs in the car, and saw the message on the iPhone saying \\"charging is not supported with this accessory.\\"<br /><br />As it turns out, the newer generation iPod/iPhones use USB charging which is 5 volts and my original car adapter could not charge the \\"newer\\" iPod/iPhone since it was designed for older 12 volt units and the iPhone/iPod is protecting itself by refusing to charge.  By using this device, I was able to use the 3Gs phone in the car, and now the car adapter charges the iPhone 3Gs and plays the music thanks to the passthrough function of this adapter.  It also has a side Mini USB charger, in case the adapter does not supply proper voltage for charging.<br /><br />I highly recommend this adapter since it saved me around $500 if I had to change the car head unit.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG!  What else is there to say........I actually could not put this book down, I was working with only 1-2 hours of sleep because I would read all night.  If you love erotica, there is no way you cannot not read this book.  And the 2nd book is even better.
8862931921|5.0|It looks beautiful on wooden desktop. The touch feel of the paper is so  smooth. It can be fully expanded on a surface. It comes with a bookmark, and you can use another ribbon to bind the notebook.<br /><br />The logo \\"Moleskine\\" is \\"etched\\" on the back cover, you need to pay attention to find it. So the logo doesn't spoil the overall elegant visual design.<br /><br />What more can you expect from a notebook?

B00452BRRE|5.0|The only Velvet Underground album that I listened to for years was VELVET UNDERGROUND & NICO.  This wasn't because I didn't have access to the band's subsequent material -- it was because I refused to believe that anything else the band would release would be as good as their first album.  There could simply be no way for them to top it, right?  It would only be down-hill listening from here.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Big time.<br /><br />The Velvet Underground's first album after founding member (and violist) John Cale's departure from the group finds the band veering towards a more conventional style.  After the bold move of WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT, Reed and Company dial it back on their selftitled album.  It's a much quieter and more beautiful record than its predecessor, but it also takes less chances.  There's nothing as jarring here as \\"Velvet in Furs,\\" or \\"Sister Ray;\\" instead, the album is packed with stunning (mostly concise) rock songs.  The band has traded its experimental tendencies to focus on solid songwriting, and it's a brilliantly successful move.<br /><br />The album begins with Doug Yule's vocals on \\"Candy Says\\" -- this song attempts succeed the beautiful \\"Sunday Morning\\" from the band's first album, and while it might not succeed completely, it stands as one of the best tracks on the album.  The next track \\"What Goes On\\" is a grooving, smiling rocker.  In typical Velvet Underground fashion, this dualistic nature of the band's songwriting (plenty of loud songs, plenty of soft songs, and not many content to fall between) is still present on this album.  Quiet ballad \\"Jesus\\" is a poignant and personal track that follows \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" wonderfully.  Reed winks at his listeners with the upbeat and cute sounding \\"That's the Story of My Life,\\" a song that hides its personal scars under a strong melody.  I really enjoy \\"The Murder Mystery\\" (by far the most psychedelic track here) until its final minute, but at times it feels like the band trying to one-up \\"The Gift.\\"  The album concludes with \\"After Hours,\\" a sweet, nursery-rhyme-like track in which Lou Reed passes the microphone to drummer Mo Tucker.  It's an innocent song, and it bookends the album well with \\"Candy Says.\\"<br /><br />As a whole, THE VELVET UNDERGROUND feels much more consistent than the band's previous albums.  It may be more consistent, but it's missing the ludicrous highs that those past albums were able to offer (\\"Sunday Morning,\\" \\"Waiting for the Man,\\" \\"Venus in Furs,\\" \\"White Light / White Heat,\\" etc...)  The 1996 remastered tracks that serve as the digital copy offered here on Amazon are well done -- the quality is also better than past releases.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Candy Says,\\" \\"Pale Blue Eyes,\\" and \\"Beginning to See the Light.\\"  If you were once like me, only listening to THE VELVET UNDERGROUND & NICO, you've been missing out.  Take the plunge and enjoy these albums.p \\"The Gift.\\"  The album concludes with \\"After Hours,\\" a sweet, nursery-rhyme-like track in which Lou Reed passes the microphone to drummer Mo Tucker.

1451648537|5.0|Simply put: a fabulous book celebrating the life of a genius who has changed the way America thinks.<br /><br />Facing his own limited time, Steve Jobs invited the author into his life and opened for him all access channels to his family, acquaintances, employees and former and current business associates. At the same time, Isaacson was able to look squarely into Steve's eyes as he wrote about his many shortcomings, specifically his aversion to showering and his lifelong history of verbal abuse and callousness toward everyone around him.<br /><br />Supposedly, this rudeness and outright cruelty served Steve's obsession with perfection. But I can't help wonder how many great, exceptional talented people he had lost in the process.<br /><br />The book covers all of Steve Jobs's ups and down, his being ousted from his company and being kept away for years before returning to it, somewhat more mature, yet not more humble.<br /><br />An excellent read that while does not teach us a lesson we can draw from the life of this extraordinary man (other than clean corporations from dead weights, mediocrity, and less than stellar performers), nevertheless is important to place on the shelf of books about the history of human and cultural development.
B001GCUO5W|3.0|You know, I'm not sure that I really liked the story of this movie all that much, but it is worth watching just for Leo's performance alone!
B008XG1X18|5.0|So glad this is available on Kindle Fire now.  Yay!  I'm having no difficulty using this app on my Kindle Fire.  Love the recent update too; makes pinning easier.
B0064NTZ6W|3.0|I don't understand the reviews saying this blu-ray copy is good, I was not impressed with a single frame of video.  The audio is pretty good, but I was let down by the poor, unsharp visuals.  Still a great movie, just not a good upgrade if visuals are important to you.  Since many reviews gave it high marks on PQ, I will watch it again and report back if needed.<br />UPDATE:<br />  To clarify, I bought this movie from Best Buy, it was the single-disk version of the Director's cut, running 208 minutes.  I reviewed it again last night, and while I maintain that IMO it is not the expected blu-ray quality I was hoping for, it may not be reasonable to expect this from such an old movie, with grain, a narrow range of focus, lots of smoke in scenes, etc., it just looked old, especially in the early scenes.<br />  As a comparison, I looked at U-571, and the clarity there was impressive in lots of scenes.  Das Boot is still a great submariner movie, reminding me alot of all those WW2 sub movies I saw when I was a kid, and inspiring me to volunteer for U. S. Navy sub duty, which ironically enough I was turned down for due to my vision, and I ended up in an anti-sub patrol squadron!
034580404X|5.0|Great Easy Read!! Entertaining and Interesting.  Love the Story and the exotic suspense!  Highly Recommend to anyone mature enough to read and be drawn in by the dark and sexy side of Christian Gray.. Bring on the Movie!  BTW work full time with 2 kids and took me less than 10 days to read entire series!  Couldn't put it down!!!
B008BM9L72|5.0|Best book ever. It is so easy to read hope she writes another one. It's not just a book for women all you men out there need to read might learn a thing or too.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A night circus, run by real magic? In!<br /><br />Those were my first thoughts. Once I got into the book, I was continuously impressed with the writing - they author does a great job with character development and seamlessly weaving an intricate plot together. I was very impressed that though sections of the novel take place in different times, the chapters flow together. You are never confused (like which time am I in) but it also never feels like a disjointed leap.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|This is the best from there catalog, it has a great guitar and vocal edge to it.  I like the industrial touches on Blood and other tracks.  Hopefully they pick up on a good tour this year.

B000021Y77|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time whilst visiting Germany - it was playing on TV and in original German (with no subtitles, of course.)  Have I mentioned I don't speak German, apart from \\"bitte\\" and \\"danke\\"?  I actually understood most of the movie!  The basic plot of the movie doesn't revolve around the dialogue, but having seen it later with English subtitles was a much richer experience.  I was so blown away by \\"Lola Rennt\\" in Germany, I went on a mission to buy the soundtrack before I left the country!  (As an aside, it's AWESOME workout music!)  I'm re-purchasing today in DVD format to replace the VHS I bought when I returned to the states in 2000.  Watch this movie - you won't be disappointed.
0385733577|5.0|I knew I was hooked early on when I ran into my daughter's room and nervously asked, \\"You have the rest of this series, right?\\" To which she responded, \\"You know I have the rest of the series; you and mom bought me the rest of the series.\\" To which I responded, \\"Right, right--gimme book two! And don't lend out book three to anyone--Wait!--gimme book three, too.\\" I now have the entire series on loan.<br />Nobody blends mythology and folklore into present day narrative better than Michael Scott. And among his many gifts as a storyteller, my favorite is his ability to first deliver an incredibly entertaining chapter, and then end it with a wallop of a reveal--often delivered in a single, breath-snatching sentence. His did this so many times in THE ALCHEMYST that--when I KNEW I should be sleeping--I learned to page ahead to find out how many pages were left in the chapter I was reading, so I could stop reading for the night a good two pages before the end. IT WAS THE ONLY WAY. I operate very poorly when in sleep-deficit mode. (Word of caution: this method only worked about half the time. As I said, the chapters themselves are incredibly entertaining, and hard to put down.)<br />I can't wait to find out where Sophie and Josh are headed next. (Actually, I know where they're headed--because I read the book! Ha!) And I highly recommend you pick up this series so you can find out too.<br />Job well done, Mr. Scott.
B005BDZLYQ|2.0|I had a real problem.  Bought \\"Real Gone\\" Hank Mobley 8 Classic albums, Bud Powell 8, and Sonny Stitt 3.  The \\"8\\"s come on 4 disks, the \\"3\\" on 2 disks. The SS is fine. All the \\"Real Gone\\" album mutliples might be \\"needle drops\\", taken directly from vinyl disks.  For the price, that is not a problem.  Most of the sound is good enough.  But there is another serious problem with engineering. On 3 of 4 disks for Mobley and Powell, there was 70+ minutes of music.  On those \\"long\\" disks, the last track jumped, skipped, whistled, popped, crackled, terminated wrongly, or looped endlessly.  It happened on several cd players.  I think Real Gone pushed past the limits of what you can get on cd at reasonable quality.  The choice of material was quite good, and nearly all the playback was good enough quality except for the last tracks on 3 of 4 disks per set.  If you want to buy a set for the material that is sonically clear, and will take a chance on the last tracks of some disks, then these sets might still be worth the price.  Just know what you might face.  I will be careful with these sets until I hear from other reviewers that the problem has been cleared up, or was just my personal bad luck.
B0071J58JQ|5.0|Absolutely love this CD set - I got the double.  His voice is mesmerizing.  And the music and lyrics seem fresh to me and different from most music I hear these days.  Can't put it into a category - just give a listen to the sample tracks and you will hear what I mean.  And - \\"Home Again\\" is one of my favorite tracks - just sticks in my head and I hum it all day.
B001GFOBTY|5.0|They will always be the kings! Just a true clasic all the way around. True west cost punk metal, with brains to match.<br />Feeling like you are the only one who is crazy, then this will make you feel in good company. God what a great bunch of killer tunes.

B003L1ZXL6|5.0|This is a classic book that cannot be over-rated and over-recommended.  It reveals Chesterton at his best.  It has been said that Chesterton is the Apostle of Common Sense.  The reader will gainfully understand why and will want to reread this book more than once.
B005ELQVGW|2.0|Back in the day when Bjork came up in conversation, the conversation was usually followed with something like: \\"The beats are SWEEEEET, and her vocals blended with the beat... AAAAMAZING!!\\"............. What is going on with the last two albums?? The critics who once hated her now love her, and the fans get the finger????? Do we have to wait for a remix cd to get the complex house beats that she WAS known for??? It's cool to dabble with new ideas, but don't forget your roots.... and the rest of us you left behind. P.S. We still love her, just throw us a bone.
0375507256|5.0|You may categorize this as a post-modern novel, (  Gaddis, Pynchon, Barth, Nabakov, DFW, etc.) according to whatever critical theory definition you have of that \\"genre\\", but for me, it's most concrete virtue was it's good theme- our greed and quest for power will ultimately destroy us. Our civilization and culture are poisoned. What lies beyond this dystopia? I think the book answered those questions for me, and will for you also.<br />The writing was very polished and professional. The author searched for and found a unique and different way to express his metaphors-bravo!<br />A very quick read, even though you had to switch gears and find the authors voice because of his style pyrotechnics several times.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|nice app. like it a lot<br /><br />would surely tell friends abt it. nice visual n works like a charm. will keep.
B000002IKR|4.0|The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star is the fact that compared to the production tools today, it stinks. At the time it crushed big time, but going back you hear a poor job of studio talent . Still a album for the ages.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is fantastic. it has a creative set up that is easy to use and looks pretty cool. the sounds are very clear and sound natural, not like a rough recording at all. I use this app every night.
B006T3RM08|5.0|Bought the Henge Docks Clique from Amazon.com.  I was concerned about the Apple Track Pad retaining the \\"click\\" function.  This function requires the Track Pad to be placed on a hard surface to \\"push against\\" in order to \\"click.\\"  That is, when you push the Track Pad, it moves and gives you the \\"click\\" feedback.  I read several other posts, including one on YouTube which demonstrated the Track Pad \\"click\\" function is retained with the Henge Docks Clique.<br /><br />Installation of the Key Board and Track Pad was easy.  Track Pad \\"click\\" function was retained.  Both are held securely in the Henge Docks Clique allowing both to be used away from a desk top (i.e. on your lap while lying on a sofa).  I use this with my Mac Mini.<br /><br />Overall - works as advertised.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|@ first I started to read fifty shades to see what all the hype was about....but soon enough I fell in love w the characters and their crazy unconventional love story. After the first few chapters I was hooked :-)) read the trilogy within a weeks time. Now my sister is hooked & can't put it down. This book is far more than just the \\"dirty book hype\\" I would definately keep recommending it to others.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Every now and then I think of this movie and ponder on the emotional events that surrounded this horse's experiences during the second world war.<br />The sequence of events touched my heart, but the fact that they cover several years took me completely by surprise which leads to a four star review.<br />Great dialogue, drama, and action. It also shows several perceptions of war that are often overlooked. i.e. emotional and physical effect on multiple families, the \\"horsemasters,\\" battle logistics, and economical effects on land and people.
B00005T7I1|1.0|THe DVD stopped about halfway through, which I know happens sometimes.  I tried skipping backwards and then forwards in order to \\"jump\\" the damaged area but nothing happened.  When I looked at the back of the disc I noticed a very larger, very deep scratch.  I hadn't bothered to check before loading the disc since I figured that a brand new DVD right out of the package wouldn't have any damage.  I've tried everything I can think of to repair, resurface, or get the laser to continue reading the undamaged parts of the disc but I guess the damage is just too bad.<br /><br />This is probably the 3rd or 4th DVD i've bought off of Amazon recently that has been damaged right out of teh package.

054531058X|5.0|I don't know what to add to the lengthy and excited conversation about this book except that I loved it. Collins is an excellent storyteller, her pacing is perfect, and with Katniss she has invented a morally complex narrator who defies expectations of typical \\"heroism.\\" Fantastic book.
B005USZML4|5.0|As always John Grisham's is at his best with the excitement he creates in his novels.  I really enjoyed the series on\\"Theodore Boone\\".  Exceptional!
B007N85ZXY|5.0|love the album, it's classic Neil Young (and Crazy Horse)taking a lot of the songs we knew as children and given them a \\"grown up\\" rework - most of the times it was by restoring the original lyrics before they were sanitized.  the last cut on the album is most provacative - God Bless the Queen (a nod to his Canadian roots, though I'm sure those younger than he sang \\"O Canada\\" in school) that morphs into My Country Tis of Thee.
B008M34INW|4.0|I must not have seen any previews for this in the theater but this movie was great! I thought it would be a big let down because it didn't get much publicity but one of the better movies I have watched in months. Great Job Mel!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've seen it twice in theaters and both times blew my mind. It has EVERYTHING a good popcorn flick should have: good action, funny dialogue and unforgettable characters. I was afraid it would be little over bloated with so many superheroes (see Spiderman 3) but boy was I wrong. Every character is nicely fleshed out, useful and gets their time to shine. Tom Hiddleston as Loki was perfectly cast. I loved him in Thor and in Avengers, he's even better. He is completely delusional, full of himself and comical at the same time. He's the kind of villain that honestly believes in its own greatness and as such he deserves the praise, which gives him the justification to make people \\"kneel\\" in submission. Where he lacks in physical strength, he makes up for it in manipulation & deceit. Tom Hiddleston got him DOWN, as they say: the smirk, the anger and over bloated ego. I'm proud to call myself a Loki groupie. I can't wait for my BLU RAY to arrive so I can bask in his glory.
0765365278|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but I'm afraid he doesn't have enough respect for his work.  I don't understand why these authors cave to the publishers and $$$.  I'm not investing in a 10 book series, they always disappoint.  Look at Jordan, Erikson and Martin - the quality is almost bound to go downhill.  I think it's very difficult for the author to retain focus for so long.

B007Z9RAX4|2.0|It didn't have the action in it that I was hoping for the story was lame you knew how it was going to end from the start. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing if there were good graphics or interesting martial arts but none of that happened. This film did nothing for me. I gave it 2 stars because I did finish watching it but that is the only reason.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|FINAL UPDATE:  My original review(below) was designed to help people get information about the 3D release(Theatrical version in 3D and a 2D DVD copy--with no extras), before it was available to the general public. This review was written before the extended collector's edition was available. I hope those of you who purchased either the 3D or extended editions are enjoying it.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/2012: Final 3D release price was $24.96<br /><br />UPDATE 8/2012: Just want to clear up a misconception that some people may have. In order to view the Panasonic Exclusive edition you did NOT need to own a 3D Panasonic HDTV and Blu-ray player. It worked on ANY 3D system. It was, however, only FREE to those who purchased Panasonic HDTV's, Blu-ray players and 3D Starter Kits during Panasonic's special promotion periods.<br /><br />As this \\"Collector's Edition\\" is currently only a Pre-order item the purpose of my review is to provide information on what exactly this edition will contain as information becomes available and to address some obvious questions about the release (feel free to skip around to any questions that interest you). I own Avatar 3D(Panasonic Exclusive) and it is indeed terrific eye candy and a stunning showpiece in our 3D collection.<br /><br />--Is it worth owning? Absolutely, if you have the 3D technology, liked the movie or simply want a great 3D experience.<br />--Should you buy it now if you've been waiting for it? Certainly, haven't you waited long enough for a 3D general release? It's time to finally see it.<br />--Should you pre-order it now if you want it? I would. Amazon could raise the price of this item before the release date or after if it's a big success. (Pre-orders are not billed to you credit card until the item is ready to ship. So your credit card will not be charged until about 3-5 days before the release)<br />--Should you buy it if you already have the 3D Panasonic Exclusive? Probably not. Rent or borrow it, but hold out for the 3D Extended Collector's Edition.<br /><br />While of course I haven't actually seen this NEW edition yet, here is what I do know about it. This new two-disc Avatar 3D Blu-ray Collector's Edition will feature the original THEATRICAL release and be available in all-new special collectible packaging. The 2D and 3D theatrical versions of the film will be accessible on the Blu-ray disc and the included DVD will be 2D only. There has been no mention of this version including the extended cut of the movie or any extra special features or goodies. Even so, right now it looks like the NEW Amazon version will be better than the Panasonic Exclusive release. (The Panasonic Exclusive had no extras and didn't come with a separate standard DVD copy)<br /><br />Is the new [[ASIN:B008XBCJ34 Avatar (3D Blu-ray Collector's Edition)]] going to have all of the versions and extras available on the non 3D  [[ASIN:B0044XV3QY Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]?<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The official announcement said that it will be the THEATRICAL cut. My guess is that if they were including other versions they would have said so as this would have created more of a buzz. There is speculation though that it will contain some new extras as this has become James Cameron's pet project.<br /><br />Multiple sources have correctly predicted that when the 3D version was finally released it would not be a \\"complete\\" edition and Fox and Cameron would attempt to double dip by offering a barebones edition first(October, 2012) and then a complete edition with the 3 versions of the movie and extras later on down the road. (as they did with the DVD versions)  Many people will be very disappointed or even angry about this issue while others will be extremely happy to at last be able to own a copy of Avatar in 3D.<br /><br />Will this theatrical Collector's Editionbe exactly the same as the Panasonic exclusive edition in regards to picture quality and sound?<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The official press announcement stated \\"this release offers the highest picture quality possible\\". The original movie was created using the Fusion Camera System, a digital movie camera system developed by James Cameron and Vince Pace and shot on multi format 3D Sony cameras. Avatar 3D is pretty much still the benchmark to which every 3D movie released in the USA is compared. It is hard to believe that it can or will be improved upon.<br /><br />What languages and with what subtitles will this new 3D edition be offered?<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Amazon's Product details say \\"Language: English, French, Spanish, Subtitles: English, French, Spanish\\". However, the Panasonic Exclusive said:<br />\\"Master Audio is English 5.1 DTS, French Spanish and Portuguese Audio in 5, Subtitles in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese\\" so I guess the only question is regarding Portuguese.<br /><br />Will this be a Region Free release?<br />---------------------------------------<br />The 3D Panasonic Exclusive was Region Free(Confirmed for Region A, B, C). I would guess that this release will be the same although currently it is only confirmed for Region A (Region B & C are untested).<br /><br />Are people complaining that this release doesn't contain the extended version(cut) of the movie or that it's not an extended Collector's Edition?:<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Well, both actually. It's about not having to spend more hard earned money on yet another version of Avatar and also about getting a different cut of the movie.<br />1) Those who already own the 3D Avatar Panasonic Exclusive(2D/3D single disc blu-ray) really wanted this to be the extended cut(16 additional minutes, including alternate opening on earth) or contain both the theatrical and the extended cut of the movie. Yes, this release does have an extra DVD copy(2nd disc) but otherwise there's nothing new.<br /><br />2) Those who own both the 3D Avatar Panasonic Exclusive AND the non-3D Collector's Edition Blu-ray AND those who never purchased ANY version of this movie wanted this release to be the final, complete release with all 3 versions of the movies plus all the extras and goodies, hence, a TRUE COMPLETE 3D COLLECTOR'S EDITION.<br /><br />About the Extended version: The \\"extended cut\\" of Avatar is not simply 16 additional minutes slammed onto the front end of the movie. It does start differently which adds some time to the beginning scenes but the 16 minutes difference is much more. It's little bits added and cut here and there(scenes, dialogue, locations, action) which many people feel made it a better movie. Other reviewers felt the extended cut \\"lends further depth to the characters\\", \\"fills in important parts of the storyline\\", \\"enhances one's enjoyment of the film\\", and that \\"the Extended Edition of AVATAR and regular theatrical version are like watching two different films\\". Here's a review that detailed the exact changes if you're interested(beware! contains spoilers):<br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ENZY9G8KPC3N/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044XV3QY&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=<br /><br />So I guess the big question is whether this 3D version will be too little too late? (My thoughts)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />By now almost anyone who liked this movie already owns it in either DVD or Blu-ray form. My hunch is that this release will sell EXTREMELY well no matter what's on it! There is a large group of people who have patiently waited for this 3D release and the price is certainly affordable for almost everyone.  PLUS, since the original theater showing of this film in 2009 many people have been slowly upgrading to 3D HDTV's and 3D Blu-ray players(or bought a Playstation 3). The big selling point here for Avatar in 3D is that technically 3D is \\"the way it was meant to be seen\\" as developed by director James Cameron. Hype or not, on that premise alone people are likely to purchase it. Probably even people who don't especially like the sci-fi/fantasy genre and/or have NEVER seen the movie but now  have a 3D HDTV setup will be buying it.<br /><br />Since Cameron has announced \\"I'm in the \\"Avatar\\" business.

After waiting so long for this general release, for $27.99 I feel we should be getting more than just the barebones 3D edition. I feel cheated. This is certainly a 5-star movie based on technical merit alone, but I'll reserve the last star until I'm totally certain what the \\"Collector's Edition\\" contains. After all, this isn't really a review of just the movie. There have already been 5 releases of Avatar(2 DVD, 2 Blu-ray, 1 3D Panasonic exclusive). So a review of a \\"Collector's Edition\\" also needs to look at what's on the discs and the packaging too. The new cover art is pretty cool, but if they put this in a steelbook case or it had a stereoscopic jacket, now that would be something.<br /><br />Food For Thought: I'm not quite sure why Amazon and other websites are tagging this as a \\"Collector's Edition\\". This just isn't true. The box art simply says \\"Limited Edition\\" and even Cameron didn't call it a collector's edition in his press release. It should just be listed as \\"Avatar - Limited 3D Edition\\".<br />UPDATE: Amazon has changed the title name of this offering to \\"Avatar (3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray/ DVD Combo Pack)\\" and removed the Collector's Edition working. Thank you Amazon.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />-------------<br />It's great that Avatar will finally be available to the general public in October. There will be much rejoicing over this in many homes.<br />However, Cameron's exclusive Panasonic deal has left a bad taste in many of our mouths.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|I picked this up along with a [[ASIN:B003UCESP8 FiiO L3 Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]] in addition to a FiiO E09K amp (which is not available on Amazon at this time).<br /><br />The menus are easy to navigate and it has a few nice features (balance, bass, treble controls, etc) and it'll last around 15 hours on a charge. It's pretty rare that I listen to that much in a day so I can't say I've really put the battery to the test yet.<br /><br />As a portable amp this is very capable of driving my [[ASIN:B000R2PC2M Sennheiser PXC 450 NoiseGard Active Noise-Canceling Headphones]] with the gain set to 6db when connected to my old Apple iPhone 3G using the L3 line out cable. When docked to my FiiO E09K and connected to my MacBook Pro via USB it has no problem syncing at 24/96 (maximum bit rate via USB) and Mac OS remembers its volume settings and switches automatically to the FiiO when it is connected.<br /><br />The only little quirk I've found is the sleep timer isn't really what you think it is. I thought it was a setting to tell it to power down automatically after a period of inactivity. Instead you set it to say, 60 minutes and it turns off after the time has elapsed. I guess it is useful if you are listening to music in bed?<br /><br />When it comes down to it, you can't really beat this thing for the number of features it has (portable amp, USB sound card, etc) for the price. Highly recommended.

B005WTR4ZI|4.0|As we enter into the election cycle, this is a book well worth reading in terms of unemployment, taxes, business challenges and the future of the country in the age--the rapidly growing and expanding age--of technology.<br /><br />Most of the major campaign issues are included, and, no matter if you are Republican, Democrat or Independent, this is a book well worth reading.<br /><br />Technology is changing our lives. These authors are of the opinion that we, we humans, can't beat Technology, so we better find a way to work with technology rather than against it.  This book outlines their plan and their concern...<br /><br />They use an interesting analogy for man vs. technology: John Henry, the Steel Driving Man and his race against the steel driving machine. John Henry was good, but the steel driving machine, the steam engine, was better..and steam engine eventually took over the work of men like John Henry. Technology, modern day steam engines, are taking over jobs today. What are we going to do about it?  What can we do about it?<br /><br />An important book if we are to understand the challenges of the 21st century.

B0085A9HXS|4.0|The Raid: Redemption (Serbuan Maut) is a 2011 Indonesian action/martial arts epic extravaganza that seems to be a feature-length version of the last 40 minutes of John Woo's epic Hard-Boiled. And that's not necessarily a criticism, either. There's no doubt that director Gareth Evans set out to produce a gritty, no-quarter-given 100 minute adrenaline overload of action mayhem, and too his credit he was able to make an engaging and great-looking movie in an extremely limited environment with an even more limited budget.<br /><br />The plot, rather unsurprisingly, is inconsequential. That is to say, there is just enough storyline to keep things moving along briskly. Iko Uwais stars as Rama, a rookie officer on a Jakarta SWAT team, with a pregnant wife at home.... and, save for a somewhat conventional reveal that comes about halfway through the movie, that's pretty much all the character development and definition you're going to get in this movie. Uwais is a strong screen presence and, even more effectively, an incredibly kinetic martial artist in the Pencak Silat discipline. Along with the rest of a 20-member SWAT team, he is ordered to raid a slum tenement -- a known haven for criminals, killers, drug pushers, and the like -- in order to eliminate a drug lord known as Tama Riyadi. Who ordered the raid and why? These questions drive the story, which takes a turn for the insanely suspenseful when the SWAT team is pinned down and trapped inside the building, with no backup coming, no outgoing communication, and, even worse, nobody knowing they are there in the first place. If that wasn't bad enough, Tama gets on the intercom and announces to all the building's residents that whomever kills a police officer gets free rent for life. The cops suddenly become the hunted, with no place to hide and legions of hardcore killers gunning for bear.<br /><br />This is all set up in the first fifteen minutes. The remaining 80 feature any manner of violence, action, gore, depravity,you name it, as the surviving officers try to find some way -- ANY way -- to escape the building. All of it is excellently staged and shot, including some of the most exciting martial arts sequences that -- while FAR from realistic -- avoid much of the 90s/00s genre cliches (slow-mo, wire-fu, etc.) and coast by on sheer brutality. We're talking spine-snapping, bone-crunching, neck-twisting, limb-rendering goodness. You know... for kids!<br /><br />The Raid: Redemption is an unapologetically violent action film, and on that level it is quite superlative. If you want character development, plot complexity, or nuance of any kind, you're best served elsewhere. Is there enough plot to keep things from being little more than a stylistic exercise? Surely, but without the insanely watchable battle sequences -- including a ridiculously incredible 3-way fight sequence between Uwais, Donny Alamsyah, and Yayan Ruhian, the latter of whom playing a brutal yet somehow honorable thug called \\"Mad Dog\\" and providing the movie's most memorable character -- there would be no other reason for The Raid: Redemption to exist. Yet as a sheer adrenalin blast of gleeful kineticism, this movie excels in abundance.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|This is a well written, expertly performed, and beautifully produced record - if you like early Beatles, Stax, blue-eyed soul and well-crafted, melodic songs, this is the best album that has been released in years - and it's not a revival kick.  Nick could be the heir to Elvis Costello if he continues to develop and dversify; the sound he gets is organic and clean.  His ultimate talent might be as a record producer, this record sounds THAT good.<br /><br />Best album of the last 5 years

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was exciting and definitely a page-turner, but the writing left much to be desired and the ending was lackluster. Enjoy this book on your kindle on the treadmill or lounging by the pool, just don't take it too seriously.

B005QUQP76|3.0|This mouse has a few good points; it glides on the surface, as if on a cushion of air, the buttons are well placed and it's very sturdy. I've been through most of the so-called Gaming mice out there and found the M60 to be the most rugged. However,as a Gaming mouse, I found a big problem with it. The buttons are to hard to press and you have to put your hand into crazy configurations to operate them. For example, when you try and press a thumb button, the pressure required automatically forces your index off the left button, the \\"fire\\" button in all FPS games.<br />They say it takes a while to get used to, but I've had it for almost a month and I had to replace it with a different brand.<br />I moved to another computer I use for audio/video/graphics production and found it useful because of the many button programming options and it's precision. The programming software is very easy to use.<br />So, if you're into high paced gaming, this won't do it.

0765348276|5.0|The only real flaw with this book is that the author hasn't spent any time in the military. I have, so some of the military interactions are pretty cringe-worthy. Readers that don't know anything about the military probably won't notice. This is his first book, and there are some parts where awkward wording makes this a little obvious, but Scalzi is such a good storyteller that you don't notice it much.<br />The first half of the book pretty much details the travels of the main character as he transitions from civilian life on earth to military life in the colonies. I found this part particularly interesting because you get discover this new culture with the character. The second half of the book is an account of the character's military service. It's a first person book, so you know the main character won't die, but Scalzi doesn't let you get too comfortable with supporting characters.<br />All in all, a great read. I did it in less than 24 hours and I laughed out loud on more than one occasion. Some of the humor is a little cheesy and the aliens are a bit cartoonish, but hey, still a great book.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works well for playing the game. Yes there are ad pop ups but for a free app what do you expect. sometimes you give up a little time to get it for free. No other problems so good game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After the movie hype, I decided to read the book. I was surprised it was better than I'd expected it to be. Although it is marketed as a young adult genre with a fantasy element, the way Collin's has constructed a story around survival in a dystopian society mingled with very convincing sci-fi elements made it a good read for an adult.<br /><br />The main characters were well developed, the plot was generally solid and I can see why it was turned into a movie. Having said that, I do not feel compelled to read the rest of the books in this trilogy as I am satisfied with the way the story ended and I am not interested in what happens to the characters after, but I would be interested in watching any subsequent movies made.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I fell into this book hard & fast.  I stayed up way too late because I could not put it down! I found myself emotional, wiping away the tears more than one time.  There are parts of this book that is shocking,gripping, mysterious and sexual.  I liked the characters and can not wait for the sequil.  This book has it all, yes it is a little immature at times but the story itself makes up for that. What a good story it is! I loved this book!
0345803507|5.0|Okay I've written reviews for the first two books stating how non hardcore they are and I was right about them. I think the author decided since in book three they are married she can go hotter. This book is practically all sex with plot shoved between lol. It gets redundant actually but the storyline around it is so good you don't mind. It will pull you in with the first page. In an odd way...and you will agree probably if you read the Twilight series...this book reminds me of some plot lines from there lol. Still worth staying up to ungodly hours of the morning lol. Enjoyed every minute reading it. Will miss reading about these people. Look forward to how hollywood makes it into a movie and not a NC17 one lol.
B002WJI66C|5.0|It looks awesome! It came on time and I was very pleased with the condition of the product, as well as the quality.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|Read the first half of the book, then you have the horrible story of what happened to Jaycee.  I have to say that I respect her 100% and can see that she is intellegent and devoted to her children.  I just found that the book itself became a little boring for me, reading about her animals over and over. With this said, I would still suggest the book. It is a good lesson regarding what to do if you are kidnapped or to discuss with your children on what to do.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is by far the best sci-fi series I have read in a long long time.  I usually find myself predicting what would happen in a series of books and finding myself not at all surprised when it happens but I will tell you that the Wool series kept me hooked the entire time, always wanting to read just one more chapter to find out what was going to happen.  The characters are engaging and you really feel like you understand the motivations and actions being taken.  Nothing was really too far \\"out there\\" to not be believable given the circumstances.  Totally engaging and I really hope someone at HBO or stars or somewhere is reading these reviews because this deserves to be made into a 1 season mini-series.  I think there is too much there to do it justice in a movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was looking for something to read after 50 shades of Grey.  Someone told me about Bared to you, and I bought it right away.  This is such a good read, it is not as porn like as 50 shades yet you can not put the book down.  My only disappointment is that I have to wait till this October to read book 2!!!!  I would highly recommend this book, and have recommened it to many friends all who have liked it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I received an e-mail from Amazon to review this book. I was bewildered because I thought I did not buy it yet. I thought that I am still reading the second book from \\"Game of Thrones\\". Today I installed Kindle on my iPhone and first book that popped up is \\"A Storm of Swords: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three\\". For about a month I thought I am reading the previous one. This book is so fantastic that I forgot about all other books on my Kindle reader. \\"Game of Thrones\\" are huge books and satisfy my readers appetite very much. I did not even notice when I switched to next tome :)
B004WY2M8I|4.0|These three books are fantastic! However I wish Kindle would divide the book into three on my device so I can keep track of where I am in each of the books (Kindle lumps all three together making it one long book with no way to tell how far you are in each one)

0345803507|5.0|E L James pays close attention to detail in her descriptions.  She makes you care about the characters and keep you yearning for more.  The language is simple and makes for a very quick read.  Many people criticize the plot and say the characters are unrealistic; fortunately for us, this is a fiction book and it doesn't have to be realistic.  It was a great distraction from day-to-day events.  This book is labeled under \\"Steamy Romance\\"; if you have conservative/traditional viewpoints that you don't like to be challenged... maybe it's not for you?  If you go into it open-minded you may be pleasantly surprised.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|My husband recommended this book for my Kindle -- It is simply an amazing story of family, dedication, love, undying commitment, loyalty, and perseverance.  I am amazed every day by the sacrifices that our military men, women & their families make in order for those of us Americans to enjoy the many freedoms we do.  Our sincerest thank you to the Brown family and all of our military veterans, reserves, and active duty personnel for your service.
