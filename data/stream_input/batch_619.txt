B0002S94BG|5.0|I can't say enough good things about Jeff Buckley and his music.  This special edition of his breakout album (and his only completed album), Grace, is worth picking up.  I had never got the unreleased \\"Forget Her\\" before (even though I think it was pretty easy to come by) until I got this.  That song alone is worth the special edition.
1590581814|2.0|You can get an idea about the story from other people's reveiws. I can just tell you that this was a disapointing recoomendation from Amazon. You can read this in one sitting as it is very short. The story is basic and very unoriginal. I would bet money that this was the authors classroom assignment. The story flashes back and forward in time to give it a Momento-esque story line, but keeps it realy simple so the average slurpee pusher at 7-11 can follow the story between customers. This book would have been a good product for a community college creative writing class, but as for spending money on it, I wouldn't do it unless you are trying to make the transition from fantasy novels to detective pulp.
0385510454|2.0|Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...

B000G8NY4U|5.0|I originally caught Yanni Live on PBS and immediately ordered the CD/DVD combo.  It's a good thing CDs and DVDs are read by a laser or I'd probably already be starting to wear it out if this were on traditional vinyl!  There are multiple superb tracks by great musicians on these discs, but my personal favorite track has to be \\"Playtime\\" which features Ming Freeman on keyboards, Sayaka Katsuki on violin and Pedro Eustache on sax.  The verses played back and forth between Sayaka and Pedro are marvelous, leading up to the two of them finishing the track in unison!  Crank it up.... WAY UP!!!
B000GPIPSS|1.0|So Universal turned up the contrast and brightness on the 75th anniversary DVD of DRACULA, and now expects us to shell out more money for something that we, the buying public, could easily do ourselves, with the picture controls on either our TV's or DVD players, with the original DVD releases of the film.<br /><br />But, who'd want to???<br /><br />As it looks now, everything is bright and cheery; outside the inn, during sunset, looks like mid day in the dessert, inside the inn, lit only by a fire, looks like mid day in the dessert, Dracula's catacombs, where there's no desirable means of nature or unnatural light, looks like mid day in the dessert, Renfield's entrance into Dracula's castle's antechamber, looks like mid day in the..., well, you get the picture.<br /><br />And to make matters worse, the original mono soundtrack is impossible to listen to, where as in the first DVD version of the film, there is some tape hiss and crackle, most noticeable during talking, during silent parts though (of which there are many, seeing as the director started out directing silent films, and thus relying more on mood and action then dialog, to tell the story) the hiss and crackle are almost non existent, but in the new mono track for the 75th anniversary DVD, there's this constant waterfall like noise going on in the background of the film, that is the constant during silent and talking parts.<br /><br />Oh, but the sound on the track with Philip Glass's new score is perfect, with no tape his or crackle, but instead, you have the crappily intrusive score to take the place of the previous hiss and crackle (and it ain't any better then the hiss and crackle, let me tell you...)<br /><br />So, other then another commentary track by a guy who sounds like he's reading excerpts from an upcoming book that he's writing, and who's only claim to Dracula fame, is the mildly amusing, Dracula, Dead And Loving It (if you want to see it done right, check out, Love At First Bite) and a clips documentary on Universal monster movies (which if you own all of the Universal monster DVD's, you don't really need) then there's no reason to fork out the extra dough to pick up the newest version of  this cinematic classic.and a clips documentary on Universal monster movies (which if you own all of the Universal monster DVD's, you don't really need) then there's no reason to fork out the extra dough to pick up the newest version of  this cinematic classic.
0618680004|5.0|I strongly recommend this book to all. Dawkins is one of the best thinkers of our time. Undoubtedly he will continue to be attacked for not being \\"charming,\\" as one reviewer has written, or for not pandering to the egos of supernaturalists, but he is a fearless scholar who uses clear reasoning to reject religion and all its silliness.  <br /> <br />And why, indeed, should anyone take pains to assure believers that they aren't \\"stupid\\" when they believe in something without a single iota of evidence? What would we say about someone who professed a belief in fairies or unicorns? Ought we to show respect for such unsupported beliefs? Dawkins maintains that we should not; by respecting unsupported supernatural beliefs, we are enabling the delusion to linger. He proposes that we treat the religiously delusional as we'd treat flat-earthers or alchemists. He offers the world a much needed dose of common sense. <br />
0385474547|5.0|This is the first African novel I ever read, and it really impressed me, in the same way that life in Africa impressed me: it is direct and without concessions, and yet it has an eternal, mythical quality.<br /><br />There is a constant play of contrasts and paradoxes in \\"Things Fall Apart.\\"  The descriptions of daily life in the Ibo tribe of Nigeria are totally realistic, and yet the mythical world of African magic always seems present.  The reader both admires and despises Okonkwo, the main character, who is charismatic and intelligent, but also selfish and unspeakably cruel.  Traditional life in Nigeria seems isolated and timeless, though politically, at the time of the story, Nigeria is a British colony on the verge of independence.<br /><br />The novel is easy to read, and manageably short, but deserves a second reading to reveal its many levels of symbolism and meaning.<br /><br />A great work.
B00006IU73|5.0|In Absentia and their next offering Deadwing present a departure from the previous PT offerings, taking a heavier slant, distorted guitars etc. An album worthy of any rock/metal collection.

B000HCO83Q|4.0|This should have been an all out epic battle and granted, there are some very cool action scenes and performance, even the startling inclusion of Kelsey Grammer.<br /><br />What failed, for me, was the small role the Dark Phoenix had against the backdrop of \\"The Cure\\" fiasco and Magneto's war.  The Dark Phoenix' role promised to be grand and spectacular and instead, fell apart at Alcatraz with a simple expression of love and Jean Grey's offing. Xavier's death was more intense, emotional and grand.  Like the characters, I was shocked and saddened by that turn of event; I didn't get that with Jean Grey's fisted puncture.<br /><br />Though Brett Ratner's getting some big projects and has done some cool action sequences in his other movies, what he lacks, as does Tim Story of Fantastic Four, is the ability to create iconic imagery, something that makes the movie's scenes and visuals stand out.  Peter Jackson managed to make every frame of the Lord of the Rings trilogy seem like a piece of art; Ratner doesn't seem to know how to create interesting imagery that wasn't prevized by an effects company.  It all seems rather standard and goes by the film school playbook.<br /><br />The duality in my feelings with the movie come from the fates of all the other characters, from the throwaway death of Scott, to the humanizing of Rogue and Mystique.  They are far from the roles in the comic, yet I understand why the filmmakers did it.  I like the movie for the chances they took; I don't like it at the same time.<br /><br />What I am most bugged about, though, is the finale of the movie with the Dark Phoenix.  Her use of her power didn't seem as epic as it could have been and the pure evil of her character was wasted.<br /><br />I'm gonna' get this movie though.  It's flawed, but it still makes a great addition to any scifi/fantasy buff's video shelf.
0141439807|3.0|Mansfield Park, by Jane Austen (whose death at an early age was a tragedy for literature), was an intriguing window into the life of English families in the late 1700s and early 1800s.  The arrogance and pomposity of the land holding families, the invisibility of servants, the status of women, class consciousness, and the self-centeredness of those who didn't have to work for a living all come out in this novel.<br /><br />The story focuses on Fanny, the daughter of a sister who didn't marry as well as another sister.  In a fit of compassion (loosely defined), the wealthier sister takes on Fanny as a companion to use and a project to make.  Over the next decade, Fanny evolves from a homesick and chronically shy girl into a most balanced character.  Surrounding this story are the highs and lows of the other characters, her aunts, uncle, and her cousins and their friends.<br /><br />As a story, Mansfield Park is rather tedious and sleep-inducing.  The detail is almost overwhelming.  The insight into this period, however, is fascinating.  Jane Austin clearly was a very astute observer of the life and times of people around her.
B000063CPL|4.0|Review no. 105. 'Rock In Rio' is a good 2-CD, 21 track live audio document of Iron Maiden playing to a crowd of reportedly a quarter of a million (supposedly their largest crowd ever) at the 2001 Rio Rock Festival. Nice to see the return of frontman / vocalist Bruce Dickenson. Tunes I liked experiencing once again were the the title cut from their new (at the time) CD, \\"Brave New World\\", \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\", \\"Trooper\\", \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", the band's namesake \\"Iron Maiden\\", \\"Number Of The Beast\\" and of course \\"Run To The Hills\\". I saw Maiden earlier on this very tour and I remember other fans complaining they didn't play ENOUGH older material. Actually, I myself thought they performed an extremely well balanced set. Great cover, no?
B000GFLAI0|5.0|There are a lot of things to occupy America's thoughts these days: War, terrorism, the economy, the Hurricane Katrina crisis, gas prices, and (depending on who you ask) an incompetent president and his administration. Bob Dylan, however, isn't thinking about any of that on his new album, MODERN TIMES. He's thinking about Alicia Keys. If anything else is on his mind, he doesn't blatantly say so. Like most of Dylan's output, a lot of this latest offering is open to interpretation. Is \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" actually about Hurricane Katrina? That's for you to decide.    What IS obvious is that MODERN TIMES is another masterpiece in the canon of the 65-year-old singer/songwriter. Like TIME OUT OF MIND and \\"LOVE AND THEFT\\" before it, MODERN TIMES is rooted in the blues and other American song forms, the origins of which are all at least eighty years old. These forms still hold considerable power; Dylan has been completely revitalized by them. His voice hasn't been this expressive in decades and his band, which he claims is the best he's ever had (a statement that will undoubtedly spark debate), plays with a natural and relaxed intensity. That's not even mentioning the songs.    What a batch of songs they are - \\"Thunder On The Mountain,\\" \\"Rollin' & Tumblin',\\" and \\"Someday Baby\\" (an expertly crafted 15-bar blues) crackle with energy and drive. \\"Spirit On The Water\\" is a gorgeous and lovelorn ballad, featuring a gently swinging groove and a lyrical harmonica solo. The country waltz \\"When The Deal Goes Down\\" is lovely. \\"Beyond The Horizon\\" is the weakest song on the album, but it is still an interesting offering in old-time swing. \\"Nettie Moore\\" is one of Dylan's more interesting songs, with each verse split up into sections of 11 and 14 beats; the chorus is simply beautiful. \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" could have used the bite it would have been afforded on \\"LOVE AND THEFT,\\" but it is still a great song.    The two greatest songs on the album, however, are masterpieces thatwill undeniably stand among Dylan's best songs. \\"Workingman's Blues #2\\" is simultaneously a love song and an anthem to the working man, a political statement the likes of which Dylan hasn't attempted in years. The closest thing to a full-out rock song on the album, its beautiful melody, chord progression, and well-written lyrics assure it status as an instant classic. The album's ominous closer, \\"Ain't Talkin',\\" is the best on the album, painting a bleak portrait of a world where \\"every nook and cranny has its tears\\" and people will \\"jump on your misfortune when you're down.\\" The subdued backing of the band and Dylan's rough voice suits this song better than any other. It is truly haunting, and even after the final major chord you cannot help but feel chills.    All in all, this album doesn't quite reach the majestic heights of \\"LOVE AND THEFT\\" (it's not as much fun and doesn't rock as hard), but it still stands head and shoulders above most of Dylan's other albums. Its songwriting is excellent and Dylan hasn't sounded this good in a long time. In a year of many great releases by many great artists, MODERN TIMES is among the very best.

0316168815|3.0|In The Lovely Bones, 14-year-old Susie Salmon (\\"like the fish\\") is raped, murdered, dismembered, and her remains are hidden by a neighbor and serial killer, Mr. Harvey.  This happens at the very beginning of the book.  The rest is the story of Susie's family and friends, investigators, and Mr. Harvey over the next decade, mostly from the perspective of Susie, who is watching from heaven.<br /><br />Issues covered include missing children, impacts on family and friends of murdered children, psychological impacts of never recovering a body, heaven, and growing up.<br /><br />Or, The Lovely Bones is simply a novel, a piece of fiction, not really a treatise on anything; a Patricia Cornwell novel from the victim's perspective.<br /><br />The book, by Alice Sebold, was well-written, engaging, and read more (to me) as a crime novel.  How was the bad guy going to be caught?  Vignettes of Mr. Harvey's \\"life\\" were scattered throughout the text.<br /><br />I know this book was, or is, popular on the book club circuit.  It isn't one I would have recommended for that purpose, but perhaps the \\"view from heaven\\" discussion made it \\"discussion-worthy.\\"
B000002J0B|5.0|Review no. 262. Originally released in 1973, this was Zeppelin's fifth record. Talk about your 'album rock' classic. As I've heard a few Zeppelin supposed die-hards put down 'Houses Of The Holy', this is no doubt one of their best works, at least I've always thought so. Every single one of the eight cuts here are considered to be sacred (if you'd call it that) to most Zep fans, late night radio listeners and old time hard rockers. From &#34;The Song Remains The Same&#34; to the melodic &#34;Rain Song&#34; to the beautifully written and played &#34;Over The Hills And Far Away&#34;. Also remember in my teens, partying until wee hours in the morning to &#34;No Quarter&#34; and &#34;The Ocean&#34;. Simply a must-have.
0440219078|5.0|Several friends and acquaintances of mine over the years have said that Louis Lowry's THE GIVER is their favorite book of all-time.  I finally got around to reading the book not too long ago and am only disappointed that it took me so long to finally getting around to reading it.  The book is very easy to read, but is underlined by a deep philosophical questioning.  The book could be described as a cross between Plato's \\"Parable of the Cave\\" and Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD written towards a young adult audience.<br /><br />THE GIVER takes place in an undefined, perhaps post-apocalyptic world, future.  In the community in which Jonas lives there is no crime, poverty, violence, or misery.  The community is well-ordered and disciplined.  Every family spends each night talking together about the events of the day and all that they thought and felt; think of family-time as being a confessional.  When a child enters into \\"maturity\\" they are given a pill that suppresses all sexual and aggressive urges they may have.  The community seems to be perfect and everyone seems completely happy.  Everyone is assigned a life occupation when they turn twelve.  Jonas is twelve and at the ceremony in which their occupation is assigned, Jonas' name is skipped.  It turns out that Jonas has been selected to be the next \\"receiver of memory\\".  He is trained by an Elder known as \\"The Giver\\".  Under the tutelage of The Giver, Jonas is allowed to see all that has been sacrificed and suppressed for the perfectly-ordered community in which he lives.  He experiences feelings, colors, and thoughts that he was never able to experience before.  He learns the cost of perfection and has to choose if he will become a contributor to it or if he will run.<br /><br />Even though there are no dull moments, THE GIVER begins rather slowly, but moves at a quick pace from the time of the ceremony on.  It deals with some very important issues including individuality, diversity, and euthanasia.  The book is classified as young adult literature, but the novel appeals to readers of all ages.  THE GIVER is a world where everything literally appears to be either black and white, but as Jonas discovers, the world is more than just black and white; it's full of brilliant colors.is classified as young adult literature, but the novel appeals to readers of all ages.

B00005KHEU|5.0|An amazing ELO album with three bonus tracks. Compared to the original cd issue of this album, the remaster sounds HEAPS better.  <br /> <br />I did a side-by-side comparison of the Discovery <br />- Vinyl <br />- Original cd release <br />- Remastered Version <br /> <br />To date, I've thought the vinyl sounds the best by far, but yesterday I got the remastered version and I think it's the best now. <br />1) The mix is louder <br />2) Everything sounds much clearer, I'm actually noticing things in the mix I hadn't noticed before.. <br /> <br />I was very disappointed with the original cd issues of the albums, particularly OOTB and Time. I was brought up on the vinyls!! So I'll definitely be getting the other reissues now. I'd recommend the same to any ELO fan, providing you can afford it! <br /> <br />It's an amazing album, a must for anyone who likes ELO!
B000024B0E|5.0|i was first introduced to spiritualized at a jesus and mary chain show in 1992.  the lights went down, all you could hear is organ and someone in the crowd jokingly asks,\\"what, are we in church?\\" <br />they've been one of my favorite bands ever since.  and when this album came out, well it has been one of my favorites ever since.  this album shows that music is still going somewhere.  listen to this cd in headphones over and over and you will find yourself amazed at the new things you hear with every listen.  it's been almost 10 years that i've played this cd over and over and i still hear new sounds in it's infinite layers.  there are only a few albums that i could listen to as much as i've listened to this one. <br />if you like great production, if you like soul, if you like gospel, if you like psychedelic, if you like rock and roll, if you like \\"pet sounds\\", if you like \\"seargent pepper's,\\" if you like phil spector, daniel lanois or brian eno, do yourself a favor and give this a shot.
B000005JA8|5.0|The first response to Trout Mask Replica was laughter. It wasn't that I found so terrible that it was funny - it was just that the end result was humorous in some way shape or form. <br /> <br />Somehow, I found myself having to dig into this album. I had to find the point of entry. Being raised on a good diet of 90s pop, this would be an album to challenge me, not an album whose payoff would be immediate. But boy, when I got it - I found a great release. <br /> <br />Musically - it has its roots in blues. Lyrically - it literally runs the gamut from surrealism to very popish to very political. And there is a sense of humor about it. However, it isn't a joke. <br /> <br />The sound of the album is very discordant and atonal. Sometimes it sounds as if there are two songs being played at the same times, other times, it sounds like a band without a sense of rhythm. Keep in mind, never does it sound like there was no talent. <br /> <br />The point is - in order to 'get' this album - you have to change your ideas about music and ultimately the way you hear music. As Charles Ives once said - \\"Take you dissonance like a man.\\" <br /> <br />The point I'll make to those of you who get this album is to listen to it more than once, and really work at it. It isn't supposed to go down easy. No, it's going to challenge you and require you to open up your ears. Sure, it ain't serialism, but it ain't pop music either. For many, the only song they'll get with any ease is Moonlight on Vermont. <br /> <br />It is very hard to really effectively review this album. It simply is one of those albums you need to have in your collection so that one day you might get it, and realise music is a lot wider than we may initially thought.
0618680004|5.0|In The God Delusion, Dawkins challenges religious belief with characteristic vigor and clarity.  What sets this book apart from his past writings on the subject is its comprehensiveness, as well as its sensitivity to the non-theoretical reasons people embrace religion.  For this reason, Dawkins' book has immense explanatory power, in addition to containing a slew of devastating arguments against the rationality of religious belief.  Dawkins emphasizes that those who respond to the challenges he presents by appealing to faith are essentially just admitting that they have run out of reasons and evidence.  And, as Christopher Hitchens recently quipped, what can be asserted without evidence can also be denied without evidence.  Fortunately, Dawkins presents overwhelming evidence for an alternative, naturalistic worldview.
0783233477|5.0|There is alot to say about this fine movie (my thanks to the director, Martin Brest for slowing things down ), but I'll focus on the big impact for me - Claire Forlani and her complete, breathtaking beauty. Claire Forlani in her evening gown at the end of the movie is one of the most powerful images of femininity I can recall - the way she looks, the way she moves, her control, lack of control, and the things she says, are all stunning to behold.<br /><br />But thats not where she's the most attractive.  Like several other reviewers, I first came across \\"Meet Joe Black\\" while I was changing channels on the TV.  When I saw Claire Forlani come into the coffee shop, in her ugly gray t-shirt, no hair styling, little makeup, I couldn't tear myself away.  This amazing vignette is for me, some of the most compelling footage I've ever seen.  Her every glance, movement, in/exhale seems to communicate emotions that build as the scene unfolds as she takes in and responds to this young man she's just met.  Lightning struck me too!  Wow.  (The only thing that seemed unnatural was when the two part company without either of them following up!)<br /><br />Watching Clair Forlani in this movie changed my image of beauty and femininity.  I hope she's given more opportunities to display her talent, poise, and stunning appearance.<br /><br />Whenever I hear Thomas Newman's magnificent score for this movie, I think of Ms. Forlani and her graceful beauty.
B000004286|5.0|James Horner has never written a more epic score than this--it eclipses even the gorgeous music he wrote for Legends of the Fall a few years earlier.  This score boasts breathtakingly beautiful music at times, and powerful and inspiring music at others.  There are a few tracks that evoke the tension of battle that, while not always pleasant on the ears, do a great job expressing the mood.  Horner wrote multiple themes for this one, each of which is wonderful.  He wrote two themes that can be heard simultaneously for one of the greatest musical moments in cinematic history (see track 17) but that stand alone well during the rest of the album.  \\"For Love of a Princess\\" is probably one of my top ten favorite tracks of music ever.  This album is an absolute staple of any good soundtrack collection, and would make an excellent place to start one if you haven't yet.  Fantastic stuff that only gets better with repeated listens.
0618680004|5.0|When it comes to my opinion of Dawkins, I think my title says it all. \\"The God Delusion\\" is a page turner, up-to-date, and loaded with devastating arguments. It's even funny at times. It's clear that many that have given the book poor reviews did not read it. Dawkins debunks the popular arguments for God. He writes about why atheism, science, and reason gives one a clearer and healthier outlook on life and the universe, and why God belief does not. What's wrong with agnosticism and religious moderation is also addressed. If you are to own one book on atheism, this is it.
B00005OWIU|3.0|Most peole rank this score higher than they should (in my opinion).  They give it 5 stars because John Williams wrote it (so it must be good, right?) or because it's part of the Harry Potter franchise, which is reason enough to declare that it is wonderful for some.  For me, this album was a huge let-down.  Yes, the theme is recognizable (does that mean it's great?), but not enough for me to say this score is anything but okay.  Track 2 IS wonderful, and some of the final tracks are excellent, but this score is plagued by wall-paper music throughout the rest of it--it's just there--it doesn't do anything for me.  If you want a great score for a children's film by Williams, go for ET or Hook, if you want a great score for a H.P. film, go for Prisoner of Azkaban, or Goblet of Fire.  This one did okay, but that's about it as far as I'm concerned.

B000000OEI|3.0|Zimmer's score for Crimson Tide is, in my opinion, one of the more overrated scores that has been written in the last 20 years.  This score is continually lauded by music lovers as powerful, inspiring, and exciting.  I would apply those adjectives to the theme of the film (heard in the first, fourth, and fifth tracks on the album) but to little else in the score.  The other problem here is that the tracks are so long that to hear the great theme, you'll need to listen to at least 10 minutes of music that is adequate at best, and downright boring at worst.  When I first got this score years ago I would have given it 5 stars, but I think I was being influenced by what everyone else was saying about it.  Now that I've had it a while and listened to it scores of times I have to say that other than the 2 minutes of brilliant theme heard 3 times in this score, there is little else for me to recommend in it.  The one possible exception is the hymn on the album heard twice--it's beautifully sung, though the lyrics are unintelligible.  That I would still give something three stars, though, even though I really only enjoy 6 minutes of the album, says something about what a great theme this one has.  Those familiar with Pirates of the Carribean will notice that one of its theme is a shameful replay of part of the theme from this film.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|\\"Tommy\\" is beyond question one of the big milestones of early rock. Musically the band were at the peak of their creativity.<br /><br />All band members were obviously extremely talented musicians and both Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend were/are great singers. Apart from few exceptions like \\"Cousin Kevin\\" all songs are outstanding; and it's really great to have the whole story on one CD - compared to the old double vinyl album.<br /><br />Though the storyline may seem a little weird today ( to me it always did ), there is so much great music on this album.<br /><br />The second bonus CD gives a very interesting insight in the developement of some of the songs. Though the sound quality is exellent CD 2 will mainly be of interest to hard-core Who fans. None of these alternate versions are better than the ones chosen for the album, though a few come close. The studio version of \\"Young Man Blues\\" which did not appear on the original album is a nice addition too!

By page 50 I felt this book was being written for a young person or teenage audience. I think his experiences with Apple Computer only made up about 1/3 of the book.<br /><br />In the last chapter I believe I was vindiated when he appeared to start speaking directly to the young people.<br /><br />I wanted a lot more detail and depth and I wanted to hear what this talented man had to say and I must say I was disappointed. Too much info about trivial things and not enough material for an adult readership interested in this man's experiences....especially before and during his founding of Apple Computer.

From the original Posidion Adventure, and the TV remake of the Posidion Adventure where a cruise ship was flipped by terrorists, I think most people knew what to expect from this movie.

Dave Brubeck is a very talented pianist, and along with Paul Desmond's incredible airy tone, self-described as a dry martini, Joe Morello's fluency in odd times signatures, shown on Take Five in 5/4 and Blue Rondo A La Turk in 9/8, and Eugene Wright on double bass. From start to finish this album is filled with classics. I highly recommend this album along with The Essential Dave Brubeck 2 disc set.
0385335997|1.0|Having enjoyed Gabaldon's first two books in the series, I had to review this book to say how disappointing and boring this one was.  <br /> <br />The story  sees Claire return to the 18th century after finding out that Jamie is  still alive and takes it from there. We meet all the characters in the  earlier books, Fergus, Jenny, Ian alongwith others - after all, it's  been 20 years. The plot moves along briskly in the 1960s, however once  Claire returns to the past, the story got majorly involved, convoluted and looong! Outlander and DIA were victims of the same kindof bloat, but atleast  they were entertaining. The way the plot moves forward in this  book, and the increasingly crazy situations the characters are put into  had me shaking my head in disbelief - you'd think Claire and Jamie would learn to be more circumspect with age!! Claire has barely been in the past  for a couple of hours, when she's having her bodice ripped by unsavoury  characters and the action continues with no respite (except for them taking time off every couple of pages to have sex *enough already* ). Claire even finds herself saddled with her own 'Typhoid Mary'. I did read on the author's website that she writes  different scenes in the book and then puts the book together and it seems  pretty evident in this one - the dangerous situations faced by the  characters never let up. Additionally, there are so many unnecessary and unexplained  scenes in the book - the one where Jamie suddenly emerges as the  captain of some French troops, etc - and these really bothered me. But to be fair, maybe they were explained, at this point of time I was so bored that I was skipping  through pages just wanting it to get over. And for a story that covers  2 different periods in time, 3 continents, it's such a stretch to find  that Claire and Jamie keep running into EVERY single character time and again. I know they say, it's a small world - but this small is really stretching it.  <br /> <br />Anyway, I think I'm going to read the next one on the series, just because I  already have it waiting for me in the library, but if that doesnt  improve much more then that's it for the Outlander series for me.
B000002IJO|4.0|My 2nd Fav. RATT CD! Right behind the obvious \\"out of..\\". Great riffs here and a thick groove adds to most tracks. Great sounding as well. Best songs are \\"Looking for Love\\", \\"Slip of the Lip\\" and \\"Drive me Crazy\\". But there is little fluff material on this cd. Must have Ratt.
B000FC2FVA|5.0|I was blown away by these guys in concert.  They carried their earlier, more poppy stuff well, but their new stuff really rocked!  THis album is full of great tunes that allude a bit to the early 80s punk movement, but also throw a couple unique styles out there.  The use of repetition is the most blatant thing on the album that I haven't heard anywhere else.  It kinda throws you off at first, but then, you learn to love it- great stuff!
B00003CXPD|5.0|1984 in the UK: it was the worst of times.  Young British boy Billy Elliott had just lost his Mum.  His Dad and older brother were on strike with the other miners.  Whether they knew it or not, a lifestyle was ending.   <br /> <br />But, something caught a spark in Billy--not at the boxing lessons his father gave him 50 pence to attend, but from watching the ballet class of girls just outside the boxing ring.   <br /> <br />He joined that class in secret and that spark caught fire.  Despite his father's opposition, he trained til he managed to convince his father he needed a chance at a better life.   <br /> <br />While this film is very serious in nature, there's a lightness and a hope even in the worst of it.  This is a very enjoyable watch and one I believe would be good to see again and again.
B00005JLWN|2.0|there was a reason this film never made it to the theatres. now, i know why.  <br />it's not a terrible film, but it just doesn't work. the action scenes aren't particularly believable, even with suspension of disbelief, they just don't ring true ... and that false note carries on through the rest of the movie, as well. everything seems forced. the plot just doesn't have a good flow. it's like a building constructed by a little kid with high-tech building blocks; nice material, but it doesn't hold together well.
0440234743|5.0|With every Grisham book I read, I get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense, but to insert other elements to make this human as well. <br /> <br />For once, we have a character that is not consumed by financial gain.  However, this person has been left most of an eleven billion dollar fortune.  However, she does not know this.  A lawyer is sent to find her, and in the process, undergoes a fundamental change of his own. <br /> <br />This story takes place in Washington, Maryland, West Virginia, and the rain forests along the Brazilian-Bolivian border.  In typical Grisham fashion, he inserts considerable detail in all of the venues of this book, enabling the reader to create a mental picture everywhere this story goes.  You can picture the six heirs that are clawing to get their share of the millions.  You can picture the judge itching to have a high profile fight.  You can envision the rainforest, and you can picture in your mind the massive changes occurring in the life of Nate O'Riley. <br /> <br />This is yet another Grisham work that will simply stick to your fingers like glue.  The pages literally turn themselves.  Do not start this novel before going to bed, or you may have a sleepless night simply for the fact you simply will not be able to put this one down. <br />
B000GRUS22|4.0|As a big fan of Enigma right from the very beginning, I felt a little let down with Michael Cretu's last effort as Enigma, \\"Voyageur\\" from 2003. It had none of the qualities that I had found from listening to the other 4 albums. I'd often been asked by people in the past what it actually was I liked about Enigma so much: The answer? It was different. Back in 1990, \\"Sadeness Part 1\\" came out and I loved it. Still do. Over the years album after album came out and I loved it still. Again, It was different. Like many fans, I lost a bit of faith when \\"Voyageur\\" came out, but some of it grew on me although it is not my favourite (that honour goes to \\"Enigma 2: The Cross Of Changes\\").    I am pleased to say that \\"A Posteriori\\" is much better and almost a return to form. Out goes the dodgy singing and Britney-type beats and back in come the terrific soundscapes and floaty atmospherics. It's not an easy listen at first (it would have done really well during the Trance boom circa 1999-2002 particularly here in Ye Olde England), but trust me, stick with it and you will appreciate it. I have to say that although the best way to describe the sound is chill-out trance, Michael Cretu does add a certain something that maybe had been missing from a thousand chill out trance records from 3 years or so back.     In short, it's still very Enigma and similar to \\"Enigma 3: Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\" in mood.    Favourites? \\"The Alchemist\\" is a storming number and, for fans of the old style, \\"Invisible Love\\" is sure to please. Also, this version of \\"Hello and Welcome\\" is much better that the single mix. The singing is also kept to the minimum overall (not always a big hit with me, however that's just my opinion of course). \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" is nice but a bit too Eurovision-a-like for me.    In short, \\"A Posteriori\\" made me feel something \\"Voyageur\\" didn't achieve, in that it's made me really look forward to the next one : - )
1591396190|5.0|I admit I was skeptical of the promises this book made.  The book went beyond my expectations.  It gives a structured framework for culling newness out of tired competition. <br />I think the reviews that say 'doesn't work' come from people using tired old strategies. <br />If you need a method for structure to a remake your firm, to give people some sense of coherence while their business world reels in radical change, this book will provide it. <br />Good, solid discussions.  Pair with Clayton Christenson's books for a 1-2 punch.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is a wonderful CD to take you away from the cares of your day, and bring a sense of joy and peace.  It's not pure Celtic folk music, but it's lovely music and most enjoyable.
B000002UAU|4.0|There are many different incarnations of Beatles.......even though the players always remained the same after 1962, the year they started recording.   There's the 1962 - 1964 Beatles, who made great catchy rock 'n' roll music AND great catchy pop music.  There's the 1965 - 1966 Beatles, who made \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" sophisticated pop/rock, which is my personal favorite period.  The later Beatles of 1968 - 1969 (\\"White Album\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\") were also great, because they were attempting to return to their roots, but were beginning to realize they were drifting apart as a band.....but still made great Lennon music, great McCartney music, and now great Harrison music.   The 1967 Beatles are a category all their own.  It was an experiment that went too far......and yet invented a new category of music,  progressive rock.  Bands like Pink Floyd, the Move, King Crimson, Moody Blues,  Yes, Emerson Lake & Palmer all were HEAVILY INFLUENCED by the 1967 Beatles.  The 1967 Beatles was LSD Beatles who had the luxury of not having to play live anymore....so they could experiment in the studio with no deadlines, and no reason to worry about reproducing their sound on stage.  Sgt. Pepper was such a groundbreaker at the time because headphones were becoming a popular way to listen to albums, and albums were now becoming stereo, and the Beatles were starting to mix over-produced sounds with their music that sounded great in stereo while listening to it on headphones......especially when you were high.  But this CD just doesn't hold up in 2006 as well as it did when it came out.....a lot of people today don't get what all the fuss is about.  I think Magical Mystery Tour, released just 6 months after this, is as good as Sgt. Pepper.  And I think anybody who wants to listen to 1967 Beatles music (which was the real beginning of progressive rock, as I've mentioned) need to buy BOTH Sgt. Pepper AND Magical Mystery Tour......and burn their own CD, leaving off the weaker tracks.Because the stronger tracks on both CDS still sound great to these ears.  Here's how'd I mix it: <br /> <br />GETTING BETTER <br />WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS <br />LUCY IN SKY WITH DIAMONDS <br />FIXING A HOLE <br />WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU <br />GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING  (use version off Anthology CD) <br />LOVELY RITA <br />I AM THE WALRUS <br /> <br />STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER <br />FOOL ON THE HILL <br />FLYING <br />BABY YOU'RE A RICH MAN <br />ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE <br />PENNY LANE <br />A DAY IN THE LIFE <br /> <br />This is the self-made CD I've been listening to for quite awhile.  Takes the best of both Pepper and Mystery tour......and it flows from song to song quite nicely.  Try it, you'll appreciate the experimental acid 1967 Beatles much more. <br />
B000H305U0|5.0|I grew up on Bobby Brown, BBD, and Guy.  If you enjoyed them, you'll enjoy this.  The beats alone would make this album go gold.  I haven't even gotten past track #6 yet.  #1 is as funky as My Prerogative.  Plus J Tim brings solid vocals.  No one can credibly say this album is not at least a low 4, especially compared to what else is out right now.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Christopher Nolan is a genius along with all of his other movies.  This movie is very unique and will never get old.
B000784WMW|5.0|Perhaps I am the only person alive who saw this movie before they read the book.  But, that put me in the unique position of being able to critique it on the basis of the performances of the actors.  Having not read the book, when I first viewed it, I thought it odd when Rochester asked Jane if she thought him attractive and she answered with an emphatic \\"No\\".   The guy is gorgeous, but I figured she just had different taste than me.  Naturally, I realized Rochester was supposed to be unattractive after I read the book. However, to me, this is a minor point in comparison to the actors ability to convince me they are plain Jane and tortured Rochester. <br /> <br />I bought the movie because I remember vaguely hearing that \\"Jane Eyre\\" was a good story.  One day I was strolling through the movie section and saw the cover and bought the movie on a whim.  I sat through the whole thing one stormy Saturday afternoon and fell in love with the story.  Poor little Jane immediately got my sympathy as the unloved orphan and kept it ever after.   Although the ghost story was totally unexpected, and probably wouldn't work in a story of its kind today, it was totally appropriate here.   <br /> <br />Now that I have actually read the book, and seen several other movie versions of the story, I still love this version the best.  I like all the others as well, simply because they are \\"Jane Eyre\\", but this is my favorite. <br /> <br />
B000G8NXYG|5.0|This short review is on the 2006 edition and not the 1998 edition issue by Criterion. The 2006 edition issued by Criterion proves to be a highly improved version of the Seven Samurai. The first thing you will discovered when watching this edition over the 1998 edition will be the image, vastly improved and enchanced. While its not perfect like what you might see with very recent films, this 2006 issue will probably be close as you can get with the Seven Samurai.<br /><br />After all these previous reviews, I am not going into the plots and additional praises. A person who buy this DVD knows the quality of the work. I won't be redundent with the usual mantra.<br /><br />While the 1998 edition only had a screen commentary which proves to be interested and its still with us in the 2006 edtion, the new edition also got more supplements that should please any fan of the film. The two hour \\"My Life in the Cinema\\" should proves most educational to any Kurosawa fan and 50 minute \\"Making\\" of the Seven Samurai gives a great insight into how the film developed into the masterpiece that it is. Another great supplement titled: \\"Seven Samurai: Impact and Influences\\" reflects on the influences this movie had on other directors in other countries as well as what influenced Kurosawa himself while making this film. Once more, this supplement help the buyer gained more insight and understanding of the film and its filmmaker. To those who like film commentary, there also an additional one by various American film scholars.<br /><br />Finally the DVD come with a booklet that contained various short essays written by American film experts on this film. Toshiro Mifune's essay was included as well that reflect his insight on the film.<br /><br />While a great set all together in three DVD disks, I only wish Criterion packaged it into a sturdier plastic container as the 1998 verison instead the cardboard container which looked bit on the weak side.<br /><br />Overall this is a very expensive DVD to buy but in all reality, if you are a fan of the Seven Samurai, buying this DVD should be a no-brainer. The improved soundtrack, improved images and the great supplements make this almost mandatory buy for any real fan of the movie.y expensive DVD to buy but in all reality, if you are a fan of the Seven Samurai, buying this DVD should be a no-brainer.

B000001DQI|3.0|I am a big Elton John fan, but honestly, this album is not that good.  If Elton had wisely chosen to make this a single album, it would have worked, because he's got an album's worth of good material.  Instead, he made it a double and included an album's worth of bad material.  Rather than do a song by song breakdown, I'll just put each song in the \\"good\\" category, and the \\"not-so-good\\" category.   <br /> <br />Good-Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Candle in the Wind, Bennie and the Jets, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, This Song Has No Title, Grey Seal, Sweet Painted Lady, Roy Rogers, Harmony <br /> <br />Not-So-Good- Jamaica Jerk Off, I've Seen that Movie Too, The Ballad of Danny Bailey, Dirty Little Girl, All the Girls Love Alice, Your Sister Can't Twist, Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting, Social Disease <br /> <br />This is just my opinion.  A lot of people really like this album.  I would say that you should buy \\"Madman Across the Water\\" instead.  Or \\"Captain Fantastic.\\"
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I never write reviews but I'm SO impressed by this album that I just had to share it.  It's so chill and refreshing.  I haven't stopped listening to it for 3 days straight!  I wasn't a huge John Mayer fan but I heard the CD was good so I bought it.  I'm sold!  It reminds me a lot of the songs I grew up with (I'm 28).  I'm thinking this CD will be a classic.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Star Wars Episode I, The Phantom Menace, easily qualifies as one of the best science fiction movies of recent years.  While I would give each movie in the original trilogy 5 stars, I could only give this one 4 stars because of its \\"moments\\" of bad acting and weak story line.  Imagine how great this movie would have been if it had been combined with Episode 2, saving only the best from each, and trimming away the dull parts.  Ideally we would have seen Anakin quickly growing up in one movie, being trained in the ways of the Jedi.  Instead we got stuck with a little kid throughout the whole movie, and worse - Jar Jar Binks.  Overall, though, I'm just glad that the Star Wars movies returned to the big screen. <br />Reviewed by: Adam Platts, Northridge
0375830995|4.0|Unlike a lot of other reviewers I haven't read \\"the thief.\\"  In fact, this isn't my type of book generally speaking.  That said, it's a very good inspirational book, dealing with the one great question we all have at some time or another--Why was I born?  What am I to do with my entire life???<br /><br />Kusak handles the topic with humor and with characters that are so real--they are either your neighbor or the guy in your high school class.  Yes, the first challenges of the main character are more daring, dangerous and interesting than some of the later examples.  But the character is learning and growing as he goes. If the second and third sets of tasks were as dangerous as the first, the character would probably have been killed halfway through the book.<br /><br />I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending tried a little too hard.  Generally speaking there is nothing really wrong with the ending, but I think as readers we got the point of what was happening halfway through the book--I didn't feel I needed to be hit over the head with it, nor did I need answers about who set the main character up to do the tasks.  And if there had to be an answer, it needed to something that made more sense.<br /><br />:>) All said, the book is worth a read.  The message is a good one. The pages contain some delightful humor, wonderful human spirit and an interesting plot.
0743298020|2.0|I don't usually run out and immediately purchase a recently released book, but made an exception for this book based on reviews I read on Amazon. I was so totally disappointed with not only the story but the author's excruciatingly derivative narrative. Her obsession with Bronte, Collins and Austen only made me realize that she is merely a \\"wannabe\\" who has little of the talent or imagination of those literary giants.
B000FZERIG|4.0|When George Harrison released \\"Living In The Material World\\", he was still on the huge commercial/critical roll he had begun with \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"The Concert For Bangladesh\\", a roll that left former bandmates Lennon and McCartney a bit jealous (Lennon had yet to reach such commercial heights, and McCartney was being scathed by the critics).  \\"Material World\\" continued the commercial thumbs up, being another #1 multi-million seller that contained another smash #1 hit single in the gloriously easy-listening mantra \\"Give Me Love\\".  Critically, however, it received a mixed reception, with \\"Rolling Stone\\" giving it a highly supportive review while (as stated in the expanded liner notes here) others at New Musical Express complained it was just *too preachy*. <br /> <br />What is sure about \\"Material World\\" is that George was in expert vocal and production form on this album.  Using the same key players as on \\"All Things Must Pass\\" minus the Phil Spector \\"wall of sound\\" in most--but not all--instances (the heavenly orchestra and choirs re-appear not just on \\"Try Some Buy Some\\" but also \\"Who Can See It\\", \\"The Day The World Gets 'Round\\" and \\"That Is All\\", which makes the original side two the last gasp of the whole Spector Wall Of Sound idea in Harrison's career), <br />the arrangements took months to piece together and the overall sound here is superior to \\"All Things Must Pass\\", which makes this remaster all the more welcome.  The tape hiss which seemed to plague the earlier CD and cassette releases has been removed, thank you, and you can't ask for much more.  The liner notes feature some nice photo outtakes, and all lyrics and original artwork has been reproduced as well. <br /> <br />Highlights include \\"Give Me Love\\" (of course), \\"Sue Me Sue You Blues\\" (brilliantly dark comedy set to some scorching slide licks), the would-be hit \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\", the title track which is the most rocking and also includes the ethereal \\"spiritual sky\\" portions, the meditative \\"Be Here Now\\" (my favorite Harrison solo song) and the very ATMP-ish \\"The Day The World Gets 'Round\\".  Songs like \\"The Light That Has Lighted The World\\", \\"Who Can See It\\", \\"The Lord Loves The One\\" (a good rocker that could have been GREAT if the tempo was doubled) and \\"That Is All\\" tip the album to over-preachiness a bit, but at least no-one could doubt the sincerity of George's beliefs, or the overall ambitious thematic arch of the album.  The remaster now includes two fine b-sides, \\"Deep Blue\\" and \\"Miss O'Dell\\"; the charmingly lighthearted \\"Miss O'Dell\\" should most certainly have been on the original album,  <br />as it may have given it a bit more of a humorous balance. Now it has been restored to its rightful place, and one can program it in whatever appropriate spot to perfect what was perhaps George's final shot at greatness.  Although not quite the equal to its two mighty predecessors, \\"Material World\\" contains too many gems to be discounted and as the liners say, this remaster is long, long overdue.  <br /> <br />
B0000AUHPK|5.0|This version is, of all the filmed productions, the very best one of this classic story. It goes way beyond chapter 17 in Emily Bronte's novel (Catherine's death), and follows the tragic but hopeful relationship which develops between Catherine's daughter Cathy and Hareton, Heathclife's only natural son. They almost become a tragic replay of their parent's live's, but fortunatly love alters their course in the end.
0743298020|5.0|I may be presumptious here.  I have only, so far read half way of THE THIRTEENTH TALE by Diane Setterfield.   Yet I had to write this review.  It is one of the best books I have read for a long, long, long  time.  One of the books I will come back to, and re-read over again.  It is for those readers who like nothing better than to immerse themselves in a story, to find themselves taken by the words of the author into another world.  It is a story about an aged author, Vida Winters, her younger biographist, Margaret Lea.  Both have one thing in common, their love and associtation with books.  And maybe, with a secret they both share.  <br /> <br />Vida Winter is the author of over sixty novels.  Her first book, a collection of short stories, is entitled, THE THIRTEENTH TALE.  Yet, in this first edition, there was only twelve stories ever published.  So what happened then, to the thirteenth?  Down the years, Vida has been asked this constantly.  To each she has given a different answer.  She has invented a story.  Because she is a born story teller.  Has never revealed the truth of THE THIRTEENTH TALE.  Until she learns of a young biograhpist named, Margaret Lea, who is summoned to the shadowy house of Vida Winters, on her request to at last reveal the truth.   <br /> <br />The style of writing is always fluent.  In no way does it try and copy that of some of the so called, classical novelists.  Yet, in a way, it creates an atmoshpere that can be compared with such novels, as Jane Eyre, The Turn of the Screw.  The old mansion to which Margaret is summoned, is itself dark and shadowy.  Draped in it's own secret.  And perhaps it's own ghost?  Yet when Vida begins to tell her own life story, to Margaret, her words and images of those characters she has once known  and is again, bringing once more to life, transports the reader away from the flickering lamps of that old house.  And into the lives of those self same characters.  It is like a house of stories. Each contained under the roof of that old house.  Yet each room holding a different tale, all of it's own.  But, are any of them, really THE THIRTEENTH TALE?  Or is Margaret herself that ,unknowingly, is linked with this tale?
0393307050|4.0|Patrick O'Brian is not for everyone.  In fact, I tried to read this book many years ago and gave up.  I went back to it after seeing the movie.  I was frustrated again because O'Brian does not make it easy for the reader.  He makes only occasional efforts to explain technical jargon and historical context.  The dialog, true to the early 19th century Royal Navy, is often curious and can be difficult to follow.  In general his prose demands a high level of concentration.     I persevered despite these difficulties and finished all 20 books.  It went much better after I stopped trying to read over passages I did not understand and simply kept going.  After a while, things began sinking in and my admiration grew for his characterizations, historical fidelity, humor and inventiveness.  Jack Aubrey, a good natured Royal Navy captain, brilliant at sea and hapless on land.  Stephen Maturin, a surgeon with a complicated, sometimes tortured personality, very much the naturalist and cunning intelligence agent.  These very different men, with only the love of music in common, enter into a deep, lifelong friendship.      Not long after finishing the novels, I read Dean King's A Sea of Words, a lexicon and companion to the novels.  It gives a brief historical sketch of the Napoleonic wars, the Royal Navy, and the state of medical knowledge at the time.  It provides definitions of many obscure words used in the novels.  All of that made it clear that, however much I enjoyed the novels, I missed a great deal of O'Brian's nuance and subtlety.    So, I reread them all.  Only then did I really appreciate his very high level of literary artistry.  The adventure, which pulled me along on the first read, became secondary to the philosophical themes, the Aubry/Maturin interactions, the sparkling dialog, and the detail in describing the workings of the ship, naval discipline and life in early 19th century England.    Some advice to those who want to tackle these novels --  If you don't have any background in early 19th century Europe, you should at least read the first 50 pages of A Sea of Words and keep it handy when you want to look up a word.  You also need a good world atlas (the older the better as many place names have changed over the decades).  Finally, read the novels in consecutive order.  I hesitate to say that because the first two, Master and Commander and Post Captain, are among the most difficult.  There are some slow spots and as I say O'Brian for the first time can be discouraging.  But they set up everything that comes after and in comparison make the later novels, when O'Brian really gets in the groove, much easier to read, comprehend and revel in.     Master and Commander begins in 1800 Port Mahon, Minorca (an island off the east coast of Spain) with a rather testy first meeting between our heros, Aubrey, a Royal Navy lieutenant, and Maturin, an Irish/Catalan physician and amateur naturalist.  Both of them poor without a ship.    Jack is promoted to master and commander (a grade below captain) and gets command of a small sloop of war (brig) named the Sophie, joined by Stephen as the ship's surgeon.  The Sophie cruises the coasts of Spain and France for enemy merchant shipping.  After capturing many \\"prizes,\\" the Sophie eventually battles the much more powerful Cacafuego, a 32-gun Spanish xebec-frigate.  Aubrey's leadership skills are very much on display, along with Maturin's medical prowess (especially for the times) and philosophical bent.      We learn much about the Royal Navy.  Rank, promotion, corruption, discipline, punishment, \\"interest,\\" prize money, ships, guns, ship maintenance and routine, disease, tides, storms, wind, sails, battle strategy, etc.  Fascinating stuff for me.    I originally gave this four stars because I intended to review each book and this was not among the best of the twenty.  I now don't see any reason to review each book, they are all four or five stars.  So reviewing it as a series I should have given it five stars, but I can't edit that.
0679720200|5.0|this is the first piece of writing i have read from albert camus and i found it very interesting. the character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to be very impartial when he hears of his mother's death and kind of continues to be static untill the the second half of the book. i do not want to give the book away as some of the others have, but i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what ones perception is, it can never match the perception of others. one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god because according th chaplain \\"it is not the human justice that matters but divine justice\\" and meursault's response was \\"it was the human justice that put me here\\". no matter what acts you commit, whether they be henous, incensitive or loving, one way or another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your sentence. it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he can not change; his fate. \\"with this, i dont even have a chance to survive, not even a slim one\\".
1400031567|4.0|It's my wife who is the reader of mysteries in the family. And she highly recommended Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander mysteries to me, and Side-Tracked in particular. This was a pleasant diversion and Mr. Mankell is an excellent writer and his detective Kurt Wallander is an interesting lead character. The book opens with a great start, a wandering middle and strong yet predictable ending. After all the reader learns half way though the book who done it and waits while Wallander and his Swedish detectives figure it out. One of the charms of the book is its Swedish local and yet that part of this particular book is not fully realized. This could just as well have been Kansas. So my read is a recommendation as the book is entertaining, well written, and if you're in the mood for a mystery I think you will enjoy your time with Mr. Wallander. But don't skip those other great Non-fiction books out there unless your looking for pure diversion. Yet, I will look forward to sampling another Wallander Mystery sometime soon.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Anytime a story is about time travel the audience must accept the fact that suspension of belief is mandatory.  Based on a Korean film 'Siworae' by Eun-Jeong Kim and Ji-na Yeo and adapted for the latest version by David Auburn, Alejandro Agresti has his work cut out for him.  The story is Swiss cheese full of holes as anyone would expect from a tale about two people who fall in love from the disparate vantages of 2004 and 2006 and as long as the viewer accepts the inherent incongruities of such a story the overall effect is really quite lovely, if a bit too uninvolving.<br /><br />Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) has a history of living in a glass lake house outside Chicago but when we meet her she lives in a luxury apartment while she is on staff at a small hospital.  Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) currently lives in the lake house (we discover that his father played by Christopher Plummer is an architect who built the house years ago) and begins to find mail in his mailbox from the previous tenant Kate.  The story weaves back and forth between 2004 and 2006 and keeping score is rather tricky at times, but eventually of course the two time-lapsed people meet, the riddles are unexplained, they fall in love over the distance of time, etc.  There is not a lot of message here except that real love can occur despite almost any obstacle.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock are fine, but the rest of the characters are sketchy and only tangentially relevant to the story.  A family discourse among Reeves, Plummer, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Henry, the other brother) never gels.  The supporting cast includes interesting actors such as Shohreh Aghdashloo but they have little to do.  In fact the scenery and the house seem to be the main characters and that really is OK because both are beautiful, thanks to Alar Kivilo's cinematography, and Rachel Portman's musical score is very fine.  It is not a deep film and it could benefit from a really good re-write of the script, but for an evening's diversion it is pretty to look at and tender in content.  Just forget about the holes and you'll be fine.  Grady Harp, September 06ng's diversion it is pretty to look at and tender in content.  Just forget about the holes and you'll be fine.

B000F0UUT6|4.0|I've only had the VHS version up to now. I waited to purchased this DVD version since earlier reviews stated that the early DVD version had washed out colors. I've viewed the 2 DVD's so far (not the extra bonus DVD yet). The colors in the feature movie are indeed washed out, but not too badly. I adjusted my television settings (LCD) to increase the contrast and warm up the colors. It displayed much nicer with that adjustment. You will probably have to put those settings back when you watch other DVD's. The sound and picture quality are otherwise fine. The book is very good also. I'd highly recommend this even though the film could have been translated better to DVD.

This ablum is great listen when you are just chillin' at home and want something smooth to listen to. I think old Mr. Cretu thought this album through fairly well. Definately worth taking a listen to. Cheers.

B000GGSMB2|5.0|Just saw a quick preview of this disc at the beginning of another DVD that detailed what this, what, 4th release of this movie, is all about.  Apparently, the picture has been totally remastered, and also the sound effects.  The sound effects have been either remixed or replaced with modern sound effects.  Meaning that all those vintage (or cheesey, depending on your POV) sounds of gun-fire and what-not have either been remixed or replaced by modern sound effects to give this Platinum Edition a much more realistic feel.<br /><br />I've got the Anniversary Edition, and was quite pleased with it, but I may have to double-dip on this one to check out the up-dated version.
0451527046|5.0|I had to read this book when I was in 7th grade and I really didn't care for it  and after I read through it I forgot all about it. Luckily I accidentally kept it and didn't return it because years later I came across it and I decided to give it another chance. I'm glad I did because it's a good adventure book that will keep you interested the whole time. This book has everything from buried treasure, pirates, fighting, sailing on the open seas and  drinking rum. This is a book for both children and adults looking for adventure and a way to escape their everyday life.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Eli Roth had directed the OK movie CABIN FEVER in 2002. Now, he's back with a total crap fest called HOSTEL, which is 95 minutes of my life I'll NEVER get back!<br /><br />STORY: 3 teenagers on a European trip get locked outside the hostel they are staying in. They go to their friends as a source of help and are told about a Slovakian hostel with total chicks. They take a trip to Slovakia and stay at the hostel, with total chicks for roomates. But that's not all, one by one each teenager dissapears, and it'a all up to Paxton to find out...then Paxton is next.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: What a waste of film! I kept wanting to turn the movie off. It has no gore, and if you want gore, watch SAW, SAW 2 or DEAD ALIVE. That's what I call gore.
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|Ok first I have to say that anyone that has seen them live will gain a larger appreciation for them because their lead singer runs around like he's on crack and can hit the notes just like the cds.  So my review is biased based on the fact that ive seen them.  So, I like the album, but as a sorta soundtrack to the drunken adventures I have on the weekends.  Deffinitly a stress reliever.  Im a huge fan of \\"serious\\" music, but not all the time, this is a great album for this use because it doesnt sound like the other usual crap that tends to come out as of lately.  All the recent dance music seems to be either techno or some sort of rap or r&b, this deff is a good alternative to that.  So that being said it isnt like the first one in that it can be listened to in any mood.  Im a huge fan and would have thought lesser of them if I hadn't bought the special additon.  Thats where the but comes in, the song transitor is just cool, it shows a different side that hopefully will come out on the third album.  If the songs in the bonous cd were actually the songs of the main cd and they threw in a couple of the main songs then this album would have been amazing.

1577314808|5.0|Francesco Petrarch wrote, \\"It is appointed to us to lose the present in expectation of the future,\\" or--he might have added--in fretting over the past. Though Eckhart Tolle's message isn't new--it's at least as ancient as the Hindu and Hebrew scriptures--his presentation speaks directly to the modern mind. We are so bombarded by memories, momentary incoming messages, and fears of the future that we lose the only part of life that truly exists: the present moment. His subtitle says it all: \\"A guide to spiritual enlightenment.\\" You will feel better immediately when you follow his lead into the now.
0743454537|4.0|For anyone else, this is a rhetorical question. For Anna, the answer is clearcut. She's here because her sister needed a donor. <br /> <br />Everything in Anna's family revolves around her sister Kate's leukemia. No matter how much each person tries to deal with things in their own unique ways, the sheer fact of Kate's leukemia means they're always spinning around that tornado of which she is the center. When Anna decides she's had enough, and wants to leave the storm, the tornado only threatens to grow bigger. <br /> <br />I enjoyed Jodi Piccault's method of letting us see how each character thinks, letting us see both the honorable and not-so-honorable elements in their behavior. The mother, at times, seems so totally uncaring of Anna's needs, yet she comes across as believable, despite her flaws. Indeed, all the characters come across as believable, including the brother who sets fires in a desparate bid to be rescued. <br /> <br />As with some other readers, I was shocked and disturbed by the ending, but these kind of things DO happen. In fact, I mostly wanted more, I wanted to know more about how the family dealt with it. We learn the long-range ending, I wished I could have read more about the short-term process. But I guess that's the sign of a good story, that we're a bit bereft when it's over. <br /> <br />As for the love story, while it's true that it wasn't an essential element of the story, I enjoyed that part of the novel. There are patterns in life that may not seem to overlap but they often set things in motion that might not otherwise have been.
0060254920|5.0|This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up. Now that I am a mother, I am thrilled to be able to share this very same story with my own daughter and watch her eyes light up with excitement every time we read it together. My daughter absolutely loves all the colorful, interesting illustrations throughout the book that accompany the equally colorful story. The little imp Max appeals to her \\"devilish\\" side, and she laughs with glee as max dons his wolf suit and chases after the dog or as he swings from the vines and marches under the moonlight with the \\"wild things\\". This is a book that she really enjoys taking an active part in. How cute it is when she pretends to be one of the wild things...roaring her own little roar and showing her \\"terrible claws\\" right along with the story. It is such a wonderful message, too. Max takes an imaginary trip to \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" after being sent to bed without his supper, but even though he becomes King of All Wild Things, he learns that there's nothing more comforting in life than being where he is loved no matter what. And when he \\"returns\\" to his room and finds his supper waiting for him, he knows he is truly loved. Such a beautiful story related in a way that both children and adults can relate to.

055358202X|3.0|I really enjoyed the first three books of this series. Together they are the very best fantasy books I have ever come across. Like many other reviewers here, I am upset with Martin by his decision to spend a thousand dense pages on characters two or three times removed from those we were introduced to in the first book.<br /><br />I guess that a few of the plot lines were a little like life itself, it plods on and then ends suddenly without a point. Martin spends a good two hundred pages on one character in particular, making her travel this way and that, only to kill her off in the end (unless she receives the kiss of life). I cant really see the point of her being introduced to this series in the first place as her story adds nothing at all to the whole.<br /><br />The queen who also takes up long chapter after long chapter, really does very little. I could summarise three hundred pages of this book, her story, in a couple of sentences. Only one Stark is featured in this book, and that is probably the least engaging of the bunch.<br /><br />Really, if I didn't already have a lot of time and emotion tied into these characters and this story, this book would be nothing more than a wasteland of intrigue. By this I mean that Martin spends page after page building up hugely complicated back-stories or tracks back stabbing plots of the lords in his story in such infinite detail that this novel is nothing more than a dried up husk of a story. Their is nothing in this book that you need to know before heading into the upcoming book five of the series except for one or two small details that I am sure Martin will go over again in the next installment.<br /><br />It might be worth skipping this one altogether.
0784010501|5.0|I'm not lucky enough to own this product, but I just did a search on it to compare its contents with those of the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret, which I do own, and realized that the DVD is currently only being sold by external users and sellers, and not by Amazon itself. <br /> <br />So I'd like to know, cuz this has got me thinking that maybe we'll see a re-release soon? I'm really hoping for a new DVD, with remastered sound and video. It would be so great it they would release it this year, to go along with the more recent documentary.
0451204530|3.0|This book starts off with a character who does not know who he is. This guy is wandering around dressed as a bum, smelling of alcohol, and lacks any memory of his past. One strange thing is that he is being followed by people he keeps seeing over and over again. Are they his imaginings? Or is someone keeping tabs on him?<br /><br />This is how Follett's Code to Zero starts out. And the first hundred or so pages are engaging beyond most of Folletts other work. As the plot starts to come together however, the story starts to become mundane and processed. The plot is set around the earliest stages of the US space program, just after Sputnik one and two were put into space. The protagonist is a lead scientist on the US program who is being taken out of the picture for some reason that he cant understand.<br /><br />Follett has a lot of gifts as an author. rarely does his work hold together as a near masterpiece like his earier Pillars on the Earth. Code to Zero is not great, but it is one of the better Follett books that I have read. I think that if you enjoy his other writings this one will satisfy you greatly.
B0007ORU66|1.0|Sorry, folks.  I know you all mean well, but the reviewers who indicated this is a \\"bootleg\\" are correct.  The LP was issued originally as \\"The Beatles Again,\\" placing several tracks on 12\\" that had only been singles up to that time.  It was later titled \\"Hey Jude.\\"  It is a great compilation.  All of the tracks on \\"Hey Jude\\" are available on CD in stereo (in fact, I believe all of them are available on CD in mono, too, because of the Beatles singles box set).  This \\"Hey Jude\\" has yet to be issued on CD...and will (most likely) be part of the last Capitol stereo box set issues (with \\"Yesterday...and Today\\" - \\"Hollywood Bowl\\" - and more to come?).  Amazon is awesome, and truly a great place to find cool material, but THIS is a hoax.  Did you see the record label?  It sure wasn't EMI, Apple or Capitol.
B000001FTJ|5.0|I guess Waits fans have to be diverse and maybe a tad strange, or, they wouldn't be Tom Waits fans. However, I look at some of these lukewarm reviews and I just scratch my head.

Oh well, to each their own, but I think this is a nice starter album for Tom Waits novices.

The 2nd one was bad enough, but to add a 3rd act with none of the original cast, an extremely boring and subdued lead who was obviously chosen for eye candy, and cars we've all seen before is, well, lame!!! The first one was so much fun, original, funny, good racing and great action, even the acting was, well, decent. But this is just a mess, the only thing that saves if from the depths of a D or F is the wonderfull Tokyo scenery, man what a gorgeous place, Maybe if the director had focused more on Tokyo instead of those dumb cars and cast we might have had something.<br /><br />I think the whole trick-your-car and pimp-your-ride fad has come and gone, you see less and less low-riders on the streets these days (thank god) and more and more trucks and SUV's, you know, real vehicles. So, sorry to all the hip wannabe gangsters and street-racers, this movie blows and hopefully we have seen the last one is the series.

B000BCKFWK|5.0|This is a classic comic book movie, it is indefinitely the best movie based on a comic to stick to what happened in the comics. And for all you people out there rating this movie poorly because its a \\"violent piece of garbage\\" what were you thinking watching a movie called sin city if your against violence, squeamish, and its not like this is the most violent thing going on right now so don't you dare even fathom that this movie is more grotesque then real life. If you turn on the TV to fox news you'll see more people dead in our screwed up world and the only thing your doing is blaming it on movies and other works of art.     Now about the movie. This movie is a story of revenge, lust, and murder (which yea are sins you Christians, hence the name sin city) and I absolutely loved it and I believe frank miller is a genius, and for those of you whom enjoyed it they are making 2 more at the moment, but may still make more, and I also recommended the graphic novels. The movie contains: The Big Fat Kill, The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow [....], and a short, which was longer in the comics, The Customer Is Always Right. Mickey Rourke (Marv) was undoubtedly the best anti-hero in any movie I've seen. This DVD also has many special features which unlike most are pretty sweet. But hey if you still think this is trash then go back to your \\"fine art\\" and \\"culture\\" and \\"family oriented movies\\" so don't blame the film makers if you rent this movie and your five year old sees dismemberment it your fault! Take responsibility for your actions.

0618001905|4.0|Eminent author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle termed the exploitation in the Congo, initiated by Belgian King Leopold II, \\"the greatest crime which has ever been committed in the history of the world,\\" while Viscount Ferdinand de Lesseps, the builder of the Suez Canal, had earlier described the work of the same king as \\"the greatest humanitarian work of this time.\\" The enormous contradiction of these statements represents the totality of the struggle between civilizing values and crass exploitation in Hochschild's work. Unique, even among early 1900s colonial possessions, Leopold's Congo Free State was deliberately and systematically founded on slave lobor.<br /><br />The author, who seems to specialize in uncovering previously unknown brutality, presents several parallels involving kidnapping, mutilation, and murder between Leopold's Congo and Nazi concentration camps and Soviet gulags. While Leopold sought a vast personal fortune and monument-studded legacy, he was mostly remembered for the \\"handless\\" children of the Congo.<br /><br />Sadly, it was not civilization which which was spread by the Europeans in the Congo but the legacy of authoritarianism demonstrated by the thirty-two year reign of Joseph Desire Mobutu. This book is provacative; informative and absorbing at the same time. It is an easy read for a novice, however it is not an academic work. I recommend it as an excellent piece of journalism or an introduction to an academic study.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I first saw Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind when it was shown on cable TV in the late 80s.  I remember being amazed at the artwork, the design of the aircraft, the way the insects and the jungle were brought to life.  I had seen Star Blazers and was watching Robotech but this movie was on a whole different level.  Now the masterpiece is back.<br /><br />The story, like many Studio Ghibli would make deals with mankind and how we treat ourselves and our Earth.  We have poisoned the planet, by either war or other reasons, and now it is trying to heal itself.  A toxic jungle tries to cleanse the soil while giant insects, the biggest being the Ohmu, guard the jungle.<br /><br />Nausicaa, voiced by Alison Lohman, is a Princess of the Valley of the Wind who is studying the jungle and the insects, trying to understand what is happening, why it is happening and if she can protect her people from it.  For as the trees clean the soil they also poison the air - this seems to be a byproduct of the process.  Asbel, voiced by Shia La Beouf, is a Prince that she helps see that warfare and violence, against other people or against the forest, is nothing but a dead end.<br /><br />Other voices include Chris Sarandon, Mark Hamill, Edward James Olmos, Patrick Stewart and Uma Thruman.<br /><br />Fox-squirrels can also be seen in Castle In The Sky, so I am not sure if the events in Nausicaa, the movie, happens after or before the events seen in the later one or even if the two are somehow linked.  It could just be an inside joke.  They have them in most of the movies made by Ghibli.<br /><br />without THIS film there would have been no other films as it was the one that gave birth to Ghibli!
031236198X|4.0|Everyone loves penguins, as long as you don't have to smell them. This avian parable, set on a fragile iceberg in Antarctica, not only reminds us of the precarious condition of our planet but also gives gentle lessons in how to promote, prepare for and respond to change. <br /> <br />The book is extremely easy to read and some of the more subtle points will probably emerge more clearly on a second reading.  Professionals involved in mamaging change will find it useful not so much as a handbook on the process but rather as an aid to raising awareness of all the complexities involved in leading transformation.  The message which pulsates through the fable is the overwhelming importance of vertical communication, an obvious point perhaps but one which is often obscured in companies both large and small.
B000GRUS22|3.0|...and that's a shame.  I'm obviously a big fan of his work.  Of course every cd gets better the more you listen to it.  Difference for me was when I bought the other cd's, there were songs, if not most of the album, that stood out and had wonderful and amazing beats and atmospheres.  I miss the vocals and some of the more aggressive beats.  Most of this cd isn't bad, it just sounds like anything else out there from the late 90's.  Like any generic later Delerium-esque stuff.  Years ago, you could instantly tell when you were listening to an older ENIGMA cd compared to all the other groups but now this cd just blends in with the rest.  I think there is better stuff out there these days.  Again, it's not bad, it just seems lame for ENIGMA. By the way, for me, the first 3 cd's are basically 9 or 10's to me, amazing classics. Then it went down just alittle each time with the next 2 cd's which are still great but this is Enigma's 1st cd I'm not raving about.
B00008LOS1|5.0|This is a perfect album and should be in any rock fan's collection. Every song is famous so there are no standout tracks.<br /><br />What is great is the order of the songs. \\"Bab O Reilly\\" kicks it off and \\"Wont get fooled again\\" closes it. All in between is not good...it is terrific. All of the songs are staples on the radio. This holds up to anything that the Stones, Beatles or Led Zep ever did. This is the cream of classic rock.<br /><br />This was probably the peak creativity and energy emitted by this enduring band. I love the other work by the Who, yet pound per pound, song by song, \\"Whos Next\\" is their best work...by far! The bonus material simply reitterates how great of a live band they were. By this used since for 10-15 dollars you will get a stunning work!<br /><br />There is no rational reason to not have this cd.<br /><br />I will always be intrigued by the cover of this album!
B000HA4WT8|3.0|I think The Fast and the Furious- Tokyo Drift is slightly better than the second one. It's light years behind the first film though. The acting is fair but not everything works in the movie. The script is weak and at times I admit it's like you're not even watching a Fast and the Furious movie. It seems more like an after school special. Lucas Black gets in trouble for racing the older brother from Home Improvement. His mom then sends him to live with his father in Tokyo. His father warns him that if he goes near a car he'll kick him out. It's obvious from the start that Black isn't going to listen to those rules. Plus we know he actually won't ever get kicked out because if he's not with his dad then he'd have to settle for jail and then how would he be able to race or drift and then it would be no point in it being a Fast and the Furious movie. So that plotline is pretty pointless and proves to be pointles since in the end it..has no impact on it. The movie is mostly just about him learning to do a new form of racing to him called drifting. He damages each car he trys it in but of course you know he'll do better by the end.<br /><br />  Lucas Black still fairs well here as a leading man but he doesn't have the screen presence of Vin Diesel or even Paul Walker. He's probably a better actor than Paul Walker. He went to a better acting school then the Keanu Reeves acting school that Walker went to I guess. Little \\"or medium sized\\" Bow Wow is also ok as Black's friend who doesn't race but sells things. This one has less sexy women and less hot cars than the previous ones. The direction is less flashy too. This one is just more juvenile and I can't say the Lucas Black character even changes, he goes there as a punk kid and basically just becomes... a wiser punk kid by the end. I also felt like I was watching the Karate Kid but with cars instead of Karate.
B000FA57N0|5.0|This was my first introduction to the Firefly universe created by Joss Whedon. I recall seeing commercials for the series when it first came out and thinking, \\"Oh boy, another Farscape clone/ripoff. PASS\\". Forward to three months ago when I decided to rent the DVD, thinking how bad it was going to be. I was utterly shocked. I know that I am hooked on a movie when I go through all the DVD selections (Special Features, Making of..., Gag Reels, etc.) after watching it for the first time. Now, this movie seems like a love it or hate it movie. For the Firefly familiars they loved it. For the uninitiated they either loved it, were confused, or hated it. This movie appealed to me because I am, by and far, a huge Science Fiction fan. I loved it, I guess, for its originality and unique vision. Also for its characters. I plan on buying this DVD and the first season of Firefly, as recently Universal HD (channel) has started running Firefly eps in the order they were intended. I saw the pilot for the first time Sunday, and all I can say is that I hope a sequel to Serenity is made, bar some revival of the series. This series is too good to have received such poor treatment from Fox. I feel terrible for not giving it the chance it deserved back when the series started. Here's hoping it recovers.

B000F39MAQ|5.0|I am delighted to own this DVD as the production offers a new take on Verdi's masterpiece. Fond memories of productions featuring Gheorghiu and Gruberova are not eclipsed with this new version, although I am tempted to say that I enjoyed this version more than the others. The principals sing and act excellently and I can see why this production caused such excitement when it was premiered at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|This review is of the two disc special edition of Top Gun, not the prior one disc edition.  Top Gun is essentially about a naval pilot's journey through fighter weapons school.  He must resist his rebellious individual nature to become the best pilot and also a team player.  If you're reading this review, chances are you've already seen the movie so I'll focus on reviewing the dvd. <br /> <br />This first disc is presented in widescreen anamorphic format which is a big upgrade from the original release.  The picture is generally sharp with good contrast.  Picture quality appeared to be a big upgrade from the prior release.  Not sure if this apparent upgrade is merely the result of changing to anamorphic transfer.  The soundtrack is presented in DTS6.1 or Dolby 5.1.  Sounds are generally well mixed and dialogue remains audible through out.  Be aware that the sound effects in the action scenes will be considerably louder than the volume levels of the dialogue.  With my 5.1 surround system, I found that the subwoofer got a workout, but that the rear channels were perhaps slightly under utilized.   <br /> <br />Extras were adequate.  On the second disc, there were some vintage interviews with the major players including Tom Cruise (pre-craziness).  These were interesting and there was some particular focus on the history of the film, i.e. getting it to produced.  The documentary \\"Making of Top Gun\\" was imformative.  In addition to the vintage stuff, there's also a restrospective look at the film.  Val Kilmer's appearance is notable.  Other lesser known actors also appear.  However, the interviews are notable for the absence of Kelly McGillis.  Also included is a picture gallery which is fine. <br /> <br />All in all I'd say this is a good release for fans of the film.  The extras are excellent except for the absence of Kelly McGillis.  I view this as a significant absence since she is the the primary co-star.  4 out of 5.

0060776757|5.0|The pictures throughout U2's history alone are great but wonderful stories such as how The Fly and Macphisto came to be plus the behind the scenes of the making of each album and tours in their own words are amazing.  Throughout their history there have been alot of stories and half truths about this band but this book answers every thing I ever wondered about U2.  This is a must read!
B000HCO8IQ|5.0|If you're only familiar with \\"Take Your Mama\\" and \\"Laura\\" from the Scissor Sisters' first album, some of the tracks on \\"Ta-Dah\\" will come as a bit of a surprise.  (But buy both anyway.)  First, there are the solid ballads - in the vein of \\"Return to Oz\\" and \\"Mary\\" from their first album, the beautiful \\"Might Tell You Tonight\\" and \\"The Other Side\\" are placed later in the album, and come as lamenting love songs amidst a wealth of dance-inducing cuts.  And the darker, twisted \\"I Can't Decide,\\" with its bouncy flair (and Jews Harp played by Gina Gershon) is incredibly catchy for a song sung by someone who's trying to decide if they should commit murder or not (\\"I can't decide/whether you should live or die/Oh, you'll probably go to heaven/Please don't hang your head and cry.\\")  Likewise, Elton John's co-written \\"Intermission\\" is equally jaunty and dark (\\"Happy yesterday to all/We were born to die.\\")<br /><br />That's not to say you can't dance your a** off to this album - there are plenty of tracks designed to help you do just that.  \\"Ooh\\" and \\"Paul McCartney\\" - perhaps the most hyper fan letter ever written to a Beatle - are both excellent reminders of why this band has the reputation it does.  And the sole song sung by the totally fabulous Ana Matronic, \\"Kiss You Off,\\" sounds like she's channeling Goldfrapp and Blondie at the same time - and with the driving beat and laid-back vocals, it works.  Great lyrics too - \\"Kiss you off my lips/It's standing room only for a piece of my pigment/So excuse me a minute while I supply demand.\\"<br /><br />The lead single \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing\\" is - and will be - ubiquitous, and deservedly so.  With Elton John both contributing to the songwriting, and playing piano, and Jake Shears' disco falsetto, it's one of those rare songs that you like the more you hear it.  And once you read the lyrics, you'll find there's much more to it than what its name seems to imply.<br /><br />And that's true of much of the Scissor Sisters' music, which is why they're so worth checking out.  They create intricate, fun, occasionally sad, beautiful, and poignant music, which is actually layered with meaning - a welcome change in a \\"mean what I sing\\" pop world.  But then, these folks are no ordinary pop group - they keep getting better, and they mean to stay around for a while.  Good thing, too.  (And a quick word to the wise - if they happen to come through a town near you, do not hesitate to see them live.  They're one of the best, most fun acts to come along in years.)sic, which is why they're so worth checking out.

B00005JP87|5.0|A Delightful movie. Full of spirit, love & magic mixed with illusion.  As others have said, the magic gets rationalized at the end, especially in the mind of Uhl, Giamatti the policeman who secretly admires the Illusionist, but is sworn to do the sadistic prince's bidding.<br /><br /> The sets, well, they aren't sets, they are authentic castles, dark mysterious real streets with cobblestones, untouched for the last 200 plus years. The movie is worth seeing, if only for it's dark stone buildings, castles, wrought iron fences and streets with white plaster and dark hammerbeam shops. Prague and the Czech Republic was somehow spared the destruction of WWII. Authentic Victorian styles everywhere.<br /><br />Norton is tops as the title magician, trying to work around the despot, in despair at the loss of his love. The spirit of the princess Sophie comes right out of 19th century Spiritualism, foggy wavy ectoplasm. Too much more would spoil the movie if it hasn't been spoiled already by tell-all reviews. One can see the chip-on-the-shoulder arrogant attitude in the Sewell's prince that would soon pull the world apart and destroy Europe in World War I, the kind of person who would sit in his tower and order thousands to attack machine gun emplacements. The kind of person who would be assasinated to start WWI!<br /><br /> This movie has the look and feel of an older classic. Luminous. Tinged sepia. A feast for the eyes. A feast on many levels. Old fashioned movie, with substance, a movie to cherish - good over evil. With so much violence, vulgarity and negativism in the cinema, it's great to see a movie like this again.<br /><br />I am astounded by the negative, cynical reviews I see here, as if whether you puzzle out the plot is the only thing about a movie that matters. I loved it, have seen it twice and I'd go again. Highest recommendation. best of '06, so far.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I have to agree with Buffy topaz@shaka -- I'm really surprised at ANY TV show being so good in its freshman year.  It's a lot to expect, but this show delivers. (Thank GAWD they renewed it, I would've croaked)  Excellent nuance and drama, and the creepiness is truly, madly, deeply CREEPY.  It's got bad, bad stuff coming up ahead, too -- the foreshadowing in this series is handled with finesse and horror.<br /><br />The actors are hot, but much more than that -- the producers hired guys with terrific and real talent.  The season-ender episode burnt my eyebrows off!  They -- everyone on the series from the stars to the people who clean their trailers -- have my undying respect.  May this series burn for many years to come.
B0002S943O|5.0|After seeing this on dvd I really wish I was able to attend the concert. Alas, I was a bit too young and my mom probably wouldn't have let me. This is the sexiest concert film I have ever seen. It's not just Dave Gahan, as most girls would tell you.  There's something in the air, something the director Anton captured.  The mix of video and live performance is breathtaking. I was in awe the whole time.
B000BP86OG|1.0|PLEASE TAKE THE MUSIC EXPERTS ADVICE. THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE QUEEN. <br /> <br />I bought the first album and was awful sorry I did. Someone tricked me into thinking it sounded like Queen (of which I am the biggest fan). Um, Freddie Mercury could sing for one. Brian May knew how to play a guitar. Roger Taylor could add some awesome fills. <br /> <br />Justin Hawkins sounds as if someone is stomping on his nuts. The Guitarist and Drummer (who cares what their names are, they suck anyways) could play their instruments better and it would sound better if they were urinating on them. <br /> <br />If you have ever ondered what would happen if Hair metal and the Bee Gees had sex, what kind of child would come out, then I HIGHLY recommend this album. If you are a Queen fan, a real Queen fan, not just a fan of a hit or two. (If you know the following songs, you are qualified as a real Queen fan just by having heard them: Stealin, I Go Crazy, Hangman, or Lost Opportunity) STAY AWAY FROM THIS, it will make your ears bleed! <br /> <br />This is the only artist who I refuse to play when I DJ at the bars. After all, I don't want everyone to leave! <br /> <br />one star because I can't give NEGATIVE stars!
B00005JPE7|3.0|To all you losers that take this stuff too seriously, GET A LIFE!  Mr. MC was just stating his opinion, and a logical conclusion!  We all know that after the original ROCKY, all the films went down hill.  C'mon the last two really blew!  The recent contender show sucked, Sly's magazine went nowhere, and everything he seems to touch turns to Poo Poo!  Maybe it's been long enough that he can start anew with the ROCKY story?      Just because someone states facts, doesn't mean he hates the thing.  I love ROCKY and Sylvester Stallone in general, but facts are facts!  Boss Fan, try not to be so pompous and anal all the time.

0425105709|5.0|Among the subtlest and \\"deepest\\" of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot stories, ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MY SHOE is a murder mystery that comments on the British class system.  That the story is essentially about class is clear from the widely differing social stations of its cast of characters.  Take, for example, the three victims:  first, a respected dentist named Mr. Morley is found shot to death in his office; then one of Morley's patients, a wealthy Greek immigrant, dies while another patient, a nondescript charity worker with the \\"pompous\\" name of Mabelle Sainsbury Seale, vanishes.  Hercule Poirot and Chief Inspector Japp must find the common link between these three occurrences.  The matter is complicated further by the fact that Alistair Blunt, a financier who gained his status by marrying into an Anglo-Jewish banking family (one obviously based on the Rothschilds) was also a patient in Morley's office on the day of his death; Japp believes that Blunt himself was intended to be the victim.  But for the ever-observant Poirot, the case really begins with something quite mundane:  that is, a shoe...a woman's black patent leather shoe with a large, ornate buckle...<br /><br />Also highly recommended, for those who have finished the novel:  the superb made-for-TV version of ONE, TWO, BUCKLE MY SHOE, starring David Suchet as Poirot and Philip Jackson as Japp, and available on DVD from Amazon.com.
B000059LGC|5.0|Having viewed \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" and seeing Albert Finney in the role of Hercule Poirot, I was uncertain about my reaction to Peter Ustinov in this leading role, such different personalities and physical types/appearances. My concerns were quickly laid to rest, when at a hotel on the banks of the Nile, Mr. Poirot spoke in his French-accented Belgian voice to David Niven who played a lawyer representing Lynette Doyle's (aka Ridgeway's) interests, one knew this would be a film worth viewing. All the key players in this murder/drama were staying at the same hotel, waiting for the luxury steamboat \\"Karnak\\" to arrive and take them on their cruise down the Nile ...<br /><br />Based on Agatha Christie's book of the same title, the film is superbly cast with such great names as Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, Olivia Hussey, George Kennedy, Jack Warden, and actors and actresses unknown to me: Lois Chiles (played the leading lady, Lynette Ridgeway), Jane Birkin, Maggie Smith, and Jon Finch. The story begins as the heiress and socialite, Lynette Ridgeway arrives home at her great estate in England. She is greeted by the servants and her best friend or relative, Jacqueline (played by Mia Farrow) who begs her to hire her fiance and lover, who is penniless and without a job. When they are introduced, a spark is exchanged, and one senses that Ms Ridgeway will win him in the end ...<br /><br />In the next scene, Lynette and her new husband are riding on horseback to view the Pyramids ... They stop and kiss on horseback, then climb to the top of a Pyramid. Only to learn as they reach the top, Jacqueline is there, waiting for them, giving details about the structure as if she were a tour guide and laughing as she views their discomfort and irritation by her surprise appearance. She is their nemesis, tracking down their moves and showing up, when they least expect it ... playing the spurned female lover to perfection. The couple manage to trick her into going to the railroad station, as they back track and return to the hotel, to board their boat for the cruise ... The upper class never looked so grand and haughty as the various actors and actresses play their roles when boarding for their cruise ... One learns nearly every passenger has a grudge against either Mrs. Doyle (aka Lynette Ridgeway) or her father who left his wealth to her. They all resent or hate her for some reason or another ... On a tour of some ruins, the passengers feign interest in the huge columns and carved structures, when they are all eyeing the antics of the newlyweds, the Doyle couple, as they wander around the site. A scream from Mrs. Doyle arouses everyone's attention, as they run to see what happened, a huge boulder, had toppled from one of the columns and nearly crushed her ... Hercule Poirot's instincts are aroused, his attention to detail and memory, like a steel trap, is put into over-drive ...<br /><br />Ms Jacqueline makes her grand dramatic entrance at a tour site along the way and she comes on board ... to haunt the Doyles. She gets drunk one evening, threatens Mr. Doyle after his wife had gone to bed. Jacqueline loses control, whips out her pistol and shoots him in the leg. After this event, she is led back to her cabin, emotionally distraught and nearly hysterical. A passenger who is a nurse is awakened to stay with her all night, she injects Jacqueline with Morphine ... Mr. Doyle is taken to the doctor's cabin for treatment ... And shortly thereafter, Lynette Doyle is discovered murdered, shot in the head, with the same pistol used to shoot Mr. Doyle.<br /><br />This is the first murder on board and Hercule Poirot has his work cut out for him, as *everyone* is a suspect ... Nearly all the passengers have motive and most had the opportunity to do it, except the *obvious* suspect, Jacqueline who was guarded by the nurse in her cabin. In true Agatha Christie fashion, the clues are examined by Mr. Poirot. Everyday life on board the boat becomes more tense and frightening. Even Hercule Poirot's life is threatened by a live cobra in his bathroom ... In the end, there are five total deaths on board. The last two occur after Hercule Poirot reveals who the murderer is: amazingly, the murderer and accomplice end up dying. This is a very fine film with enough twists and turns to satisfy any \\"who dun it\\" murder mystery fan.The film has magnificent long shot scenery, great actors and actresses, superb winding plot and colorful characters played to perfection, one can ask no more of a film!

B000HA4W4S|5.0|What does that mean? On Friday, after getting off a hard work week you need something to pick you up and set the mood for the weekend - and that's where the Scissor Sisters debut album stands. By Saturday, you need something just a little more outrageous to get your blood pumping and kick into full party mode - thus, Ta'Dah, their sophomore album does just that. On first listening I thought the album had some good songs but just didn't live up to the brilliance of their first album and was slightly disappointed. Then, while doing things around the house, I put it on again and BAM! The jam-packed effect of this album hit me full force. All the \\"poor\\" songs I thought I heard on first listening slide into their proper place in my brain and next thing I knew I was dancing around the house and wanting more. I was wishing it was a weekend because I wanted to get out of the house and go to a club and enjoy this masterpiece in its proper arena. This album proves that the Scissor Sisters are here to stay.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is the first album in years that I have bought and enjoyed almost every song.  Usually I buy two or three of the songs I like off of an album to save myself some money, but this was a great album.  It's powerful lyrics, heavy riffs and overall full sound just blew me away at first listen.  I have it in my car, and I haven't taken it out in over a week even when my total drive time is two hours a day.  I am so impressed with the way they've matured and haven't sold out at all. A great rock album, one that I keep suggesting to all my friends.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|The songwriting and lyrics on this album are mature and interesting, and Bruce, Steve, Jan, Dave, and Adrian perform well. My only complaint is with the drumming. For one, Nico's timing is off in many places. He plays fills and intros too fast, and tends to speed up while he's playing. And another thing, the snare drum sounds TERRIBLE. I don't know if the snares were too loose or what the problem is, but the snare sounds very fake, as if a combined snare/high-hat hit was artificially put in by the producer. This, combined with Nico's timing problems, sometimes make some of the songs unlistenable. Otherwise this album would get four stars.

B0000TB01Y|3.0|I was excited about getting this compact disc about Wicked, the hottest ticket on Broadway. I liked the beginning about how the witch was born green. I think the compact disc does serve a service in providing us a closer view of the musical itself. I didn't care for the story involving Glinda, the good witch, and Elfaba, the bad witch who is green. I didn't like the story itself. While I am sure that the musical is much better than just listening to it but I was uncomfortable with Elfaba's portrayal as being born green and bad while Glinda was both popular and pretty. I think I was just more sympathetic towards Elfaba because she was the outcast and I always find myself among the outcasts so I felt sorry for Elfaba. I don't find much sympathy for Glinda who has spent her entire life being both popular and gifted so of course, she doesn't change. She gets rewarded while poor Elfaba gets treated as bad.  I also expected a lot more so much that I would actually pay a lot of money to see it live but I haven't. I believe this musical probably does a lot of magic onstage and live than on the compact disc. The originals have left and replacements have come and gone. While I'm sure Wicked is worth seeing at least once, I probably won't see it and wait for the movie.

B000002JOH|5.0|I admit it, I had completely stopped listening to Pantera until the \\"Behind the Music\\" episode aired recently, but it was that TV show that inspired me to dig out my old tattered copy of VDOP. And you know what? I still LOVE this album, even as a responsible husband and father with the whitest of white-collar jobs! I had forgotten what a HUGE sound Dimebag got out of that little flying-v guitar, how Rex and Vinnie could shake my insides with their thunderous, tight grooves and most of all, how much Phil could get into my head with that straight-outta-Hell roar of his!! This is a timeless classic, and newer bands like Disturbed, Godsmack and System of a Down owe a debt of gratitude to Pantera for bringing the POWER metal to the forefront. One of the top two or three metal albums of all-time. If you are a true metalhead, you MUST pick up this CD! AWESOME!!

076531178X|5.0|Mistborn is even better than Elantris, which I thought was great.  Both the world and the characters in Mistborn are richly developed.  It's so great to have a character-driven fantasy that's not a Tolkien wannabe.  Even though it may be part of a trilogy, it's also nice that Mistborn has an ending that's not a cliffhanger.  Sanderson doesn't pull out any gimmicks to get you to buy the next book in the series.  Instead, you'll be very satisfied with this book as a standalone novel, yet you'll want to come back to this universe simply for the characters themselves.  Don't miss this book!
B00004WGC4|5.0|In my opinion, it's a toss-up between this and Blackadder as the greatest British comedy of all time. Warning: this complete set includes rather lengthy (and not always interesting) interviews with John Cleese before every episode. If you have no interest in the script-writing process or Cleese's relationship with the actor who played Manuel, then that might be a minor bother you'll have to fast forward through. But even so- this is a great series.

Their  attention to detail and perfecting their craft has these guys on top of their game. Khan's vocal lines are crystalline and flawless, while Thomas Youngblood continues to be a master of tasteful the guitar work by not over playing. Yes in deed they have created a truly dynamic listen from start to finish.<br /><br />One of the best I've heard from this style of music thus far!
B000AP04L0|4.0|This movie is made for the DVD format.  Repeat viewings.  While some may call it over rated, and unfunny, those would be individuals who do not know the definition of funny.  Please consult Wester's dictionary, available for sale at this website.<br /><br />One thing I've never seen mentioned is how ironic and funny this movie was, as a statement of the 80's.  The 80's are generally overlooked. But this movie, casually shows many instances of reference to this often overlooked decade.  For instance:<br /><br />1) Did you notice they go for coffee in a restaurant coffee shop?  Not a stand in line, barrista style Starbucks coffee shop.  Very indicative of the office workers in the Silicone Valley offices.  I worked at a restaurant very similar to the one in the movie, and the office workers often came for coffee in the mornings, at the Peninsula, California city I worked in.  And no, they did not require us to wear \\"fringe.\\"<br /><br />2) Did you notice the boss, as he walked around from desk to desk, he carried a ceramic coffee mug, not a papercup?  Another indication of the 80's.<br /><br />3) The fact that this movie was centered around the Silicone Valley, and computer companies, again was an indication of the 80's computer rush.<br /><br />4) Many other 80's nostalgia references, can you think of any?<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!
B000HCO83G|1.0|I'm not going to go through the entire detail and synopsis like everyone else.  I will however say what is wrong with the movie.  First of all, it should be called the Wolverine/Storm Show.  The two main characters have an entirely too large a role, leaving hardly any scenes for other character development. <br />I was incredibly dissapointed in the development of Colossus.  Poor Daniel Cudmore had an astonishing 27seconds of TOTAL screentime.  This is one of the major X-men and they use him as an extra basically.  Scenes with Colosssus could have been amazing, but they used little action for this character, it really was a waste.  Secondly, Angel, yah...had a few speaking parts, about 2 scenes where he flew around in the sky...and thats it!  This could have been a great character to develop as well, but once again...nothing!  Juggernaut, could have been amazing, i'm surpised that actually gave Vinnie Jones scenes where he spoke, but the way they finished him off was just ridiculous.  Shadowcat? C'mon?!  Iceman and Pyro were actually given some screentime and a final battle, which to my opinion was the highlight of the movie.  Other than that and the final battle with the \\"hopping mutants\\", the movie was a total waste of my $7.50.  I've got to say that Brett Ratner really screwed this movie up.  Any true X-men fan would have and should have been dissapointed in this movie.  Its a total discrace the the X-men franchise and comic.  As much as I do not want to buy the dvd and boycott it, I am...but only because I have the other two.  Please, save yourself the time and just rent it if your bored or sick, other than that it would probably make a nice doorstop.  I would put it up there with the Super Mario Bros. movie.
B00025ETIW|4.0|In certain crowds, you're not supposed to like bands like My Chemical Romance, because you're supposed to despise anything that gets air time on MTV. If you're that type of person, stay away from this album. If you can appreciate music for what it is and not worry so much about what's politically correct to listen to, you may really like this album. The songs are catchy, the lead singer does a good job and the production is good overall.  <br /> <br />If you've heard any of the singles you'll know whether you'll like the rest of the album as well. If you don't like the singles, don't buy the album. If you like the singles, the album is full of equally good songs.
B000E1155E|4.0|I just bought this on itunes mainly because I saw them play \\"a certain romance\\" on saturday night live and it inspired me to play my guitar along with the recording. the rest of the album is good but i still think \\"a certain romance\\" is well beyond anything else on the album. i actually find the single \\"i bet you look good on the dancefloor\\" kind of annoying but some of the other tracks are great!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Anyone whose read my previous \\"Star Wars\\" reviews know I've been very hard with George \\"Whore of Hollywood\\" Lucas and the whole direction he took the first trilogy on.  I don't care if it WAS reflective of his \\"original vision,\\" I get the feeling we'll need another prequel to figure out just what the Heck was going on (Is that what he MEANT to do?  Who knows?).  I was also a kid when the first trilogy came out and absolutely loved it.  And yet, I think folks are being a LITTLE too critical of the changes made in this DVD set.  Honestly, I also liked the updated special effects on the cinematic reissues for the 25th (I think) anniversary. <br /> <br />So let's get the crap out of the way.  The changes Lucas made FOR the DVD - necessary?  Some yes, some no.  It was nice to see Ian McDiarmid being the emperor in \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" (sorry, Mr. Revill.  I at least hope you still get royalties), and the script rewrites make more sense now given what we know of the backstory.  But still, but still....we didn't need Boba Fett's dialogue redubbed.  We also didn't need even MORE stormtroopers for Han Solo to run away from.  Another thing that, not only we didn't need, but was unnecessary and puzzling - replacing Sebatian Shaw at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" with Hayden Christiansen.  Why?  And why not replace Alec Guinness with Ewan Macgregor to make it a matched set?  My biggest complaint is with other \\"Star Wars\\" veterans; why didn't Lucas include the cleaned-up originals with the altered ones?  I guess we all know the answer to this one, but it bothers me still. <br /> <br />The changes, however, are minor and don't get in the way of the goodness that are the original trilogy of films.  The bonus disc is a nice touch as well, bringing the sheer joy of behind-the-scenes goodness up to date with what made him famous.  It was good to see they added and expanded on \\"Empire of Dreams,\\" since they showed a version of it first on A&E.  One doesn't get the feeling of reheated leftovers that sometimes accompanies a DVD which throws an EPK or \\"HBO Behind-The-Scenes\\" doc as a \\"special feature.\\"  Add in the commentary (good overall), great still galleries, and excellent promo spots (it was way cool to see the TV ad for \\"Star Wars\\" I remember back again), and it's a good buy.  I hope, though, that Mr. Lucas resists putting out any more \\"special limited editions.\\"  Oh, well, one can hope!
B00005JP87|3.0|but, of course, the death of a prince is quite realistic. if he didn't commit any murder, why he would convince himself that he commited a crime? an average movie, not a great movie at all. very slow tempo, loose script. the montage is too dark, trying to give you an ancient vienna feeling. too many and too much close-up shots. with computer generated graphics, everything you saw in this movie is nothing but. the romance is also quite luke warm and not well developed. watchable but on the other hand, also quite skipable and forgetable.
B000G03Q2S|5.0|In 1999 Capitol released the first stereo/mono single disc version of this album.  In 2000 they re-released it, and what I read at the time was they had goofed and not used the HDCD master for the 1999 release.  I didn't bother buying it again because I don't have a player with HDCD capability. <br /> <br />Last week I found out that there's another reason they re-released it in 2000:  when the stereo version was released, radio stations started playing the stereo versions of the songs that were singles from this album.  The stereo version of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" has Carl Wilson singing the bridge (...maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true...), while it's Mike Love's voice on the mono version that we've heard since 1966.  When he found out about this, Mike Love had Capitol alter the stereo version of the song to insert the bridge from the mono version with him singing.  When you listen to the stereo version of the song on this CD, you can hear how the stereo folds down to mono briefly during the bridge.  Capitol did a good job of splicing it together; I hadn't noticed it until someone pointed it out to me. <br /> <br />The altered version of this song has also appeared on compilations released since 2000.   <br /> <br />The surround sound and hi-resolution stereo versions of the album on DVD-A and on the DVD that accompanies this release use the unaltered track with Carl Wilson singing the bridge.  I believe the 2 LP vinyl set also uses the unaltered stereo version.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|Bob Dylan has been in the music business since 1961, even then people realized he didn't have the voice of Frank Sinatra, has put out many albums that have revolutionized music, many refer to him as the voice of the \\"Vietnam\\" generation, and now some 45 years after his debut album some people are still shocked that his voice doesn't have operatic tendencies. Many of these people claiming to be \\"die hard\\" Dylan fans, gimme a break. <br />True Dylan fans realize this album is great because of, ohh, let me think it called, um, um, songwriting, yeah thats it. <br />Best Song: Nettie Moore, Workingman's Blues
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I really love this movie and especially love the relationships and realistic depth to all the characters.  Danielle's relationship with her family is not unexpected because of the circumstances.  Her Stepmother Romila could not deal with being left a widow, and the rivalry between her and her stepsisters was inevitable.<br /><br />Her relationship with the Prince is both comical and romantic and I absolutely love that Danielle's fairygodmother is the Great Da Vinci himself.  That was infinitely most unexpected and wonderful.<br /><br />This will remain as my all time favorite movie and is definitely a CLASSIC!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I enthusiastically recommend this item, as it gives you hours of laughs. This is your perfect chance to own all 10 seasons on DVD. This provides you with over 230 episodes and over 85 hours of laughter mixed with some drama. Of course, if you already have the 10 seasons on DVD already then I don't really recommend buying this. However, if you're a Friends fan and you haven't gotten the DVDs yet, or if you're someone who loves sitcoms, this is your chance.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a great game.  I noticed that someone mentioned their concern about losing pieces.  Our three-year old lost a piece shortly after we got this game.  I simply called the company and they sent me a replacement free of charge.  They are great to work with.  Enjoy!
B00005JP8V|2.0|I have to start off by saying this movie was actually not that bad. It's not on the same level as \\"The Craft\\" or \\"The Lost Boys\\", but it wasn't too bad. There were some creepy scenes, a decent soundtrack, and Renny Harlin used the Autumn in New England setting perfectly. I thought the private school was a perfect location for a horror flick, huge gothic buildings, underlit for a creepy atomosphere. But to be honest there really isn't anything scary presented here that hasn't been seen before, and done much better. You will be left with tons of unanswered questions, like what happened to all of the ugly people in town? Seriously, everyone here stepped right out of a Gap commercial. Why does it always rain at night? I know thunderstorms help create mood in horror films, but it was almost laughable at how once the sun sets, the thunder and lightening kick right in. What is the point of the 4 member covenant when 3 of the members are presented as useless after the first 15 minutes of the film? And what's with the \\"water-bubble-battle\\" climax? That might have looked good on paper, but was pretty goofy looking on film. But despite all of it's faults, this is still a fun little B-movie, just don't go into it looking for real scares.

B000F8O35U|4.0|I love this movie and I want to know if this DVD has spanish audio or tracks?  <br />Please, somebody answer me... Thanks!
B00004RJEG|5.0|Much has already been written about this excellent DVD however none of the good points have been over emphasised.  The audio and video quality is exceptional throughout and can bring out the very best in a top notch home cinema system.  <br /> <br />I introduced the agent who sold me my Theta / Krell / Martin Logan system to this disc and although he was trying to sell me some upgraded Xtreme cards for my Casablanca at the time, he admited that it would be difficult to improve on the sound quality.  In relation to the beautiful No Frontiers duet, as he said, you can not only hear every detail of the arrangement but you can truly feel the emotion in the performance.  It is a truly moving experience.  The picture quality too is very high although to obtain the best from the DVD a display system with good differentiation between blacks and differing shades of grey is required. <br /> <br />The performance itself is almost flawless, in fact the only bum note on this disc, at the end of a piano coda, stands out quite dramatically.  However, such is the (justified) confidence in their abilities that rather than brush it under the carpet Jim jokes with his sister and the audience over it.  Each member of the family appears completely at home playing a number of instruments, perhaps a testimony to their classical background, as referred to in the excellent review by C. Hsieh of All the Way Home. <br /> <br />A truly exceptional DVD by a truly exceptional group of musicians.  If you love music you should have this in your DVD collection. <br /> <br />Incidentally I note with some sympathy the comments on the time it took for this DVD to appear in region 1 format.  Normally it is the rest of the world that has to wait for other region code versions to appear and when they do they usually have less features than their region 1 equivalents.  Unfortunately it appears that until consumers can find a way of pressuring for the abandonment of the discriminatory region code system every one will have to continue to settle for a less than ideal position.
B000021Y77|5.0|RUN LOLA RUN is one of those films that actually delivers what it promises. In this case, a heart-pumping, action-filled flick with an excellent soundtrack, and plenty of artistic weirdness to boot.<br /><br />Clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, this German-made film is infused with a quality normally seen in the cars this country produces. Tom Tykwer wrote the script and directs (as well as contributing his voice and music to several songs/remixes), and gives us a movie that contains more than just artsy material. He takes the viewer on a journey of existentialism thanks to the unusual abilities of its main character, Lola. She's a dye-dipped redhead with a high-pitched, soprano voice that can shatter glass. And she has the ability to change her future. Problem is, though, every time she changes something, everything changes, not just the one thing she wants. So when her boyfriend, Manni, loses 100,000 Deutsche marks that are owed to a local mob boss, Lola has to save him. But she's only got 20 minutes, and everything doesn't go as planned ...the first time. Or the second. Or maybe even the third.<br /><br />Not being very familiar with German cinema, I'd rarely watched anything from this country. But I'd often heard people comment on Run Lola Run and how great it was, so I decided to check it out. And I'm glad I did! The film opens up with a bang and doesn't stop until the final scene. Franka Potente stars as the hair-color-enhanced Lola, and her portrayal is believable, beautiful, and bizarre. In short, a great combination. Her boyfriend, Manni, is played by Moritz Bleibtreu, and his ridiculous behavior is pulled off well, especially when he loses the money and calls Lola in a blubbering panic.<br /><br />I loved, too, the incorporation of overlapping animation, something I enjoyed in the movie THE DANGEROUS LIVES OF ALTAR BOYS.<br /><br />Connections within connections is the main theme here, but one that is brought to life by a vivid script and excellent camera work (the dizzying slow-downs and speed-ups may drive some to distraction but are vital to the story).<br /><br />I mentioned earlier the great soundtrack and that the director contributed his own voice and songs to it. And so did Franka Potente. The European beats mixed with old American titles were laid down in topnotch fashion.<br /><br />This is another foreign film gem, and one that won't take up much of your time. But it's one you'll be glad you visited.ent camera work (the dizzying slow-downs and speed-ups may drive some to distraction but are vital to the story).  <br /> <br />I mentioned earlier the great soundtrack and that the director contributed his own voice and songs to it.

0618680004|5.0|Few remarked on Dawkin's use of humor and personal experiences that I think set this work a part from his others.  In addition to funny quotes from Monty Python, comedienne Julia Sweeney, and his friend Douglas Adams, Dawkins himself can be quite amusing as well.  He is not above poking fun of religious ideas that are clearly poorly developed as well as occasionally using a bit of self-deprecating humor as well.  He also discusses his life and experiences with religion that gives the reader perhaps the most personal view of the author to date.  This is a very entertaining book as well as thought provoking and relevant.
B000000HHE|5.0|Del La Soul's Three Feet High and Rising is a record that is utterly evocative of a particular time -- because in 1989 and for a long time thereafter it was the only thing being played on the streets and on car radios in New York, especially Brooklyn -- while managing to sound relevant today. It has lost none of its sweetness, while artfully avoiding being coy. It has to be in the top ten of classic hip hop records. Given that it is a seamless work of sampling genius, it would be trite to pick out any particular one of its 24 dazzlers. Enjoy.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess has envisioned an ugly potential future that came to be. In addition to such writers as George Orwell and Aldous Huxley, British authors seem to be the masters of creating fiction which predicts the worst possible societal, political, and cultural decay, based on contemporary observations of the latest trends in these three factors. In Clockwork Orange, Mr. Burgess portrays what was for him, a near-future Britain, in which economic failure, inept and corrupt government, and social malaise result in a society overwhelmed by crime. The main perpetrators are vast numbers of street-gangs roaming the cities, savagely assaulting, robbing, murdering, raping, and vandalizing...for fun. The gangs are largely composed of teenagers, who aside from their random violence, are also obsessed with drug-abuse and pop-culture, a pop-culture with its own trendy slang-language (based on Russian in this case). This scenario, exists now, in certain neighborhoods of specific cities! The vision did come true! <br />The main character and narrator, is Alex, an average street-thug, who describes graphically the psychopathic crimes commited by his gang. Despite his vile behavior, one can't help but find a certain charisma in Alex. His one positive attribute seems to be his love of classical music, Beethoven specifically.  <br />Alex eventually finds himself in prison, and volunteers for an experimental \\"treatment\\" in exchange for early release. This turns out to be a form of operant-conditioning, which programs him to be violently ill whenever he feels compelled to violence. The government endorses this new method, so as to make space for \\"political prisoners\\", by releasing \\"treated\\" street criminals. The result: Alex is released into a crime-ridden society, completely unable to defend himself! This becomes the major philosophical point of the story. The most disturbing fact is that some bureaucrats really do believe such concepts are an acceptable means of \\"establishing control\\".  <br />Get the unabridged version of this book WITH ALL 21 CHAPTERS. Some time ago, the American version was very foolishly published with only 20 chapters! I didn't get to read the last chapter until 1995! <br />The film version, is a Stanley Kubrik classic, but is based on the abridged version of the story. The film was banned in Britain for quite some time because film-goers were emulating the behavior in the movie!
076790592X|2.0|People raved so much about this book, I was shocked to realize that I wasn't enjoying it.  I liked Morrie, of course.  How could you not like Morrie?  Unfortunately, although the book is supposedly just about Morrie's philosophies about life and about dying, there is really a second main character--Mitch, the author and narrator.  He only briefly sketches out a picture of himself, which may be his main mistake.  What I know about Mitch comes from the comments he makes about himself--he didn't bother to keep in touch with his teacher even after promising he would, he harassed his brother as a child, he's a workaholic who doesn't pay enough attention to his wife and never got around to starting a family.  Mitch sets himself up as a real jerk, and he never does anything to change my mind about that.  I had expected that as the book went on and Morrie dispensed his advice, Mitch would begin to change his personality.  Instead I get the impression that if his newspaper hadn't been on strike, Mitch never would have made the time on Tuesdays to visit his old professor at all.  If Mitch's life wasn't changed by the slow death of his favorite college teacher, why would I expect my life would be when reading about it?
B000301YY8|1.0|It would be nice if what we hear on the radio matched what we thought we were buying.  I pitched the cd because I can't play \\"You're Beautiful\\" in front of my kids.

B000AWYOG4|2.0|When I heard that this US remake was based on a Japanese horror I was very hopeful that it would be a good, scary film like The Ring or The Grudge. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver on all fronts. <br /> <br />The plot is too much like The Ring or countless other recent horror films which concern a tragic person who dies and subsequently tries to contact the living. This theme has been explored to death in horror movies for the last thirty years or so e.g. Ghost Story, What Lies Beneath, The Changeling, The Ring, The Grudge etc etc. <br /> <br />My main objection to Dark Water was that it was just not scary. There are only one or two sudden shock moments and even they are not fantastic. Jennifer Connolly is a competent actress and has an impressive CV but unfortunately , this is a stain on it. The actress who played her daughter was excellent but the material was weak. <br /> <br />I would have to question some of the loose ends in the plot that are never resolved. It's very sloppy indeed e.g. what was Dougray Scott doing talking to the two deliquents who were harassing Connolly in the apartment ? What was the point to the Tim Roth lawyer character ? <br /> <br />This film seemed promising at the beginning but I am afraid that it didn't amount to enough of a scare and there was far to much vagueness <br />to satisfy anyone at the end.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|The good:  <br />I got the Swivel Sweeper as a Christmas present and for the 1st 6 months or so, it worked great. I loved it. It was light and portable for those smaller vacuuming jobs.  <br /> <br />The bad:  <br />The handle is a bit flimsy and feels like it would break if you're not careful.  <br /> <br />After about 6 months, it stopped working. It would work for about 5 minutes and then stopped. If I turn it off and wait for a minute or so and turned it back on, it would work again for a minute and then stopped. So frustrating.  <br /> <br />The ugly:  <br />I emailed the company, Ontel, and got no response. I called them and was given the standard line of \\"Our warranty is only for 90 days. You need to contact the store you bought it from.\\" I told them that it's been 6 months, no store was going to take it back and it was a gift. I asked if they knew about the problem since it seems to be a common problem and has been written online by other users. They said they knew but there's nothing they can do about it.  <br /> <br />Conclusion:  <br />Buy this product if you think $40 for 6 months of usage is a good deal, otherwise, save your money. The product is obviously defective and the company knows about it but won't do anything to reimburse customers and the customer service is non-existent. <br />
B0000024LN|4.0|...it's album number 3!!! Now let me say this, I didn't pick up on Redman until about 2003. This is because I didn't really get into Hip-Hop until about '98/'99. So, when I started seriously getting into the music, which was about '01/'02, I already had this image set of Red as a novelty actor from How High. <br /> <br />   Little did I know that Red was one of the most clever, hard hitting rappers ever. <br /> <br />   This was the first Red album I picked up, and I must say his best album to date. The production set down by Eric Sermon(of EPMD fame) and Redman shine throughout the whole album, and the lyrics are on point as well. I can't think of one track were Red's rhymes don't meld seamlessly with the beat. In fact, the whole Def Squad camp shines bright, with Keith Murray and Jamal showing up at the CD's end. The only thing that brings this CD down are the skits, which are funny the first few times, but after a while you hit 'skip' on your player. <br /> <br />   The stand-out tracks on this album include \\"Iz He 4 Real\\", \\"Whateva Man\\", \\"Do What Ya Feel\\", and \\"Yesh Yesh Y'all\\". <br /> <br />   So at the end of it all, we have a rapper who isn't afraid to take himself too seriously, and spits pure fire over P-Funk beats. Pick up this CD as soon as you can. <br /> <br />
B0000A98ZP|3.0|This seems to be on everyone's list as the most definitive film of the 80's, that film to describe the youth of the generation and it's been hailed as the greatest high school movie ever made.  Beings that I wasn't born until the year this film was released my idea of high school life finds no merit in this film whatsoever and I in no way shape or form can relate.  Thus I can't agree with the above statement. <br /> <br />The film is about a group of kids from all walks of life getting stuck in detention one Saturday.  None of them are friends and most of them can't stand each other but by the end of the day they realize that they are all alike in many ways and become close friends.  There's Andy (Estevez) the jock and Brian (Hall) the brain and John (Nelson) the bully and Claire (Ringwald) the rich girl and Allison (Sheedy) the weird girl.  Under the strict watch of Principal Richard Vernon (Gleason) the group is commanded to stay silent and write a paper explaining who they are. <br /> <br />The problem is none of them really know who they are. <br /> <br />The premise of the film is a good one and holds promise for a great movie, and I feel that if it were tackled now it would hold a lot more weight.  To me the majority of the acting was overacted and came across forced and amateur, but then again, acting has improved so much over the course of 20+ years.  That's not in anyway meant to slam this movie.  It's hard to judge a movie like this critically since it's so well loved and praised by the general public, but I have to be honest and say that I expected a little more, with all the hype that is.  After I finished watching it I asked a bunch of my friends (all of whom are in their 30's) what they thought of this film and none of them cared for it. <br /> <br />So I guess it wasn't just me. <br /> <br />A word of advise...if you're not a child of the 80's, and I mean that as in `if you weren't a high school student during the 80's' then you won't get out of thismovie all that you are meant to.  Sure, the moral still holds weight today and it's a subject (the whole acceptance thing and learning to find common grounds and not judging others just because their different than you...) that needs to be addressed...I just think it's been addressed in better ways before.  Oh well, to each his own I always say...one mans trash is another mans treasure. <br /> <br />Was that harsh?
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer's new cd is a diamond in the rough among a whole slew of other music/cd/albums. Each song is masterfully crafted, lyrics more meaningful than ever, and everytime you hear this album you wonder how he knows about our lives so well. Every song (yep that's right) is high quality and a classic. It's like John Mayer producing a Greatest Hits album... only these songs are completely new. Don't take my word for it. Go out there and listen/buy this cd. It's a must-have! No disappointments.
B000G75AE8|3.0|I tried to love this CD because it is the return of Dave Lombardo but it just leaves almost NO impression on me. Kerry King has been writing most of the Slayer material for the past decade and quite frankly I think it is dry and uninteresting. Jeff Hanneman was the driving force behind the great days of Slayer and I don't know if he is just getting bored with the band or if he has lost his magic for writing great songs. Jeff has abondoned most of the song writing leaving King in charge. Sorry Kerry, but you are a subpar song writer at best. Your lyrics are juvenile and your wah guitar leads are annoying. I have a feeling that unless Jeff Hanneman gets inspired to write some new material we are doomed to listen to Kerry King's C level version of Slayer. JEFF WHERE ARE YOU????
B00000JQFM|5.0|Joe Satriani is unquestionably one of the greatest rock guitarists of all time.  He influenced as many guitarists as he was influenced by, and manages to set the standard for creativity and technical prowess in the world of instrumental guitar rock.  When this album was released back in '87, it was unique and unlike anything else being played at the time.  Sure, guitar-shredding was fairly popular, with technicians like Yngwie Malmsteen, Tony MacAlpine, and Vinnie Moore receiving due credit in the world of neoclassical rock, but there was little variation between these artists and their lightning-speed scales, arpeggios and clasically inspired licks.   <br /> <br />Joe Satriani managed to release an album which was fresh, powerful and varied.  Instead of sticking to one approach for every song the way Yngwie or MacAlpine did, Joe wrote each song as an individual piece of music with its own vibe, message and unique quality.  He shows a great deal of restraint, tying his songs together with strong, well-constructed melodies and riffs that can be soloed over or improvised on to create a fluid, progressive piece of music.  Every song on this album is a winner, and what makes them work so well together is their differences of style but consistency of quality.  No track is alike or could be mistaken for another, but they are all incredible in their own way. <br /> <br />1) Surfing With the Alien - Awesome track that's all over the place.  It features some of the album's flashiest playing, with especially exciting tapping and bluesy riffs.  It isn't the absolute greatest song on here, but it makes for a fine introductory piece of what's to come. (8/10) <br /> <br />2) Ice 9 - A funky, infectious song with lead guitar playing somewhat reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix, only more futuristic-sounding.  As with much of his material, Satch starts out slow and builds up to balls-out shredding.  Satch loves to experiment with a variety of guitar tones and sounds, and this song is the perfect showcase for his creative abilities. (8.5/10) <br /> <br />3) Crushing Day - This could be my favorite song on the album, and is definitely one of my favorite Satriani songs of all time.  The main melody/lead riff in this song is simply perfect.  It's emotional yet driving, and filled with energy that only Satch could deliver.  The song also features some awesome soloing and great rhythm guitar.  Satriani's tone sounds simply amazing here. (9.5/10)   <br /> <br />4) Always With Me, Always With You - Here is another excellent, trademark Satriani song which has become a favorite among listeners, including myself.  It's more subdued than some of the faster songs on here, and features a \\"brown sound\\" lead guitar tone comparable to Van Halen, soloing with lush melodies over a clean rhythm section.  The overall feel of it is warm, passionate and electrifying. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />5) Satch Boogie - This isn't my favorite song on the album, but it's still quite cool.  It's very energetic and filled with rapid-fire blues bends and artificial harmonics.  The rhythm section, as the title suggests, is pure boogie blues.  The way Satch soloes over the rhythm section is what makes this song appealing--he uses finger-tapping, neoclasiscal sounding scales and phrasing, along with straight ahead blues-rock to give the song a sense of immediacy and impulsivity.  It's a fast, ruthless song which fits in well with the collection.  (8/10) <br /> <br />6) Hill of the Skull - Here is the album's first most unique song, and also one of its two shortest.  Clocking in at under 2 minutes, the song is a brief foray into brooding, atmospheric territory.  It actually would have been cool if the song were more progressive and lengthier, but it works well as a miniature experiment, all the same.  It features some of the most heartfelt, classically influenced melodies on the album, but still manages to sound incredibly original.  No shredding here, just slow, dirging guitar melody and a similarly grave rhythm section.  (8.5/10) <br /> <br />7) Circles - A cool, laid back rhythm intro erupts into pounding, distorted riffs and frenzied lead guitar work.  Joe Satriani's lead guitar tone sounds in fine form here.  The song switches back to the mellow vibe that it started out with.  (8.5/10) <br /> <br />8) Lords of Karma - Kind of a strange, mysterious song which sounds deliciously 80's, but has that trademark space-age Satriani sound to it which is present through this album.  Here is a great example of why Satriani was so ahead of his time with this album--there is no other song or artist that I can think of to compare this particular song to.  Even the name is original.  The soloing is, of course, pretty similar to other shred-fare seen during the 80's, only slightly more fluid and progressive.  Satriani knows what he's doing.  (9/10) <br /> <br />9) Midnight - The shortest track on the album, this song starts out a bit like Eddie Van Halen's Spanish Fly.  The clean tapping sounds amazingly smooth and bell-like.  After the Spanish Fly reminiscent intro, the song gets slightly more brooding with the addition of keyboard and rhythm section.  It returns to the classical-sounding guitar tapping.  Awesome little track.  (8.5/10) <br /> <br />10) Echo - As the album's closer, this one is expected to be great, which it is.  It's one of the album's highlights, and manages to incorporate just about every element which makes Satriani's playing excellent.  It's more serious and contemplative than something like the title track of Satch Boogie, but is still a showcase for Joe's technical abilities.  It's the album's longest song, and the most progressive, giving a real sense of journey and evolution over the course of 5 and a half minutes.  As expected, it sounds fresh and futuristic, combining simple elements in an unusual and amazingly skilled manner to produce a completely original work.  (9.5/10) <br /> <br />This is a must-have album, and despite its short length, is still one of the best values for anyone willing to spend money on a cd these days.  In 37 minutes, Joe covers more ground than most guitarists cover in their entire careers.  The album has been around for 20 years and it doesn't sound a bit dated.
B000021Y77|5.0|I use to work for a music store in SF that also sold and rented DVD's so I've seen my fair share of films including many foreign films and this by far is my favorite. I rented it and then immediately purchased it and forced my roommate and friends to watch it. Some were skeptical, but they all loved it. <br /> <br />Truly a one of a kind movie and it certainly does Not need to be remade.  Lola was also the inspiration for my cat's name. I spent days musing over names and was still undecided. Then out of sheer desperation I turned to my ever growing DVD collection and scanned over every title for a possible name until I landed on this one. It was/is a perfect fit. <br /> <br />Even if you don't usually like foreign films I think you should give this one a look. Though if you become a Franka Potente fan because of it and want more then please steer clear of one of her other films The Princess and the Warrior. In addition to Run Lola Run I rather like her in the Bourne Identity.
0060920084|2.0|My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.<br /><br />Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one.
B00005ATQH|4.0|When people tell me that this film doesn't follow the novel I like to point out that Nabokov wrote much of the screenplay for this film and he completely approved of the final product, so you can't tell me this film doesn't follow his intentions.<br /><br />This film is very different from the 1997 version. It is really a dark comedy whereas Adrian Lyne's version was a drama. It doesn't have a lot of emotion until near the very end, but it does really touch on the moral and ethical issues that the book raises.<br /><br />Kubrick approaches the subject matter delicately, partially I think because of what was allowed on the screen at that time, but it is exactly what the film needed. The physical relationship between Humbert and Lolita is not really the important part of the story; its<br /><br />really about motives and subtext.<br /><br />Humbert in this film is very sneaky, conniving and manipulative. There is scene where he is reading Charlottes love letter and laughing uncontrollably, and yet he ends up marrying her anyway to get closer to Lolita. This is really who Humbert is at his core. And yet by the end of the film we see that what was initially obsession with Lolita has turned to genuine love. He is a character that shocks us a bit, and yet at the same time we sympathize with his predicament.<br /><br />Sue Lyon gave a much more nuanced performance than Dominique Swain (who just came across as a spoiled brat). Her dual role as an immature yet crafty young girl is spot on.<br /><br />Although James Mason and Sue Lyon give great performances, it is the two supporting characters that really deserve the most praise. Shelly Winters as Charlotte plays the lonely but annoying and overbearing mother to perfection. Peter Sellers is hilarious as Quilty; I think he always did best when he was playing multiple characters with disguises and foreign accents.<br /><br />Overall this film was well done and closer I think to the spirit of the book even if it didn't follow the plot exactly. I like it as much as the Adrian Lyne version, but for entirely different reasons. If only someone could combine the best parts of these two films into one.ollow the plot exactly.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|I've got my share of problems with George Lucas - all the usual ones. I absolutely love the original three movies. I love the story, the effects, the way the movies take me back to my childhood - above all, the original trilogy was extremely fun. I've never seen the prequels, and I never will. When I thought the updated dvd versions of the originals were all we'd ever get, I bought them, and I regretted it. I hated the CGI (above all I couldn't stand the added scene with Jabba; and the desert sequence in Return of the Jedi looks more like a video game than a movie) because they were distracting and very fake looking. Star Wars didn't look like Star Wars anymore.<br /><br />Because I don't have a special wide-screen tv, and I have no real need for all the bells and whistles of super-duper surround sound, I decided to go ahead and buy these new releases with the original movies. What a wonderful relief it was to see the movies I loved again.<br /><br />The oddest thing for me was how much more realistic the then-ground-breaking, now \\"primitive\\" special effects look than the CGI. They fit the tone of the movie better, especially the explosion of the Death Star, and all around take me back to when Star Wars was the greatest thing in the world. Instead of saying \\"look how fake that CGI looks,\\" I'm back to saying \\"isn't it incredible what Lucas was able to do in 1977!\\"<br /><br />If you like the prequels, the newer versions are probably great for you. The six movies fit together, the new Anakin shows up in Jedi, and I suppose that continuity is nice to have. I therefore don't mind that the updated versions exist. They're just not for me. I wouldn't colorize Casablanca, and I wouldn't CGI Star Wars.<br /><br />Whether Lucas caved to fan pressure, responding to a demand, or he's just out for more money, I wouldn't speculate. The result is the same: We've got our Star Wars back. And I, for one, am glad to have it.
B000AADYYO|5.0|The phrase \\"progressive death metal\\" has been used before, but it probably fits Opeth better than any other single band. Opeth are much more than a Metal band, They are a five man orchestra. Even when the music gets heavy it still holds a form of ambience untouched by fellow Death Metal bands. So melodic yet so brutal all in one dose. Opeth are truely pioneers among the metal scene friends!<br /><br />Ghost Reveries begins with a moment of mellow guitar and tranquil peace, But the moment is soon over as the crushing riff of the instant classic 'Ghost Of Perdition' take the stage. This song alone is worth getting the CD, with several tempo changes and at about 2:34 into the song comes my favorite melodic piece of any Opeth song EVER.<br /><br />Mikael Åkerfeldt is an amazing vocalist. Looking at him you would easily be decieved as he looks like an every day joe. But beneath that moustache and down that throat lie two of the greatest lungs in the history of Metal. The man has a great Death Metal growl, Which is normally audible. And his 'clean' vocals are to die for, He hits some very hard to achieve notes. This is truely one of the great Metal Vocalists that shall always be remembered and always respected.<br /><br />Another of my favorite tracks is 'Atonement'. A soft gentle track with mezmerizing guitar and a beat that could put a crying baby to sleep. The reason I like it is because it stands out so well against all the powerful chugging riffs. That and Mikael truely shows talent here, some very charming and almost enchanting vocals.<br /><br />I have to give credit to bassist Martin Mendez. I am a bassist and this guy plays some excellent B-Lines, Especially on easily the two most popular tracks 'Ghosts of Perdition' and yet another of my own favorites The Grand Conjuration, A track that reeks of \\"progressive death metal\\" from the get go with the headbang worthy riffs and inspiring drum blasts. Another thing that makes this a favorite is Mikael's constant changing vox from clean soft harmonous vocals to harsh audible growls.<br /><br />People I can not stress enough how truely important it is for Metal Fans world wide to hear this album. This band has defined what it is to be a \\"progressive death metal\\" band and have set the bar for fellow bands. Also I just seen these guys play live at Gigantour in Detroit. Simply.. Amazing I would advise you all to do whatever you must to get to see these guys live!<br /><br />Mikael Åkerfeldt and Devin Townsend are the only Metal Vocalists I would gladly knell and bow my head to if they were before me. Support the scene and buy this great album, and please click YES if you took the time to read my review. If nothing else it kept your intrest for a couple moments.<br /><br />-A Loyal Opeth Fannt changing vox from clean soft harmonous vocals to harsh audible growls. <br /> <br />People I can not stress enough how truely important it is for Metal Fans world wide to hear this album.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|This is like early Black Sabbath for the 21st Century, only lacks Tony Iomis soaring guitar solos.  If you loved Iron Man, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, this is the album for you.  Check out the website too, very cool.  The tracks will grow on you, but Witchcraft and Joker and the Thief really stand out.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie. At first I was a bit confused by the polarity of the reviews here; it seems like people (in general) are giving this flick either 1 star or 5. This film was great to me because I could relate to much of what Napolean was going through. I was pretty good with a bo staff. I drew goofy stuff like \\"Ligers.\\"<br /><br />Popular kids don't really understand the unpopular kids too well, and vice-versa. It would be very hard for me to imagine a dork growing up and not loving this film.
0062515675|5.0|One of the best books I have read... ever! Other books can be too clinical in their aqpproach meaning you forget what the book is trying to tell you far too quickly. This book is NOT one of those. It's story-like approach is innovative and the lessons you learn about life sink in readily and are not forgotten by the next page.  <br /> <br />Definitely a recommended title. I am going to buy every other Robin Sharma book as a result!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|i dont understand what the point of this boxed set is. dont get me wrong i love the show friends. in fact just last year i bought the entire gift set that came in the black box with the glass door with all 10 seasons. i just dont understand why in 1 year, warner brothers would release it again just in a different packaging. friends ended quite a while ago and most ppl who really like the show probably already own all ten seasons by now. in fact ppl were complaining about that last year saying that it was unfair to loyal fans to release the boxed set with the glass door because many fans already had all the seasons. i give it a 5 just cuz i like the show but otherwise the only purpose of this set is for the company to make more money. <br /> <br />
0316172324|4.0|this book has some really interesting segments that were entertaining to read, and good for casual conversations as everyone else ive mentioned parts of it too is also interested. however, i was expecting to gain a much more profound or higher understanding of the subject...enhance my consciousness i suppose.  this is not gained by reading the book.  entertainment value only, and somewhat informational.  good for someone wanting to do their own research into this subject and take it further as this book should have done.
0143034901|5.0|This book was recoommended to me by a spanish freind and he did not let me down. This book starts out with a Harry Potter for adults type of atmosphere. It progresses to a thriller and mystery. If your the type that trys to solve the mystery before it's done, or your one of those horrible people that makes a point of proving your clevor by shouting out what you guess the ending of a movie is- then you may not enjoy it as much as the pateint person that is ready to be trasported into a dark and seductive Barcelona.<br /><br />  Sex, intrigue, murder, and horror- this book has nice sized portions of each. I had not read a book this pleasurable in so long that I was begining to forget you could have fun reading- in fact I forgot you could be scared by a book. It is an unfortunant shame that this author has not translated more of his books. I am truly tempted to learn spanish.  Anyone would enjoy this book- great to take on vacations or road trips. This authors style of writing creates such a vivid mental picture that it transports you into his world with out being overly wordy. Use this book as an escape!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Ok where to begin. I am some what astonished by the few reviews I have read for this album that have been negative (i.e. 2 stars or lower). Not because \\"oh these people are idiots, or this music is just to much for them\\" but precisely the opposite reason. There were a few reviews that were 2 stars or lower from people who wrote somewhat intelligent and thoughtful comments. My advice to these people is to just give this some time to sink in. I know that it is not above these people, and If they give it a few extra listens it will eventually catch them. <br /> <br />I first purchased Michigan, and gave it 2 full listens, and shared almost identical feelings with a few of these reviewers. \\"This music is technically good, but no soul, or passion\\", I remember thinking one time. On another occasion \\"This is good; in that his lyrics are ok, but not fantastic, music is composed well, but not groundbreaking, and at the end of the day, it just lacks the confrontation and balls that indie rock and rock in general should have!\\" \\"Why would anyone think this holds a candle compared to Arcade Fire?\\" I have certainly come around since then, and well yes, admittedly, it does not trump Arcade Fire, it is certainly not beyond reproach for some one to think differently. <br /> <br />All that being said, the scope of ideas contained with in Illinois encompass all that Michigan did, and then some. On top of that he pulls this off on an album that is much more fluid and seamless.  Often I will look up at my cdp to find the disc already on track 17 when I would have assumed it was on track 12. As I have become more familiar with this album, of course this has stopped happening since I know that \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back From The Dead!! Ahhhh!\\"is track 16 so obviously its past track 12 for instance. The whole point of this album is to display compositions and ideas in such an original way and keep us entertained well doing so to the point that at theend of it, we do feel transported to a different time and place. The astonishing thing here is that Sufjan pulls this off with such aplomb that it nearly seems effortless. <br /> <br />Get it, listen, then listen again, if it still hasn't struck you, let it lie around and when you are bored with music, throw it back on, and be prepared to enter a whole new world of ideas. Be prepared to enter Illinois! <br />
B000HEWEE4|2.0|The location shots are beautiful and interesting, and Sandra Bullock looks great, hence the two star rating.  I would be just as happy to look at a CD of still frames than be subjected to this one.    The plot is unforgivably predictable and not very interesting.  The dialog is halting, uneven, boring.  There are times when it looks like they've settled on the thirtieth take of a scene.  I'm sure that's because most of this film ended up on the cutting-room floor.  There is precious little character development, so it's difficult to care about what's happening.    This movie does have one irritating axe to grind: global warming.  It's peddled as though this theory were a foregone conclusion.  And the on-screen reason?  Because there's a 60-degree day in February.  Wow.  Does that mean that if we have a 45-degree day in June or September that we're in an ice age, or even heading into one?  This kind of pseudo-intellectual insincerity ruins movies for me.    The real stars of this chickflick had no dialog...the glass house and the (darn cute) dog.
0553579908|2.0|I gave \\"A Game of Thrones\\" a try because of it's good reviews and the fact that I had an opportunity to buy it for a great price. I liked the plot, and it had it's strong points and likeable characters, and the careful use of mystery and the unnatural was done in good taste. However, I most certainly disliked the use of bad language and the pointless, excessive sexual content. Still, I decided to read the sequal, hoping those irritating brushes of bad taste won't get in the way of the plot too much. <br />I was wrong. <br /> <br />As for the plot, in the first half of the book, there is hardly any plot. So much of it is wasted on sexual content. Any story progress is slow and the... \\"stuff\\" in between is terrible. The seconed half of it is far more rapid, and yet, it's not much, and the book's climax, the battle over King's Landing, is silly in the way it's resolved. There are some good points in this one, but the bad outweights the good.  <br /> <br />Reading it, you get the feeling that Martin got some good feedback about the use of bad language (from readers with terrible taste, if I may add), and as a result, the language here is nothing short of VILE- much, much more than the first book. In my mind, it's simply shows that George Martin is a jerk.If you would censore those parts, this 800 pages book will be rendered to a mere BOOKLET, and still not more than \\"ok\\". I believe that bad language and excessive sexual content has no place in fantasy novels. I adore J.R.R Tolkien for making the perfect example.  <br /> <br />Some argued that those themes are there because it's \\"just like real life\\". Please. It's not real life. It's fantasy- fantasy needs real logic, but the best thing about it is the ability to do without some of the negatives in our daily lives. If you include magic and dragons, you can write a book not filled with swears and disturbing content. Song of Ice and Fire is filled with prostitution, rape and debauchery, all are thick and often. I simply find it repulsive. <br /> <br />While the evil characters are smart, I truely think the good ones are simply unwise, making foolish decisions and ignore dangers. For those who are yet to read this one, think of the way Edard disregarded Arya's warning, when she tells him what she overheard in \\"a Game of Thrones\\". Martin likes his bad guys too much, granting them easy victories in what should be tough battles. Their enemies are always caught off-guard, which is guarannteed victory at minimal losses, in Martin's eyes. <br /> <br />Tyrion is the most frequently-used character in this one. This is bad news. Everything around him is swears and sex. A number of his chapters include him visiting his prostitute in her safehouse, arguably the most disgusting feature of this novel. And as for his character himself- it's nice that he has a sense of justice other Lannisters lack, but his main charactaristic is being smart. Well, not true. Tyrion has a number of brilliant ideas- in fields he should know NOTHING about, such as economics, battlefield strategies, leadership, fortifications(that part is story changing, and should not have been there), diplomacy (for a character which presents itself as undiplomatic)... you name it. <br /> <br />The most rdiculous part in when tyrion becomes a warrior- a fierce, frightening, inspiring fighter, and lives to tell the tale. That's not realistic at all, and makes no sense even in a fantasy novel. And that's Much, much stronger blow to the immerviveness than, say, not including the vile language and all that sexual content.  <br />Other evidence of poor writing is how he suddenly picks on a character named Lulis (in a cruel way) after she was never heard from, and how foolish it is that everything about house Florent is ugly\stuiped\ disgraceful. <br /> <br />The Night's Watch parts are better than the other ones, and contains less of this book's bads. Bran has some good part of interaction with two young members of a house loyal to Stark.His mother also is a good character with some good dialogs. Arya has a few good parts, but she is mostly with bad company that makes her chapters disturbing to read. Truely, I liked the childish point of view in the first one, as it was very well done and felt right. In \\"A Clash of Kings\\", half of what they are viewing is the debauchery around them, but when they are not, the young Starks are all likeable.Daenerys? in the first book all her chaptershave been disgusting. In this one it's not as bad, but it's not good, either. Greyjoy is a lousy edition, with all his chapters being extremly repulsive and soaked with swears. <br /> <br />To sum it up, I will say that \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" is a (widely) missed opportunity at creating a classic. The plot is disturbed by Martin's terrible taste in including (extremly) excessive sexual content and a language nothing short of vile. The story itself isn't nearly as good as the first one, and the climax is foolish. There is epic potential, but not an epic novel, and you just can't create a masterpiece with all this trashy parts. Some thing are better left out of the fantasy genre. (The shining example of classic, epic, wonderful litrature triumph is Tolkien's Lord of the Rings- as fantasy should be- beautiful, immersive and clean). <br /> <br />If you consider yourself readers with a good taste, stay away, especialy if you found his style even somewhat disturbing in the first book. It's repulsive and disturbing, the bad easily outweights the good. There are good books out there without all that vile content.   <br />I gave up on \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" after this one.
B00005R1N3|3.0|After seeing all the raving reviews for this movie just had to see it. Honestly I thought it was a bit overrated, but when you consider this is from 1974 before When a Stranger Calls or Halloween, this is actually an original for this genre.

B00005MP58|5.0|I saw this when it first came out on the BBC. (I lived in England)  I have to say it is one of those dramas that I will watch and watch and watch again.  I love the characters and I think that the casting is one of the best. Jane Austen of course must be given the credit of a great story.  But I commend the adaptation and staying true to the book.  I read the novel after watching the film and was amazed by how well it stuck to the story.  I love the settings and the views but I am an English country girl at heart so I would.  But it is a true love story that can bring hope that we can all find our own Mr. Darcy.

These pieces are grotesque caricatures of Mahler melodies and while I have not heard Caine's other depredations, after listening to this one I think I'll pass.  If this is something released after a jam session that somehow was rescued from the cutting room floor, my apologies.  But Mahler's melodies do not belong in a setting like this and who is Caine to try to improve on Mahler's orchestrations?   Save your money.

B00000IMTH|5.0|Read Darth Kommissar's 10MAR05 review for the low down on this album, I agree with everything he says.<br /><br />Back when I was 14 years old in 1978 I went to the Post Exchange on Patch Barracks in Stuttgart, West Germany and paid $5.25 for this album. Money well spent. A couple of years later I bought the cassette, years after that I bought the CD. Man...Blackmore and Dio really hooked me with this one. It's like audio crack to me.<br /><br />If this album only contained the two songs Long Live Rock And Roll and Kill The King it would still merit 5 stars.<br /><br />Kill The King is a masterpiece. Listen to that song with your headphones on and you still cannot play it loud enough even if your Walkman (opps...I'm old school) I-POD is at max volume. You'll be foaming at the mouth. It's like Rainbow's very own version of Breaking The Law by Priest. You want to smash something while listening to it. \\"He'll Rule No more!!\\"<br /><br />On Long Live Rock & Roll from the Cozy Powell (rest in peace bro) machine gun drum intro to Ronnie James Dio  howling ....\\"I can hear him screaming in my head, Long Live Rock And Roll!!!\\" you will be hearing Rainbow at it's headbanging peak. It's another song that will have you frothing at the mouth. As Ronnie says...\\"I'm looosing control\\" .....Oh yeah!<br /><br />I wish this Rainbow lineup had cranked out another album or two before they split. This album simply is the finest effort of the band known as Rainbow headed by Richie Blackmore.<br /><br />Ronnie James Dio...where are ya man?! Rock and roll needs you again dude. Make peace with Blackmore and tell him to ditch the minstrel gig. You build it and we'll come.<br /><br />You'll never be sorry you bought this album..opps..CD! Like I said, I'm old school.

I started reading this story because of the vast amounts of material found throughout Asian culture based on this novel.  I soon discovered the an amazing epic and soon, like all who have read this story before me, fell became a great fan of the story.  This translation is the better of the two and the footnotes are a very wonderful and nessisary addition to the story.  Do yourself a favore a pick this book up.  Trust me, you won't regret it!
B000026OHN|3.0|I love this music and Sviatoslav Richter is one of my favorite classical artists, but the quality of this recording is horrible and is so bad that the quality of both the performance (excellent!) or of the works themselves (wonderful!) can not be overcome by the quality of the sound.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|Eat A Peach, along with the live Fillmore album represents the Allman Brothers in all their power and glory.  Many would agree that, try as they might over the next three decades, they would never be able to shake the unfortunate death of brother Duane and recover that musical edge they had during the Fillmore days.  More than any other musical group from the south, they-along with The Grateful Dead, were the proto-typical jam band that could play on until doomsday and then comeback for an encore!  So we get the peach album and an extra disc of Fillmore concerts.  Technically they would probably be outtakes, since the best stuff was already culled for the Fillmore album just prior to Eat A Peach.  Still the original peach album seems to have been cleaned up a bit thereby lending \\"Les Brers In A Minor\\" more poignancy than before.  \\"Melissa\\" and \\"Little Martha\\" are very improved--you will swear the ghost of Duane is picking his guitar right next to your ear!  As for the live concerts, they are less murky--I always had a problem with the version of \\"Mountain Jam\\" on the Eat A Peach album, as it seemed to sound like what you would hear if your were listening to these guys with some ear plugs on.  That problem is fixed now of course.  As for the second disc, the songs are pretty much the same fare as the Fillmore, but (dramatic pause) also different. The sound quality on the second disc is also superior to what you may have heard in the past--you'd swear you were in the same room!
B000E41MRC|5.0|The aim  of the rallies and parades described here was to create dramatic impressions that overcame rationality and reached the emotions of participants. The adrenlin that must have been generated among the thousands at these rallies  and other Nazi events, probably could have filled an ocean. Wilhelm Reich's _Mass Pyschology of Fascism__ gives a very good analysis of this aspect of the Nazi party and its regime.<br /><br />The film captures the Sixth Congress of the Nazi party in 1934, the first after Hitler had come to office.  What also see is how the Nazis studied what the theater, the cinema, the church, and the pyschologists had learned about the use of pagentry, of light and darkness, of symbol and ceremony to craft their spectacles.<br /><br />I remember the first time I saw it, I watched it in solemn, silent awe, as impressed by its images as I was disgusted and terrified by what it documented.<br /><br />Leni Riefenstahl was a genius.  The film techniques used, the editing, the absence of any narration, and the way you are struck by the film despite the utterly disgusting spectacle that this film was, are great example of the what both creativity and technical achievement can produce.<br />It is a massive example of the central concept of dramatic art: SHOW DON'T TELL.<br /><br />The film was used not only as a propoganda piece around the world where it won many prizes, but as indoctrination in Germany itself. Every school child in Germany was forced to see this film with its marching storm troopers, its shreaking speaches by Hitler, Goebels, and other Nazi leaders, and its display of pagentry.<br /><br />  All of this was not by accident.  The congress came after a major crisis in the Nazi movement. The Nazis had always had a radical rhetoric, claiming to defend working people (The party's actual name was the German National Socialist Workers party) against the huge landowners, the bankers, the corporate plutocrats who had in fact bankrolled and managed Hitler's rise to power.  A radical wing of the party was concentrated in the SA, the storm troopers--the Nazi's gangs of organized thugs and street brawlers--, their leader, Ernst Roehm. After Hitler came to power in 1933 Roehm demanded a \\"second revolution\\" by the Nazis against the plutocrats.  Roehm demand a merger of the Army which was the lynch pin of the old Prussian Aristoracy and Germany's new capitalist magnates-- and the storm troopers be combined under the Roehm's leadership. Germany's ruling class threatened to replace Hitler, or, at least not allow him to succeed the ailing President Von Hindenberg, if Roehm and the other adherents of the \\"second revolution\\" were not crushed.<br /><br />  In June 1934 Hitler had hundreds of Storm Troopers including Roehm  murdered.  Roehm was replaced by Viktor Lutze, an insignificant police official and the SA was allowed to whither away.  Meanwhile. the SS, Protective Squadron, which had hitherto been Hitler's personal body guard was extended to become a large organization, fielding its own military divisions in the the Second World War.<br /><br />  The Sixth Nazi Congress shown in the _Triumph of the Will_  took place in September 1934, only a few months after the SA purge. Throughout the film you are continually seeing Viktor Lutze, you are continually seeing affirmations of loyalty by the Storm Troops, including a huge cermony in which tens of thousands of Storm Troppers swear allegiance to Hitler (Previously, these thugs swore to obey their unit commanders only). In the speech that concludes the Congress and the film, Hitler 's final point is that the two institutions that are the foundation of the new order in Germany are the Army and its aristocartic leadership and the Nazi party.<br /><br />The rally ratified loyalty to Hitler, loyalty to the course of serve the capitalists, the landowners, and the army after the Roehm purge.<br /><br />The splender of the triumph of the will, the marching thousands, the banners, the spotlights, the festivities of women, children, townspeople, and the brown shirted hordes, all was staging to ratify that the same old plutocrats and big landowners that Hitler had claimed to fight for the interest of Germany's people were still in the saddle.e, and the brown shirted hordes, all was staging to ratify that the same old plutocrats and big landowners that Hitler had claimed to fight for the interest of Germany's people were still in the saddle.
B000002LUB|4.0|As a Dio fan, This was a great album.  From a Sabbath point of view, I really liked the the prior two albums from Tony Martin (headless cross and TYR), and this was a change of pace back to a more Dio style music.  None the less, this is a great album From the group, overlooked by many. Time Machine is one of my favorite tracks with Dio at the Helm, but as the other reviewers point out, their are many good songs. I think part of the backlash on this album may be the fact it was promoted as a \\"reunion\\" type album, and Ozzy fans of sabbath had turned their back on the band long before, and this was one more slap in their faces reuniting a band they didn't like.  Hence people may have bad-mouthed it, and thus sales didn't do as great.  This reunion unfortunately ended reportedly ended when ozzy reunited briefly with Black Sabbath for a couple of dates (available on Ozzy's Live and loud) at a benifit concert. Dio left reportedly mad having to open for Ozzy...And interestingly enought, Rob Halford of judus priest stepped in on vocals for a couple of songs, and reportedly has sang a couple of sabbath songs when he was touring with his solo band because of the incident.  Anyway, check this album out, A return of Sabbath to the Dio perfected sound, heavy and lyrical/vocal.

B000GIXEIG|5.0|Beowulf <br /> Finally, someone does a respectable interpretation of one of the most important pieces of Western European literature!  If you can get past Beowulf's witch Selma's respective Scottish and American accents, as well as some modern turns of phrase in the Danish dialogue, then raise your flagon of beer up high, for the rest of the film will be clear sailing.  Those who had to read this epic in school (and who didn't??), and those who actually read it in Middle English for enjoyment in college (like myself  . . . ) will be grateful to know that the film is pretty faithful to the book.  Ok, there is the witch, but they weren't really that uncommon back then.  Most of them pretty much were outcasts who lived on the fringes of a community anyhow--although few were probably as desirable as Selma.  There is also some revisionism going on, most particularly with Grendel-and it is here that director Gunnarsson can't be praised enough.  Through Grendel we have the conflux of monster/hero, myth, truth, and the legend that gets made from truth, even while the truth is unfolding at the moment--watch the bard in the movie and you'll see.  There is also some nice historical background that mattes the picture-you can see how the blood oath/vengeance shaped much of that culture for the time; the first inroads Christianity was making into Scandinavia; and some references to parallel historical threads, namely Clovis of the Franks.  My only criticism is of not including the final part of Beowulf's life.  It would have been nice to have seen this part because it is in a way more political and true to life--an exceptional charismatic figure holds a kingdom together by force of will and then the kingdom disintegrates upon his death; that and there was a good dragon fight as well, but that's another story for another time.  The extras respectable.  I liked the one deleted scene of the Christian priest ranting at the Danes as he's sailing into their community to Christianize them.  A final thank you should go to Anchor Bay for continually turning out some fine DVDs of some of the most obscure past films past and some great mainstream films that somehow would have fallen through the cracks of being released.   <br />
B000HIVQK8|5.0|Nice box, nice package.<br /><br />The booklet could be better.  (Mine has the booklet cover stapled onto the booklet upside down, but no big deal; too much trouble to ship it back for that.)  But it could have better pix in it, imho.  The lyrics in the booklet are nice to have and especially the comments on some of the songs, by George.<br /><br />The sound qulaity?  Well, it did not \\"knock me out\\".  I listened to the original - in mp3 no less - recently, and frankly I don't think they did anything astounding with the remastering.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I'll have to compare it side by side.  It does sound good, anyway.<br /><br />The bonus disc in the \\"limited edition\\": The 5.1 of the Japanese concert performance is excellent.  This is the best part of the bonus disc.  I only wish they'd have included several more like this.<br /><br />The Miss O'Dell here is better and I wish they'd have put this one on the main disc and the other one on the bonus disc, instead.<br /><br />The Sue Me, Sue You version here is great, and this plus the 5.1 concert version of Give Me Love makes it worth buying the dvd version, for the hard core George fan.<br /><br />Overall, the bonus disc is nice, but it could have been better.  I think they were a little stingy with the material on the bonus disc.  $9 extra for one real 5.1 live performance, and 2 extra songs (Sue Me Sue You and Miss O'Dell) with animation?  Not exactly a great value.  The \\"Material World\\" \\"video\\" is not a different version of the song, but rather, a music video which goes back and forth between the studio version of the song to a poor recording of it as the record pressing factory guy listens to it.  Interesting idea, but not great for listening.  Okay for watching once or twice...<br /><br />Overall, I ALMOST wish I hadn't gotten the cd+dvd package.  I expected it to be better.  But being a George fan, I will try to burn the bonus tracks and copy them onto a new copy of the main disc with the bonus tracks included.<br /><br />What I do wish is that they had just put the bonus tracks on the regular cd and given us a good cd package for the money.  The dvd itself doesn't offer much.  The live performance is quite good but it does not make it worth it, alone.  If they'd have included, say, THREE songs from the concert, in 5.1, it would have made it worth it.<br /><br />As to the album itself, it's a good album, and having good clean versions of Miss O'Dell and Deep Blue are worth buying it for.<br /><br />I'm probably just being picky.  It's a good package, overall.  I just think the limited edition could have been a little more worthy of the extra money.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Great album by a great singer/songwriter.ks included. <br /> <br />What I do wish is that they had just put the bonus tracks on the regular cd and given us a good cd package for the money.

0593055489|4.0|Dawkins has done the important work of attempting to return analysis and critical thought to the discourse on God and society.  It sounds the alarm without the kind of alarmism that dulls the urgency and with a generous dose of good humor.  His work is a necessary, and urgent, popular corrective to the current state of \\"forgetfulness\\" in which the intellectual heavy-lifting of the past several hundred years has been cast aside in favor of the emotionally palatable but deeply flawed fundamentalist answers to the problem of man.<br /><br />What Dawkins does particularly well is isolate the \\"unnaturalness\\" of belief in a deity, any deity -and how such belief flies in the face of reason and the evidence of the natural world.  He resets the debate to its necessary starting point: a world without God as the a priori principle.  His habit of empiricism reminds us that society is running the risk of inverting the model when it comes to God and society.  In such a world -regressive and possibly even theocratic-- anyone who actually thinks will be at risk -but such a world will never arrive if Dawkins stays around.<br /><br />Of course, this valuable book takes us only as far as reason, empiricism and wit can.  The \\"unreasonable\\" aspects of man are central to the question of God and persistent belief in him/her/it.  Indeed, the \\"unreasonable\\" is central to all problematic human phenomena (e.g., romantic love).  Dawkins' tendency to lampoon the obvious folly of fundamentalism at times runs the risk of overlooking how the seemingly sane and empirically-minded can believe in God.  One recent book that explores this more subtle ground is The Collar by Jonathan Englert.  In it, the reader goes inside a Catholic seminary and is introduced to second-career Catholic seminarians who are at ease with a scientific worldview.  It is unlikely Englert's intention, but The Collar is a welcome companion to Dawkins by exploring in an exciting, nonfiction journey the fascinating topography left unsurveyed by the God Delusion and Sam Harris' two works on the subject.hy left unsurveyed by the God Delusion and Sam Harris' two works on the subject.  <br />
B000059T5O|2.0|After 39 reviews, I have some doubts about any beneficial effects the 40th may have, but I feel so strongly about this disc that I decided to weigh in anyway.<br /><br />Pretty straightforward, really: Tom Waits is a musical genius. John Hammond is a great blues guitarist, and a very good singer.<br /><br />Didn't they listen to this CD before they released it?<br /><br />Except for the passing novelty of hearing some of Tom's (deliberately) incomprehensible growling translated into english, this disc has very little to offer.<br /><br />You know that sensation you get when you hear a really great song performed as elevator music?<br /><br />Bingo.
0316926345|5.0|There is little new to say of this book other than to mention what an excellent light it sheds on Waugh's other, very different books.  Although dismissed by Waugh as the product of Spam and blackouts (wartime privations), Brideshead endures because of its superb structure, characterizations and ultimately heart.  It is this last feature which gives evidence of the human depths that inform all of Waugh's novels even those whose satire keeps these depths at a clinical distance.

B000002BMV|5.0|THE BAND: Steve Perry (vocals), Neal Schon (guitars, vocals), Jonathan Cain (keyboards, guitar), Ross Valory (bass), Steve Smith (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1981) 10 tracks clocking in at just under 43 minutes. This 22-bit digitally remastered version released in 1996. Included with the disc is a 4-page foldout with original black & white artwork, song titles/credits, song lyrics, and thank you's. All songs written by Perry, Schon & Cain (except \\"Who's Crying Now\\" and \\"Open Arms\\" by Perry & Cain). This is Journey's 7th album. Recorded at Fantasy Studios, Berkeley, CA. Cover artwork by famed album illustrator Stanley Mouse. Label - Columbia.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Journey had a string of very good albums with Steve Perry at the vocal helm with \\"Infinity\\" (1978), \\"Evolution\\" (1979) and \\"Departure\\" (1980). However, with \\"Escape\\" (or \\"E5C4P3\\" as it's written on the album cover), Journey reached new heights. Journey was now a global force and a soon-to-be huge arena draw. \\"Escape\\" reached #1 on the pop album charts, as well as #139 on Billboard's Top 200 of the same year. This album is the band's 2nd best seller with 9+ million units sold... only their \\"Greatest Hits\\" album has sold more (14+ million units). The album had 3 huge hits with \\"Open Arms\\" (#2 on the Pop Singles/Mainstream Rock charts), \\"Who's Crying Now\\" (#4), \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (#8)... and more success with \\"Still They Ride\\" (#19). On Journey's 2-disc \\"Essential\\" (2001) release, 7 of the 10 songs from \\"Escape\\" are featured. I'm actually surprised that leaders Perry & Schon let newcomer Cain come in and have so much influence over an album (Cain had co-writing duties on all 10 songs). To me, \\"Escape\\" featured less rock, and more pop. Much more keyboards and piano (thanks to Cain) than any of their previous albums. Not that I liked or disliked it anymore than previous albums, \\"Escape\\" just had a different feel to it. Some will say \\"sell out\\", but I say it's simply slick, polished, and well written - and if there was ever a Journey album geared more toward the ladies... \\"Escape\\" was it. I've always leaned toward the harder rock songs from Journey's catalog... and ballads like \\"Open Arms\\" (and later \\"Faithfully\\") did absolutely nothing for me. \\"Escape\\" featured some great faster songs... \\"Stone In Love\\", the title track, \\"Keep On Runnin'\\", and \\"Lay It Down\\". Schon's guitar work - rhythm and lead - are the highlights as usual (check out \\"Stone In Love\\" - featuring a blistering solo in the middle and another lengthy one to end the song). Steve Smith's drumming was on par with any rock drummer of the time. \\"Escape\\" finds Journey at their all-time commercial peak. Great songs... a classic disc (5 stars).here was ever a Journey album geared more toward the ladies... \\"Escape\\" was it.

B00006V9A0|3.0|This is merely a fistful of Nirvana's most overplayed songs thrown together on a CD. It doesn't flow well as an album and isn't really a great selection of songs either. About half came from In Utero and I would highly recommend that you purchase that instead. It flows infinitely better and consequently the same songs sound better on it. Also, it has the electric version of \\"All Apologies\\" whereas this has the unplugged, which isn't as effective in my opinion. <br /> <br />If you are looking to listen to all those Nirvana songs you keep hearing on the radio every couple of hours in one sitting, this album is for you. If you're looking for an album that is more than the sum of is parts and a good representation of Nirvana's talents, look elsewhere.

B000002OR4|5.0|Of the many great scores John Williams has penned, this one is, for me, the finest single soundtrack he has ever written.  Itzak Perlman plays emotional, tragic, heartbreaking violin solos throughout this album.  The music on the whole is beautiful, thoughful, often sad, but always excellent.  There are also several tracks that are heavily influenced by Jewish music, which sound great and round out the album nicely.  This is a great score, and in my opinion, the finest music Williams has ever written.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|From the first bars of this CD, even an undiscerning ear can tell that this is no teeny-bopper pop music album.  Having already taken home Grammy Awards for \\"Song of the Year\\" and \\"Best Male Pop Vocal Performance\\" (twice), Mayer sets his sights on new categories with this album, which is reminiscent of old-time soul and blues, with just a touch of his pop background for flavor.<br /><br />The excellent guitar work makes this album even more remarkable, and Mayer proves that he has matured as an artist since his last solo studio album, \\"Heavier Things\\", in 2003. Even the mush-mouthed vocals of the past have cleared up, making the lyrics sound even more meaningful.  Mayer puts a lot into this album, singing, playing the guitar, writing all but one of the songs, and even producing it, and it's obvious that he's proud of his efforts.<br /><br />The first single is \\"Waiting for the World to Change\\" a soulful track where he finds his inner Curtis Mayfield, but the one that got repeat plays from me was \\"The Heart of Life\\", one of the best songs on the album.  Listen also to \\"I Don't Trust Myself (With Loving You)\\" (reminds me of the Doobie Brothers); \\"Stop This Train\\"; \\"Bold As Love\\"; \\"I'm Gonna Find Another You\\"; and \\"In Repair\\" (my third favorite).  Jimi Hendrix fans will also appreciate the cover of \\"Bold As Love\\".<br /><br />Maturity sure sounds good on John Mayer<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 29, 2006
0140544518|5.0|This is a wonderful, delightful and simply funny off take on the old three little pigs story.  It is told by the wolf and the story is through his eyes.  Now whether you choose to believe his story or not, is completely up to you.  The wolf is able to tell a pretty convincing tale, but you just don't really know.  This story could be pulled from the newspaper of any of our large city papers today.  The author has a true wit about his writing that is appealing to both  young and old.  The art work is great and fits quite well with the text.  Recommend this one quite highly.
0307346609|5.0|Despite its absurd premise, World War Z is one of the most compelling novels I've read in a long time.  As other reviewers have already written, the book (inspired by Stud's Terkel's The Good War) is constructed as to present the seemingly true accounts of the survivors of a fictional zombie war that nearly destroyed humanity.  These first person narratives tell the tale of the war from its origins in Asia where the zombies were first encountered to the aftermath and clean-up across the globe.  Brooks offers accounts from survivors from many classes and cultures in order to present a broad spectrum of the \\"war\\".  Each story is poignant in its own way, and truly gripping. <br /> <br />One of the entertaining conceits of the work is that Brooks references events in our current time, but it is impossible to tell when exactly they occur within the timeframe of the novel.  We know that World War Z takes place in the \\"near future\\", but just when exactly that is is up for debate.  It was fun to try to identify the politicians and celebrities the author alluded to in the many vignettes.  However, due to the lack of absolute details and elision of all names, one cannot make a positive ID on anyone.  Still, it was fun imagining just who he was talking about! <br /> <br />To comment on some of the poor reviews for the book:  While I believe Brooks does in fact have liberal leanings, I don't believe he infused World War Z with far left political views.  I would urge anyone who thinks he's bashing a specific political group (read:  GOP) to go back and re-read the portions that ostensibly do that.  I challenge anyone to truly pin down which party he is blaming.  As I already mentioned, the allusions to politicians/administrations are intentionally vague.  The narratives can certainly be read to lambast either party, and that's at least, how I chose to interpret them.  So for anyone with a political chip on their shoulder, brush it off before reading the book. <br /> <br />Just one more comment on the whole zombie genre:  While reading the book, it struck me that, like the time travel genre, the zombie genre has it's own internal logic.  Specifically, no one ever knows initially how to \\"kill\\" a zombie.  I got a chuckle out of this.  All zombie worlds must never have had a George Romero or Dario Argento, otherwise they'd know as soon as the first member of the walking dead showed up.  Aim for the head. :)
B000002B7M|2.0|Ban this cd. Aside from the rotten, dull songs, it empowers dudes with mullets to commit savage acts of sodomy on each other. While that concept may sound funny, other side effects spill over into pop culture, warping the fragile balance of nature. Commonly, one will observe dudes working on their pickups on their front lawns, nascar stickers abounding! Ozzy's pathetic rantings are perfect for those who live in grandma's basement while collecting welfare. The same can be said for ANY ozzy cd, and all comparative 80's crap-metal. Cliche garbage.

B000EMGAGW|3.0|I'm a Mobb Deep fan from wayback. I'm down with Mobbphonics, and have followed Mobb Deep since they dropped The Infamous. Unfortunately, that means I have high expectations when it comes to P and Hav; I want poetic, albeit macabre rhymes from Prodigy, I want Havoc there on the mic to balance out Prodigy's visceral rhymes, and I also want Havoc on the boards producing grimey cuts. I'm sure I speak for most hardcore Mobb fans when I say that, and to say this album wasn't that would be an understatement - but, at the same time, it's not a complete loss.    Let's start by pointing out the obvious; the lyrics are weak. Not weak in comparison to the average emcee, weak in comparison to what we've come to expect from Havoc and Prodigy. There are two glaring problems; one, they've gotten too acquainted with the lavish life, and won't stop talking about their new found fortune, association with G-Unit, or groupies, and two; when Prodigy and Havoc do get introspective, it seems like they've literally forgotten how to rap. Prodigy's the most evident example of this, as his voice is not near as empowering as it once was - and Havoc sings for christ's sake. Now, granted, Havoc actually doesn't sound too horrible when he does start getting all sing-songy, but this is the same man who helped pen some of New York's greatest street anthems.    Production wise, this is NOT Mobb Deep fare - at the same time, it's not bad, either. In fact, the production on this album is stronger than the lyrics, and one of the few reasons I didn't give this album two stars or less. The production isn't neccessarily the bangers we've come to know and love from Hav, but it is pretty dope in most spots. If this were production for any other emcees besides Hav and P, or as they've rechristened themselves, Hollywood Hav and V.I.P.(another sign of evidence that 50's money has turned our the Infamous into a couple of spoiled brats) it would work quite well. As it stands, though, this production doesn't suitMD, and would sound much more at home on one of 50 or his cronies' albums.    You come out of this album dissapointed, but that doesn't mean you won't find yourself creeping (pun intended) back to it from time to time. It's not completely unredeemable; in fact, it's quite nice for a mainstream release. However, for an MD joint, this album crashes and burns the moment it leaves the launchpad.
B00005JPE9|5.0|I have noticed that the reviews on this page kind of looks like a Rocky-story itself! <br /> <br />Some guy comes along and throws a few cheap punches right in our face, saying that Rocky 6 will suck.  <br /> <br />But that statement awakes the fighter in all us Rocky fans. So we stand up, eat some raw eggs, put on our grey jogging suit, and put this lousy guy where he belongs: Lying on the floor as he's counted out. We'll show him that Rocky 6 rocks!
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|Okay, this wasn't too bad. The plot is about the Prime Directive and what it means.  Well, an alien force and certain Star Fleet members express interest in a planet with regenerative properties. Their interests violates Star Fleet's golden rule, \\"The Prime Directive\\". The Federation may not interfere in the development of other civilizations. Picard makes a very hard choice and go against Star Fleet's golden rule. Picard and his crew must protect and defend the planet. Even if it means the end of their careers at Star Fleet.
B000002J09|1.0|Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!!!

B0002FR07O|5.0|1996's Signify was Porcupine Tree's final studio album for Delerium, they recorded a live album in '97 for the label called Coma Divine Live, before moving on to Snapper. I have not heard Stupid Dream or anything they did afterwards, that means that so far, I have to say Signify is by far the finest album Porcupine Tree had ever done, certainly for the Delerium label. I first heard of Porcupine Tree back in 1996 when a mail order catalog described them as a \\"laid back Ozric Tentacles\\". In 1997, I bought The Sky Moves Sideways and was amazed. The Ozric Tentacles comparison was basically only valid during the more techno moments of the group, the Pink Floyd comparison was much more valid. The tone of their music was much darker and more sinister than anything the Ozrics could come up with. Steven Wilson admitted the Pink Floyd influence in his music with Porcupine Tree, but later found it an albatross around his neck, since he wanted their music to move on beyond that, like their more recent releases. <br /> <br />Signify was certainly PT at the top of their game. While only half the cuts on The Sky Moves Sideways featured a complete band (as the band was assembled halfway through making that album), Signify had much greater band interaction. This album is stuffed with lots of great songs like \\"The Sleep of No Dreaming\\", \\"Waiting Phase One\\", \\"Sever\\", \\"Every Home is Wired\\" and \\"Dark Matter\\". I really love the vocal arrangements on \\"Every Home is Wired\\". In between many of these cuts are some great ambient experiments like \\"Pagan\\" and \\"Intermediate Jesus\\". I really appreciate how some of the cuts tended to be acoustic, others electic, others electronic, and some of all in some of the cuts. I also liked how the production was modern, but not giving it a sterile feel, too many albums I've heard from the '80s and '90s with a modern production had that very plastic, sterile and synthetic sound to it, Porcupine Tree avoided that. Same for Steven Wilson and Richard Barbieri'suse of keyboards, most of them digital, but done in the most tasteful way, I usually criticize the use of digital synths because too many of them use the most synthetic sounds, but not Porcupine Tree. These keyboards created a wonderful atmospheric backdrop to go with the music. The entire Signify CD never fails to amaze me every time I listen to it, it's not only my favorite Porcupine Tree CD, it's by far the finest album I've ever heard from the 1990s. <br /> <br />And I own the digipak reissue that includes a second CD, a 1997 disc called Insignificance, which was originally only available through a Porcupine Tree newsletter called Transmission. These were 1995-1996 outtakes from the Signify sessions. About 80% material is stuff found nowhere else, with alternate versions of \\"Signify\\", \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Sever\\". Plus you get a totally acoustic version of \\"Nine Cats\\", which originally appeared on the 1991 cassette The Nostalgia Factory (and of course On the Sunday of Life). Honestly I prefer the version off On the Sunday of Life, because the combination of acoustic and electric. Many of these other cuts are excellent, although a couple pieces, like \\"Dark Origins\\" sounds like half-finished demos. This is truly nice stuff to have. <br /> <br />If you came through Porcupine Tree through albums like Stupid Dream, Lightbulb Sun, In Absentia, and Deadwing, and want to dig deeper in their catalog, Signify is a great place to start!
B00004ZD69|5.0|While this is probably the most inconsistent musical piece I've ever trophied with a five star rating, it ultimately becomes nonsensical and painstakingly difficult to refuse its power, and every time I find myself expressing a genuine 'thank you'. 'Lift Your Skinny Fists...' is a gift. <br /> <br />So, yeah -- not only is 'Lift' Godspeed!'s most erratic, dysfunctional exercise in the uncharted waters of grandiose elegance, it's quite possibly rendered with less real thought or meditation than any of their other stuff, before or after. But, really folks, it's so overwhelmingly divine in its peak moments that it becomes an outright heedless task in trying to find fault -- which there most certainly is -- with the album overall, because we find, literally, but five minutes of material here that justifies a perfect rating (and I emphasize that particularly small amount of time to showcase 'how' good the strongest bits here really are; there is at least half an hour of it). To me, this is indisputably some of the best music I've ever heard in my life. <br /> <br />The rousing ten minutes that open \\"Storm\\". The religious, redemptive \\"Static\\", displaying mournful, weeping strings over a moving monologue, whom expresses a desperately emotive sermon on the inevitable communion with God we will all encounter. This track, in particular, provides the sort of reoccurring Godspeed! philosophy that will either give way to individual liberation, or scathing revulsion. It wallows in the mystical nature of our existence, of our uncontrollable fate. The paradox of our utter unsubstantiality, birthing out of such our Holy importance. It's all up for interpretation, of course, but I take it as such, rather than some sort of satire -- I believe Godspeed! showcases the peculiar monologues (taken from outside contexts entirely) because this day in age, such passion with regard to thoughtful extremes, especially amongst the collective whole, seems sparse. It's somehow become improper to confront these matters with such a stern seriousness. Questioning the nature of ourselves, contemplating the humblingly unanswerable anomaly of our being here... The stuff that arguably gives way to spirituality (and, I might add, surely not a stance in which the intellect is evaded), and the themes that make for completely enrapturing art. These guys do it as well as anyone. <br /> <br />The sole minute... the one soaring moment, on the album's final track, \\"Antennas to Heaven\\", 'which begins at 5:30 and ends exactly sixty seconds later at 6:30, is worth more in itself than even some great albums can provide in their entirety. If that's not a testament to the brilliance of these guys, I don't know what is. It sends chills down my spine. <br /> <br />Godspeed! You Black Emperor is quite possibly my favorite band, with a hefty measure of others lagging so closely behind, but such adoration of the band is not at all required in order to succumb oneself to the music here on this disc. It's just... in the least crass way possible, musical ejaculation.
B00005JOX6|5.0|Beside Adam Sandler who has been brilliant my hat goes off as well for co-starring Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken, all have been very good. I normally didn't like Adam Sandler's movies: too light for my taste. But this has got all: hilarious, sad and a deep meaning that sometimes we give for granted but it's not granted at all. It takes quite a lot to make me cry but I am not ashamed to say I did and I laughed and I left the cinema theater with tears and a smile on my face. I would definitely watch it again several times. This is something that has never happened for any of Adam Sandler's movies. <br /> <br />P.S. By the way I agree with the reviewer who admitted that with someone awesome as is Kate Beckinsale you really need nothing else in life. Do you? <br />
B000AJJNPY|4.0|When this album first came out my spirits sort of deflated upon hearing it for the first time, but to my grateful surprise it now stands as my favorite Sigur Ros release.    This is basically Sigur's most confident, well-rounded album yet. I always found 'Ágætis Byrjun' to be overlong and muddled (but certainly not without its shining moments), and the unique, progressive follow-up to 'Ágætis', '( )', was a step forward in album coherency and ambition, but often required more patience than the payoff was really worth. Don't get me wrong, both of the albums are pretty sensational overall -- especially the latter -- but both tended to be heavy in disposition or long-winded, quite often both, and 'Takk' is the first Sigur Ros album that is stellar from start to finish.    Some might not give the band as much credit because it is regressive in the sense that it's not nearly as bold a composition as '( )', but I couldn't be happier with the direction. The melodies are simply more beautiful, more at ease with themselves, and the 'sound' is fuller and more lively; within the first half of the album, especially, 'Takk' is far a pleasingly more optimistic work than either of its brooding siblings. And, despite it not being quite as radical in reach as '( )', it's still complex and layered, often providing unique song structure and a compelling sense of variation in direction. Most of the songs are similar in a handful of ways, but really most of them do differ as far as individual song format is concerned. And, combined with the illuminated tone of most the thing, the result is their most downright enjoyable work yet.    I've always befriended good pop, and those like me should adore this album. It's melodies are, in typical Sigur Ros fashion, simple and almost disconcertingly straightforward, but the dreamy vocals and luscious instrumentation allow pushovers such as myself to dismiss any criticisms that might spring to mind.    I give it four and a half. It's truly, freaking, impossible not to like -- just... sweetly outstanding.
076531178X|5.0|Sanderson's writing is a fresh approach to fantasy.  There are the familiar elements of thieves' guilds, magic, and medieval flavor, but the careful attention to detail creates a unique new world.  As other reviewers have pointed out, Mistborn's magical system of allomancy has well defined rules and a tough learning curve, making it much more interesting than the traditional vague spell-casting magic. <br /> <br />The dark setting of mist and falling ash contribute to the atmosphere of oppression and hopelessness.  This darkness works as a great backdrop for the lead characters to shine against.  Unlike Sanderson's \\"Elantris\\", which also had a very dark atmosphere, the hero is not a near-perfect saint-like being, but more complexly human.  The material is powerful, and the various viewpoints achieve a moral \\"grayness\\" that doesn't come off as preachy. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the charismatic characters, and the plot twists that kept twisting until the end.  Highly recommended reading for all fantasy fans.

0142000663|2.0|First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work.<br /><br />Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book.<br /><br />I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like \\"Of Mice And Men\\" or \\"East Of Eden\\" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\".  Go figure.s hated him so much.

0684824906|5.0|TEAM OF RIVALS<br />I just finished reading a great book which I heartily recommend. It is\\" Team of Rivals: the political genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin, (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2005.)<br />This is a biography of Lincoln, but it also has woven through it the biographies of his principle Cabinet Members, and how he exerted masterful leadership to blend them into an effective government even while they were in competition with him and with each other much of the time.<br />These histories and biographies help me to maintain a more hopeful perspective in the midst of our tumultuous political and social environment in 2006. Goodwin creates a tapestry of Social History that serves as a fascinating backdrop to the large events that were taking place in the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century.<br />One fact that is staggering to me, is that during the Civil War 600,000 men died. In terms of today's population that would be the equivalent of five million deaths. The War Between the States was far and away the costliest war in our history.<br />Another way that a book like this helps my perspective is that it shows that the ins and outs of politics haven't really changed much. The more things change the more they remain the same. Technology and media have changed but the politicians learned how to use what was available to their advantage then, just as present day politicians do now. Lincoln and his rivals used public speaking, the print press, and the telegraph to advantage, just as today's politicians use television and the internet to reach voters and build campaigns.<br /><br />One passage that gives me courage said that, \\"Both (Secretary of State, William H.) Seward and (President Abraham) Lincoln agreed that `one fundamental principle of politics is to be always on the side of your country in a war. It kills any party to oppose a war'. As, indeed, Lincoln knew from his own experience in opposing the Mexican War\\" (p. 546). It is easy to get nervous when the Democratic Party seems to be completely the anti-war party in our day. One wonders if the American people really have the patience and the fortitude to stick with a war until it is won, as we always did up to and including World War II. But if Lincoln's principle is true, then President Bush doesn't have to worry about Americans wanting to \\"bug out\\". Zell Miller explains in his book, A National Party No More, what has happened to the modern Democrat Party. The decline began when the anti-Vietnam War group under George McGovern took over that party in 1972.<br />Another passage helped me to appreciate the influence classical literature had on informing the leadership and decision making process by our national leaders. Lincoln loved the writings of William Shakespeare and they influenced his world view and his rhetoric. \\"The histories and tragedies of Shakespeare that Lincoln loved most dealt with themes that would resonate to a president in the midst of a civil war: political intrigue, the burdens of power, the nature of ambition, the relationship of leaders to those they governed. The plays illuminated with stark beauty the dire consequences of civil strife, the evils wrought by jealousy and disloyalty, the emotions evoked by the death of a child, the sundering of family ties or love of country.\\" (pp. 611-612) As Winston Churchill's speeches rang with the cadences and rhythms of Kipling and Macaulay, so Lincoln's speeches were filled with down home country homilies, Shakespeare's phrases and well known (then) passages from the King James version of the Bible. Goodwin makes a strong case that the Gettysburg Address was the distillation of the essence of the mature Lincoln's total political philosophy. He anchored his philosophy more in the Declaration of Independence than even the Constitution of the United States.<br />More than anything it was enlightening to see the extent to which Lincoln could inspire hope in the American people through the darkest days of the war. \\"`Having hope', writes Daniel Goleman in his study of emotional intelligence `means that one will not give in to overwhelming anxiety, a defeatist attitude, or depression in the face of difficult challenges or setbacks?' Hope is, `more than the sunny view that everything will turn out alright; it is believing you have the will and the way to accomplish your goals'.\\" (p. 631)<br /><br />Lincoln had this power to inspire hope even though he was somewhat melancholy in general temperament, and suffered some severe bouts of depression in his own life. He had personally experienced the death of his mother when he was only a child, his first serious girlfriend died, and two of his young sons died, one in Springfield, Illinois before Lincoln ran for President and, Willie after he was already in the White House.<br />I am deeply interested in the Civil War. The best books are Bruce Catton's three volume centennial history of the Civil War: The Coming Fury, Terrible Swift Sword, and Never Call Retreat. The best historical fiction is Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels, and Jeff Shaara's, Gods and Generals and Last Full Measure. Carl Sandburg's three volume biography of Lincoln is also very good.<br />This new book adds immeasurably to the scholarship available on Lincoln and America during the period of the Civil War.

B00005JKN9|5.0|Long as it was, it ended too soon for me. Some call this its famous director's flop, but I disagree. This tale of revenge, corruption, and of immigrants vying for a place in the landscape of American society balances fantasy and history and with its authenticity regarding period attitudes on race, ethnicity and status it is among the more courageous motion pictures made in a long time. As far as storytelling for the sake of storytelling goes, Gangs of New York gives three hours of great characters, intricate mid-nineteenth-century scenery, and a plot that never drags. Violent, mesmerizing, gritty, it is among Scorsese's top films, and Daniel Day Lewis deserved an Oscar for making Bill the Butcher the best cinematic villain so far in this decade.
B000H7JD4K|2.0|When I saw that Maiden had released a new cd, I was excited.  I read the reviews, all were giving it around 4-5 stars.  When I listened to it, I found myself hitting the skip button.  I want to like this album, I really do, but I don't see anything special about this release.  The intros are too long, too boring.  Sure, the guitar work is awesome, but the songs all sound the same, to me there is no track that really stands out.  I love Maiden, but I still long for the sound of the glory days. Even Brave New World was better quality metal.  Don't run to the stores to buy this, \\"Run To The Hills\\" and pick up their older material, because this one is disappointing.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Phillip Seymour Hoffman deserved the best actor Oscar he won last spring for his performance in Capote, but Catherine Keener was equally impressive in her interpretation of Capote's long-time friend, the author Harper Lee. This necessarily dreary movie concerns itself with those several years in Capote's celebrated life that revolved around his writing the novel In Cold Blood. Here we see goings-on covered in neither the novel nor film version of In Cold Blood, as Capote befriends Perry Smith, one of two criminals who savagely slew a Kansas family inside its farmhouse. Capote is portrayed here as a troubled, conflicted individual, who both uses Smith to gain information possible only if he has Smith's trust, and also as someone who does seem to genuinely care for Smith, whom he visits during his incarceration on death row. Capote's sexual orientation is not made an issue here and is in fact barely touched upon. Likewise the victimization suffered in the dark past of the psychopathic Smith, which played a significant role in In Cold Blood, is mostly left out. Chris Cooper is sound as the Kansas sheriff who cracks the case of the killings, and one thing wrong with this film is how Capote's near-betrayal of the Sheriff and others who had helped Capote during the formative period of his book is barely mentioned. Truman Capote as portrayed in this film seems a would-be amoral  artist whose conscience won't let him get away clean with all that he does in the name of his art. He'll use people, it's true, but he'll later feel tortured by it. This complexity is intriguing. Capote, the film, might be found too deliberate in its pacing for all levels of patience, and it is certainly bleak, but it is an undertaking in which the performers, writers, and those at work behind the cameras coordinated well and got everything they set out to do exactly, I think, as they wanted it.
B000002KB8|5.0|I was a young high school kid when this came out......I loved it!!  Had already been listening to Zeppelin, Hendrix, Cream, Blue Cheer, Humble Pie and Mountain.  Was a young long-haired stoner kid who loved hard rock  (it wasn't called metal until later in the seventies.  Even Sabbath didn't call their music metal in the beginning.)  Today I'm much older.  A guy in his 50s who still likes this stuff  (hey, I'm still much younger than Dio, Lemmy and Ozzy.)  But too many metal books written today are changing history.  As great as I loved the first Black Sabbath LP/CD, it didn't invent anything.  It was just another step toward harder and darker music.  I think Blue Cheer took a bigger step than Sabbath did.  But ever since the first Cream & Hendrix albums came out, I've been buying about 4 or 5 metal LPS/CDs a year.  I'll give you metal kids the  best metal records every year since the Cream/Hendrix days: <br /> <br />1967 - Jimi Hendrix \\"Are you Experienced?\\",  Cream \\"Disraeli Gears\\" <br />1968 - Jimi Hendrix \\"Electric Ladyland\\", Blue Cheer \\"Vincebus Eruptum\\",  Cream \\" Wheels of Fire\\"  Steppenwolf \\"Steppenwolf\\" <br />1969 - Led Zeppelin, \\"Led Zeppelin 1\\",  Led Zeppelin \\"Led Zeppelin 2\\",  Mountain \\"Climbing\\" <br />1970 - Black Sabbath \\"Black Sabbath\\", Deep Purple \\"In Rock\\",  Black Sabbath \\"Paranoid\\" <br />1971 - Led Zeppelin \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", Black Sabbath \\"Master of Reality\\", Alice Cooper \\"Killer\\", Deep Purple \\"Fireball\\" <br />1972 - Deep Purple \\"Machine Head\\", Black Sabbath \\"Vol 4\\",  Wishbone Ash \\"Argus\\", Uriah Heep \\"Demons and Wizards\\",  Scorpions \\"Lonesome Crow\\" <br />1973 - Deep Purple \\"Who do we think we are\\", Led Zeppelin \\"Houses of the holy\\", Black Sabbath \\"Sabbath bloody sabbath\\",  Queen \\"Queen\\" <br />1974 - Deep Purple \\"Burn\\", Queen \\"Sheer Heart attack\\", UFO \\"Phenomenum\\",  Kiss \\"Kiss\\", Rush \\"Rush\\" <br />1975 - AC/DC \\"High Voltage\\",  Kiss \\"Kiss Alive\\", Rainbow \\"Ritchie Blackmore's rainbow,\\"  Aerosmith \\"Toys in the attic\\",  UFO \\"Force it\\" <br />1976 - JudasPriest \\"Sad Wings of destiny\\", Rainbow \\"Rising\\", Aerosmith \\"Rocks\\", Rush \\"2112\\", Kiss \\"Destroyer\\" <br />1977 - Judas Priest \\"Sin after sin\\", UFO \\"Lights out\\", Queen \\"News of the world\\", Motorhead \\"Motorhead\\", AC/DC \\"Let there be Rock\\" <br />1978 - Judas Priest \\"Stained Class\\", Van Halen \\"Van Halen\\", AC/DC \\"Powerage\\", Scorpions \\"Taken by force\\" <br />1979 - AC/DC \\"Highway to hell\\", Motorhead \\"Overkill\\", Judas Priest \\"Hell bent for leather\\" <br />1980 - Judas Priest \\"British steel\\", AC/DC \\"Back in Black\\", Motorhead \\"Ace of Spades\\", Black Sabbath \\"Heaven and hell\\" <br />1981 - Ozzy Ozbourne \\"Blizzard of Oz\\", Motorhead \\"No sleep till hammersmith\\", AC/DC \\"For those about to rock\\" <br />1982 - Iron Maiden \\"Number of the beast\\", Judas Priest \\"Screaming for vengeance\\", Ozzy Ozbourne \\"Diary of a Madman\\", Scorpions \\"Blackout\\" <br />1983 - Iron Maiden \\"Piece of mind\\", Def Leppard \\"Pyromania\\", Motley Crue \\"Shout at the devil\\", Metallica \\"Kill em all\\", Dio \\"Holy Diver\\" <br />1984 - Iron Maiden \\"Powerslave\\", Metallica \\"Ride the Lightning\\", Judas Priest \\"Defenders of the faith\\", Deep Purple \\"Perfect Strangers\\" <br />1985 - Anthrax \\"Spreading the Disease\\", Megadeth \\"Killing is my business\\", Slayer \\"Hell awaits\\", Possessed \\"Seven churchs\\" <br />1986 - Metallica \\"Master of Puppets\\", Slayer \\"Reign in Blood\\", Megadeth \\"Peace sells..who's buying\\" <br />1987 - Anthrax \\"Among the Living\\", Guns n Roses \\"Appetite for destruction\\", Def Leppard \\"Hysteria\\" <br />1988 - Iron Maiden \\"Seventh son of seventh son\\", Metallica \\"And justice for all\\", Slayer \\"South of heaven\\", Megadeth \\"So far so goo so what\\" <br /> <br />This was about where I got off the \\"crazy metal train.\\"  Didn't like where it was going.  The death metal and thrash metal just began to lose me.  Mayhem and Possessed and Sepultura and Pantera and Cannibal Corpse was the end for me.   I still bought Metallica and Iron Maiden, and of course Judas Priest and Deep Purple and Black Sabbath all through the '90s up to today (when they release something, which is rarer and rarer.)  So any metal kids can finish where I left off around '88.   But remember, even though Dio & Lemmy & Ozzy & Tony Iommi & Ritchie Blackmore & Jon Lord & Jimmy Page & even Rob Halford are all older than me.....I'm up there myself.  So there WAS heavy dark music before Sabbath.  Trust me.  But they were great, no doubt.  Just buy ALL the CDS I just mentioned to get THE WHOLE PICTURE !!  <br />
0307346609|5.0|I like the end of the world scenario. I kept thinking throughout the book <br />Thank God the Democrats were not leading the country. It is easy to transpose other possible scenarios with this one. It doubles the pleasure.
B000HIVQK8|4.0|I must agree with the previous reviewer.  As big a George fan as I am, it is hard to justify paying TWICE the price (regular version $15.99, deluxe version $29.99)  While the packaging and booklet are nice, the dvd clocks in at about twelve minutes, and the only rewatchable part is the live in Japan \\"Give me love\\"  The alternate versions of Miss Odell and Sue me sue you blues have already been widely bootlegged years ago, and will be no surprise to any hardcore fans.  Having said that, I do feel they did a very good job on the remastering.  Sound quality is much improved over the previous issue.
B000HEYVOU|4.0|While reading this book to my baby, I got a paper cut from the monster's big red mouth with sharp white teeth! Many babies and children with soft skins will read this book and they might have the same kind of experience as mine. I wish this book were made of harder paper without this kind of danger.  <br />
B00005AQE8|5.0|2pac is one of the most influencial artists of all time cop this album will always be a classic
B00000JCB2|4.0|It was in the summer of 1999, when the rapping grudge rocker band Limp Bizkit finally hit it big. SIGNIFICANT OTHER brought the members of this group tons of attention. Single after single, and with numerous performances ranging from live, to videos, to concerts, to promotional spots, Limp Bizkit's sound had finally been accepted by millions. Led by the rapping Fred Durst, the rock band also consisted of guitars, bass, drums, keyboards, and numerous sound effects in order to create the genre that Limp Bizkit is now considered to fall into. Durst's lyrics are incredibly original, overpowering at times with very sensitive material, but they are what makes or breaks a song off any of the band's records. Melodies are fairly simple, but the rhythms are what hooks a listener to continue through the record and backing up Durst's lyrics, the product is simply stated as: Limp Bizkit. SIGNIFICANT OTHER is definately a record to hear, for it paved the way for more fusion of rap and rock. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"Nookie\\" <br />\\"Break Stuff\\" <br />\\"Re-arranged\\" <br />\\"n 2 gether now\\" <br />\\"No Sex\\" <br />\\"A Lesson Learned\\"
B000EJ9N6Y|3.0|I was waiting for a new Nouvelle Vague record, the first one was a rare, original and yet classic animal, and there are'nt that many gems like that. <br />This disk has the same sonic qualities, but it lacks the edge the first one had, the songs are'nt as energetic and plane not as good.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavinge released UNDER MY SKIN, her long awaited second Mainstream album, in the Spring of 2004. Airplay promoted this record like crazy, and rightfully so. UNDER MY SKIN is an even better piece of work than Avril's debut. Her voice had matured and so had her sound. This record still has that bubbly feel with her lyrics in dealing with relationships, but the contour and Avril's sound is darker. This aspect adds even more artistic quality to the album and it is a trait that coinsides perfectly with Avril's older and more mature style. Once again, Avril jumps from instrument to instrument within her band's rhythm section, but of course her voice is the one melodic instrument she can't get away from. A typical rhythm section along with numerous effects backs up the nineteen year old, and the product is one that can only be described as: Avril's. And that's a statement that any proud musician would want to receive from a listener. UNDER MY SKIN is a unique piece of work and one that is worth hearing.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"He Wasn't\\" <br />\\"How Does It Feel\\" <br />\\"My Happy Ending\\" <br />\\"Forgotten\\" <br />\\"Fall To Pieces\\" <br />\\"Slipped Away\\"
B000GRUS22|5.0|Enigma's sixth release \\"A Posteriori\\" comes three years after their last CD \\"Voyageur\\" which saw Cretu completely shed the Gregorian sounds of the first four albums and replaced with new sounds altogether. \\"A Posterior\\" more or less continues some of the styles of \\"Voyageur\\" but has a lot more dance-trance style that permeates throughout the CD. \\"Eppur A Neuve\\" has that trademark horn intro but evolves into a hauntingly beautiful track with a very brooding melody and electronic bliss. This is arguably my favorite intro track since the intro to MCMXC a lifetime ago. From her though the album starts to get somewhat repetitive with most of the songs having a similar style with occassional breaks. \\"Invisible Love\\" though has such a beautiful intro with 12-string guitars meshed with beuatiful keyboard sounds before it becomes a slower-paced dance-oriented track. The final track \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" is a Cretu vocals track that features Cretu himself as vocalist and also has a strange chant in the foreground. \\"A Posteriori\\" is yet another winner in Enigma's catelog and is worth the wait. It could've used a little more diversity though and hope that will be the case on Cretu's seventh release. Still highly recommended.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Fans of the rapping grudge rock band: Limp Bizkit only had to wait one year for the artists to punch out another record. CHOCOLATE STARFISH AND THE HOT DOG FLAVORED is an interesting piece of work. Its impact was not as significant as its predocessor, but the record is not awful either. What really hurts this record is very repetitive rhythm changes and poorly arranged songs. There are only a few of them, but those few are what really hurts this record's contour and context. Again, Fred Durst is rapping out very unique and sensitive lyrics. He is backed up by a typical rhythm section along with sound effects and they are what set up Durst's entire routine. An upside to this record compared to the one before, is that CHOCOLATE STARFISH AND THE HOT DOG FLAVORED WATER has more melodies and harmonies to many of its pieces. One could almost declare those pieces as rock rap ballads, and they are very well performed. The one thing that this record did, was bring Limp Bizkit even more promotional attention. The band was given an oppurtunity to perform a track for MI:2, and DMX joined Durst for a variation of the track \\"Rollin' (Urban Assault Vehicle)\\". CHOCOLATE STARFISH AND THE HOT DOG FLAVORED WATER can definately be identified as Limp Bizkit material, but is far from being as good as the band's first and third Mainstream albums. <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"My Way\\" <br />\\"Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)\\" <br />\\"Take A Look Around\\" <br />\\"Bolier\\" <br />\\"Hold On\\"
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I think I like this movie more now than when I was a kid! And the extra features on this 2-DVD set are absolutely wonderful. Great interviews with Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, one of the Sherman brothers (songwriter), and the girl who played Jane that really show how special the movie-making process was, which then translated to joy on the screen.  <br /> <br />The movie is long for little kids, but my 2-year-old requests \\"Step in Time\\" and \\"Jolly Holiday\\" frequently (let's hear it for scene selection!) and dances around the living room with the chimney sweeps!
B00004Z459|4.0|The rap techno group Linkin Park made their debut back in late 2000. The band consisted of two singers, a tenor and barritone. A drummer, bassist, guitarists, and a talented keyboardist back up the two singers with their rhymes. Linkin Park has a very distinct sound of a rap lyrics sung on top of heavy electronical rock progressions. The end product is well worth hearing and HYBRID THEORY is a great piece of work for this type of genre. The rhythm section is not anything really special for this record, but it works for the very melodic vocals given by Chester Bennington. The thing about this album, is that its sound was still in the experimental stage. It is a major work that helped pave the way for future techno fusion genres. HYBRID THEORY is a good album, and one that should be given some attention.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include: <br />\\"Crawling\\" <br />\\"In the End\\" <br />\\"A Place In My Head\\" <br />\\"Forgotten\\" <br />\\"Cure For the Itch\\"
B000H305U0|3.0|Maybe it's just me, but I miss these things called \\"songs.\\" Y'know, melody, verses, choruses, bridges...? <br /> <br />Maybe popular music has passed me by.  <br /> <br />But aren't these all just, like, beats and grooves and samples and repetitive lyrics...done over and over and over again? <br /> <br />Sure, they all sound great. The production here is, as you'd expect, tremendous. On a dance floor in a club, they are a perfect aural backdrop for socializing...this IS music to get hooked up to. <br /> <br />But out of that arena, like in your car or on your iPod, it's kinda boring the second time around. <br /> <br />It is not just Justin either. Both Beyonce and Janet have new records that suffer from the same disease. None of these albums will age well...pop music can be disposable, I know. I just don't want that sort of music from these performers... <br /> <br />If you really want to here what this guy can do, skip to the last song on the album. Produced not by Timbaland but by Rick Rubin, you will in all likelihood hear the best R&B ballad of the year. After an hour of mindless hip-hop and soulless slow songs, this one jumps right out and blows you away.
B000006P8I|3.0|David Bowie's first album originally released in June 1967 is a pretty cool little record. If you like Bowie or quirky mid-60's British pop, then you really can't go wrong. Should it be the first Bowie album one buys? God no! But it is very enjoyable in the right frame of mind. \\"Join the Gang\\" is a rip on certain aspects of \\"Swinging London\\" and is a personal fav from the debut. \\"Rubber Band\\" is a fun nostalgia trip on big bands during the Great War. \\"Uncle Arthur\\" is a silly song about the ultimate mama's boy. \\"When I Live My Dream\\" is generally considered the best song on the disc; it definitely seems the most mature. Even \\"Sell Me Your Coat\\" sounds cheerful though the poor guy seems to be freezing to death. David will always be one of rock's greatest songwriters and lyricists and 'Bowie' the album has its fair share of hilarious stories of maids, transvestites, models in the ads, meglomaniacs, childhood fantasists and psychotic gravediggers. 'David Bowie' is a neat little record where every song is memorable for good or bad. Not essential listening for 60's psychedelic enthusiasts but more for Bowie completists. In 1967 a 20 year old genius was having a blast giving commentary on both Mod London and Twentieth Century England in general. Years after this release, when Bowie became Ziggy and ruled the world; he may have been embarassed by this record. However, fans of folky, campy rock will enjoy!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|In a world gone soft on just about every aspect of our lives in the pursuit of making a quick buck including the music being sold out there in this jungle of condescension comes CONTINUUM. John Mayer's third CD brings to fruition his commitment to higher aspirations against the ordinary and mundane in the recorded music industry. Evidently and assuredly he is a true artist, the real thing as he evolves his poetic sound and from-the-heart delivery of his works. The delivery and sound and the sincerity of these elements is something you do not read about but instead feel when you listen to the music. You can feel those profound elements on this CD.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|It is amazing to me how much Knights Of Cydonia sounds just like the old hit Telstar by the Tornados from the '60's...and then Freddie Mercury rises from the dead to sing!  Check it out for yourself and tell me I'm wrong...someone remembered his 60's tunes!  If you've not heard Muse before, this is so far their finest release!
B000077VPU|5.0|I never saw the MTV broadcast sadly and never owned the VHS version. I do have this DVD and I love it, it brings tears to my eyes every time. <br />It is very possible that while the DVD is missing tracks there is more than the assumed reason that the DVD people botched it.  <br />Itis possible that legal issues cropped up to prevent the release of the entire original concert. <br />Yes the songs are all Queen songs but the concert was before DVDs were the norm and the bands who performed may have signed off on Video rights but when it came to DVD rights they wouldn't allow it. I don't know I'm just saying it is VERY possible that the DVD is missing tracks for other reasons than the ones assumed! <br />Anyway just becuase it isn't the VHS or entire concert version it is still a fabulous heartbreaking DVD and I love it!
B000HA4W4S|4.0|or second half of the cd. The first five songs are good and fun, all in the same Fleetwood Mac production meets Bee Gee/Elton John vocals. However, from the song Intermission on the album is just as excellent as the debut, great songs in various genres and emotions. My personal favorites are Kiss You Off, Paul McCartney (genius lyrics and groove) and the album closer Everybody Wants the Same Thing. <br /> <br />This falls just a little short of their debut due to lack of variety (faulting from both songwriting and production) but it is a pretty funky groove they are stuck in.
B000GRTQSE|1.0|So we waited for 5 years to get this? This set is the most disappointing,mediorce and lifeless set of songs from one of the most influential and truely great singer/songwriters of all time.This collection deserves to be classified with Rod Stewart's Trilogy of re -recordings of American classics..technically competent and about as potent as a glass of water.I do not want to think that Bob has degenerated to this,swill.You cannot say that the backing track/Murph and the Magic tones sound of his touring band,is understated...it is underdone and why bother.<br /><br />Bob's lyrics say nothing new and in fact he has become a sad paraody of his former self.How anybody can liken this to Blonde on Blonde or Highway 61 Revisited,or Blood On The Tracks or Desire is beyond me.How this got to Number 1 in the US is amazing,well seeing the rubbish that is out there now ,maybe it is not that surprising.<br /><br />If I am to believe some of the reviews and the sentiments expressed,this is a truely great CD...I am sorry but it is not.I will simply beg to differ with those reviews and remember Bob,s truely great albums,that have the bite the spark the growl the lyrics that defined a generation,and leave this limp wristed collection of borrowed beats,dreadful renditions and lack lustre backing to the rest of you.<br /><br />Give this a wide berth and at least listen to Bob's Unplugged MTV album from 1995 if you want to hear the real more recent Bob Dylan.<br /><br />I am truely disappointed with this collection and remain so ,even after several listens.The defining moment for me...I had to take it off after 5 songs.Why listen to this when you can listen to the real thing from the 60s and 70s.
B00004TJWE|5.0|magnifica obra de un grupo anclado en el sonido sucio y garagero que se entromete con la psicodelia y crea una de las obras mas valiosas y poco conocidas de los '60.... influenciado por el viejo pink floyd de syd, la acidofilia beatle y la controversia con tommy, no deja de sorprender la calidad de los temas y la variedad de sonidos, las letras, en fin , una delicia..\\"s.f.sorrow is born\\", \\"bracelets of fingers\\", \\"baron saturday\\", \\"the journey\\" retumban en tu cabeza...realmente un trabajo sobresaliente de un grupo muchas veces comparado con lo stones en sus comienzos, que los supera claramente en el campo de la psicodelia (quien se acuerda de sus majestades.??)
B000001FQ4|5.0|When I first bought this album back in 1974 I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. This was the first outing featuring the twin guitar sound of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham so I expected something different, but I was surprised at how mellow it was. Ok so the band had changed direction before. In the Eric Bell era they went from a folk sound on the first two albums, to a heavier raw sound on Vagabonds so I guess I was anticipating hard rock here, but although it does contain a couple of heavier songs in Sha-La-La and Its Only Money, the guitars are played down somewhat with strings featuring on the title track and the final song Dear Heart. This may have been due to the production of Ron Nevison which the band was allegedly unhappy with. There are also, what appears to be, a couple of fillers in Frankie Carroll and the instrumental Banshee.  Don't let that put you off however, as there are still some great tracks with excellent guitar harmonies in She Knows, Philomena and Showdown. But what elevates this album to five stars for me is the beautiful Still in Love with You.  The live version has received greater acclaim (this is also brilliant incidentally), but I still love the studio version. It features Gary Moore on guitar and Brian Robertson apparently refused to re-record it, as he thought it couldn't be bettered. I have to say I'm inclined to agree.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|An album like this is a rare avis in the absurd and boring music world of today, we need this kind of inspiration from all the artists we admire, 90% of the time I regret buying albums with no respect for the listener, only one or two songs that worth, and the rest for the boredom... But in this case, Mayer put his heart and soul in this record and I became an instant promoter. <br />I saw him live in San Diego bay and was impacted from his guitar skills... this kid is a natural musician and storyteller, so if you have the chance, don't miss his tour with Sheryl Crow.
0789723107|5.0|An infinitely quotable book which takes you through the fundaments of designing websites that customers will find easy to use.  Easy to use websites of course being successful websites.   <br /> <br />If nothing else, this book arms the believer with succinctly put arguments to put to the next avid \\"intro flash page\\" or \\"let's make our website different\\" fan... Krug even provides copy/paste emails to send to higher ups showing how sensible focusing on usability is. <br /> <br />With its how tos, practical examples and explanations this book is a must read for anyone involved in website creation.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I am a big fan of the original versions of Star Wars and I already own the special editions on DVD. I will not take this release. This crappy release is nothing but an insult to all of us true star wars fans. George Lucas should get with the program and release the originals with 5.1 surround sound and anamorphic widescreen. Skip this and wait for Lucas to release these in better quality.
B000H7JCG4|1.0|With all due respect to Aaron Spelling, Beverly Hills 90210 was pure soap trash. The writers on the show basically tried to mask the show's true identity as shallow T&A dreck by having some character, usually Gabrielle Carteris' Andrea, spout off about some issue like date rape or AIDS for a token five minutes every episode. This was supposed to make the show \\"deep\\" and \\"topical.\\" I've got news for you: I've seen wading pools at Motel 6 that were deeper and shampoo commercials that were more genuinely topical. Everybody slept with everyone ad nauseum and, like interchangeable parts in a car, cast members who left the series were replaced by clones with even less acting talent and depth than their predecessors. And, of course, every two years or so FOX trotted out its latest tribute to 90210 where the cast members, production staff, and writers waxed poetic about what a milestone the series was, how it broke new ground, how wonderful they all were, blah, blah, blah, blah -- nauseating self-congratulations for a show truly about nothing (my apologies to Seinfeld fans). Previous Aaron Spelling shows like Charlie's Angels, The Love Boat and Dynasty at least owned up to being nothing more than superficial entertainment with a lot of giggle appeal. That Beverly Hills 90210 claimed to be groundbreaking is ridiculous and insults the viewers' intelligence.
B000B8I8WS|3.0|This was a pretty good cd complilation, but by far, the bonus dvd was really what was worth the price. I hadn't really listened to much from Roadrunner since the 80's, so I could go through and pick out the artists I liked best and then check out their individual bands. Got some great cds, both new and old school, out of this comp.
B000GFLE86|1.0|<br />Ever since I discovered Careless Love, I've been waiting for Madeleine's next album with a lot excitement. Well, here it is. And what a disappointment. I've been listening to it over and over and can't seem to find the vitality she had in her last album. The music is dull and the lyrics are cheesy, but if your just looking for some good background music for a romantic diner, it'll do just fine.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|What is the joke? How are coffee and Eric Clapton alike? They both suck without Cream. Well, I don't go that far. Eric has made some really great albums, primarily in the 1970s, but still. This album is such watered down and contrived garbage that it is impossible to listen to without getting ill, primarily because the man behind this music is so talented and capable of so much more. I actually took this to record store to sell and the guy passed, saying they had too many of this one stocked.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I bought a swivel sweeper as a xmas gift this past December '05. It worked fine for our needs from January until the beginning of August. We only used it moderately, maybe once every two weeks or so. We were very careful to never overcharge the battery and we periodically cleaned the brushes, etc. However, even with the proper preventive maintenance it eventually it began to cut out after a few minutes of use. If you waited for a few seconds you could get it to start again but it would continue to cut out. According to the manual it sounded as if the automatic shut-ff was engaging time after time so I made sure that the sweeper parts etc. were spotless as per the instructions. However, the problem persisted until it stopped working altogether once it was placed on any surface. The thing will still run fine if it's held up off the floor, so if you like 'swivel sweeping' the air then this is the tool for you. I called the Ontel Customer Service department to see if they would stand behind their product. I first spoke with a person named Jesse and then to someone who said she was his supervisor named Carmen. Both told me how sorry they were but that there was nothing that they could do. Then they offered to sell me another one. Oh yeah, I'll run right out and buy another swivel sweeper just as soon as I am finished waxing my Edsel. I guess you can say that the Swivel Sweeper sort of does what it says it will do: it will suck you right in.  Save your money~
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Watch Beowulf and Grendel for the scenery and Gerard Bulter, as his acting and good looks are never hard to bear.  However, do not watch this looking for a faithful adaptation of Beowulf, the epic poem.  With the additions of new characters (Selma) and new motives for Grendel, this movie fails to provide anywhere near the themes and spirit of the original poem.  I think the quality of the script was overshadowed by the real main character - Iceland.
B000002JPA|5.0|I listen to it all of the freaking time!  Although the cheese factor on this type of prog metal is very high, this album is probably the least cheesy.  Much less so than their more recent work.  It satisfies my ears to hear one of the most technically proficient guitarists of all time mate their virtuosity with solid song writing.  As a gutarist John Petrucci has had a VERY profound influence on my playing such that I had a friend tell me that I sounded like a clone of him the first time she heard me play last year.  I fear some non-musicians might non get this album.  If you are a budding guitarist, You need this album.  The cover of the album looks like a master work of art, the music is such too, not too esoteric for non-metalheads to listen too either.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|I'm sorry, maybe my expectations were too high-but this movie sucks. Every scene feels chopped, like what we were supposed to see was about to happen, but we never quite got there. The extablished characters do not grow and the plethora of new characters are unnecessary. The beloved \\"fast ball special\\" sequence was lamer than I thought possible. Kelsey Grammar was wasted as Beast, and the power of Phoenix was not used or explained to satisfaction. I liked the first movie, loved the second, and was absolutely heart-broken by this third; more like a train wreck than an adventure film. If none of the action is believable, none of the humor is funny, and none of the conflict satisfying, then why even make this mess? I sure hope Spidey 3 doesn't blow it this hard!
B00008AWOG|5.0|I never thought that I might say this about an album that has elemements of death metal, but I shall about this one.  The guitar work is technically proficient enough to rival any, and they are able to integrate the acoustic with the hardest electric FAR BETTER than ANYONE I have EVER heard.  Its rare to find music where all of the songs on the album are just about equally as good, but this one does just that for me.  This is probably my second favorite Opeth album behind Blackwater Park.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Could be the best band on the planet right now.  Everyone sounds at the top of their game.  Outstanding musicianship.  Gave me chills.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|I never thought that I would write a review about ANY DVD especially about Dido's live concert. \\"Especially\\" because I have never been her fan, furthermore I wasn't even familiar with her songs except \\"White Flag\\" which had been played on all radio stations a lot. Then I bought a nice Home Theater system and was looking for some high quality live concert to try it with. After reading a very good reviews on Amazon.com about this particular DVD live performance I brought it home... and I'm a huge Dido's fan ever since. If it would be possible to give a six or even seven stars out of five I would, as this concert is a very good example of what every live show of every artist is supposed to be. Quality of sound is awesome, quality of video is amazing. Dido is great. I have been watching this concert already maybe 20 times in its entirety and will do it again and again. Musicians on stage are very professional and have everything to do with this concert's success. On the downside of this 2 disc package though the absence of \\"Hunter\\" on CD and I would rather omit \\"Honestly OK\\" from both DVD and CD. It's frankly not my favorite song. All other tracks are very good and I really enjoyed Dido's performance and envy those people who watched this show live in London. I wish I was there. Well, this DVD now is a center of my live shows collection and I'm glad I gave it a try and bought it. Buy it. It's just awesome!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer's new disc is nothing short of phenomenal. I actually can't believe how much Mayer has grown from his first record. This is him at his absolute finest.

B000H4JGZY|4.0|I was introduced to Bryan Ferry by Simon LeBonne and John Taylor.  It was statements by Duran Duran in Star Hits Magazine regarding  Roxy Music being one of their influences that made me purchase Roxy Music's Greatest Hits - on cassette. . . at a record store.  Only grown folks know what I'm talking about here.  One of my signs that I am officially old is that no one has to point out to me from which musical palettes Justin Timberlake stole his brushes while creating Futuresex/Sexyback.  I already know because I own the original cassettes.<br /><br /> And that makes Futuresex all the more delightful for me.  You see, I can't listen to Prince's \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\" any longer.  Not only because the cassette is all warbled now but also because Prince isn't making that type of song anymore.  He's that symbol now and his music has evolved.  I could buy the digital song online but that is not the point.  I don't really want to hear Prince sing \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\" over and over again.  I want to hear new songs which capture the stylistic essence of Prince as he was then.  That is just what Justin provides on \\"My Love\\".  From the teenage lovestruck falsetto of his vocals to the painfully earnest neediness/romanticism of the lyrics (\\"If I told you you were beautiful/ Would you date me on the regular\\" ), Justin channels Prince.  Justin even goes for the Greek chorus backing vocals a la The Family in \\"Nothing Compares To You\\".  The psychedelic circling synthesizer is a Princely touch as well.<br /><br />What elevates Justin's channeling from imitative to creative is Timberland's producing and vocal collaboration.  The \\"Let Me Talk To You\\" prelude to \\"Let Me Talk To You/ My Love\\" sounds as if Timberland only just finished remixing the Sergio Mendes cover/remix album Timeless with Latin tinged cowbells as the rhythm section.  Timberland has absolutely mastered keeping hip hop fresh by incorporating the musical styles of other cultures without dumbing them down.  Timberland does this best on \\"Sexyback\\".  I thought it was brilliant when Limp Bizkit chopped it up with Jay Z melding hip hop and grunge rock.  Well Timberland takes it to another level on \\"Sexyback\\".  He and Justin capture the essence of the ecstasy, gay rave-party, dance-all-night house song and stream it through that creepy but alluring Trent Reznor/Marilyn Manson sieve.  I believe this will end up being the 2006 song all the other contenders for the pop thrown wish they'd cut.  It's so neat and so new yet so familiar.<br /><br />Prince's spirit isn't the only specter seancing on Futuresex.  Michael Jackson, a long time influencer of Justin, shows up in his black suit and white ankle socks complete with fedora on more than one tune.  Most obviously, and best, on \\"Lovestoned/I Think That She Knows\\".  \\"Lovestoned\\" is all Billie Jeaned out.  Then Justin transitions right into the lush \\"I Think That She Knows\\", which is like \\"Human Nature\\" meeting Coldplay style melodic layering.  The transition is so smooth it makes me wonder why gapless playback was even invented.<br /><br />My favorite cut is where Timberland goes stereo with both Justin's Prince and Michael channels.  It's \\"Damn Girl\\".  Justin, like Prince, has a way of conveying unadulterated, grown-up lust while singing falsetto without it seeming silly.  The arrangement is tight, funky and jazzy.  I mean it is right Off The Wall.  It goes further back than that actually.  This is a song \\"Lil\\" Michael Jackson would have sung if he'd been allowed to sing \\"grown up\\" sexy songs with the Jackson Five.<br /><br /> There are weak cuts.  \\"Losing My Way\\" features lyrical and musical platitudes.  It is so weak Kirk Franklin et al was brought in to, failingly, legitimize it as an inspirational song.  \\"Summer Love\\" is a forgettable prom song throw away.

In the interview he showed more depth than that for which I gave him credit.  He was courageous to be experimental at a time when it seems a lot of hip hop and pop is striving for sameness.

It's not the most fantastic Japanese book ever, but it's great for a class, or for some other guided instruction.  Much better than any American textbooks I've seen. <br />Every chapter starts with vocabulary, then a skit using the new words, as well as some good examples and exercises.  The illustrations are cute.  Also, the appendices are very useful in a pinch.

0307346609|2.0|Before you stop reading this, know that I love all things zombie.  Love zombie movies, George Romero, etc. <br /> <br />This is not that much of a zombie movie.  It's a book about people living with zombies.  And you have to read a lot of personal narrative about people living around zombies.  But not a lot about zombies.   <br /> <br />Basically, the author must have read Studs Terkels books like \\"Working\\" and decided to write a zombie novel in a similar fashion.  The author does in fact credit Studs Terkel. <br /> <br />But what is so SORELY missing is suspense and action.  This reads like a sociology book, not a fun work of fiction.  Heck, I felt like a zombie after staggering to finish this book. <br /> <br />There's a lot of better fiction out there.  And there's a lot of better zombie fiction out there too.  Sorry Max, I don't like your book that much.  The premise is great.  You've got Brad Pitt supposedly producing your movie, but your book turned me into a zombie. <br /> <br />And you other reviewers who actually thought there was a political discussion in this book, give me a break... Seriously.  It's a zombie novel, not the works of Marx.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|We watched this DVD last night, and I think it may have surpassed everything else we've watched and is now at the top of my list. WOW. Amazing! I love when a band sounds just as good as they did when they first hit the music scene. <br /> <br />A wonderful plus to this concert is that Frey, Henley and Walsh also sing their own songs so it's like getting a bonus concert. Joe Walsh is quite entertaining! <br /> <br />Definitely a must see - I'm already looking forward to watching it again!
B000H4JGZY|4.0|It's been four years since his last solo release and it's evident when you listen to this album.  His voice is stronger, his beats are better (thanks in part to Timbaland), and his lyrics are definately more adult.  I don't like every track on this album, but it is worth the money I spent on it.  Keep it up Justin!
B000H305U0|5.0|This album shows how much Justin has grown as an artist. I love the Prince-flavored tracks as well as the mix of rock, hip hop and dance music. \\"Lovestoned/I Think That She Knows\\" blends these genres beautifully. \\"Another Song/All Over Again\\" is \\"Old School\\" R&B at it's best. Excellent album overall and a job well done.
0451163532|5.0|Book Review:  \\"On Wings of Eagles\\" by Ken Follett; published by William Morrow, New York in 1983; Non Fiction. <br /> <br />I read quite a few books, usually one or two per week on average, and my selection varies widely from the latest murder mystery fiction novels to the more mundane non fiction biographies of ordinary people that lived through extraordinary situations hundreds or even thousands of years ago.  I am a firm believer that almost every book is worth reading especially if the alternative is not to read at all.  I like reading so much that when left alone in an environment with no other suitable distraction I will often read the labels on product cartons including tissue boxes, furniture cushions, and even the tiny shampoo bottles found in hotels.  Reading is educational, entertaining, and therapeutic while also being quite inexpensive, flexible, and completely portable.  Like most readers I have developed a preference for a number of topics and acquired an addiction for a few select authors yet one book stands out among all others as by far the best book I have read in over 30 years of persistent study. <br /> <br />The book currently at the top of my list is \\"On Wings of Eagles\\" by Ken Follett.  This book reads like a non-stop action thriller and it competes with the finest of the wild and dramatic novels out there yet the most incredible aspect of the story is that it is 100% true as recounted to the author first hand by many of the original subjects.  I know this for fact as I have researched the story several times, at first in disbelief and then later out of admiration and a passion to find out even more about the origins of this unique situation and the amazing people that were involved.  My research included querying numerous news archives, reviewing public profiles of several large corporations, communicating with a few veteran book collectors, and eventually to direct contact with the author who was kind enough to correspond with me on severaloccasions. <br /> <br />The story takes place in that late 1970s.  It starts innocently enough when EDS, a large computer processing company based in Dallas, wins a contract from the Iranian government to provide computer hardware and software that will administer the Iranian social security system including taxes, finances, and payouts to the citizens of Iran.  The company assigns hundreds of employees to the project and many of them are relocated to Iran where they setup a typical corporate office complete with cubicles, meeting rooms, typewriters, secretaries, etc.  They install and maintain a massive mainframe computer system and live relatively normal lives including a Monday-Friday work week with shopping, social events, and errands on the weekends.  A number of the main executives even brought their families with them to eliminate the burden of long term separation that often accompanies massive out of town projects.  The wives furnish and decorate their houses and apartments, they buy cars and appliances, and the kids go to school just like they would back home in Dallas.  Several families even have pets including dogs, cats, and birds. <br /> <br />For a while everything seems to be going well and the contract is worth many millions in revenue so the company is looking forward to a substantial profit as the deliverables are completed and payment is made.  This is where the trouble starts.  The Iranian government becomes unstable and they withhold payment on all invoices due to the company despite the significant work that has already been completed.  Various fanatical groups emerge to stir up trouble in their desire to take over from the local government.  Demonstrations are held in the streets, protests and vandalism become common, and civil order begins to erode.  Eventually it becomes unsafe for the Americans to travel after dark and a curfew is imposed.  The EDS workers and their families are concerned but they assume this is a temporary situation thatwill blow over in time once the political arguments are resolved.  They are initially confident of their safety since they are providing a critical service to the Iranian government which in turn provides a valuable service to the Iranian citizens, so of course it would be unwise for Iran to turn on the service providers that are supporting them. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the opposite happens and in just a few short months the entire country is thrown into a full scale revolution which includes severe restrictions on travel.  Violence, gunfire, and civil unrest are common place and there is now a much greater threat to Americans in particular.  At this point the US government issues orders to evacuate all non-essential US embassy staff and American citizens living in Iran, so of course the company decides to evacuate the employees and temporarily shut down the project.  Most of the employees put their belongings in storage or hire Iranian friends to look after their homes and possessions in anticipation of returning once order has been restored.  A small skeleton crew of top executives and core employees volunteer to remain behind and maintain the system in hopes that the Iranian government will be restored, pay the outstanding invoices, and welcome the Americans back to resume their work on the lucrative contract. <br /> <br />Unbeknownst to EDS, the Iranian government was running out of money thus they were not able to pay the invoices however they also needed to keep the system running to maintain critical services if they were to eventually recover.  To solve their dilemma one of the government officials decides to have two of the top executives arrested, interrogated, and jailed on false charges of corruption.  The official refuses to pay the invoices and insists that the remaining crew continue to maintain the system.  The executives are found guilty without a trial and bail is set at $13 million dollars.  The entire process is quite unusual given the normallaws and legal processes in Iran so EDS immediately engages a team of top lawyers and US government officials to get their employees released from prison and returned to the US. <br /> <br />A long battle ensues driven primarily by Ross Perot, the EDS President, and his extensive network of powerful corporate and political allies.  All options are considered including payment of the outrageous bail however nothing works.  The US government is not willing to risk creating an international incident since the employees initially appear to be safe in jail, the legal advisors recommend against paying the bail since there is no assurance that the employees would be released and it could encourage further arrests or increased demands, and all attempts to reason or bargain with the Iranian government end in total failure.  At this point Ross makes a bold move which would have been viewed as completely insane by many and actively thwarted by all government officials had they known about it at the time. <br /> <br />Ross decided to form a small team of his top executives by selecting those that were closest and most loyal to him.  By coincidence they also just happened to be ex-military soldiers formerly assigned to Special Forces duty for the US Army.  Ross then hired an old friend of his, a legendary retired military colonel and former Green Beret known as Col. Bull Simmons, to lead the newly formed commando team.  He gathered the group in his Dallas headquarters, swore them to secrecy which included cover stories for their families, and charged them with doing whatever it took to rescue the imprisoned employees and bring them back to the US.  He provided unlimited funds, transportation, and valuable connections to certain influential parties that could get things done.  Then he stepped out of the way and let the team get to work. <br /> <br />Col. Simmons trained the team, conducted reconnaissance, obtained the proper gear, and arranged for the team to be smuggled into Iran.  The remainder of the story is quite exciting and will keep you turning page after page well into the early morning hours as you fight off sleep and struggle to keep your eyes open for just one more paragraph.  I won't ruin the surprise by relating the outcome but suffice to say it is quite an adventure that serves as a reminder of how strong the bonds can become between team members when they are led and motivated by the best and then made dependent on each other for survival against all odds. <br /> <br />In closing I recommend that you buy not one but several copies of this book.  You will want one to read, one to keep in safe storage with your permanent collection, and several to give to your family and friends.  In the past several years I have purchased more than a dozen copies and given them all away except for one which is an original first edition hardback that was signed by Ken Follett, Ross Perot, and 7 of the top executives that were involved in the rescue operation.  That copy is safely stored away with my most treasured possessions where it remains for many months at a time until I get the urge to pull it out and read it again or show it to friends as I highly recommend an item for their shopping list on their next trip to the bookstore.
B000G759LW|5.0|I am a 40 something married mom of 3 - not the typical Christina fan.  This album \\"Back to Basics\\" has gotten my attention and earned my respect for her unbelievable talent.  Her smoky, sultry vocals are reminiscent of Aretha or Etta James but she also has the energy and theatricality of Bette Midler in a lot of the numbers.  This album is perfect.  It showcases her range from sweet love songs to songs of pain and longing.  Then there are the just plain fun songs like Candyman.  I also like the way she has bits in some of the songs referring to her past reputation.  There is even one song \\"Still Dirty\\" that boldly addresses that issue.  I haven't found a song I don't like yet and I've listened to both discs several times.  Kudos to Christina for this amazing album.  I know we'll see more great things from you in the future.  I'd love to see a musical stage show done based on some of the songs from these discs.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|Twenty-five years ago, while in law school, I saw this three-hour-long movie six times. It was worth every ticket and minute. If you like history, politics, writers, romance, adventure, and cycles of idealism, cynicism, disillusionment and hope, this movie is for you. It's a true, panoramic story about the American left (who splinter and implode among themselves)and the Russian Revolution, taking place on two continents.  Conservatives living in Red States probably will hate it, unless they are willing to look beyond ideology to more basic, human, tragic themes. In this movie, Reds are the good guys, but the good guys don't win. Cheer and cry your eyes out.
0060523794|3.0|Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.'s WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN'T DANCE? is Gerstner's account of how he managed the turnaround of ailing computer mainframe giant IBM during his years as CEO (1993-2002).  The book is at its best when Gerstner gives his personal account of his first experiences with Big Blue.  For me, though, the details of the IBM revival are less captivating, and my interest began to flag about halfway through the book.<br /><br />I picked up WHO SAYS ELEPHANTS CAN'T DANCE? for leadership and management training purposes.  The section in which he talks about corporate culture--in particular, the chapter \\"Leading by Principles\\" --includes what I think are valuable insights into what aspects of IBM's culture were self-defeating, and what principles Gerstner introduced to help turn this moribund culture around.  These eight principles, listed on pp. 201-202, are worth reviewing.  Like many management principles, they are not particularly earth-shattering, but I have found that organizations that can adhere to such principles as \\"We never lose sight of our strategic vision\\" (#5), and \\"We think and act with a sense of urgency\\" (#6) are more than likely going to be successful--and be, moreover, places that attract and retain good employees.<br /><br />It's true that Gerstner is self-aggrandizing at times, for example, in his description of his philanthropic efforts.  I'm willing, though, to tolerate a little chest-beating from people who are devoting their personal resources to the greater good.  (As an aside, I think he underestimates the good that corporate money can do for charitable efforts--he favors rather the donation of a company's expertise to the community--but this is a minor point.)<br /><br />Gerstner's book isn't one to be devoured, I think.  But it is worthwhile reading in parts, in particular, those sections in which he shares his experience of and knowledge about managing people.  If you are interested in learning how to lead an organization to greatness, you should definitely check this book out.eatness, you should definitely check this book out. <br />
B00005JP87|4.0|Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti are very good here, as they always are. Even Jessica Biel turns in a better than average performance. The sets, costumes, and musical score are all lovely, but the movie lacks something I can't quite put my finger on. The slow pace didn't bother me, but the love story didn't hold much water. The Illusionist is a movie worth seeing, but perhaps it is better suited for a DVD viewing.
0780021150|4.0|\\"M\\" is a film that is 75 years old, having came out in 1931. It's also in German and when movies that came out three years ago have been forgotten, this movie still thrives and frequently finds itself on a Great Movies list by some critic. In fact, the way I heard of it was through Roger Ebert's The Great Movies. \\"M\\" is a great movie. It's not, in my opinion, an entertaining film though. It's a great movie, because it's one of the first (if not the first) serial killer movie; It's got some good cinematography...From what I've heard about previous releases of this film (both DVD and VHS), I think I got lucky with the copy I obtained. The subtitles are clear, the sound quality is good, and the picture is all-right. The picture is far from perfect, but it's watchable. In this film, Peter Lorre (you may remember him from Casablanca, among other things) plays the semi-main character Hans Beckert. I say semi-main character because he's the character that the entire film is built on, but he has a miraculously small amount of screen time when you get right down to it. Hans Beckert is a serial killer and it's hinted about that he's a pedophile. It also says he is on the back cover, so I assume that he is. If someone could go get Lorre from 1931 and bring him into the future, every Hollywood director making a film about a serial killer would cast him. He's such a bug-eyed, creepy looking dude he fits the part so well. In the beginning of the film, we hover above some kids as they play a game. This game is a typical children's game, but the words they chant are a little more sinister than you'd expect. A few minutes later, one of the girls is kidnapped and killed. For the record, no murder is ever seen onscreen. You don't even get as far as seeing Beckert leading his victim off the screen and suddenly hearing screaming. Because of Beckert, the city is in turmoil. The police are desperately hunting the man down and so is the German underworld. Police raids are frequent and police are walking around so much, it's keeping other criminals from doing what they do best. The title \\"M\\" comes from a scene in the film where a man is following Beckert and is able to mark his jacket with the letter \\"M\\" (short for murderer) to follow him more easily. This is not a movie you'd rent for enjoyment; It's a movie you should check out, so you can say you've seen it. It's not a movie that will rub everybody the right way and it's certainly not the best film ever made, but it's ahead-of-it's-time cinematography and speeches (especially Lorre's at the end) make it worth it. <br /> <br />GRADE: B-
0553583182|5.0|It doesn't sound like the people you list as reasons \\"not\\" to read this book, actually read \\"this\\" book. There is a big difference, in my opinion, of putting positive affirmations in your mind, versus a witch doctor. And quite honestly, it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in \\"conjuction\\" with medical care. Does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care, because you will most definitely be healed? No where. So in my opinion, one has to have a \\"sound\\" mind, and not view the book as a \\"cure all\\" for all the ills in life, but rather a positive way to \\"enhance\\" your life. It is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care, when you have a terminal illness, or any other illness for that matter. But according to what I gather from the book, you CAN use positive affirmations, and \\"believe\\" that you are getting well, to help keep yourself in a positive state, rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well. Studies aside from this book have PROVEN that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook, have done wonders for recovering patients, along with their medical care. Your review did not address any of those people that read this book, because the two examples of people you list, it is apparent they didn't read the book either, (not sure what compelled you to post here?) therefore you are not qualified, in my opinion, to critique this book, as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist, did they prescribe drinking snakes blood, too? Anyway, this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick, and those that do, probably won't be addressing their medical problem. Can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis? I imagine it can, (studies prove it can) in addition to proper medical treatment. Anyway, you might want to actually read the book, instead of making comments of what happened to \\"so and so\\" who didn't even read it or apply it, including yourself.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|It was through the grapevines, I heard about Ms. Rae. I bought her debut album upon listening to Put You Record On. To me, she seemed similar to India.Aire. She is when it comes to song themes and soulful upbringing, but she is definitely an artist seperate from the pack. Ms. Raw delivers eleven beautiful, chill tracks to which one can easily mellow out to. I am not particularly a jazz or blues fan, but I could tell that Ms. Rae has been influenced heavily by these art forms and their dieties. She used them as insprition to create a vocal art. Personally, my favorites are \\"Put Your Record On\\", \\"Like a Star\\", & \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\", but all the tracks have their way of touching you and transporting you to an etheral place.<br /><br />If you are a fan of this genre, Corinne Bailey Rae is a must have. If you enjoy artists who truly deliver worthwhile substance, this is a must have. If you long to be in a blues lounge and hear a soulful singer sweep you off your feet, this album will certainly take you there and it is certainly a must have.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|First time I saw this movie it was probably already in the middle somewhere. My first impression was that it was wierd and possibly stupid. A friend of mine at work was raving about it so when it popped up on cable again I sat all the way through it. Seemed wierd again but pretty funny. The third time was the charm. I sat through it again, this time looking forward to certain parts. Bottom line: this is a weird and very funny movie. Some people just aren't going to get it. If it's any help seeing where I'm coming from, I've probably watched \\"Groundhog Day\\" about 10 times. There's even some irony in that, don't you think? If you thought \\"Hee Haw\\" was funny, maybe this isn't your movie.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|Stephen Spielberg is one of our time's greatest directors.  The fact that he can balance out a real artistic vision while remaining unashamedly mainstream is truly remarkable.  Still, in movie after movie there is a groan-point.  A character will make a speech, or a scene dripping with sentimentality intrudes into what up that point has been a nearly perfect film (Schindler's List is a prime example, Saving Private Ryan also has its moments).  After so many years of watching Spielberg efforts however, I'm throwing in the towel.  Spielberg, I'm convinced, doesn't do this out of calculation; it's who he is:  an American director who loves nostalgia and sentiment.  And to be honest, to see the alternative is easy enough to do.  Spielberg is not David Lynch - a great, but weird, director.  No, he's Main Street without the teeming dark corners.  Oh, there's darkness with Spielberg, but light as well, and Hope.    So where does that leave Munich?  I think in a pretty good place.  The only \\"speech\\" that I heard, the kind that Spielberg cannot resist, popped up at the two hour mark, and it was pretty brief.  Something about revenge being endless.  (Still, I confess I'm mystified by those critics who have damned this movie because of its ambiguity.)  As usual, with Spielberg, great actors and performances, and a pretty fast moving movie for being close to three hours.  It grabs you from the first moment. My only real criticism is the way Spielberg chose to unveil the Munich massacre.  Dramatically it didn't seem to serve much purpose, since the event is unveiled in bits and pieces, with the climax (no pun intended) revealed while the chief Israeli assassin makes anguished love with his wife.  That just seemed weird - and not in a good David Lynch sort of way.  Just clunky.  I think a straightforward telling of the Munich attack would of worked just as well.  But it doesn't sink the movie, or irritate in the way past Spielberg moments have.  Definitely worth a watch, though I'm not sure it's the resonating piece on our times that Spielberg intended.
0070511136|5.0|The canon of Sales Lit goes back only a couple of decades.  In that canon, Neil Rackham's first \\"Spin Selling\\" takes a special place as one of the classics or founding texts.  So, if you need help preparing a meeting with one of your largest accounts, take the time to re-read this classic text.<br /><br />Sure, we all know how to ask questions, but Neil is the first to make the point that the wrong kinds of questions will more likely kill the deal than win it.<br /><br />Neil's classic distinction between \\"implicit\\" and \\"explicit\\" needs -- what I like to call \\"surface\\" vs. \\"deeply-held\\" need -- will help focus any salesperson's line of questioning.  With each deeply-held need uncovered, the likelihood of closing the sale rises exponentially.<br /><br />For instance, I recently went into a meeting with one of my largest accounts knowing the company needed an easy-to-use storage software solution.  If I based my proposal on this explicit need, the meeting would have gone nowhere fast.<br /><br />But, during the meeting, I uncovered the deeply-held needs that the software needed to work with the Mac and Linux OS's, and be localized for Chinese and Japanese, as the company was preparing for the Asian market.<br /><br />As I walked out of the meeting, I felt secure in the knowledge that I had uncovered more than three deeply-held needs.  Confident of my line of questioning in that meeting, the rest of the sales process went swimmingly.<br /><br />Anyone who manages large accounts needs to keep reading -- and re-reading -- Neil's classic text.
0786860707|5.0|I've never thought that this book can be as wonderful as it is. As a prospective animator, it was really useful to read it at the beginning of my studies, because it took me to the right direction. It takes animation so serious as I hoped. Unfortunately it hasn't been released in Hungarian, so I couldn't read it in my native language, but luckily it is easy to understand in English too. <br />It worths the money, because this is a handbook, that you don't read only once, but can be used anytime when it needed.  <br />The Illusion of Life tells about everything: the theory, the process, and also the people behind all this magic. <br />It is absolutely wonderful!!
B000024QML|5.0|Although I believe 1990's \\"Behaviour\\" to be Pet Shop Boys greatest offering to date, \\"Very\\" remains my personal favorite to this day. <br />I was 17 when I bought my first PSB album. I bought two at once. I bought them at Kmart. \\"Discography\\" and \\"Very\\". <br />I was taking a gamble. At that time I only knew the songs \\"West End Girls\\" and \\"Suburbia\\". <br />But I am so happy I bought them. Particularly with \\"Very\\". Aside from Discography or PopArt, this is a great album for people who are curious about the Pet Shop Boys. It's just a great pop album, I love every single track - every one. <br /> <br />I highly recommend to those who are only vaguely familiar with their music, and are considering owning something of theirs. This is the album to test the waters. And you'll love it!
020530902X|5.0|The Elements of Style makes grammatical research so easy, you'll want to look up things you'd always wondered about but thought would take too much time. Recently someone asked me about the use of the serial comma, and, as it was about text we were going to put on the dust jacket of a book, it was sufficiently important to look up. It turned out to be the second item in the Table of Contents. First you get the general rule, in this case \\"In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.\\" The example given is \\"gold, silver, or copper.\\" The sole exception is a series of names in a business: \\"Brown, Shipley and Co.\\" There! With thirty seconds effort, the issue was adjudicated. I can't recommend it highly enough. Thank God for the Fourth Edition. My Third Edition is dog-eared with use.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Thanks to all who wrote in to Amazon.com about this outstanding series.  We would never have heard of it otherwise.  My wife and I have been enjoying dramas like this for over 30 years on Masterpiece Theatre.  Now, we see where they've gone. <br />   Since the show runs 4 hours and is rather dark much of the time, it wouldn't make fun viewing on a rainy day.  Nevertheless, if you have the time and energy, this miniseries will reward you with a memorable experience. <br />   With the problems we have today a lot of people get depressed and angry.  Still, once you see a show like this you can be glad you didn't have the problems they had back in the 1850's when this story took place.  Grim working conditions, worse living conditions, disease, intolerance, and more.  There was no \\"safety net\\" for anyone. <br />   Despite all their problems, the characters in this drama show the type of courage and resiliency that give one hope for the future.  Amid the gloom and strain of everyday existence, the characters look for wisdom and understanding, and of course, love.  There are some similarities with the themes in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" as others have said.  But there's little of the sardonic humor you'll find in a Jane Austen piece.  This production shows mostly hard scrabble poverty and tough manual labor, but the happy ending makes it all worthwhile.  If anyone wondered where unions came from, to fight for decent wages and working conditions, look no further. <br />   Because dialogue can be hard to follow in places, viewers might want to switch on Subtitles.  Northern British accents are not what most of us are used to and their idioms and words can be difficult to follow.  These conditions aside what the characters say and do is worth knowing and the show rates 5 stars without doubt. <br />
B000BNNLN4|3.0|The wonderfully offbeat title and faux-primitive cover (even printed on socialist utility paperboard in the British edition) give a very good idea of the humor of this little book, and on this level it doesn't disappoint. Two sisters put aside their decades of quarreling to save their elderly father (an engineer obsessed with writing a History of Tractors) from marriage to a blowsy Ukrainian woman less than half his age, who sees his meager savings as her passport to the luxuries of the West. Lewycka is especially funny imitating the fractured English of either of these characters (the father himself is a postwar refugee from the Ukraine), and her ability to contrast the attitudes of the different generations of immigrants is right on target, as is her picture of middle-class life in the English provinces. The story skips deftly from one incident to another in a \\"You won't believe what she's done NOW\\" fashion, and its slight repetitiveness is offset by the author's ability to create interesting supporting characters and to keep shifting the balance of sympathies between the major ones.<br /><br />Lewycka has also been praised for her skill at using this little cautionary tale to reflect the family's sufferings in the political upheavals before and during WW2, but there I find her less successful. The quotations from the father's History (which turns out to be as much about tanks as tractors) are too oblique as a reference to the past, and the specific details of persecution and life in the camps come too late to really illuminate the modern story. But this is a most enjoyable book in its own terms, and any historical resonance is a bonus.
B000BGH22W|4.0|This is a very strong score.  It has some very memorable tracks, and a very nice waltz number.  Action pieces are also very good in this score.  Personally, I am a fan of John Williams and I still think that the score to Harry Potter and the Prionser of Azkaban is the BEST Harry Potter score EVER. PERIOD. NO questions asked.  Azkaban had so many good strong themes, it has become  a cult classic score for me. You MUST buy that score.  The score to Goblet of Fire is a very good score, but if you have to buy just one Harry Potter score, well--buy Azkaban. And if you buy two, try Goblet of Fire out. Four stars out of five for GOF.
B0007OASII|5.0|Can you think of a song that has \\"that part\\"? A particular riff or vocal hook, maybe kicking the song into high gear. A part which is executed just right, so that your spine tingles, and you just think... \\"wow\\". It's totally electrifying.  That's when you know that a band has (temporarily) mastered the art of songwriting.  Usually these times are few and far between. Then there's Kamelot's The Black Halo. Along with various other fine qualities, almost every song on the album has at least one of those parts. <br /> <br />Leaving the realm of the abstract, let's see a few specific reasons why Kamelot stands above the rest.  First of all, the vocals by Khan are absolutely amazing.  He doesn't give into one of the biggest crimes of progressive/power metal:  wailing.  While well-respected singers like Geoff Tate and James LaBrie (along with numerous wannabes) often try too hard to hit the ear-piercing upper upper upper register, Khan shows incredible melodic ability while staying in a pitch range that isn't painful to listen to.  Also, Kamelot features none of the synthesizer cheese that sinks much of the competition (Andromeda and Sonata Arctica come to mind).  All of the keyboards are tastefully done, including some beautiful piano work.  Finally, Casey Grillo adds power and rhythm to the songs with his drumming while using the double bass machine gun drumming only sparingly.  \\"When the Lights are Down\\" is the only song where such drumming is noticable.  Better vocals and keyboards than prog, and everything better than power metal.  These guys shouldn't even be classified, since they lack the assumed flaws of those genres. <br /> <br />Ok, now you know why Kamelot didn't screw up.  Here's how they truly became something special: <br />1) Guitars.  I haven't mentioned this instrument yet, since quality guitar work is fairly essential to success in this style of music (in other words, most power/prog bands don't mess it up).  But of course, Kamelot is not to be bested.Thomas Youngblood never seems to run out of inspiration for killer guitar riffs, although they don't overpower the rest of the music. If you want pure lightning speed, just look to \\"Nothing Ever Dies\\". Or maybe you want a chugging march, the obvious choice would be \\"March of Mephisto\\". I could go on, but take my word for it, every song (minus the interludes and Abandoned) has a memorable guitar part that rarely takes a back seat- this is true metal! <br /> <br />2) Power.  These guys really love to combine the bass drum with a crunching guitar riff.  It creates a strong rhythm that you can easily bang your head to, while knowing in the back of your mind that it still isn't caveman music. The title track is a good example.  This album is what I was hoping for when I first heard the term \\"power metal\\". <br /> <br />3) Atmosphere.  The choir chants in the background add an epic (but not cheesy) tone to several of the songs, as do the keyboards.  And the band seems to have a total understanding of the human mind, knowing when to build up to a climax (Memento Mori does this amazingly), or drop off and give the listener moment to catch their breath.  The latter often being done with the interludes. <br /> <br />4) Depth. When I first listened to this album, \\"The Haunting\\" and \\"The Black Halo\\" were my immediate favorites. The incredible chorus of the former, and the pounding rhythm of the latter made them easy to spot as great songs. But with time, I began noticing how great the other songs were, too. Each in time making it to the top of my playlist for at least a while.  And every few listens I pick up on a new layer to the song that wasn't immediately noticable. <br /> <br />Add all of this together and you have, in my opinion, the greatest album of the new millennium.  The only album to challenge it is Dream Theater's \\"Images & Words\\", which rather than try to compare to The Black Halo, I will simply dub the best album of the 90s.  And I would definitely give this one the thumbs up over their previous release, epica (although some may dispute that), which was also a good album but didn't draw me in as much. This stuff just can't be beat.  If I were pressed to choose the best songs, I would go with \\"Memento Mori\\", \\"The Haunting\\", \\"Moonlight\\", and \\"March of Mephisto\\".  But there isn't a single weak track on here. <br /> <br />Buy this album!
0156027321|5.0|Piscine Moter Patel-- known to all as Pi Patel (Pi=3.14) (Martel 22-23)-- is the son of a local zoo owner in Pondicherry, India, and is preparing to move to Canada in a cargo ship-- with a boat- full of animals. After a few days in the cargo ship, Pi notices some water coming into the boat. He tells the crew and they shove him into a life boat. He, a hyena, a zebra, an orangatan, and a tiger made it to the ship. None of his family, none of the crew, and no other animals survived; they were all asleap, unable to believe Pi, or locked in their cages.  <br /> <br />In the ship, the hyena ate the orangatan and the zebra, and Richard Parker, the Tiger, ate the hyena. So, only Pi and Richard Parker were left on the ship. Then, Pi found a locker full of essentials to surviving in the middle of the ocean. It contained food; water; solar stills, devices that turn salt water; a survival manual, along with other survival essentials.  <br /> <br />But Pi still had to deal with Richard Parker. He had to get the tiger some meat in order to keep himself alive. But that was easier said than done for Pi, as he had been a vegetarian all his life. He still did it, though; he wasn't too upset, as he did it not for himself but for Richard Parker. But the time came when the bicuits, the item of food in the locker, became scarce and the ever- vegetarian Pi had to eat meat. So he continued to catch the fish and began to eat meat.  <br /> <br />Richard Parker was still there, so Pi would have to prey to Allah, his many Hindu gods, and Jesus Christ, that he would make it to land without Richard Parker eating him. <br /> <br />In THE LIFE OF PI, Yann Martel describes everything beautifully, and emotionally. In this way, it was amazing. It is very emotional, and everything you need for a good book. THE LIFE OF PI deserves a 6 out of 5. Great book! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXRM|5.0|About two years ago I was in a thrift store checking out the good stuff, as I was heading out I walked past a TV set that was playing \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou\\".  I was stopped in my tracks and stood there for half an hour just mesmerized while watching the video. Talk about totally different and totally enjoyable, I couldn't belive it, it reminded me of a time in the 1940s while living in South Carolina. I returned the next day and bought the video. Now I have the concert \\"Down From the Mountain\\" <br />and also the CD Music and the \\"O Brother\\" song book. The music is just out of this world. I've turned into a Bluegrass junkie.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Queen is Dead is The Smiths Greatest Record. <br /> <br />This album, which is full of stories about intellectuals, stay-at-homes, cry-babies and runaways will endear you to each ones plight, as Morrissey becomes the martyr to the hopeless and voices their confusion and sorrow.  Indeed he even sings \\"Now I know how Joan of Arc felt!\\" <br /> <br />Morrissey's lyrics- well, poetry really, speaks astutely on a wide range of feelings from alienation to bitterness to flippant joy.  And all of it is surrounded by the excellent guitar work by the brilliant Johnny Marr, who never sounded so earth shaking until this record. <br /> <br />I'll go on file as saying that \\"Cemetary Gates\\" is one of the greatest songs ever penned.  \\"They were born, and then they lived, and then they died.  Seems so unfair, I want to cry.\\"   <br /> <br />This album is very dear to my heart and I do listen to it frequently.  And each time it positively crushes me when I hear \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out\\".  If anyone is interested in buying a real record with real artistry on it then you must buy this album.  Five Stars. <br /> <br />_
B000HA4W4S|5.0|It's not often that a new band that had a GREAT first CD can follow it with an equally amazing second CD. But Scissor Sisters HAS done it. I thought it was great after the first listen, but it just gets better and better with each listen. Not only are the tunes catchy enough to remember, but after a few listens, the lyrics stay with you as well. It might take those few listens to get all the lyrics, but it is definitely worth it. 3 words: BUY THIS CD!!!! You won't be sorry! Great job Sisters!!!
B000002UB6|3.0|When George Martin was asked if he wanted his name as the producer of this album, he replied, \\"Sure, and then you can put overproduced by Phil Spector\\". The Beatles intended Get Back, or Let It Be, as it was finnished, to be pure rock without overdubs and that junk. Thanks to Phil Spector and his \\"Wall of Sound\\", this back to the basics album was ruined. The only part that sounded live was the studio chatter in between songs. Although it wasn't that good for beginers, some of these songs would have been better. \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Dig a Pony\\" are good raw, as presented. Then, in 2003, the seldom played Let It Be Naked... was released, the way it was intended. If you want REAL Beatles' music, buy Let It Be Naked... and get your money's worth.
B0000457HB|5.0|A truly gifted singer you could/can count on for providing strong yet delicate recordings. This double CD arrangement is perfect for any versatile music goer. Sensational background sounds at almost any workplace or leisure. Especially inspiring for that special evening with your mate having smoked oysters and wine by the fire or whatever suits your fancy. A wonderful source of music for any occasion. Highly recommended.
B00005JNS0|5.0|We have taken our two boys, ages 5 and three, to see this movie a total of four times in various theaters since its release. I personally have never paid money to see any movie more than once in the theater, especially now when movies are released so soon onto DVD. We all loved it and can't wait for the DVD. My five year old is just beginning to play team sports and really got the \\"winning isn't the most important thing\\" concept and we have referred to it often. My three year old had never made it past the first hour of other Curious George and Ice Age 2 type movies which resort to simple slapstick comedy. He not only made it completey through Cars, which is longer than most animation movies, but sat through the touching and funny credits at the end. I used to live in the Southwest so I really enjoyed the scenery, which was amazingly accurate, and now we have committed to taking one of our first family road trips along Route 66. Maybe we'll buy this amazing soundtrack for the trip?

Avoid at all costs!
B000HEWEE4|1.0|THE LAKE HOUSE fails on so many levels that it's tough to pin down one thing viewers will dislike the most. Be it the multiple unexplained fantasy elements, or the lame acting, or the dumb-downed plot, this film will most likely make you shoot popcorn out of your nose, not in laughter, but because of incredulity.<br /><br />A time-traveling mailbox (and, apparently, canine) bind two lonely souls together at a lake house. The place was built by Simon Wyler (Christopher Plummer, INSIDE MAN) for his now deceased wife. Being a successful architect, his sons fall into the family business too. One of these is Alex (Keanu Reeves, THE MATRIX), who purchases the house in 2004. Trouble is, though, the house is already owned ...in 2006. Not usually a problem, but apparently these two years in time are connected somehow. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock, CRASH) is the 2006 year owner and has just sold the place. She leaves a note for the new owner to send all mail to her forwarded address. But the mail gets picked up in 2004 by Alex, who's confused about the date she put on her message. When he sticks his reply in the mailbox, Kate picks it up ...in 2006, two years later. The two form an \\"across-time\\" romance, trying to meet up in Kate's year but failing. They do bump into one another in 2004 but neither realizes the importance of it.<br /><br />Okay, let's start with the basic problems: Why these two and why a mailbox? The two individuals chosen for this event may be overlooked as mere coincidence. But the mailbox? Please!<br /><br />Kate and Alex are separated by two years in time but brought together by the mailbox. The big issue here is that neither of them find this even remotely disturbing or incredible. They just accept it. The assumption must be that the script and director wanted to move on to the \\"more interesting\\" love story surrounding the two protagonists. The problem here, though, is that the romance is anything but interesting. It's distant (like the years that separate them), and rushed, and poorly acted. Bullock and Reeves had more chemistry in SPEED (that ought to tell you a lot!).<br /><br />Time travel movies are tough to pull off to begin with, and the challenge for most of them is avoiding the paradox they create. The Lake House doesn't even TRY to address this problem and simply plows ahead without considering the intelligence of its audience. For instance, at one point Kate (in 2006) goes to an architects office and discovers some disturbing news. She rushes out to try and prevent it from happening by sending Alex a letter. And they do avoid the disastrous event. The trouble is, though, is that if it's avoided, then there never was an event to begin with because Alex avoided it in 2004, thus, in 2006, there wouldn't have been this problem for Kate to worry about. Some may not be bothered by this, but many scientists must be pretty ticked-off that the film doesn't address this issue.<br /><br />And the final tragedy is the acting. Both Reeves and Bullock CAN act. We've seen them do it. But here they are bland, boring, and completely unsympathetic. Even Christopher Plummer's character seemed forced and poorly thought out.<br /><br />Need a sleep aid?

B000001FYL|5.0|It's hard to classify this album in a genre, but musically it is a benchmark album that sets a standard that few can reach. What sets it apart from Bon Jovi (the band) records, is that it doesn't sound so polished and commercially viable. This is real, heartfelt compilation of songs that speak of life and anyone with a soul could relate to a few of these. \\"Santa Fe\\" is one of the greatest songs, lyrically and musically, that I have ever heard. It takes you to a state of mind that few songs do. The movie was decent, but it pales in comparison to this album. I wouldn't buy this album because of the movie, i would buy the movie because of the album.

B00006RJHG|5.0|Black Christmas is one of a kind. Great cinematography, flawless acting, great directing, wonderful use of color. I bought this movie after Deron Miller (singer of hard rock band CKY) acclaimed it to be one of his favorites. The first time I watched it, I didn't think much of it, though the ending was creepy. With repeated viewings I have come to see what a masterpiece it really is. There are no plotholes; everything works together perfectly. The unique camera direction throughout leads to a genuine sense of urgency. Your heart rate quickens and your eyes go without blinking for minutes at a time. It's one of those where you want to scream at the character to not go in there (yet you realize that you'd probably end up doing the same thing).

B000G75AE8|2.0|I love Slayer and have for years however other then the first track on here, I just didnt feel it with this album. Alot of it just sounds fast for the sake of being fast..Where are those riffs that make you want to throw a relative from a ten story window? A joke folks but as much as some people on here whine about God Hates Us All, I find that alubm much more interesting then this one. People whine about how Tom's voice was \\"jarring\\" and \\"grating\\" on God Hates. Look if you want phantom of the opera go somewhere else. Tom isnt a singer but what I like about his vocals is the feeling behind them. He honestly sounds like someone in torment..screaming and not giving a damn what people think about it.. I respect the brutality of it, most fans do. Look if you like Slayer then buy this album..however I will have to agree with one of the above commentaries, Jeff needs to start writing some material again. I think he balanced Kerry out, so hopefully that will happen sometime in the future.
B000E33VWW|5.0|if you can get by the at times irritating,mannerisms of Miller(which are almost exactly like the real Capote-hence -great acting)you're infor a treat into the human psyche. Capote's guilt feelings at using 2 murderous losers,playing and pumping them for \\"gory details\\"about their vicious crime,are an overwhelming undercurrent through the whole movie.He never wrote another book after,In Cold Blood because he had aroused his own demons and had to wash them in alcoholic abuse after the book.The highlight of the movie came for me when Capote decides by himself to name the book In Cold Blood and then lies to the 2 murderers and tells them he has no title for the book.Obviuosly he is afraid that if he tells them they won't give him the harrowing complete story of the murders.The 2 murderes are forced to endure Capote's visits as are caged animals at the zoo and Capote even feeds Perry Smith his favorite staple,Aspirin.Nothing like using one's press pass for a free bestseller sort of like insider trading? Capote revels his true self when he informs the police chief,\\"Idon't care if they commited the murders or not I just want an interview with them\\". The police chief is offended,\\"Well I do care\\"!! An emotional outburst that is refreshing as compared to Capote's coolness. Later Capote feigns cold indifference toward Perry Smith on whether Smith gives him details of the killings or not.Is it time to withhold Smith's Aspirin?In reality Capote needs the savage details to finnish his book, indeed the book would be mildly interesting without these details and Capote needs a bestseller.The murderers are using Capote to get a light sentence but do they know Capote is using them to write a best-seller?<br />Probably but it is their last chance to if not escape the gallows then at least to confess and pay the penalty so justice is served.Maybe their last chance for a fresh start in the next world?The final scene as the scafflod trap door bangs make for a gruesome end to the tale.Maybe something also died inCapote as Perry Smith shot through the trapdoor,like his self respect? TrumanCapote wanted to write a piece of classic literature but instead he had to suffice with writing the first true crime novel,the only thing lacking by today's standards --shocking pictures which the authors say are placed for outrage,but in reality are put in to enhance and SELL MORE BOOKS!mething also died inCapote as Perry Smith shot through the trapdoor,like his self respect?

B0002IQHY8|5.0|Before reading this review, I want to take a few seconds to tell all those who will listen to the album: Do not listen to any of the older Project works immediately before this. The reason why people have given this album 1 star or less is generally because they expect the old \\"Project\\" lineup or the old sound. You're not going to get the old-style project stuff with this album. Which is why I rated it 5 stars. <br /> <br />Now that that's out of the way, \\"A Valid Path\\" is a good way to start back up after 5 years. The album, taken on it's own merits, has excellent production and excellent engineering.  <br /> <br />Starting off with \\"Return To Tunguska\\", Alan brings in an old ally in David Gilmour to start and drive the album. It's ethereal and edged, and quite wonderful to listen to. <br /> <br />The next two are the weaker links of the album, the P.J. Olsson song \\"More Lost Without You\\", which would work well on a P.J. Olsson album, but not necessarily on this album; and \\"Mammagamma '04\\", which starts out great but ends up not doing as well. The credit that I can give to Jeremy Parsons on this remix, however, is that it is probably one of the best coast driving songs that one could ever play.  <br /> <br />\\"We Play The Game\\" is a homerun on an album which has two outs already. Excellent engineering, help from members of the Crystal Method, and Alan singing on his own...let's just say that this song is the one that really gets the rest of the album going. <br /> <br />\\"Tijuaniac\\" is an instrumental ditty that takes you down a level. The song makes you feel like you're in a cigar bar, relaxing, not doing anything. It's a slow feel song, written by members of the Nortec Collection. It's just a nice song, with one small area of hard screechiness to wake you up from your slumber in time to catch the rest of the song, and it's eventual mix with the next track, \\"L'Arc en Ciel\\".  <br /> <br />\\"L'Arc en Ciel\\" is a mix of soft and hard, techno and straight up driving sound. With help from Tim \\"Q\\" Wiles (aka Uberzone), he helps to make an ethereal yet edged song that would please anyone driving down the Pacific Coast.  <br /> <br />\\"A Recurring Dream Within A Dream\\", a remix of \\"The Raven\\" and \\"A Dream Within A Dream\\", is as close to the old Project as one would expect on this album. With Parsons doing most of the guitar work, the bass, vocals and Jeremy Parsons doing a lot of mixing, this one becomes a real treat to listen to. And besides, who doesn't like hearing Orson Welles resurrected?  <br /> <br />\\"You Can Run\\" is this album's equivalent of \\"Back Against The Wall\\" from \\"Try Anything Once\\", a song that seems out of place, but isn't. David Pack takes the lead on this, and the entire song is good, though it probably would have worked a lot better if it was placed after \\"Mammagamma 04\\".  <br /> <br />The final cut, this which is the penultimate, is \\"Chomolungma\\". For those who don't know, Chomolunga is the Tibetan name for Mount Everest. And this song does effectively conjure up the image of Mt. Everest, and maybe more the people around it. The keyboards in the middle have a Tibetan flavor to them, the vocals have a semi-chant feel to them, overall it is an imaginative instrumental (if one can really call it that). And with John Cleese at the end to wake you up, you can just go rampant. <br /> <br />Overall, the album is great, though it does have some hits or misses. But this is what happens when you take time out to reinvent, get married, and really take a good look at yourself.  <br /> <br />And, as a repeat just in case everyone missed it at the top: If you're looking for classic \\"Alan Parsons Project\\" stuff on this album, you probably will not find it. This album is something completely different, and if you're willing to give it a chance, do so. (and check out their live concert, too. It's an experience.)

B000GFLAI0|5.0|Yes, Bob Dylan is back and he has his act together. This cd is 5 stars and then some. Every song is good.
B000GRUS22|1.0|I was so excited over this new album because I am a big enigma fan. But after hearing this album, I must say that I am very disappointed. Where is enigma in this enigma album? Where are the lush sounds? Where are the female vocalists? Where are Sandra's whispers? Where are the great song interludes of e3? Where are the great melodies of e2 and e3? Where is the singing? Where did Ruth Ann go? Where are the lyrics? Where are the sounds of nature? Why is the album so techno like this? Where is the enigma I can listen to before I go to sleep? This is like the stuff I listen to when I am working out. I thought I was listening to Paul okenfold throughout this album or some other club music. The only semblance of enigma in this album is goodbye Milky Way. This is very disappointing. If you thought voyageur was a radical departure from what enigma meant to you, wait till you hear this album. At least voyageur had nice melodies and great vocals. Boom boom, voyageur, following the sun, and in the shadow and in the light were all great songs. This album has nothing to offer besides goodbye Milky Way. The rest you can hear while you're on the treadmill or bench-pressing. The music on this album is not bad. It's just overall monotonic, dull, repetitive, and colorless. Hello and welcome did not need to be on the album. It is out of place and boring as heck. Things get a bit less boring with the alchemist and feel me heaven because they are hypnotic and uplifting. Some have commented that Michael cretu is not about repeating the same stuff over again, and that's great. But there is good creativity and then there is mediocre creativity. E2 is not like e1, yet both are beautiful in their own unique way. E3 is not like the previous two, and yet it is almost better than them. Good creativity is always appreciated. In fact, e3 was the pinnacle of enigma's magic and creativity. Then came e4, which has only 2 memorable tracks (gravity of love and push the limits)--note that each of the first 3 enigma albums had SEVERAL memorable tracks. How many tracks from e6 will one remember a few years from now? Possibly one and that is goodbye Milky Way. The fans who appreciated voyageur will probably also remember invisible love; Other than that, everything on this album if easily forgettable.     Word for the wise: if you want to listen to a posteriori for what it is, then skip it and get a paul okenfauld cd or listen to hypnotized by okenfold. Better yet, get something by BT or Ian van dahl or something...Now if you want to listen to a posteriori for what enigma is, then brace yourself for a major disappointment.     Moreover, this album does not come across as a collaborative effort for 2 reasons:    1-enigma doesn't sing here. It's just cretu who sings. Michael cretu has a great voice and knows how to use it--think of why, beyond the invisible, the roundabout, out of the deep. However, if cretu is to present an enigma work, then he should include the vocals of other enigma members. Otherwise, he should go solo and present the album as a solo work. There are 3 lyrical songs on this album: sitting on the moon, invisible love, and goodbye Milky Way. The first one, sitting on the moon, pales next to why and out of the deep--two songs that were also sang by cretu alone. It is very popish and commercial. The second one has a nice haunting melody but has only 8 words worth of lyrics (rescue me, my love, my invisible love, follow you....); the third is great and has the hallmarks of enigma: spirituality, enchantment, melody, and mystery. Listening to this album leaves you begging for lyrics. You would listen and listen hoping for a whisper, a chant, and some lyrics. Of course enigma is not just about singing but also about music, and I enjoy that a lot. However, the instrumental tracks here are not soothing like the smell of desire or traces (both from e4).     The alchemist and Andromeda have a gorgeous rhythm and a beautifully haunting whaling sound to them; yet those two tracks are begging for lyrics. They would have been great if andru and Sandra's vocals were infused into them.     2-monotonality:  Dreaming of Andromeda and the alchemist are really one song. Eppur si muove and 20,000 miles are one song. The rest is just redundant, which leaves one wondering whether the artistic input of gad, Sandra, Donald's, and Ruth was included. It really seems that Michael cretu made this album as one long track on a single long summer afternoon; I am sure he worked on it more than that but that is the impression one gets even after several complete listens.    I am all for innovation. But make it good innovation. Otherwise, stick to what you do best. I feel that many people would be more than happy to hear a new enigma album that would apply the same tricks and sounds of e3, e1 and e2 to new melodies and new lyrics. Old good tricks are better than new mediocre tricks.    I keep editing this review because every time I listen to this album, in an attempt to appreciate it, I get more disappointment and feel a bitter yearning for the enigma of e1, e2, and e3--heck even enigma of e4 and e5 would have been great. Fortunately, e1, e2 and e3 are timeless so I can keep listening to them until enigma returns, or until Michael cretu quits the Look of Today and returns to the classic and timeless enigma he introduced to us and kept us yearning for.    Message for cretu: if you no longer have it in you, just go solo or stop. Nobody is perfect. Good writers stop when they have nothing good to write; it is called writers' block. Please do not tarnish the beautiful image of enigma with this trance/club/metro sexual lounge/club music; leave that stuff to the DJs, and at least spare us the sweet memory of the earlier albums.      I am giving this album one star because I am observing the high standards that Michael cretu has set up for enigma.     The Milky Way is staying; it's enigma that has left us...     Goodbye enigma    P.S:    to those whoare giving this album 4 stars:    do you realize that the screen behind the mirror got 4 stars? when you give this album 4 stars, do you realize that you are equating it to the screen behind the mirror? and if you are, is it fair to do so? how can you equate the gravity of love, push the limits, silence must be heard and traces to the stuff on this album? please consider objectivity and SINCERITY in reviewing this album so that michael cretu would understand that his older work is indeed better; this in turn would hopefully influence his next enigma album. some of you criticize the album and then go ahead and give it 4 stars. this is ridiculous!!! please put your stars where your mouth is. if you give 4 stars whether the album is good or mediocre, then how do you expect the maker/artist to take your reviews seriously when he/she is making their next album?    thank you
B0009QZ4CE|5.0|After nearly imploding from the stress associated with the intense tours of Italy in 1972, VDGG disbanded only to regroup for this great 1975 effort.  Although the liner notes indicate that there were significant stumbling blocks when the music was first being put together, you would never know by listening to the compositions, all of which are strong.<br /><br />The lineup on this album includes Peter Hammill (vocals, piano, acoustic/electric guitar); Hugh Banton (Hammond organ, piano, synthesizers, bass guitar); David Jackson (saxophones and flute); and excellent drummer Guy Evans.  The performances are very good all around and Peter Hammill's aggressive vocal style is in great form.<br /><br />In contrast with classic albums such as Pawn Hearts (1971), this album may not be musically as experimental and far-reaching but it still makes for a challenging listening experience.  This is especially apparent in David Jackson's playing, which is also somewhat tamed down - he does not unleash the \\"free-jazzish\\" explosions of atonal notes on his saxophone as he did on earlier albums.  I suppose this all sounds like I am complaining although I am not.  There are some fantastic compositions on this album, and melodies are actually used very well.  Overall, the VDGG \\"thing\\" is still present, albeit in a somewhat toned down manner - they seemed to want to loosen up, even if only a tiny bit.<br /><br />In addition to the original tracks, this superb EMI remaster features two live bonus tracks including Forsaken Gardens (12'23\\") and A Louse is not a Home (10'26\\") - this track was originally featured on Peter's solo album The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage.  Although the sound quality is pretty rough, the performances are out of this world and recall the band at their heaviest.  One thing I feel compelled to point out is that the improved sound quality has really brought out the subtleties of Guy Evan's incredible drumming.  In fact, all of the remastered VDGG albums are like that - it is just a shame they waited so long to remaster the catalog, Guy is just fantastic.  In addition, the liner notes are extremely informative and feature a ton of pictures of the band (black and white).<br /><br />This is a fantastic album from this period of VDGG and is highly recommended along with H to He, He who am the only One (1970); Pawn Hearts (1971); and Still Life (1976), which is a personal favorite.  World Record (1976) is the last 1970s album to feature the classic lineup, although it is not nearly as good as Godbluff or Still Life.hame they waited so long to remaster the catalog, Guy is just fantastic.

B000B8QEYC|3.0|I first heard \\"Orinoco Flow\\" in a department store at the tender age of twelve, and have been bewitched ever since by the sheer magic of Enya's music. I can think of no singer I admire or love more and, with the possible exception of Loreena McKennitt, no one whose music can touch so many different emotions. So I was thrilled when \\"Amarantine\\" was released, and popped it into my CD player the first chance I got, expecting to be bewitched again. And it truly saddens me to say that I wasn't.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - it's not a bad CD. I would still rather listen to \\"Amarantine\\" than Hilary Duff any day. But given the choice between \\"Amarantine\\" and \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" there's no question that my choice would be the latter. The truth is, \\"Amarantine\\" feels like a rehash of \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" and not a very inspired one either. The parallels are easy to draw. \\"It's in the Rain\\" is \\"Wild Child,\\" \\"Long Long Journey\\" is \\"On My Way Home\\" (okay, not on \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" but that's what it sounds like), \\"Amarantine\\" is \\"Flora's Secret,\\" and \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" is \\"One By One.\\" And with the partial exception of a few tracks (\\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" and \\"Less Than a Pearl,\\" for example), they all lack that unnameable quality that can tug at your heart like nothing else.<br /><br />Granted, it is interesting to compare the parallel songs. \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" stands out particularly, because it takes the exact opposite stance from \\"One By One.\\" Where that song's refrain was \\"Don't say goodbye,\\" this one asks, \\"Is there a reason why you never want to say goodbye?\\" It helps that of all the album's songs, \\"Someone Said Goodbye\\" sounds the most like Enya inspired, Enya at her best. Too many of the other songs suffer from either not-very-compelling music or lyrics far more pedestrian than we're used to hearing that pull the music down. I love Enya for her ethereal music, her entrancing voice, and lyrics like those in \\"Only Time\\" - lyrics that mean something. Words like \\"I wonder how you can endure/All I've said, all I say to you\\" sound out-of-place on an Enya CD. Let me say it again: this is not a bad CD. But it's nowhere near the magic that Enya is capable of.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it's not fair to expect her to produce ten gems every time she releases a CD. Everyone has to have their not-so-good moments, even enchantresses of song like Enya. In the meantime, I'll keep my fingers crossed that this average CD is the end of her less-than-inspired period, and play \\"Paint the Sky With Stars\\" over and over until she releases another album.ords like \\"I wonder how you can endure/All I've said, all I say to you\\" sound out-of-place on an Enya CD.

B00081U6EG|3.0|The overall DVD is ok but does lack some real hot tracks that would be expected from this type of production.  Hank Marvin backed by his son has three great tracks with excellent musicianship and production making these tracks hidden gems.  \\"Sleepwalk\\" was incredible and \\"Apache\\" still has some kick to it as both benefit from excellent arranging and performances by the back up musicians.  David Gilmour was fabulous as usual and if Pink Floyd etherial rock and roll is your calling (it is mine) then he will not disappoint.  Enjoy what is there and don't worry about the other weak performances.
0739453793|5.0|Dear M. McMillin, your defense of faith gives no evidence of you having read the book you reviewed. It seems to me, that your only goal was to place a bad feedback, not an evaluation of the content. <br />Lichtenberg, a german writer of the 18th century, once observed: \\"It is really a miracle, that people prefer to kill for their faith than living according to it. <br />Sam Harris points out that most religions contain dogmas of intolerance and hatred towards others (siding commandments of love for others). This is the reason he feels, religious faith is ethically inadequate. <br />At one point he remarks, that faith is the resource (when reason fails) to keep stuck on certain ideas. Or in other words: When our reason tells us, something cannot or should not be, we use faith to avoid an update of our attitude. <br />As I feel, you used your faith to avoid understand the book.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|The movie is very intense, disturbing with lots of slice and dice blood and gore. It still is a very entertaining movie. The unique style of filming which blends comic book style visuals with very dark overtone, makes the movie an excellent choice for the comic book enthusiast. The story line is good - but not great. There are weak threads in the movie which though not absolutely necessary, do weaken the fabric of the movie. The characters are excellent and very well developed and at the end of the movie you feel like you just read a 200 pages intense comic book with some richly designed visuals. If cannibalism, unnecessary killing and every other psycho habit that you can think of - disturbs you, then do not watch this flick. If you're thicks skinned, get this!
B0000256VK|5.0|Roxy Music's final hour was characterized by lush atmospherics similar to Joy Division or Tears for Fears. I love \\"Avalon\\" because it is so strikingly different from everything else that they have recorded. \\"For Your Pleasure\\" is one of the greatest albums of the 70s, but \\"Avalon\\" definitely tops the 80s list. <br />     It is haunting, austere, and sparse. It is like the band died of natural causes and this album acts as a ghostly afterthought. It has been 24 years since its release, and it still gives me chills.  It is the aural equivalent of those brisk October nights when the leaves change in the half-light.The depth of emotion is unrivaled in albums from the 80s or any other decade for that matter.It will certainly haunt me for the rest of my life.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Wow, this movie was great!  I can't believe so many people have panned it.  I am a lifetime comics fan and love Alan Moore.  I read V for Vendetta when it came out, and it didn't grab me as much as his other work.  I think this film actually improves upon the source material, and does it with syle and panache.  The political commentary is dead on, and the updating of the story has strengthend it considerably.  The film raises important issues about fear, freedom, judgement, censorship and terrorism.  This film is well worth owning.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Loved this CD!  If you enjoy Ella and Louis (Isn't This A Lovely Day) and other jazz artists with a nod to BigBand you will MORE than enjoy this.  I am empressed with her musical range and the fact that she takes risks.  Plus, she plays the piano on most of the songs.  Again, loved it.
B000002U88|5.0|No Bob Seger fan should do without this album and \\"Its A Mystery\\" The man never makes bad music. Its timeless. We need more of his style of music.
B00006FDCD|2.0|I know, I know it's from 1990 and was made for tv... but man!! <br /> <br />Some good things: the kids, eventhough not great actors, they at least fit with the characters in the book, Pennywise is pretty scary,....that's about it! <br /> <br />AT LOT worst then I remembered, the book is so good that a B-movie (Z-movie) is just not good enough.
B000001FYZ|3.0|Ok, as a big Scorpions fan, this album still confuses me. The overall sound is horrible, I can't understand how Scorpions couldn't achieve a cleaner production. <br /> <br />Some of the songs are good, but if you wanna hear a better version of them buy \\"Live bites\\". There you have a rescued Tease me, please me; Hit between the eyes and Crazy world. I never realized how these tracks really rocked until I listened to them live. <br /> <br />Don't believe her started the tradition of boring No.2 tracks (which continues until now) for Scorpions albums. Yes, Scorpions biggest hit appears here, the so called Wind of Change. I remember how exciting was to first hear this song on the radio and say: \\"Wow! It's Scorpions! It's on the radio!\\" and then just hate it for hearing it every second, everywhere. It was just too much. Besides, this is not Scorpions best ballad, Walking on the edge or Lady starlight (just two examples among many many others) deserve much more attention than this one. Ok it was the symbol of the perestroika generation, but it's so sappy that I can't listen to it again. Besides, it also started a generation of Scorpions \\"love and peace\\" songs (Under the same sun, Does anyone know, White dove) that I just can't begin to like. <br /> <br />Anyway, this record represents the first flaw in many many time for the Scorpions, and the beginning of their 90's evident decadence.
B00005JP87|5.0|I am astounded at the negative reviews that The Illusionist received!  With all of the stupidity and indiscriminant violence out there on the screen, this movie was like a breath of fresh air!<br /><br />This was a visually beautiful period piece, with real sets combined with sepia-tinted film to give it the quality of an old movie.<br /><br />Edward Norton is at his best as the Illusionist.  I am one that feels Norton can show intensity without being bipolar or violent with someone.  He portrays it subtly as Eisenheim through his eyes.  Paul Giamatti is , as usual, great in his role as the chief inspector and Jessica Biel also good as the duchess.<br /><br />I also like the political play betweeen Eisenheim and Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell).<br /><br />This movie is full of mystery, romance, and spirit with castles, horses and buggys and a hauntingly beautiful soundtract.<br /><br />I loved it, have seen it twice and I'd go again. Highest recommendation. best of '06, so far.

B000000IV0|5.0|I've just read several reviews,and well, just don't understand. Don't mix up Cobain with Einstien for genius sake. Kurt was a huge Beatle and most notably a John Lennon fan, and a Zeppelin fan(he covered the \\"Immigrant Song\\" in early set's). So why are people uncapable of bridging the gaps. Nevermind came out in the early ninety's and people still passionately hate it or love it, which really says something about it's impact. Nirvana was just an honest group of musicians that were true to themselves and thier music. Should Kurt have never picked up a guitar because he's not going to become a virtuoso, oh no. Maybe all musicians and songwriters should just give up, cause we already have metullica (just shoot me now!). As for guitar solos some songs believe it or not don't need a two minute guitar break. Nirvana's showcase was their music and the songs. It was a different time back then, Mike\\"the Yikes\\"Jackson finally got booted off the top of the chart's with this album, and some real instrumental music finally got more exposure. More alternative radio stations started poping up, the face of MTV finally changed, and it was all a welcomed one. Say what you want, this album is part of the original music of the ninety's, heck it was a musical revolution!
B000G75AE8|3.0|What more needs to be said that hasn't already? Yeah, Slayer is back but with this \\"return to the original lineup\\" I was hoping for more grip Inc like drumming from Lombardo and somemore innovation on the guitar rythms and vocal placement. After making fans wait so long each time for albums these are way too short. after repeated listens God hates us all simply rages compared to this. The lyrics read like they were written in front of the TV. Still.....who can pummel heavier than Slayer? i saw them on the Unholy Alliance tour and they played a killer set list and will always be Thrash titans.
B000F6IOC0|2.0|Compared to the first one OR measured on it's own, this movie was a disappointment.  More blood, nudity, violence, swearing, and sex than the first movie, less plot and characterization.
B000002MX7|4.0|Hey--I really liked this CD, it gives a good overview of Chaka Khan's music in 16 short tracks.  I usually don't buy compilations or \\"best ofs\\" because they usually don't have all the best hits, but this one does to me!  I was a little girl in the 80s, and this CD is reminiscent of all the big hits like \\"I Feel For You,\\" of course and stuff before that (a little before my time, like her stuff with Rufus) and it just takes you through the whole Chaka era, to her now \\"jazzy\\" stlye, which also is great and totally her!      Good Buy--where's volume 2? :)
B000001FFJ|5.0|I'd only like to add a personal note to the many reviews which rightfully praise this masterpiece of sound. My first daughter was born in 1988. Awaiting a second back surgery, I was forced to wear a cumbersome backbrace - in fact, I would never lift my darlin' from the crib, for security's sake. I would often sit in the rocking chair, and my wife would hand me my little girl. Then, I'd press the 'play button' (boom boxes, remember?) and I'd rock her to sleep with Tom Wait's 'Time', with her a-slurpin' on her bottle. <br />As she left for college this year (Aug 06), she down-loaded \\"Time\\", to keep that underspoken, mysterious father-daughter bond together. <br />That makes Raindogs/Time very special to me. Oh, to shake this artist's hand!
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I can certainly see why some of the \\"hardcore\\" AFI fans don't like this album, or STS for that matter.  However, I am also a \\"hardcore\\" AFI fan, and I love everything they've ever put out.  Why?  Because I can understand why a band would need to be progressive with their music to avoid being lumped into a specific genre.  Tastes change with everyone and musicians are no different.  They have always had a wide range of influences, and they have always wanted to tap into them.  Besides the fact that they are not 15 anymore.  How ridiculous would it be to watch a 30 year old man scream about wanting a mohawk but his mother not letting him get one?  Come on.  I am one of those that has aged along with them, so the differences between this album and the early ones feel perfectly natural to me.  Yes, this album is \\"catchy\\"...but is that really a bad thing?  Don't these guys deserve some recognition after toiling in the underground for 15 years?  They've worked incredibly hard to get to where they are today, and just because they are on MTV all of a sudden does not make them \\"sellouts\\".  You want sellout?  How about Fall Out Boy, or Yellowcard, or Hawthorne Heights.....none of these bands have been together long enough to forge a decent following without the help of MTV or Teen Beat magazine.  So please don't lump AFI into the same category as those bands just because you are pissed off that they don't perform Cereal Wars in concert anymore. <br />But, like I said, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and you certainly can't please everybody all the time, but AFI will have a loyal fan in myself until the day I die.  No matter WHAT they put out....because my respect for them transcends labels and trends. <br /> <br />That being said, give Decemberunderground a chance....the album is fantastic, and it truly does show their maturity and talent.  I'm thoroughly convinced that Davey could write a soliloquy on styrofoam and it would sound beautiful, poetic and relevant.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Never having had much desire to see this movie, I was pleasantly surprized at how much I liked it.  Those of you who like the Matrix, Kate Beckinsdale, Vampires, or Werewolves will probably not be disappointed.  Good characterization and plotline.  Wouldn't be afraid to let your teenagers watch as there is no sex scenes, limited gore, and swearing.
B00006D295|1.0|This is just awful. And I mean spine-tingingly bad. The songs are so terrible and so insistent that it makes you feel like kicking the TV in. The idea of the film is certainly interesting....certainly if it weren't played out as a musical. But it is and you can just see some of the actors baffled as to the sheer stupidity of what their doing. Some such as Tim Curry revel in the sheer nonsense this film provides. But seriously, those songs are beyond awful. My hatred for them rivals having to listen to Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights and that's intense. But Kate Bush has made some great songs so that's OK. This however, is the movie equivalent of getting an axe through your spinal cord. How it's achieved cult status is something that will have to go down on the peculiar habits of humans.  <br /> <br />One to buy if you're an eccentric soul who loves to hear people singing out of tune, out of key and with little regard to anything other trying to sound funny when it clearly isn't. In short if you like those Simpsons episodes where there's not 5 seconds without launching into another song. Or if you're one of those people who thinks the idea of transvestites/men-in-drag appealing then this is for you. Or alternatively you are one f***ed up masochistic person. The DVD is there - enjoy....or rather endure
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />When I first saw the preview, I thought \\"What a fantastic idea!\\" movies about Ancient Greece seemed rare to me (not being a fanatic, or knowing of the older movies)<br /><br />I knew once the movie was over that it was very poor... and it took me a few more viewings to realize how horrible it was.<br /><br />First off, the music is all middle-eastern sounding. I realize Troy is in western Asia-ish (like around ancient Pergamum and such) and such, but come one, this music sounded like a day in the deserts of Arabia. More suited for Kingdom of Heaven or Hidalgo.<br /><br />Historical accuracy?  You'd find a fair share more in something like Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven (not to bash the films, simply pointing out that they aren't very accurate). Agammemnon and Menelaus are portrayed as fat greedy villains interested only in themselves, the Trojans portrayed as noblemen and upright in every way (even Paris, who in mythology, was sly as a fox), and Achilles as a moody drama queen! He's stubborn and arrogant and stuck-up and very very rude, like when he told that poor boy in Thessalonica, \\"That's why no one will remember your name\\" when the boy said he was afraid of the Thessalonican warrior sent to fight Achilles.<br /><br />The battle which was supposed to be 10 years, seemed to last less than a month, with most of that time being the 12 days they gave peace for Hector's death! In the entire movie, none of the characters change in appearance---Peter O'Toole's Priam looks on the verge of death, without any change, Agammemnon doesn't gray, no one changes in what is supposed to be 10 years, and the way the movie passes makes it seem like each passing day is just that; one passing day. Agammemnon and Menelaus survive in mythology, yet both die in this movie, probably because they were the \\"bad guys\\" in the film.<br /><br />This is a big one: Mythology. This movie seems to spit in the face of mythology, use Homer's book pages as toilet paper, and then throw up venom on the sheer \\"coolness\\" of the legend of Troy. The legend of Achilles being immortal and his only weakness being his heel is sneered at, when Paris shoots Achilles through the heel, we think \\"WOW! the legend! His heel is his only weak spot!\\" hence the term \\"Achilles Heel\\" meaning our greatest weakness...<br /><br />Then Achilles gets shot five times in the chest. So to the average viewer, who knows nothing about Achilles's legend, what do you think kills Achilles, a shot in the heel, or five shots in the chest?<br /><br />That plus the callous way in which the director--through characters like Hector and Achilles and such--seem to treat the Gods like crap, and doesn't portray their influence at all, as opposed to say \\"Alexander\\", which gives the Gods a light, dubious touch, such as showing hints of Zeus watching over him (the Eagle). The Trojans constantly claim the Gods are on their side, and the pompous way in which they say it seems to make you envision the director going \\"Pfft, what idiots! believing in the Gods of their time, HAH! Jesus Christ our lord and savior is the only God and THEY should've known that! So they die for their heresy! DIE DIE DIE!\\"<br /><br />Another big problem is something that also messed up the game Warcraft III. It is TOO HERO-BASED. In the movie, so much emphasis is placed on heroes like Achilles and Hector, that the armies pretty much play absolutely no role at all in the movie! It doesn't matter that the Greeks outnumber the Trojans 2 or 3 to 1, they absolutely can't win without Achilles!!! It doesn't matter that the Trojans are defended by epic walls and the best archers in the world, they can't win without Hector!!!<br /><br />All in all, a very poor put-together movie, with a kind of stubborn negative and childish mentality towards the ways, beliefs, and customs of the times, pretty much re-writing the legend of Troy to make it more marketable to audiences who want to gawk at Brad Pitt naked (yes, he's naked several times for no real reason) and the amount of men they can cram into one shot. The acting is wooden, and hearing Achilles whine and sass like a snotty teenage girl just irritates.  The characters are portrayed all wrong, the Gods and the Myths aren't just ignored---they're subtly cursed and treaded and stomped in the mud.<br /><br />The legend was torn open, the parts the director liked picked apart, and made more Hollywood-friendly for the money.more marketable to audiences who want to gawk at Brad Pitt naked (yes, he's naked several times for no real reason) and the amount of men they can cram into one shot.

B000GRUS22|4.0|The hype before the Voyageur album release allowed my expectations to be too high before I bought it, so much so I can't listen to it at all. All this when Chimera and Conjure One were being released at the same time. These two albums met my high expectations, and exceeded them.  So when I try Voyageur for the first time with all the excitement and anticipation I had on every previous Enigma, my jaw hit the floor, I couldn't, nor wouldn't believe that this was an authentic work of the same guy that did 4 prior enigma albums. I posted my review, telling people to call the police because Cretu was being impersonated, poorly... and the real one may be in need of rescue. I think they may have done their job. <br /> <br />Anyway, A Posteriori, with my expectations already low, I came into this one a little skeptical, but it was enough to separate $17 from my wallet to try it. I must say that this is much better than Voyageur. I haven't listened to it enough times for it to hook me yet, but I am beginning to feel something pulling me in for what may turn out to be a very enjoyable ride.  <br /> <br />My advice for this one, is don't set expectations unrealistically high, not quite as emersive as the earlier albums, as others had posted this is a new direction away from the past works. Buy it, when the mood is right, play it completely through even if it doesn't seem like you expect, then again the next day. Soon you will find yourself craving more. Weird. <br /> <br />Anyway, glad to have this album. <br /> <br />Enigma Bob
B000024C7W|5.0|I remember waiting for this album to hit the UK stores after just loving \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\". Quite a surprise, but a few plays later I was hooked. This soundtrack is more like a journey, serenading us with some of the most beautiful ballads and instrumentals Mr. Wonder has recorded (IMHO).<br /><br />\\"Come back as a Flower\\" still gives me goose-bumps, \\"Same old Story\\", the title track and \\"Black Orchid\\" are stand-outs.<br /><br />At the time, critics panned this work, but almost 30yrs later, things have changed. This title is well worth tracking down or splashing out for an import. There are still some new ones out there!!
B000H305U0|4.0|I LOVE this CD! While his last CD Justified pays homage to Michael Jackson's sound, this one has Prince written all over it. I like every single song on this CD & that's rare these days. Justin & his producer Timbaland are a fantastic team & I hope they continue to work together in the future.
B000GCFO0I|2.0|SILENT HILL is based on a series of \\"survival\\" video games, and anyone familiar with SILENT HILL the game will probably appreciate SILENT HILL the movie, but for the rest of us SILENT HILL becomes a wearying, unvarying, plotless stumble through a world of atmospheric horror.<br /><br />Rose Da Silva and her daughter Sharon visit the town of Silent Hill to find out the Why of Sharon's recurrent nightmares about the town, which at first appears deserted but is densely populated by wraiths, giant arachnids, faceless zombies, eyeless walking corpses, and other grotesques, all trapped in some congruent dimension into which Rose and Sharon are drawn. When Sharon vanishes, Rose is forced to search Silent Hill for her daughter. Rose's search finally leads her to Sharon's kidnappers, a bizarre religious cult that is dedicated to burning demons alive---of course, Rose and Sharon qualify as demons. And although the cult are the bad guys of the film, there seems to be no connection between them and the various monsters Rose has to fight to find Sharon, meaning that three quarters of SILENT HILL has nothing to do with itself.<br /><br />The major problem with SILENT HILL is that it simply isn't frightening, its just gross. Rating a 25 on the 1-10 gross-out meter, SILENT HILL even loses its effectiveness as a nausea-inducing, \\"Ewwww!\\"-producing movie because the grossness becomes predictable. Nothing shocks because the last scene was so yucky it becomes a safe assumption that the next scene is going to be even yuckier, and it always is.<br /><br />A film largely geared to fans of the video game who will give it five by five, SILENT HILL gets one star for its atmospherics, which are appropriately dark, and another star for actress Radha Mitchell (Rose) who carries most of this film on her slender shoulders alone, seems convincing in the midst of this pointless chaos, and looks good doing it.
B000G759LW|4.0|Ms. Aguilera is by far the best young vocalist out there today. I've been a fan of hers since she first came on the scene & I respect the fact that she's not afraid to take risks & do different things. Of course, when you can blow like she can, it's hard to make a lot of mistakes! I love that she pays homage to musical greats like Etta, Billie & Ella while putting a modern spin on things.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|Hello everybody, <br />First, bravo N.Stock for stating exactly what's on my mind, but I need to put my own version as well: After watching that picture, I felt physically hurt as Star Trek fan. <br /> <br />Thank you producers for making this movie. Thank you for still being able to regroup every member of the cast for this cause (after the series' end in 1994 (!)). I have great respect for all the work you did to have this movie done. To me, you did mess up big time though while making it: <br /> <br />Beware of spoilers! <br /> <br />- How come Deanna & Will marry after just a little adrenaline-induced making out in previous \\"Insurrection?\\" Doesn't fit with seven years of \\"not while we're on the same ship...\\"-talk. <br />- Another Data-type android is found...again! 2nd and counting... <br />- The car chase was cool but nah, too old for Star Trek. (Bad lightning by the way, phaser shots almost weren't seen.) <br />- Shinzon & co appear way too \\"We're gonna be the bad guys\\" during their first scene. <br />- I get the clone part but why must there be a Deanna rape? Only to explain her accessing the villain's mind during the final battle? <br />- Romulans are there but not there. <br />- Silly chanceless space battle. It's the Enterprise for God's sake! I'm tired of seeing that ship in every movie either understaffed, under shielded, unprepared or under armed! <br />- Enterprise almost self-destructed (again). <br />- Data dies without \\"downloading\\" his katra and leaves a silly replica. Bad ending! <br />- Whole flick is about Picard & Data. Again! <br /> <br />As long as the story sucks, I don't care about up-to-date special effects, I don't care that the bridge is built on actual shaking surfaces and it doesn't matter to me how many millions of $ were involved in making that project. Granted, maybe I find some things silly because I didn't understand them but it's just my opinion. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing young Kirk & Spock in the next film and hope that really well fitting actors will be found for these characters... Cheers! <br />
B000002J1O|5.0|One of the first albums I ever acquired by Genesis, and contains the one song that started my love for the band.<br /><br />One day in school my friend was playing \\"Dancing With the Moonlit Knight\\" on my acoustic guitar. Never hearing it before, I was curious of what it was. He gave me a youtube address to a live performance of this song. When I heard it, I had to watch it over and over and over. Every part of this song fascinated me. It starts with a undeniable beauty that is Gabriels voice, and a renaissance-esc guitar style of Hackett's that bring you in. On the intro to the second verse, when you hear that loud piano chord and Gabriel yells \\"Citizens of hope and glory...\\" it gives you sense of uncontrolable edge. It makes you want to stand up and belt these words! And then when it all grows the \\"Captain leads his dance...\\" part you'll be on the edge of you seat, until it concludes with \\"Knights of the Greenshield stamp and shout!\\" The song is long from over, and the rest is different versions of what you already hear, which keeps it interesting. Completely amazing song.<br /><br />\\"I Know What I Like\\" is afterwards, with a fun melody and words to live by. I always get into the part where Gabriel speaks the voice of the lawnmower. It seems to me like complete poetry. Nothing at all bad about this track.<br /><br />\\"Firth of Fifth\\" is a must for any Genesis fans. The words are great, Banks piano ballad in the beginning is spectacular, and the long solo in the middle is such a familiarizing melody.<br /><br />\\"More Fool Me\\" is the second song with Phil singing. I don't know why a lot of hardcore Genesis fans knock Phil Collins, especially after singing this song. Its so beautiful, the words working perfect with his falsetto. Now if I could only find a correct guitar tablature for this, I'd die happy.<br /><br />Now, I know a lot of people love \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\", and listening to it I know why. It just doesn't appeal to me very much. I do, though, highly respect Gabriels urges for story telling, which make him a great performer.<br /><br />\\"After the Ordeal\\" is a powerful instrumental, with that medieval-esc theme reused. It fits so well in the album. It leads up to the ballad of \\"The Cinema Show\\", a completely wonderful song. I have a hard time sitting through the instrumental part after all the singing, but its worth it to hear the transition into the final song.<br /><br />\\"Aisle of Plenty\\" is a  short refrain of \\"Dancing...\\" and finishes this album perfectly. Sometimes I tend to wonder if this should be a concept album, because it has the idea of one. But the best concept album is next. Anyways, this song ends with Gabriel reading his grocery list, supposedly. And fades out to end the record.<br /><br />This should be one of the first albums to help you get into Gabriel era Genesis. Its still a must especially for the first song. Put this baby on your list!!ough, highly respect Gabriels urges for story telling, which make him a great performer.  <br /> <br />\\"After the Ordeal\\" is a powerful instrumental, with that medieval-esc theme reused.

0375751513|4.0|Wilde creates a Faustian plot where Dorian Gray wishes to never grow old, and gives up his soul to do so. Basil Hallward paints a portrait of Gray - the portrait ages while Gray retains his youth. Standard fare from Wilde full of quotable lines and quips. Flows well with interesting turns in the plot. Recommended.
B000002J1S|5.0|In my opinion, the greatest album by Genesis. Probably, one of the best albums I've ever heard.<br /><br />The only thing I would advice is to listen to it a lot before you make a judgement. When I first listened to it, I only liked a select number of songs. And then I put it down for a while, but when I picked it back up again, I grew to love every song on the album.<br /><br />It begins with Banks entering this album with a piano part that would catch even the most anti-Genesis person. The self titled song is a great entrance, with Gabriel telling the life of young Rael, a Puerto Rican punk on the streets on NYC. I've heard a live performance of this with the Peter Gabriel Band, and it sounds a lot better sped up. Very powerful.<br /><br />\\"Fly on a Windshield/ Broadway Melody of 1974\\" continue this story, begins soft, becoming powerful, and ends with one of the most engenius poetry I've ever heard. I actually read \\"Broadway Melody of 1974\\" on the radio when I was on my towns local station.<br /><br />\\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\" is one of the first songs I really enjoyed. The muffled vocals and Hackett's amazing chord work really leave you with a sense and beauty. And the piano behind the song only add to the resonance of this gem. Then comes \\"In the Cage\\", which is one of those songs that I liked the second time around. Its a great song, and my favorite part is in the middle where Rael is calling out to his brother.<br /><br />\\"The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\\" was another first love of mine, with its Eno-esc vocals. The beat and the robotic rythm makes you want to...march! I can just imagine this factory the song is talking about in my head while listening to it.<br /><br />\\"Back in NYC\\" and \\"Hairless Heart\\" are great songs, thanks to the efforts of Tony Banks' keyboard. Gabriel carries \\"Back in NYC\\" with very angry, powerful words. It gives you more of a sense of character. But it all leads up to \\"Counting Out Time\\" which carries a very happy feel with it. This song is the reason I bought a kazoo.<br /><br />But \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" is my top favorite song of this album. The piano chords and the vocals mesh so well. It all leads up to an incredible chorus, with such a catchy melody. I wouldn't be suprised if anyone bought this whole album for THIS song. This side of the album ends on \\"The Chamber of 32 Doors\\", which has a great story, and ends on a very concluding chord.<br /><br />The second half of the album isn't as good compared to the first. Its mostly filled with unnecessary instrumentals. But the gems in this side make up for the rest. Theres the invigorating \\"Lilywhite Lilith\\", the sweet ballad of \\"The Lamia\\" and the great story of \\"The Colony of Slipperman\\". The song \\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway\\" also gives such a compelling story, in which the music build up with the questions Rael is asking in his head: Should he enter the portal and return to his every day life, or save his Brother John, who had recently abandoned him. What comes next tells the tale of all the things Rael has learned from his experiences. The album concluded with \\"It\\" which is really not about the story, but about it. Life. Everything. The best way to end any concept album.<br /><br />The key thing to do is not listen to the story of the the whole album at first. Its confusing, and really hard to follow. They have synopsises on-line, and they barely help too. I'm still trying to get the timeline of events correct. Its only a relic of how genius Gabriel really was.<br /><br />If you want to get into Gabriel era Genesis, this should be your first album. It combines all these different styles of their past years into one magnificent album. Its only depressing to know that this ends the era that was Peter Gabriel Genesis.<br /><br />Thats what this album is though, a Relic. Go and buy it.it.

B000G759LW|5.0|Christina Aguilera's new album deserves high marks for its top notch quality of music.  Her decision to work with \\"Primo\\" on numerous tracks on her album turns out a major success.  Tracks such as \\"On Our Way\\", \\"Understand\\", and \\"Without You\\" are instant classics and will be listened to for decades to come.  Artists like Christina transcend temporal boundaries.  What a bonafide diva and artist she is.  A talent like her comes once in a generation, and this album fully displays her potential.
B000002J1L|5.0|Superb. Genius. Genesis does it again. For their third album, they seem to only be getting better.<br /><br />This album begins with one of my favorite Genesis songs ever. The Musical Box, about an old man who cannot forget the love of his murderer, begins with  the use of four chords that resemble that of an actually Musical Box. The chemistry after that of Gabriels voice and Hackett's guitar works so well, and lulls you into a sense of security. What hooked me to this song was the part where it speaks \\"Play me my song, here it comes again\\", a sweet little diddy which was very catchy. Then it builds to a powerful guitar/organ part, where Hackett rips one of my favorite Genesis solos ever. At the end, if you've ever watched the Genesis Live footage, you can picture Gabriel motioning his hands during the \\"Brush back your hair\\" part, which is perfect because he is such a show man. I especially love the part where he and the organ make a chord together on the word doubt (During the \\"Casting doubt on all I have to say\\" part) that sounds so powerful, and it just wants to make you stand up. And then the song ends. Amazing.<br /><br />For Absent Friends is Collins vocal debut with Genesis, and is a very simple ballad, very pretty. I love his falsetto. Then comes the \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\", which is a much heavier song, while Hackett taps and Banks spreads the organ. Its a wonderful song, kind of gets dull as it goes on for so long, but its worth listening to.<br /><br />Seven Stones and Harlequin are two songs I don't listen to as much, but should. THey are wonderful ballads, just like For Absent Friends, and remind you destinctly that Gabriel has a beautiful voice.<br /><br />Harold the Barrell caught my attention directly when I first heard it. Its a very fun and silly song, with a melody that everyone can get use to. Then at the end you realize its about a guy who kills himself! Which gives you almost a pleasure yet very eerie feeling. You can't decide wether to laugh or to cry.<br /><br />But the Fountain of Salmacis is such a great song. Built of Mythology, as Tony Banks usually enjoys, it mixes power and smooth vocals to wow you the entire 7:54 duration of the song. It ends with a very concluding chord.<br /><br />This album is a must if you are interested in Gabriel era Genesis, especially if you want a more earlier feel. But in my opinion, the best is still to come!ether to laugh or to cry. <br /> <br />But the Fountain of Salmacis is such a great song.

B000JVT092|5.0|If you have the original and not the HD version its definately worth getting the HD version.  <br /> <br />Visual: The movie itself has a great deal of color throughout and the HD DVD version really brings out the richness of these colors. Sometimes its so rich he looks cartoon like (which I noticed when I saw it at the IMAX but not at home with the original).  <br /> <br />Sound: \\"If you listen carefully you may be lucky enough to hear the faint pop of the sonic boom\\"... When that shuttle popped I thought I was at the IMAX again. The sound was ridiculously good. There was so much power and not that loud over bearing noise but powerfull crisp sound. <br /> <br />This is one of those movies that watching it in HD makes the experience soo much better. Im so glad I doubled up on this one because it really brings out the ability of my entertainment center. <br /> <br />
B000002J1M|4.0|Foxtrot is, I believe, the third or fourth album I picked up after discovering Genesis. I've always been glad I did, mostly for ONE song, and that would be Supper's Ready.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself. This album begins with a song I first heard on the record LIVE. Watcher of the Skies adds itself to my library of amazing songs because of the heavy build up of the organ until the verse, where Peter Gabriel belts the word \\"Watcher of the Skies watcher of all\\", and by then I always realize I have my fist up in the air. Then I always get pumped when the bass plays with the verse that starts \\"Judge not this race by empty remains\\". What a glorious way to start off an album.<br /><br />Time Table is next, and it is certainly a ballad I really enjoy, where Gabriel speaks of the old times, a lot like the references used in the album \\"Selling England by the Pound\\". And then comes \\"Get 'Em Out by Friday\\", which I must admit, is not my favorite Genesis song. I know its a favorite of many others, and its a song I can listen to without changing the track, it just reminds me a lot of a simpler version of \\"Return of a the Giant Hogweed\\", but without the pizazz.<br /><br />Can-Utility and the Coastliner is an amazing song, mostly building itself up to the end when Gabriel is yelling out \\"See a little man with his face turning red. Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead.\\" And Steve Hackett's acoustic chord strumming reminds me a lot of \\"Dogs\\" by Pink Floyd. Very good.<br /><br />Horizons basically shows the genius of Hackett's classical playing. Very cool  song, easy to listen to, and reminds you of what the song is rightfully titled.<br /><br />But the best part of this album is at the end, with Supper's Ready. There is not one part that turns me away. It starts with a beautiful Octave Harmony between Peter and Phil, with Steve's graceful 12-string acoustic lines. The Garaunteed Eternal Sanctuary Man section follows afterward, and gives you the chills, because of the force behind the verses. It all build up after that to \\"Willow Farm\\", which is the silliest, yet incredibly genius part. I can always imagine that part with Gabriel wearing the flower costume and singing \\"Winston Churchill dressed in drag\\". Clearly genius. After that section, I wait for the end, with the refrain of \\"Gauranteed...\\" but with different lyrics, where Gabriel belts the word \\"Jerusalem\\". It leaves you with an overcoming emotion.<br /><br />All in all, its a great album, but I would personally listen to THe Lamb Lies Down on Broadway or Selling England by the Pound before this one.chills, because of the force behind the verses.

B000GPIPSS|5.0|and this 1931 classic version of \\"Dracula\\", for that matter!  This 75th anniversary edition has a stark B@W picture which reveals detail obscured in previous TV and video showings.  The sound contains a hiss which dissipates about 10 minutes before the end of the movie, raising the question as to why the whole audio could not have been cleaned up.  But, that aside, this movie is a real treat.  There are those who have said that it has not aged well in terms of pacing, acting and the fact that much of the horror happens off screen.  I argue that all these factors are what keep this film alive and in our collective consciousness.  The film is a surreal dream from start to finish, beginning in phantom-laced Transylvania and ending in the heart of London.  Even though the film does get a bit stagey and talky in the London sequences, it all make sense since the film is now in Van Helsing's world of words and logic.  Dracula must work extra hard to accomplish his vampiric aims in this ordered, Edwardian world, surrounded by learned men of science, so as not to be found out.  Of course, he fails. <br /> <br />The best scene in the film is undoubtedly the one between Van Helsing and Dracula.  The tension between the two before Van Helsing springs the crucifix on Dracula is masterfully directed and acted. <br /> <br />Lugosi will always be Dracula.  Not the Carradines, the Lees, the Oldmans, the Palances or any of the others who have donned the cape over the years will supplant him in the public imagination.  No small feat for someone who uttered the line, \\"I am Dracula\\" three quarters of a century ago.  Dracula does live forever after all! <br /> <br />A note about the Spanish version made at the same time as the Lugosi version.  It is NOT better than the Lugosi/Browning collaboration.  The Spanish version is overlong, clunky in its ability to link scenes together dramatically and overacted to the degree that everyone seems to be acting in their own film.  Renfield, in particular, needed some Ritalin if they had known about it then.  Even Eva doesn't seem interested in being connected to the film, just as long as she can do her own \\"emoting\\" (Lupita Tovar, the actress who played Eva admits in the documentary that the director just let her do her stuff with no direction!). <br /> <br />Finally, Carlos Villera as Dracula is just a ham.  'Nuff said. <br /> <br />
0393061434|5.0|This is a wonderful story, extremely well told.  The history of how Apple became Apple is a fairly familiar one by now but this book chronicles Steve Wozniak's personal journey from childhood up to the creation of the first PC, the founding of Apple, and beyond.   In the first few chapters, you get a glimpse into Steve Wozniak's childhood fascination with technology and the people who taught him early on.  Unlike many other biographies that list the dad as a primary influence, this book chronicles many humorous (and charming) stories of how Steve's father encouraged him in technology and more broadly, to think creatively and develop his own opinions.  Later, you get a clear sense of how his thinking evolved as he continually pushed the edges of the technological envelope to see what was possible, all juxtaposed against the technology that was available at the time, until he and Mr. Jobs quit their day jobs to found Apple. <br /> <br />I worried that this book would be too tech-y for me but it absolutely wasn't.  I definitely learned some things about technology along the way - there are clever sidebars throughout the book which explain the technology that is being discussed.  More than a technology book, this is a personal story - it is a warm and engaging narrative about one of the great geniuses of our time who invented something that we have trouble imagining life without!  What's really great about the way the book is written is that you get a clear sense of what Steve was thinking throughout his childhood - what struck him as interesting and fun and strange and beautiful - and that's what makes this book such a pleasure to read. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to everyone: people interested in Apple or technology more broadly will find it interesting to fill in the holes of what they've heard about Apple so far, people who want to know where this iPod phenomenon came from will learn something, and parents who want to inspire creativity and innovation in their children will definitely benefit too!
0743298020|4.0|When I purchased this book, I purchased it with the intent of fulfilling my ghost/thriller/mystery craving for the fall months. I was pleasantly surprised by a refreshingly different \\"ghost\\" story. Plenty of twists and unexpected turns through the lives of the Angelfield residents as well as Margaret herself. The only downfall is that I think there could've been more of Margaret's story built in to the book. I wanted more interaction with her mother and more of HER twin story. But other then that, well written novel.
0307346609|5.0|People who picked up this book based on the tongue-in-cheek humor of Brooks' previous book, The Zombie Survival Guide, will be completely taken aback by this very different, totally engaging volume. Arranged as a series of interviews with survivors, Brooks uses this book to chronicle the outbreak, fighting and resolution of a decade-long war in which humanity fights for survival against a plague of zombies. Part military chronicle, part survival tale and part good old-fashioned horror yarn, this book sucks you right in and entertains at virtually every turn.<br /><br />I hesitate to refer to this as a \\"novel,\\" as it doesn't really read like one, with a main storyline or even a single climax. Even though there's a chapter entitled \\"Turning Point,\\" it's hard to say where, exactly, the story hinges. Really, the book is a series of interconnected short stories, each one with its own element to add to the ongoing chronicle. Most of these are quite engaging -- such as the story of a downed pilot in the Louisiana swamp trying to get to safety amongst swarms of the undead, a computer whiz from Japan so enraptured by his online world that he doesn't notice when his entire country begins evacuating around him, the drug manufacturer whose placebo \\"vaccine\\" makes problems even worse, and the various political and military figures whose stories show the good and the bad of the war.<br /><br />This really is an incredible read, one of the best zombie books I've ever read. It's not an easy genre to translate to the printed page -- it works better in movies -- but this book nails it. It's smart, genuinely frightening and surprisingly realistic. Highly recommended.
B000001FA4|4.0|OK, first off let me say I'm not a big alternative rock fan - I prefer classic rock nine times of ten. But U2 (along with R.E.M., the Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam and Nirvana) gave me proof that alt-rock wasn't a total loss. And The Unforgettable Fire is a hell of an album. Highlights include Pride (In the Name of Love) - one of my favorite U2 songs, and certainly one of their best hits; chilling anti-drug ballad Bad; A Sort of Homecoming; the experimental Wire (a good showcase for Brian Eno's production) and the title song. I don't think I'll spin Elvis Presley and America, Promenade, or 4th of July again, and this is nowhere near the level that The Joshua Tree reached. But it's a good album.
B000E5KJI4|5.0|Despite the fact that Amazon says this movie has not yet been released, it has indeed been released to the public on HD DVD.<br /><br />This is a movie they I saw at the movie theaters multiple times, own on dvd and have watched the dvd & cable versions of it. Now that I also own the HD DVD version of this movie I can honestly say this is the best looking version of it I have! The difference between this and the dvd version is incredible. Owning a HD DVD player for this movie alone makes it worth it
B000GIXEIG|3.0|Admittedly, the fabulous scenery - and the hunky Gerard Butler - are the best things about Beowulf & Grendel. Shooting on rugged Icelandic locations, cinematographer Jan Kiesser provides some gorgeous wide screen vistas that give the film a visual power that goes a long way toward compensating for its narrative deficiencies and its penchant for silliness.  <br /> <br />The film itself has moments that are astonishingly dull and fractured - particularly in the first twenty minutes - with most of the action composed of lots of misty eyed running around on rocks and howling at sunsets. Obviously, this Canadian/British/Icelandic co production from director Sturla Gunnarsson is trying to be reality driven, but the movie in the end, suffers from a definitive lack of scope.  <br /> <br />The old English tale was majestic and epic, but this film ultimately lacks the grandeur and wit necessary to make the legend fully come alive. The Danish King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgård) has built a new \\"great hall\\" but the implacable, seemingly invincible giant troll Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurdsson) - seeking revenge for the murder of his father - is repeatedly attacking the King's people.  <br /> <br />Hero and warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) is recruited by his friend the King to rid his kingdom of this murderous troll. It isn't long before Beowulf figures he's being manipulated by a beautiful a witch portrayed by Sarah Polley - a dead-ringer for Cindi Lauper - who is particularly generous with her sexual favors and who also seems to be hiding secrets about Grendel's mysterious ways. <br /> <br />In order to make the film appear realistically hip, the script is spruced up with long stretches of what seems like Old English with unexpected bursts of cussing, profanity and gleeful vulgarity - Grendel is constantly referred to as a \\"f*cking troll\\" and Butler says something about him having a \\"hairy *ss!\\" But the language - when you can hear it through the accents - ends up feeling as misguided and somewhat gratuitous as just about everything else in the film.  <br /> <br />On the positive side, Beowulf & Grendel does a fairly good job of showing us how this old world functioned in the harsh and cold Nordic environment and how the onset of Chistianity was beginning to infiltrate the pagan Norse ways. Indeed Beowolf is quite sceptical of this new religion, whilst the sickly Hrothgar seeks to be baptised and ponders heavily on the truth of heaven.  <br /> <br />The performances are at least competent, with Butler looking appropriately earthy and sexy and heroic-like, although Polley is woefully miscast, appearing in her impeccably contemporary makeup, she makes the film's obviously noble ambitions go entertainingly awry.  <br /> <br />Grendel was obviously a murderer but he was also the son, father, lover, and playful child who enjoyed sumersaulting and bowling with human skulls. It's just a pity that this film doesn't really do him justice. All the protracted silliness that ensures along with the rather bland direction will ensure that even fans of the source material will be left scratching their heads in bewilderment.  Mike Leonard September 06.  <br />
B00003CXA2|1.0|The fuss over Forrest Gump still amazes me. This movie basically rips off better movies in almost every scene. Still somehow it managed to win Best Picture over Pulp Fiction And The Shawshank Redemption in 1994. Out of all of the movies that were released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20. Nobodys Fool, Quiz Show, The Lion King, and the list goes on. The only reason that I would give it props is for(at the time) was the special effects, which now are dated. After Gump Zemekis directed a episode of Tales From The Crypt where he used the same Technology and was easiest the worst episode of that year. I used to be a HUGE Zemekis fan. Used Cars, Romancing the Stone, Back to the Furture movies and Death Becomes Her were I thought were strong movies. But arounf Back to the Future 2  I thought Zemekis started to rely to much on special effects and it shows on this film. To the objective viewer re-watch this film and think about every scene and try to remember where you have seen that scene before. I guarantee you after you do that you will see this movie in a totally different light.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|In addition to such celebrated, award-winning or nominated films as THE PIANIST, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, Focus Features has released a number of gripping crime/suspense movies, including THE CONSTANT GARDENER, THE ICE HARVEST, HOLLYWOODLAND and BRICK, which I recently caught up with on DVD since it never played at any theaters near me. Being a fan of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, among others, I'll admit I came to see how well writer/director Rian Johnson worked the gimmick of having contemporary high-schoolers speak in hard-boiled pulp-fiction slang -- but I stayed because I was riveted by the sinister mystery plot and touched by the heartache under hero Brendan's tough-loner demeanor. Think of it as RIVER'S EDGE written by Hammett. Teenagers tend to have their own language and their own \\"outsiders vs. insiders\\" way of looking at the world anyway. As a result, BRICK's hard-boiled lingo and dangerous doings turn out to be a good fit in a California high school setting, especially one as low on sunshine as the San Clemente locations used here.<br /><br />The actors play it straight, inhabiting their roles with emotions that ring true in or out of a crime movie. Everybody's excellent, though I was particularly impressed with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Brendan (he's transitioning from child roles to young adult roles nicely; I look forward to seeing what his acting future holds), Matt O'Leary as Brendan's friend/sidekick The Brain, Lukas Haas as drug-dealer The Pin (love the fact that he runs his criminal empire from his perky mom's suburban home), Emilie de Ravin as Brendan's doomed love Emily (the flashbacks to their relationship show that outsider Brendan isn't always the easiest guy to get along with, which made their relationship all the more poignant for me), Meagan Good as another of Brendan's old flames, selfish Theater Club queen Kara, and Nora Zehetner in what I think of as The Mary Astor Role. I was also lucky enough to receive a copy of a collectors'-edition glossary of the argot used in BRICK. Ironically, the one word it doesn't define is \\"brick\\" (\\"drugs\\") itself. BRICK transcends its gimmick to be a tense yet touching thriller on its own terms; it's well worth a rental (good extras, too, including commentary by the director and cast, auditions, and deleted/extended scenes).nough to receive a copy of a collectors'-edition glossary of the argot used in BRICK.

B00005RHGK|2.0|This was a train wreck. If I hadn't recognized Justin's face from Dodgeball (ugh, another train wreck), I wouldn't have stopped clicking through the channels. When I saw him, I was interested in how he acted. Dodgeball was all I had seen him in, and I thought he was one of the better aspects of the movie. I hadn't been following his career, so seeing him in this film was new to me.    What intrigued me was the polarity of characters that Justin portrayed. One was a terrified teenager, running from your typical Freddy, Jason, Michael, etc. Seriously - there was absolutely nothing unique or interesting in the \\"bad guy\\" in this film. Who was he/she, and why did the delightful song \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" mean anything to him/her? Are you hard pressed to come up with a logical answer? Me too. This would have been better if the killer had popped out of a lake, or a meteor. Better yet, a cactus. That would have taken some intellect and creativity to resolve.    In Dodgeball, Justin was simply running scared because he was absolutely unathletic and didn't have a prayer in that silly game they played. (My opinion of the movie itself, for what it's worth, is, well, it was abysmall. Dogeball was rank. That said, the \\"gaffer\\" on that film probably made more in one month than I make in a year. Jerk.) Still, Justin made his character believable in Dodgeball, and honestly saved the film for me (although in such a tiny, minute fashion).     In Jeepers Creepers here he did the same, but to a greater extent. I never thought I'd tie two characters of such wildly divergent (B) movies together and say they did an excellent job, but I have to break rank here.     The female lead in \\"Jeepers Creepers\\", Gina Phillips was an extreme bore. This is unusual in boy/girl horror films. It's usually a given that the girl is favored. Not so here, and that says quite a bit about Justin's abilities. He's only 28, so he has quite a while to catch on to something huge. I hope he does. At the time of the filming of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" he was about 22. Success awaits. (And, lucky guy, he looks far younger than his years account for.)    Regarding the film - my lord, this was awful. How did it spawn (or spam) a sequel?? This movie was so lame I can't imagine it making any money on a sequel. Yet the sequel did better with Video Rentals than the original, so all in all it made more money. I've yet to see the sequel, but now am very interested in seeing it.    Coming back to the movie at hand...    I've read reviews where the reviewer has said that the \\"villain\\" was fully realized. I just have to add to this to that...\\"What?\\" Were they high? Seriously, the villain in this film was one of the absolute worst I've seen in any horror film. He had no genesis, no modus operandi - in short, he was simply some devilish form that really liked to kill teenagers. Let's all say it togather... \\"DUH\\"    There isn't much more to say. The movie was no good, but somehow made enough to spawn a sequel. (Blech.) I have a sinking feeling that the original lead actress contracted walking pneumonia and that her understudy played her role. Well, I *had* that \\"sinking feeling\\" until I just now when I looked her up on imdb.pro. I was happy to see that Justin has fared better than she has, which makes my semi-prediciton correct. Or, at best, it makes me that much more of a snot. Take your pick.     Being a snot is a bad thing. <grin>
B00006RCLQ|5.0|Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.<br /><br />That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.<br /><br />Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.<br /><br />Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them... but she can't escape from them forever.<br /><br />A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like \\"I don't want to be alone!\\").<br /><br />In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.<br /><br />The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. It was also the ending that has inspired creepy horror movies ever since. Suddenly the \\"invisibility\\" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand what it is that Mary is really running from.<br /><br />Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (\\"Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here\\") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.<br /><br />Brilliant and creepy, \\"Carnival of Souls\\" is a deserving cult classic.

B0002EXH4K|1.0|O.K. When I heard that Dave was going to remaster/re-release the Megadeth back catalog I got real excited. I still believe that this album is a true masterpiece, but when I bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version I was MORTIFIED!!!! What was Dave thinking when he decided to remix it. All it needed was to be beefed up just a little, but he went to great extremes to ruin it. I know Megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this, but the one thing I did remember is that the first time I heard Countdown... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills........period! I have regrets about buying all the remasters at once.......BIG MISTAKE!!! So in closing I went back and found the original versions of So Far...So Good...So What!, Rust in Peace, and of course Countdown to Extinction, and yes Capitol Punishment...The Megadeth Years. I'm glad that I was able to locate them.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|This is truly a spectacular film, but not for the reasons typically mentioned--such as the great cinematography or fantastic directing (although both are splendid).  What makes this film particularly good is the abstract story that is told.  This story is about the central principle that you are in control of your own life.  Even if you start with humble beginnings, you have the opportunity to rise through the ranks and be someone significant. (And in this case, it has to do with entering into nobility--no easy task!)  The second half of the movie has to do with Lyndon's downfalls.  This shows that even a person who rises through the ranks and is popular and wealthy can have a serious of setbacks.  Once you are at the top, there is no guarantee that you will always remain there.
0062502182|1.0|If you need 160 pages of drivel of the inspirational fable type, this book is definitely for you.   <br /> <br />If you understand and agree with the words \\"follow your heart\\" without 160 pages worth of words wrapped around them, you might enjoy this book.  It's a quick, fluffy read.   <br /> <br />If you don't agree that following your heart is the way to go, then unless you have a sociological interest in finding out why on earth this book has sold in the millions and what people read to feel better about life, then do all you can to avoid this sentimental, incoherent, cotton-candy pabulum.   <br /> <br />It worries me to know how many people have bought and read and loved and felt inspired by this book.  We obviously live in a world of evasion and denial, and a world where we are hungry for permission to do as we like, instead of as we ought to.
0307346609|4.0|Other reviewers are correct that Brooks approaches the problem posed by a zombie issue as a problem to be solved within the structure of modern global politics. In my opinion, the approach of focusing on the response to the zombie plague is more sophisticated and more timely than making an allegory of the zombies themselves.     It was Romero who took the voodoo myth of the reanimated corpse and popularized an idea of the zombie as a vessel for a communicable plague.  He identified a fundamental anxiety and created new monster in response to modern anxieties.  However, his use of the zombies as a critique of consumer culture isn't as fresh an observation as it might have been in the 70s, which is the most pertinent criticism of the recent \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" remake.     To the modern audience, the idea of zombies carries undercurrents of AIDS, biological warfare, and terrorism, and Brooks is one of the first to recognize and tap into that in an intelligent way. He's taken a specialized, genre subject and elevated it here to something that is literary. And while there will certainly be some who will be disappointed not to find the pages filled with endless descriptions of severed limbs and smashed brains, Brooks lays on enough of the biological details to keep the subject from becoming abstract, while keeping his focus aimed on something more significant.    As Brooks envisions it, the zombie plague encompasses the threat of terrorism and global war, natural catastrophes like Hurricane Katrina or the devastating tsunami, and global disease scares like avian flu and SARS.     There are two outcomes of a story about a zombie plague; either it consumes and annihilates humanity, or it is contained by the organized action of something like a government. As a domestic political parable, Brooks doesn't throw any hard punches. He envisions America triumphing over the zombies under a national unity government of both parties, with Colin Powell and Howard Dean as president andvice president respectively.     Powell and Dean are not named but are clearly identified, with Dean providing a narrative, in which he is identified as a \\"whacko\\" retired to Burlington, Vermont. He makes allusion to his rising political star and subsequent \\"meltdown,\\" and mentions the president's military training and Jamaican relatives.     I also think some readers may have misinterpreted the narratives about Israel. As I understood Brooks's narrative, in his \\"near future\\" Israel had unilaterally withdrawn from the West Bank behind a security barrier and the Palestinians had declared statehood in the territories. Brooks sees Israel as being the first nation to directly address the zombie outbreak by declaring a national quarantine, effectively made possible by the much-criticized barriers. Certainly Brooks's imagining of these events has a political undercurrent, but I'd see it as a center-right    While early in the book, a showy exertion of American military technology proves useless against the inexorable tide of the undead, but later on, it is the American military that adapts and develops the techniques to defeat the zombies.    Some may find it politically offensive that Brooks approaches the zombies as a problem simultaneously emerging globally, and paints the response to the problem from the perspective of people from various countries. However, the approach to emerging problems like communicable disease, terrorism and climate change as global has been broadly accepted by all but the most polar extremes of the politcal spectrum.     Several of the ideas are legitimately controversial. Brooks envisions Russia organizing as a sort of neo-Tsarist theocracy, and China pushing back the zombie tide only after a civil war which removes its establishment. Nuclear exchange occurs between Iran and Pakistan, emerging from a dispute over refugees from the plague, and Brooks explains this from the perspective of an Iranian diplomat who wryly suggests that traditionalenemies have the diplomatic mechanisms necessary to prevent nuclear war, while traditional allies would not be able to communicate in a dispute growing from a crisis.    The policy, implemented globally, which saves humanity is also disturbing, and Brooks treats it as such. Formulated by a calculating, almost sociopathic former policy-maker from apartheid South Africa, the plan calls for the abandonment of large swaths of the uninfected population to serve as bait to distract the zombies, while the military establishment and necessary personnel retreated to and secured defensible \\"safe zones.\\"    Perhaps Brooks's most radical position is the notion that the trappings of modern society must be abandoned in this kind of crisis. Professionals from the modern American service economy are re-trained by their former plumbers and housekeepers to perform the kind of tasks necessary in the wake of the zombie induced economic crash.     The military abandons its high-tech weaponry and communications mechanisms in favor of single-shot rifles, revolutionary-era firing formations, highly trained dogs, and multipurpose shovels called Lobotomizers that can be used like axes to decapitate zombies. In Europe, refugees ride out the zombie plague by holing up in old castles and fighting off the undead with medieval weapons pilfered from museums. A brilliant Indian general fights off the zombies by positioning his soldiers in a square formation reminiscent of the ancient Greek phalanx.    Ultimately, Brooks, whose previous book explored a similar theme and managed to achieve humor by taking the hypothetical problem extremely seriously, invites audiences to really treat the idea of zombies seriously by approaching them realistically, both as a military problem and a political crisis.
B00001OH7M|3.0|Mr. Bowie's sophomore effort is a lot better than most people give credit. Although there are a couple of lame songs (mostly the soft acoustic stuff), a glimpse of greatness can be seen and in some slight cases, that greatness is realized. \\"Space Oddity\\" the song has been called out-of-place and may have been better served as a non-lp single, but the song is so great that as an album opener it's a no-brainer. His first real classic, this tale of a lost spaceman may seem to foreshadow Ziggy, but I don't believe that is accurate due to the latter being sci-fi in nature as opposed to the science fact (by 1969 anyway) of \\"Oddity\\". Other favorites include \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\", a great acoustic tinged rocker (phallus in pigtails??); \\"Cygnet Committee\\", a long number that doesn't really seem that way as the anger in David's voice continues to build to a crescendo; \\"Janine\\" a catchy rocker with a great singalong chorus; and last but not least \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" (did Oasis know this song before they did \\"Champagne Supernova\\", they are very similar). \\"Wild-Eyed Boy\\" I think is slightly overrated being not as memorable as some of the aforementioned tunes, but maybe that's me. I don't get the glam rock references in the other reviews, this has NO GLAM ROCK!(at least in how I would define the term.) As stylistically different from his debut as it would be from succeeding records, 'Space Oddity' is a decided step away from his greatest albums(the next one being his first true masterwork), but it is still an essential piece of work and definitely his first truly serious record.
0486408434|5.0|The book itself is excellent, though, I saw a review that was a bit mistaken. It said to get the DVD set instead... which is partially incorrect. If you're truly interested in learning and perfecting, get _both_. The DVD set corrects some of the mistakes in the book, as well as offers different, more effective methods of some of the tricks.  <br /> <br />The book is surely one of the classics in magic, and I'll have mine until the day I die. It's _well_ worth the purchase... and you might consider getting the 5-disc DVD with it. (Not all tricks in the book are covered on the DVD).
B000DN6ZGC|4.0|I don't know how anyone could compare her to Nelly Furtado. I don't see it. Bailey, combines folk, jazz, and r&b and comes up with a wonderful CD. If you like good music you'll enjoy her work. This is music that dosen't need a elaborate music video, pirotecnique's at a concert, or undo hype in order for you to enjoy.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This over all is an excellent follow up to Trouble. Like many people I was afraid he wouldn't be able to stick it out like so many artists on their sophmore album, but honestly I like this a little better than the first album. It has the ability to haunt you and then make you tap your toes with uptempo jams. I hope he will have a long career and keep mixing things up.
0778321606|5.0|Debbie has done it again with this book.  I enjoyed the company.  I'm a shut in and live in a very rural area so a knitting group is not possible for me.  This book ended way too soon!!  I'm looking forward to more books in this series!!
B00082IJ08|5.0|This album is one of the best of our time. Integrating interesting drum riffs, symphonic arrangements, creative lyrics, musical sounds that inspire, all to create a mixed up style that breaks all barriers of genre and time. Truely a classic.
B000GCFO08|5.0|When friends ask for my opinion about \\"Silent Hill\\",I will answer:\\"This is a real horror movie\\".And that should say it all.A nightmare visualized.And that is what I like to see when it comes to horror films.Of course,again,some critics did not like what they saw.And that is what I would like to tell all those \\"serious\\" critics: What do you expect? Shakespeare? Enough said! This is one dvd to have in any horror film fan's collection!
B000002WPI|5.0|One of the most quietly produced albums is also one of the most intensely tight albums of the 1990's. It's impossible not to laugh at the idea of listening to Wu-Tang, due mostly to Dave Chappeles skits on the group, and also because the group seems to want it that way. They enjoy dabbling in the absurd, as shown in their song \\"Shame on the Nigga\\" and the disturbing skit at the begining of \\"Method Man.\\" They aren't the mean spirt of Dr.Dre, or the the playful side of Pharcyde or the firey social commentary of Nas, but what they are are great MCs that flow into one another with great regularity. Indeed, every MC, with the small exception of U-God, has gone onto critical or commerical success, or in the case of the Method Man and the Ghostface Killa, both.  <br />What's amazing to me is that it's not one MC that stands out imparticular, but rather all of them that contribute more or less equally to the project. A must have for any serious hip-hop enthusiast. Plus, it's hard to match the intrinsic rush you can get with this alum.
B000005RQT|5.0|<br />I was a young high school kid when this came out......I loved it!! \\"Speed king\\" and \\"Child in time\\" were great steps forward toward the metal music that I grew to love. Had already been listening to Zeppelin, Hendrix, Cream, Blue Cheer, Humble Pie and Mountain. Was a young long-haired stoner kid who loved hard rock (it wasn't called metal until later in the seventies. Even Purple didn't call their music metal in the beginning.) Today I'm much older. A guy in his 50s who still likes this stuff (hey, I'm still much younger than Dio, Lemmy and Ozzy.) When I first heard \\"Hush\\" in 1968, it seemed like Purple was an organ dominated band, just like Vanilla Fudge was. This LP/CD took them in a harder direction.  Ever since the first Cream & Hendrix albums came out, I've been buying about 4 or 5 metal LPS/CDs a year. I'll give you metal kids the best metal records every year since the Cream/Hendrix days:  <br /> <br />1967 - Jimi Hendrix \\"Are you Experienced?\\", Cream \\"Disraeli Gears\\"  <br />1968 - Jimi Hendrix \\"Electric Ladyland\\", Blue Cheer \\"Vincebus Eruptum\\", Cream \\" Wheels of Fire\\" Steppenwolf \\"Steppenwolf\\"  <br />1969 - Led Zeppelin, \\"Led Zeppelin 1\\", Led Zeppelin \\"Led Zeppelin 2\\", Mountain \\"Climbing\\"  <br />1970 - Black Sabbath \\"Black Sabbath\\", Deep Purple \\"In Rock\\", Black Sabbath \\"Paranoid\\"  <br />1971 - Led Zeppelin \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", Black Sabbath \\"Master of Reality\\", Alice Cooper \\"Killer\\", Deep Purple \\"Fireball\\"  <br />1972 - Deep Purple \\"Machine Head\\", Black Sabbath \\"Vol 4\\", Wishbone Ash \\"Argus\\", Uriah Heep \\"Demons and Wizards\\", Scorpions \\"Lonesome Crow\\"  <br />1973 - Deep Purple \\"Who do we think we are\\", Led Zeppelin \\"Houses of the holy\\", Black Sabbath \\"Sabbath bloody sabbath\\", Queen \\"Queen\\"  <br />1974 - Deep Purple \\"Burn\\", Queen \\"Sheer Heart attack\\", UFO \\"Phenomenum\\", Kiss \\"Kiss\\", Rush \\"Rush\\"  <br />1975 - AC/DC \\"High Voltage\\", Kiss \\"Kiss Alive\\", Rainbow \\"Ritchie Blackmore's rainbow,\\" Aerosmith \\"Toys in the attic\\", UFO \\"Force it\\"  <br />1976 - Judas Priest \\"Sad Wings of destiny\\", Rainbow \\"Rising\\", Aerosmith \\"Rocks\\", Rush \\"2112\\", Kiss \\"Destroyer\\"  <br />1977 - Judas Priest \\"Sin after sin\\", UFO \\"Lights out\\", Queen \\"News of the world\\", Motorhead \\"Motorhead\\", AC/DC \\"Let there be Rock\\"  <br />1978 - Judas Priest \\"Stained Class\\", Van Halen \\"Van Halen\\", AC/DC \\"Powerage\\", Scorpions \\"Taken by force\\"  <br />1979 - AC/DC \\"Highway to hell\\", Motorhead \\"Overkill\\", Judas Priest \\"Hell bent for leather\\"  <br />1980 - Judas Priest \\"British steel\\", AC/DC \\"Back in Black\\", Motorhead \\"Ace of Spades\\", Black Sabbath \\"Heaven and hell\\"  <br />1981 - Ozzy Ozbourne \\"Blizzard of Oz\\", Motorhead \\"No sleep till hammersmith\\", AC/DC \\"For those about to rock\\"  <br />1982 - Iron Maiden \\"Number of the beast\\", Judas Priest \\"Screaming for vengeance\\", Ozzy Ozbourne \\"Diary of a Madman\\", Scorpions \\"Blackout\\"  <br />1983 - Iron Maiden \\"Piece of mind\\", Def Leppard \\"Pyromania\\", Motley Crue \\"Shout at the devil\\", Metallica \\"Kill em all\\", Dio \\"Holy Diver\\"  <br />1984 - Iron Maiden \\"Powerslave\\", Metallica \\"Ride the Lightning\\", Judas Priest \\"Defenders of the faith\\", Deep Purple \\"Perfect Strangers\\"  <br />1985 - Anthrax \\"Spreading the Disease\\", Megadeth \\"Killing is my business\\", Slayer \\"Hell awaits\\", Possessed \\"Seven churchs\\"  <br />1986 - Metallica \\"Master of Puppets\\", Slayer \\"Reign in Blood\\", Megadeth \\"Peace sells..who's buying\\"  <br />1987 - Anthrax \\"Among the Living\\", Guns n Roses \\"Appetite for destruction\\", Def Leppard \\"Hysteria\\"  <br />1988 - Iron Maiden \\"Seventh son of seventh son\\", Metallica \\"And justice for all\\", Slayer \\"South of heaven\\", Megadeth \\"So far so goo so what\\"  <br /> <br />This was about where I got off the \\"crazy metal train.\\" Didn't like where it was going. The death metal and thrash metal just began to lose me. Mayhem and Possessed and Sepultura and Pantera and Cannibal Corpse was the end for me. I still bought Metallica and Iron Maiden, and of course Judas Priest and Deep Purple and Black Sabbath all through the '90s up to today (when they release something, which is rarer and rarer.) So any metal kids can finish where I left off around '88. But remember, even though Dio & Lemmy & Ozzy & Tony Iommi & Ritchie Blackmore & Jon Lord & Jimmy Page & even Rob Halford are all older than me.....I'm up there myself. So there WAS heavy dark music before Sabbath. Trust me. But they were great, no doubt. Just buy ALL the CDS I just mentioned to get THE WHOLE PICTURE !!  <br /> <br />
B00008H2LB|4.0|Fans of this rap grudge techno band were left waiting three years for new studio material to hit the airwaves. Linkin Park had released a remix album, but nothing new had been produced for thirty six months. METEORA delivered what the fans were demanding; more of the rap techno grudge style that had become imensely popular over a three year period. This time around, Linkin Park performed harder in their rock part, had more melodic melodies and harmonies, and delivered gritty rhymes. The band is built of the rhythm section and becomes incredibly original with the performance of the keyboardist counterpointing the vocalists. The product is definately some of Linkin Park's best work and leaves the listener wanting more. METEORA marked an outstanding return of Linkin Park and keeping them the masters in the genre the perform in. The record landed the group a spot to the soundtrack of S.W.A.T. The record is just so well put together and performed. Sadly, once again, its been three years since the band has released any new studio material and not just remixes. METEORA is a great album and one to add to the collection of music fans.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks include:  <br />\\"Somewhere I Belong\\" <br />\\"Lying From You\\" <br />\\"Faint\\" <br />\\"Figure.09\\" <br />\\"Breaking the Habbit\\" <br />\\"Nobody's Listening\\" <br />\\"Numb\\"
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns N Roses had some massive hits back in the 80's then again with the simultaneous release of their Use Your Own Illusion comeback albums in the early 90's, and were certainly worthy of their place as one of the biggest bands in the world during these times. Their biggest hits from that era are all on this album which is great if your looking for something to play in your car and don't want to keep changing CDs and are morally opposed to burning your own album from your own copies of their other albums. However if you are not opposed to making your own compilation album then there is nothing new on this album for you here. If you're a new fan to the Gunners then you'll eventually want the other albums anyway so it's a bit of a waste of money purchasing this album.<br /><br />The album is not actually the greatest hits in their single released (as you hear on the radio) versions. It is actually greatest hits of their album versions of these songs. It was disappointing on Use Your Illusion II that the song Knockin' On Heaven's Door did not contain the great voiceover intro that the single version did so this was one area where Geffen could have added something for those who have the original albums by putting the single version on this album. The only thing that this album really offers is the final track, Sympathy for the Devil which appeared on the 1994 Interview with a Vampire Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. So if you just want that song compare the price of that soundtrack against this album. Other than that you can just make this album yourself from their original albums.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|This album is definitly ATR's best album to date. If you get this album, listen to it from begining to end, its just simply amazing. This is my favorite album of 2006. Metal isent dead nor will it ever cease to get better and better. This album beats lamb of gods new album, shadows fall new album easy.
B000GPIPSS|4.0|Soooo fellow geek classic monster collectors, tell me, does this sound familiar? You are perusing various sites and store DVD racks and you stumble across these 75th Anniversary editions of DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN and your geek heart starts palpitating at the thought of  digitally restored version of these films and you get all excited and you start deciding which comic books you'll give up this month to buy these instead.......but then you remember you've bought the last TWO previously released DVD versions of these films and now you wonder if these are worth it? OK....well...maybe this is kind of an exaggeration, but you know what I mean. I bowed to temptation because, well....Universal has me with their monster releases from way back....period.    Soooo.....as it is obligatory when one has bought three releases of the same d@mn film, I sat down with them all and ran them through to decide which was the best of them. It is without question IMO, that the DRACULA 75th DVD is the best transfer when compared to the 90's (poster art), and the first LEGACY (green box art) releases. Picture-wise, the amount of speckles, noise and whatnot has been reduce quite a bit. This is most apparent in the darker scenes. So on a good note, seeing less snowy junk pop up is nice. Some of the scenes also look less jittery. For example, in the previous releases, the scene when Frye first comes into Drac's home and Lugosi is descending the staircase behind him, the film image is really jumpy...like watching a bad bootleg. In this 75th release it looks stable and doesn't have that funky aliasing look. The overall picture quality just feels cleaner in this release. But there is still a good amount of junk throughout the film that this cannot possibly be considered the definitive restoration. Only some making the leap from VHS to DVD will get their socks knocked of with this release. If you bought the other two, then you might be happy, but probably underwhelmed despite the good points. Like the FRANKENSTEIN release, this still feels like a money making thing than an anniversary homage to this film especially after the promise of something new from a third dip. Some people may say that we can't expect much because the film is so old. But sorry, after THREE RELEASES, and most especially since this one is clearly the supposed icing-on-the-cake release so far, well, I think Universal could have done even better than this, MUCH BETTER. Technology as it stands nowadays is very forgiving when cleaning up old films.....but companies need to be willing to put the money into using said technololgy. I would think that even if the buying public of an older film such as this is limited and Universal wasn't going to pour a ton of cash into it, well, being the third time releasing the same d@mn movie, would it be outrageous to assume they'd have enough saved in the piggy bank to do a definitve restoration instead of this continued fleecing, but hey, guess that's business. I think if they DID do much better and THEY knew it,  we would have gotten NEW SPECIAL FEATURES and none of the stuff that was already on the other two releases save for the one Lugos bit that is new here.    Sound-wise, I have to agree with other reviews that I have read that mention that the 90's release had better sound. It did seem a bit crisper. But like the FRANKENSTEIN releases, picking the better sound with DRACULA is like picking the lesser o two evils.......do you want Niagra Falls somewhere in the background or do you want  gentle rapids? To me, all of the background hissing and popping and rustling sounds funky on all of the releases, but they eventually just become part of the film. I don't really have much of a preference as none have ever been so clean that I could make myself care THAT much.    VALUE: Hmmmmmm........if you have the money, this is the best DRACULA to get in terms of picture and such. But one has to ask themselves how much they care about this film to fork over thecash for just one film. If you are only marginally interested in this DRACULA, but still want a copy, I'd go for the LEGACY set as that comes with other films and is the better value overall. This release is truly for the purists and gluttons for finacial punishment such as myself. Even though I have now three copies of this film, I have still only managed to watch it less than ten times since the first 90's release since, even though a classic, I find DRACULA mostly a boring affair when watched repeatedly so I hafta take it in like wine....slow...and over time. So my point is, one has to ask themselves, how much do you care to drop the cash for yet another copy of this if you already have it?    PACKAGING: For the most part, identical to the green LEGACY sets. That is, the faux hardback book case that opens up to reveal two DVD's. Only here, there is NO open window slipcover to protect the case. This seems kinda cheap since the case is a cool, leather-ish 'grained' cover printed in matte sepia, which is nice. But it will succumb to scuffs and such much faster than the better protected LEGACY set.     OVERALL: Like the FRANKENSTEIN 75th....this is cool if you got the money to upgrade. But for what it's touted as, this still is gets 50/50 from me. Just keep in mind that the 'definitve' HD/BLUE RAY versions will come at some point ........or at least the first versions of -those- definitve versions...so we ain't outta the woods yet.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|In the contest of love and Jennifer Connelly against the infinitude of chaos, the match goes to love and Connelly, 1-0.<br /><br />Mrs. Elizabeth Nash - as played long-sufferingly and with an understated intensity about her performance that can only be called gorgeous - is one of the several centerpieces of this memorable film.<br /><br />You don't get a clinical presentation of schizophrenia here, and the news coverage following this 2002 film suggests that you don't get a history of Princeton mathematician John Nash's life either.<br /><br />What you get are epic performances by Russell Crowe and partner Connelly, together with enormously assured supporting roles by Ice King Ed Harris and Paul Bettany, together with the kind of rich and textured cinematography that must have upped Princeton's application rate with its sheer autumnal elegance.<br /><br />Crowe's heroic battle against the delusions that plagued Dr. Nash's mind are gladiatorial in scope, though it would be difficult to imagine a role more restrained and internal where that famous acting played out violently and before drooling crowds. As one of Rome's famous gladiators, Crowe found redemption by bringing down a sinister emperor. Here he does so by quietly accepting the pens ceremonially laid before him by his Princeton colleagues and then by explaining that 'it is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.'<br /><br />Those who love or have been loved against the infinitude of chaos will understand Dr. Nash's discovery, regardless of whether the real Nash ever said those things from behind a Stockholm podium.<br /><br />Don't overlook this film when building your posterity collection. As human drama goes, a finely crafted fiction can ring more true than the connected dots of what really went down and who said what.
B000GPIPT2|4.0|<br />OK...........well....I am exactly the sucker....err....I mean FAN...yea, FAN that Universal goes after with these multi-dip releases. I have just finished comparing the 90's release, Legacy box set, & this, the 75th Anniversary FRANKENSTEIN DVD's. BTW: If anyone reads my DRACULA comments, you'll see they are similar in my final opinions.  <br />So, overall, YES.....I'd say there is a better picture quality to this transfer. But look.....when someone tells me a film has been restored, especially a film of the calibre of FRANKENSTEIN, then I expect to have my bolts knocked off with the transfer....ESPECIALLY AFTER BUYING TWO PREVIOUS RELEASES. I don't need to be told how old these films are and what to expect. Technology allows for many things these days and IF a company is going to toot their horn and say something is restored....especially a high roller like Universal....then RESTORE IT. <br /> <br /> Now, if you have either of the previous releases, you'll know that the transfers weren't all that bad...not great, but definitely liveable (remember when it was just cool to get this on a disc?lol:-). In this one, the print STILL has a noticeable amount of speckles and murkiness as the other two. So to say this was the bling- bling-anniversary-looked-like-we-gave-a-poop-release, well, it STILL comes up short as far as the cleanup. If this was the first time I'd ever seen this movie released on DVD, then I'd say OMIGAWD, this is amazing.....but compared to the last releases, this doesn't show me all that much difference in picture quality. Maybe if Universal spent the time and energy to do it right.....i.e. the definitive HD transfer and stopped this rerelease crap, I'd be more impressed. As it is, it seems to be more money gaining effort than an actual 'Anniversary' effort. <br /> <br />I did notice that on the LEGACY BOX SET (the green packaging), the sound had more of the fuzziness. I noticed this with DRACULA as well, that the 90's releases (poster art covers) SEEMED to have better sound than the LEGACY versions. But then this is at the same time picking the lesser of two evils in sound quality as none sound all that spectacular to begin with. <br /> <br />So let's see.....let's recap shall we: <br /> <br />PICTURE QUALITY: Better than the LEGACY BOX SET, though -that can be argued- in various parts of the film. If you NEVER picked up a DVD copy of this film, then this is the one to get. If you have the other two versions, I'd decide how much you like this film before dropping the cash for it. I mean really....only hardcore collectors are going to feel compelled to upgrade to get three or four less speckles per scene (well, that's an exaggeration, but you get the picure). <br /> <br />VALUE: If you are only marginally interested in the classics monster stuff, get the LEGACY SET. It at least has more films included as well as the same special features (minus the one new one added here) and definitely decent film quality. The first releases from the 90's might be cheaper to find used at this point though...and surprise! they have the same d@mn features...only back then, they really WERE special unlike now, when other than the new Karloff piece, they are recycled. <br /> <br />PACKAGING: So.....with this new release, we get cooler sepia toned box art. A nice touch. The packaging is nearly identical in construction as the LEGACY sets, i.e. it opens like a hardback book. Only here, it seems kinda skimpy. Whereas the LEGACY was this slicked cover housed in a window sleeve to protect the case. Well, here is a simulated 'leather'-ish cover with no gloss, and no case. I know this is minor to some, but hey, this will get scuffed & jacked up. And depending on where you buy this, for the price (in some places nearly 30 bucks) well, Universal could have at least given us a sleeve to put this in. <br /> <br />OVERALL PART 2: This releases is cool....but still gets a 50/50 for what we get packaged up.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver was a good book, but isn't my absolute favorite. It tends to be a bit boring in the beginning, but once the pace picks up, it's a great read all the way until the end. Books that talk about a Utopia, like Jonas' are a nice contrast to our society. I think everyone should read this book or a book like it to know that not everything is always as it seems. There are always things that affect us and our society, even when we don't notice it. As a twelve year old boy, Jonas has to realize these things. He realizes what is good and bad about how his community is run. He discovers new and beautiful things along the way. But is it enough to keep him grounded when he realizes activities and happenings that just don't seem quiet right, and some that are completely chilling? I loved Jonas' discovery journey all the way until the very end. The book has a great ending, I loved it. Even though in one moment everything seems to go bad, there is always a good ending to everyday. <br /> <br />Brittany Clevenger, <br />A Virual High School Student. <br />
B000GFLE86|4.0|With a voice that doesn't match her face, Madeleine Peyroux scores with her third album. She's one of those cool artists who can blend genre distinctions with ease. Typically, she's a jazz singer but this album interacts with folk and country, and also different is the \\"middle age\\" of the songs and their emphasis on poetry (Joni Mitchell, Serge Gainsbourg, etc.). Her voice sounds a lot like Billie Holiday, which some people criticize, but if you listen closely, the individuality of her voice is evident. One of her most outstanding qualities is her ability to bend a melody line into the shape she sees fit. Altering a rhythm as dramatically as she can is very difficult to do and not get lost in accompaniment - this I know from failed attempts. Also interesting is the way in which she draws out consonants which really can't be sung, yet she does; L's in particular. Peyroux uses a very unique blend of instruments as well. Some songs are backed a traditional jazz combo while others expand to the ukulele, organ, and string quartet. <br /> <br />The album highlights are the original compositions by Peyroux, something new to her recordings. My personal favorite is \\"Once in a While,\\" because it is extremely lyrical and I love the rough-sounding string quartet accompaniment. Other winners are \\"River\\" featuring a duet with k.d.lang and \\"La Javanaise,\\" the only French track. Overall, this album aches with a despondancy that is both distant and transparent at the same time. The accompaniment is thoughtful and personal with a strong sense of ensemble unity. <br />
0393324818|4.0|Money Ball was a great book. It shows that you don't need money to win in baseball(take that Yankees ;-P) Michael Lewis reavels that the team with the 2nd lowest payroll, the Oakland Athletics, can have so much dominance and success in a game where the best baseball players usually end up with the richest team. Lewis also tells the story of Billy Beane the GM of the Athletics. Billy's bad attitude and foul temper prevented him from making in the MLB. He exerts his attitude as a force over the so-called \\"experts\\" when a desicion must be made. Billy constanly goes against what the scouts think a drafts players that nobody has heard of. He shows that there are many aspects of the game that we don't know. All in all, this was an excellant book. My only complaint was that there was a lot of swearing.--- Jesse Hartman
B000025XKM|5.0|Somehow I've come across Nick's music, it's an exquisite blend of folk and soft-jazz. The story behind Nick's music and his life is tragic yet what he left behind is amazing, three studio albums and about four songs to start off a new album to be started before he died of a drug overdose.<br /><br />This album is by far his most melancholic, the most sparse record I have ever listened to, just Nick's vocals and acoustic guitar plus a minimal piano overdub on the title track. The sparseness may be attributed to some people as making this album less accessible than his sophomore effort, but in my opinion it shows perfectly Nick's state of mind in his last years, depressed and distant.<br /><br />The title track starts the album off, it has the most instrumentation and sounds the most mainstream on such an underground album, this song is a quaint song that explores the deep register of his voice. This song is commonly known because it was used in a Volkswagen commercial in 2000.<br /><br />\\"Place To Be\\" continues in the same vein as the previous song, the lyrics illustrate longing and regret, very confessional, keeping in style with the album on the whole.<br /><br />\\"Road\\" makes use of Nick's superb mastery of the finger-picking technique on the guitar, it sounds very intricate and masterful. \\"Which Will\\" is again, great but it has something extra, Nick's voice seem to have a lot of hope in them and aren't full of regret and darkness. It's a beautiful song.<br /><br />\\"Horn\\" is a great instrumental that shows off the musicianship of Nick. It leads well into the next track, \\"Things Behind The Sun\\" which is strummed in a great minor key and has an awful lot of melancholy shrouding it.<br /><br />\\"Know\\" is the most simple track on the album, built around a four note guitar ostinato it proves that you don't need a Phil Spector treatment to stisfy your target listener. \\"Parasite\\" is written undoubtedly from how Nick saw himself, as worthless and a burden.

B00005JOYM|5.0|I went to see this movie with my girlfriend over the summer.  When it was over we did not say one word to one another except \\"WOW!!!\\" Later, when we were over all the emotions it brought out (Anger, Sadness, and deepened Patriotism) we were able to discuss it with one another.  We realized that we had forgotten just what had happened and how it had happened.  It reminded us of what we are fighting for around the globe.   <br /> <br />After seeing this movie, I realized just how emotional 9/11.  It is not that I didn't realize when it occurred, it is just that I was too young to fully grasp what had happened to our country.  This movie is scary in the way it shows the two officers having to fight to stay alive beneath the rubble, as well as the emotional turmoil their families are going through not knowing whether they are dead or alive.  It makes you realize just how much we take for granted in our daily lives and how at anytime our lives can be snatched away from us as quickly as they were given. This movie is an amazing accomplishment!!!  It is just so emotional and thought provoking.  The acting is great.  Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena do an awesome job at depicting the two Port Authority officers having to fight for their lives and survive.   <br /> <br />I would reccomend this movie to everyone living in the United States of America. Hopefully it will serve as a huge reminder of the tragedy that occurred on 9/11 and America's fight to survive and band together.  On that day heroes were born and worked constantly; night and day, to rescue those men.  It is a movie about heroes, survival, and patriotism and it is wonderfully done!!!!!
0385338082|5.0|I had forgotten how hilarious Sophie Kinsella is, since it's been months since I read Confessions of a Shopoholic. She has the ability to create terrible mortifying situations and make it seem like something that happens every day. Like sharing your entire life story and everything about you to a stranger who happens to be your boss.<br /><br />This was great. Hilarious. And so sweet!
6305718954|4.0|It is amazing to see the amount of time, energy, mental fuel that is in vain consumed to build and rebuild the plot theory that says the Catholic Church has hijacked Jesus Christ from a gospel of love to a gospel of domination and control. This film is one more stone along that road. It is an incredible story, meaning a story that cannot be believed, just as if when dealing with the Christian god there were no limits whatsoever as for the lack of any logic or reason. The haunting of a non believer by an Aramaic document that she has never seen, what's more understood, to the point of getting the victim of the reproduction  in her flesh of Jesus' stigmata and her writing on a wall the full text of the document still in Aramaic is unbelievable. A human being can only be haunted by something that has had a concrete connection or contact with that person. It is not the beads of a dead priest from Brazil, stolen by some non identified local person, bought by the mother of the victim in the village, who at least visited the place where that dead priest used to preach, and received via mail by the victim from her mother, that can justify that haunting of that person. Then the contradictory discourse of a priest who is originally a scientist and who turns a believer in empathy more than reason for the girl justifies in his blindness the extreme defensive attitude of the hierarchy of the church that prefers killing the evidence to accepting the disturbing truth, if truth it is.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
B000068TPN|5.0|I went here to read the reviews of a movie I haven't seen...but I HAVE read the book. <br /> <br />In it family members clearly say that they recieved the death notices via telegrams delivered by Taxi Cab drivers (this was before the military started sending Chaplins and live people to deliver the news) and also that news of fatalities were delivered to family members on November 14th (Tom Metzger's wife knows the moment she got the news, of course...)the day the battle  started. So...those were true things I guess in the movie. <br /> <br />PS- I gave the movie the five starts because I had to give a rating to post this on the site.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|Love the album. Still have the signature Scissor Sisters touch but with a darker edge as everyone has been talking about. I listened to the albums back to back and you definately hear more musical layers. But I can't stop listening to this one. Album is great to sing along to and its pure escapism. Love that actress Veronica Cartwright is on the album cover and in the teaser trailer. I hope she's in an upcoming video. Congrats to SS and thank you guiding me through the Fall/Winter season - can't wait to see them perform in NY in Oct!!!!

0743454529|3.0|I found My Sister's Keeper to be a very well written novel that kept me wanting more. That said, it played into a lot of stereotypes that were to predictable: the angry brother unable to \\"save\\" his sister, the sick sister who everything else revolved around, and the \\"forgotten\\" little sister who has to do something big to get attention.  Unlike other readers, however, I enjoyed the relief given to the reader with the romance and how it made their empathy and reaction to the family more believable. I recommend this book if you enjoy reading for the sake of reading and don't mind a good cry. This is not a feel-good story... more one that makes you thankful for what you've been given and hopeful that you never have to make the choices this family did.
B00000I8UE|5.0|\\"Right Here, Right Now\\" is my favorite cut on this record, but there really isn't anything here that I didn't enjoy.  Cassandra Wilson's best effort so far, this is a complex and interesting tribute to the music of Miles Davis.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|_Silent Hill_ is an extremely bizarre film which features a woman and her daughter caught up in a nightmare world of demons, witches, and a fanatical cult.  The film begins with the mother, Rose, and her daughter, Sharon, at a time when Sharon is experiencing bizarre dreams and hallucinations.  Sharon repeatedly mentions a place called \\"Silent Hill\\" in her dream state, and her adoptive mother decides to take her there to cure her of her apparent psychic conflict.  As it turns out Silent Hill is an old ghost town, and as the two drive towards it leaving the girl's adoptive father behind, a series of bizarre occurrences take place.  The mother is pulled over by a police officer but drives away.  Later, they have an accident while nearing Silent Hill, and when the mother awakes her daughter has disappeared.  The mother becomes frantic and begins running through the town searching for her daughter, who appears to be running from her.  However, it is while in the town that the mother begins to encounter various strange and dark secrets.  Apparently there are evil forces loose in this town and mysterious dark creatures begin to besiege her.  Running from these creatures, the mother returns to her car only to find the police officer waiting for her.  The officer arrests her; however, soon it becomes apparent that the two of them must do battle with the forces of darkness.  The setting for this film is very dark and evil, and the influence of the demonic is felt at every turn.  While battling these wicked forces and searching for her daughter, the mother and the police officer encounter witches and crazed women.  Ultimately they are led to a cult of strange fanatics who hold a dark secret.  Apparently a great evil has been unleashed upon this town, stored up for many years in the body of a girl who was burned as a witch.  From there the movie becomes even more bizarre and ultimately the mother must encounter the demon by herself after fleeing from the fanatics.  The movie features dark deformed creatures, a knife wielding demon, witch burnings, a split self, and an all-around dark atmosphere and setting which is extremely well-done.  The ending includes a twist and an ultimate mystery that remains unsolved.  For more than anything else, this film is to be recommended for its dark atmosphere which is sure to provide a frightening experience of the dark side.  For those who bravely face head on the dark nature of things, this movie is sure to offer not only a source of entertainment but also a thoughtful look into both the dangers of fanaticism and the darkness of profound hatred.  Enjoy!

B00005JP0C|5.0|The Devil Wears Prada sells the life of a new university graduate working under the notoriously demanding and unforgiving boss. The boss is \\"god\\" at work and it is either obedience or goodbye. Based on the book bearing the same name by Lauren Weisberger, which was said to be a semi-biography of her real life experience, the audience might be expecting a lot of back stabbing and bitching and poking jokes at anorexic models and fashionable girls. However, it proves that the movie is something more than that.<br /><br />All the funny and bitching bits were in the trailers. So if you are looking forward to more of those, probably getting the trailer will do so. The movie is more about survival in a tough environment, going through close shaves at work and how to be a human being while you strive for survival at workplace. There is no definite answers to the last one but it does bring us to think about choices. The choice you made when you think there are no choices - that's the essence of what's the movie is about. Working hard, finally earning the trust of your boss is just the beginning of office politics that you get slammed into against your will. Also when you are the person around the beast everyone scares and hates, how can you survive on the battle field and at the same time who is your enemey and who is your ally? The funny part is that the most gorgeous, good looking person you met might not be the person you think who he / she is. Characters in the movie are realist, ruthless but human at the same time. I remember I recently made comments about God being very fair in a way that nearly every workplace has office politics, no matter you like it or not. Being in part of the environment forces you into it and to survive and success takes a lot of tolls. This is exactly the world in The Devil Wears Prada.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays Miranda and of course flawlessly. It might not be the most demanding roles in her career but she nailed it down without a single second of hesitation. There are of course bits and pieces that showcase she is Meryl Streep not for no reasons. Compared to her Anne Hathaway who was great in Brokeback Mountain became a real apprentice. She is not bad at all but with such a strong person in most of the scenes together, it's really learning most of the time, just like her character in the movie. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci form the remainder of the main cast. Emily provided a lot of comical moments for the movie but then you get bored afterwards cos a lot of them are similar and that makes you feel bad for her cos she is very into the character. Stanley Tucci survive the tug-of-war in performance. He is great and facing Meryl Streep he did pulled off the performance gracefully and professionally. As the mentor for the Andy (Anne) he lives through things that he thought he would never live through, again, because of the ruthless nature of a competitive office environment.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is really a movie about choices and who you want to be. It poses the question of \\"do you need to be a ruthless devil to be professionally successful?\\" One of the things that's also worth mentioning is the question of if Miranda (Meryl Streep) is a man, would people still regard her as the devil? Things were cleverly written and smart resonances can be found littering around in the whole movie.<br /><br />Two last notes: if you love Simon Baker (the Australian heart throb in the Guardian) you will be happy. And if you are in Madonna, you got a small dose of her songs that fit completely well into this world.e second of hesitation.

B000GPIPT2|5.0|Universal has released so many versions of Frankenstein on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD claiming to be \\"the Restored Edition\\" you may wonder why you need yet another release of this superb film. First off, you will not see any footage in this version you have not seen since the true restoration VHS in 1991. As many know, the footage showing the monster tossing the little girl into the lake was finally located (although in 16mm instead of 35mm) and cut back in for the 1991 VHS and Laserdisc releases. This new edition is a beautiful transfer for such old filmstock, so if you don't have any of the previous DVD releases, you should get this.<br /><br />But there are two big reasons to get this version:<br /><br />The Stills section.<br /><br />The short film called \\"Boo\\"<br /><br />I viewed the stills section with a veteran Hollywood special effects guy today. He has been to Forry Ackerman's home and looked at all his stills of Frankenstein (Anyone over age 40 will instantly realize the impact of this) and has never seen some of the stills on this disc. The stills are beautifully rendered in full grayscale as well. It is presented with audio from the film as a sort of Photoplay, and is a loving tribute to the genius that made the 1931 Frankenstein untouchable by sequels or remakes. These stills are the reason your DVD player has a pause, zoom and Slow-Mo button.<br /><br />Please note: during the Golden Age, studio stills were made with 8x10 cameras. That's right, an 8x10 inch negative! There is a near overwhelming abundance of detail in these stills that those raised on digital, or even 35mm images will not comprehend until they are viewed.<br /><br />The short film \\"Boo\\" is at first glance a horrendous send-up of the monster films done by it's creators at Universal. In an ironic twist the creators of these films are turning their back on them almost as soon as they are created. But mute the sound, and you'll see some uber-rare vintage footage from Nosferatu and the long lost film The Cat Creeps. Golden Age Monster fans take note here; evidently when Universal made this one reeler in 1932, they were working with a contemoporary print of Murnau's Nosferatu which looks gorgeous and has a full range of contrasts! NONE of the more recent (since 1960!) transfers of Nosferatu look anywhere near this good. Whatever source material Universal had of Nosferatu in 1932 was near pristine. This alone justifies the purchase of this disk for Golden Age Horror fans.<br /><br />But you'll also see equally pristine footage of the arcane film called \\"The Cat Creeps\\" a remake of \\"Cat and the Canary\\". This film has been obliterated by time, and these tanatalizing fragments reveal a lost early Golden age gem. I believe there are also some out-takes from Frankenstein which do not exist in the final version. I do not recall ever seeing the trees moving outside the windows when the Monster menaces a pre-nuptial Mae Clarke.<br /><br />Although fragmentary, these clips and stills give Golden Age Monster fans enough material to fuel our imaginations on cold Novemeber nights; a faculty which has sadly been absent from American horror movies in the past 2 decades.Creeps.

B000I0QM0E|5.0|While this isn't Tim Burton's best, but it is still a Very, very good, Very FUN movie!<br /><br />And this Blu-Ray high def version looks absolutely great.

Perfect film for Halloween!
0596009208|5.0|After I borrowed and read this book I decided to purchase it for the following reasons: <br />- it covers amazingly well fundamentals: <br />  - it explains why, what and how in Java, using different viewpoints <br />  - information on fundamentals is not lost in between tons of detail <br />- it is fun to read since the book format makes your brain entertained <br />- the book graphics and structure helps you a lot with understanding and remembering the presented material. <br /> <br />The book does not contain as much detail as other Java books (like Thinking in Java) which can be really good if you are starting to learn Java or you plan to refresh on Java fundamentals.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|This has always been a terrific film and a must have for any DVD collection. Considering it is not exactly a NEW film, it looks absolutely stunning in Blu-Ray High Def! I've never seen it look any better, and that includes watching it in the theatre when it originally showed.<br /><br />Somehow the film seems to really transfer itself to the home theatre experience well.<br /><br />I would have liked to see a few more extras on this, otherwise, a nice Blu-Ray title!
1932907009|5.0|Recently I had the good fortune of attending Blake's seminar after reading \\"Save The Cat!\\" His energy and dedication to the craft is inspiring--no hack or huckster he, but the real deal, having written and sold seven-figure scripts over the course of his career. Blake has discovered the essential core of the blueprint known as a screenplay, and shares the process in a lively and entertaining manner. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to all screenwriters--heck, I even created a worldwide MeetUp group dedicated to exploring the process with others.
B000H5U832|5.0|My 3 & 4 yr old boys, all their male cousins 6-4 yr old and all the boys in our neighborhood in Boston LOVE this movie.  We know a few girls who saw it, and they loved it, too. <br /> <br />There is nothing scary in this movie, nor is there any name-calling.  My guys say they love Monsters, Inc, The Incredibles, Toy Story, and Land Before Time, but find parts scary and we have to FF several times.  Here, the only scares our hero receives are after the mistakes he makes.  For ex, to beat his opponents, he pushes his driver too hard & wakes up on the highway at night, cars honking at him (bossiness, the importance of sleep, what can happen if you're not careful crossing the street!). <br /> <br />The first time my kids saw their older cousins after seeing CARS we heard them all discussing the hero's mistakes and successes, and in their simple way, listing the things he learned along the way that helped him be the \\"real winner.\\"   <br /> <br />For adults, the music is great, jokes are hilarious and the sophisticated subplots (how often does anyone pause to consider the effects of superhighways on the small towns of America, or notice which stars stick with the sponsors that supported them before they became stars) provide thought-provoking entertainment.  As parents, we are thrilled to see the kids enjoy a cool film about friendship, trust, honor and winning in life, instead of just competing to win.   <br /> <br />The Amazon reviewer is WAY off in their simplistic review of this fantastic family film.  Perhaps he/she should see it again...
B000H305U0|3.0|It's interesting there'd be a song on here called \\"Losing My Way\\" about a man losing his life to a serious crack addiction. It's interesting because most rappers on albums like these (and others) who made it funded their recording careers by selling crack to pay for their studio sessions in the first place! Go figure. BTW, it's a good album, albeit limited in scope and subject matter.

Now we have a modern, action-packed, loud, gory, albeit, somewhat inaccurate - film rendering - I say let it spin, mates.  Salvation has arrived!!!
B000FIMG68|4.0|I liked season 1 because of the mystery and suspense. There was emotion, tears, romance and leadership issues, but only at a point that suggested well-researched character backgrounds. <br /> <br />Season 2 had mystery, of course, answered some questions and put hundreds of new ones, but it got too emotional for my taste. I finally got bored of tears and anger in flashbacks and skipped some half-minutes at each episode. I think too much time was wasted on relationships and goodbyes during funerals instead of working on the hints and clues. <br /> <br />Season 2 was not bad, it's worth watching and still interesting. But if they intend to make of LOST a social drama set on an exotic island, then they've just lost one viewer.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|<br />I waited till 10/2006 to watch this movie for the first time, allowing time to pass between the hype and the actual film.  The viewing was well worth the wait. <br />    <br />The cinematography is beautiful.  I found the characters engaging and believable to a fault.  How many of us have wrestled with wanting only to give in to needing?  I can see that there would be a narrow interest in this film but that should not detract from its true-to-life story line.  Those of you who have not lived the wanting vs. needing scenario may not appreciate the beauty of this film quite as much as those of us who have. <br />    <br />Watch it ... enjoy it ... consider its beauty.  Then let it be. <br />    <br />
B0002Y4TOM|4.0|Lorelai, Rory, Sookie and the Stars Hollow community return for the second season of Gilmore Girls DVD. A bad boy comes to town, Lorelai's father makes a couple of life changing decisions and Lane discovers the drum kit for the first time. Characters keep growing and developing, coming together in unexpected combinations and going to places they came nowhere near in the first series (Paris in Stars Hollow, for instance). Things get a little rocky at times, relationships are tested. Plus, there's a lot more of the awkward all-rounder Kirk (who's probably my favorite character). He even makes a short film in this series, which appears as a special feature, along with deleted scenes and a couple of other goodies. <br /> <br />Recommended for fans of the series. I'm only really a casual viewer, but I did enjoy watching this box. Good times.

B000002I25|5.0|I started off with the doors at a young age, maybe around 8 or 9 becuase my dad was always playing his \\"Best of the Doors\\" cd in his car. Immedietly when i heard their sound, i was entranced by the music i have grown to love even more. I got this cd on a trip one year and it has become one of my favorites, i am even listening to it as i type this review. Here is an overview of the songs. <br /> <br />Break on Through (to the Other Side): 5 stars, great song and opener to the cd, one of the doors' most timless tunes. Who hasnt heard this song? <br /> <br />Soul Kitchen:5 stars, an underrated tune  <br /> <br />Crystal Ship: 4 stars, slow, mournful, beautiful song by Morrison, appears on most \\"Best of\\" compilations <br /> <br />Twentieth Century Fox: 4.5 stars, upbeat, rocked-out song, kewl name <br /> <br />Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar): 5 stars, put in originally as filler, but a fantastic song, one of the doors' best  <br /> <br />Light My Fire: 5 stars, biggest hit for the doors, great song, nice musical interludes, again, who hasnt heard this song? <br /> <br />I Looked at YOu: 3.5 stars, probably worst song of the alblum, good tune nonetheless <br /> <br />End of the Night: 4.5 stars, true doors tune great lyrics  <br /> <br />Take it as it Comes: 4 stars, another filler, cheesy organ solo <br /> <br />THe End: 5 stars, another of the doors' best, amazing lyrics
B00006SFBD|5.0|Purpose <br /> <br />The purpose of this review is to inform, as impartially as possible, as to the quality of this product, rate it, explain why I came to this conclusion, as well as pass on any helpful information to the reader that could aid in finding similar products.  Hope it helps. <br /> <br />Critique <br /> <br />The sixth Opeth album, this is questionably Opeth's heaviest, and quite possibly their best.  It has almost every bit of the heaviness of 'Hearse', yet combined with the technicality of 'Blackwater Park' two-fold; in MHO, anyway.  And that's one potent combination. <br /> <br />Comaprison <br /> <br />What is Opeth?  Opeth basically defies classification.  The words beautiful, brooding, sometimes intense, sometimes soft, sometimes eerie, and always beautiful come to mind.  Yet that is a pale description.  It's death metal, but not about blood and gore, like Cattle Decapitation, and like bands, (No offense, fans of aforementioned.) with long, progressive song structures, and is truly of an unsurpassed quality.  Just me, but I've never encountered a more consistantly impressive band in this genre, that not only brings everything death metal, but also beauty.  And I don't mean what some consider to be twisted, perverted beauty either.  For that, type in keyword_Slayer_, or _Emperor_.  Once agin, no offense to fans; good music, but the lyrics are a bit, um, extreme, for my tastes. <br /> <br />Album Breakdown <br /> <br />This album is all but entirely dominated by some of the heaviest, fastest, most intense, and at the same time most beautiful riffs of any Opeth album, and that's saying something.  Very few acoustical \\"softer\\" sections here, so if you are a fan of Opeth's earlier work, such as 'Morningrise', or of their all-acoustical album 'Damnation', and death metal vox bother you, then this may not be for you.  Personally, I love the heaviness and death metal vocals, but it obviously depends on the person.  Just a heads' up. <br /> <br />SimilarBands <br /> <br />Agalloch (Slower than Opeth, Black metal vocals, slightly inferior); recommended albums: Pale Folklore, and The Mantle.  Pale Folklore is the heaviest of the two.)  Ulver (Strictly Black metal, before switching over to electronic music.  I know, WTF? but their three Black metal albums are great.  They are, in descending intensity; Nattans Madrigal, Bergtatt, and Kveldssanger.) <br /> <br />Bottom Line <br /> <br />If you are an Opeth fan and don't have this album yet, you're missing out, BIG time.

0316168815|5.0|This is such a great book. I listened to the unabridged cd version on my walks. I didn't want to stop walking. I'd walk miles daily just so I could hear more! Everyone else has given a synopsis and described the story. I simply want to say that this is a must read! The narrator in the unab. version is wonderful. Perfect for the gym, walks, or a long commute. I love the story and the author is phenominal. Her book Lucky is good too.
B00004RYZT|5.0|On Rammstein's first(?) DVD, they are playing in (guess where)Berlin in a super-high energy performance playing tracks from their first two CD's. I've watched this DVD multiple times, and I have to say that this is an exceptional concert. The band has great energy, Flake does a dance, and Till does somersaults in boots that shoot sparks. On the ending track, Seemann, Flake gets an inflatable boat and crowd-surfs on it. They didn't play a few songs I wanted them to play (Der Meister, Eifersucht), but overall it's an amazing show.

6305897786|3.0|- CAUTION: SPOILERS BELOW -<br /><br />I first saw Ninth Gate at the theater in 1999 or 2000 and I'm convinced that that is the best way to see this movie. Lights low, huge picture in front of you, rich, booming sound. The opening credits are great; Polish musician Wojciech Kilar's opening theme is excellent and sets an appropriate tone of weariness and dread. Some of the pluckier parts of the soundtrack don't seem to mesh too well, or seem dated -- but the opening theme is masterfully done.<br /><br />The movie concerns a book dealer's attempts to piece together the three known copies of a medieval tome that was supposedly co-written by Lucifer in 1666. Yes, co-authored by Lucifer himself. Apparently Lucifer likes to sign his name \\"LCF,\\" the movie shows, and he does engravings, too. Piecing together all Lucifer's drawings in the 3 extant copies of the 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows,' a book that reminds of the Necronomicon, enables one to summon the dark lord. Or so the theory goes.<br /><br />Depp does an adequate, low-key job as the unscrupulous book collector in search of the volumes on behalf of a wealthy New York client (Frank Langella). As others have mentioned, you do get the feeling that some sort of unspeakable evil is always JUST around the corner. But after awhile it begins to feel like a big put-on. Is anything going to ever happen or not? The pacing of the plot is deliberate, even langorous, and there is a good amount of suspense and unease, ladled on thick and grey in various European settings. The characters are interesting and even eerie (the two book makers in Portugal, for example).<br /><br />There are some moments, however, where the film seems to devolve into self-parody. For example, when you think of it, Satan himself, sitting around, doing drawings, and planting them in 3 different books -- well, that's kind of absurd, no? Nonetheless, if you don't think about such minutaie too much, you can enjoy the atmosphere and moodiness the movie conjures. One failing of the movie was when Depp's character, Corso, encounters the pack of Satanists at a secluded European mansion. This scene, which should have been climactic, seems to want to play like EYES WIDE SHUT, and it does sort of play that way -- but it's EYES WIDE SHUT as directed for the old 80s TV show Amazing Stories. Kind of hokey. In fact, some moments of this scene are laughably bad: One of the female Satanists, for some reason, hastily strips off her black silk robe and scuttles away naked, as if she'd just seen Godzilla approaching Mt. Fuji. Granted, fleeing is one thing -- but stripping off your clothes as you do so? Why was this put here? What the heck, Roman Polanski? Another Satanist looks like a Renassance Fair enthusiast, in long hair and a pony tail. And when Frank Langella strides into the scene, dressed like lawyer Melvin Belli in the Rolling Stones' GIMME SHELTER, proclaiming, \\"Mumbo jumbo! Mumbo jumbo! Mumbo jumbo!\\" it's hard not to laugh.<br /><br />The ending also felt antclimactic. I remember in the theater that folks sat in hushed silence as the credits came up, and there was a feeling of disbelief that that confused, ambiguous little bit at the end really was the ending. (You'll know what I mean when you see it.)<br /><br />If someone else other than Roman Polanski had made this movie -- a new director, perhaps -- you'd think, \\"Hmm, this was uneven but it had its moments. I can't wait to see what this director does in the next few years.\\" But since it *is* Polanski and you expect a degree of excellence from him, it's a let down -- of sorts. ROSEMARY'S BABY and REPULSION are far superior to this. But if you have seen THE TENANT, Polanski's last of his unofficial trilogy of which REPULSION & ROSEMARY'S were the first two parts, well, it's about on level with that. THE TENANT was also a good, suspenseful, disturbing movie that nonetheless delivered a confusing, unsatisfying ending and had uneven, silly moments.<br /><br />I'mtorn between recommending this or not. I give it 3 stars. I wish I could say 3 and a half. It's not bad. But it just isn't as great as we know Polanski is capable of. Go into it with low expectations and you may be surprised.rs. I wish I could say 3 and a half. It's not bad. But it just isn't as great as we know Polanski is capable of. Go into it with low expectations and you may be surprised.
B0000024W3|5.0|Too many people for too long have been too busy trying to sound like professional music critics, spouting out phrases from old reviews without ever really listening closely to this album. Try listening without pre-judging it. Finally a lot of people are starting to say that Self Portrait is one of Dylan's most important masterpieces. So it is. This is Dylan's Moby Dick. An awesome work that crashes now and then, but what beautiful crashes. Like Moby Dick, so late in being understood. But the tide is changing. This is monumental art, even at its most subtle and subdued. But it's raucous and silly and sad and weird, too. This is Dylan's most revealing album. Don't listen to the sourpusses. I think maybe they've been listening to their leaf blowers for too long. There is so much here, if you can hear it.
B000GRTQSE|5.0|While Bob Dylan, like most other 60+ rock (ok - folk) singers, just doesn't have the musical range he had when he was in his 20's, this album is still worth having. <br /> <br />First off, it's a piece of history - from a man who made history.  Second, the stories in the songs are as good as anything Dylan has ever done. <br /> <br />The voice is not what it once was, but it is still Dylan and it is still very listenable! <br />
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I saw James T Kirk's Star Trek new on TV in the late 60s. It was the 1st so it can never be Kitsch. I don't watch those reruns with eyes of 2006, I remember it thru the eyes of 1970. Likewise Buffy the predecessor of supernatural cannot be kitschy. <br />I, like everyone else, love the chemistry between the brothers, two. But the chemistry between Kirk, Spock, Doc, and neo, Trinity, Morpheus, and Buffy, Willow, Zander et al etc was also superlative. And therein lies the rub. Supernatural has with only two constant charachters fewer strings, less dimensions. As a comparison it's flatter. And that's why I decided to write this review. If Buffy et al are 5 stars this must be 4. Yes, the dialogue's O.K., but it's not on a par with the wit and banter of Buffy, where you have expressions like 5 by 5 actually created on Buffy and becoming part of our lexicon.  <br />Of course I grant that the Male Candy does nothing for me while the Female Candy of Buffy does, so my perspective is undoubtably gender biased. And in the end I do love the trek thru the byways and backways of America. Our legends and folklore. Padaleckis, Ackles and Kripkes America. <br />So what can I do, 5 stars it is.
B000002O51|5.0|Judging by the title of this review, you might assume I was alive when this album was originally released in the mid-1980s and that I'm referring to how I felt at that time.    You would be terribly mistaken.    I discovered this wonderful album when I was 16 years old, in January of 2005.  I had always loved the band Boston ever since I bought the debut album in the summer of 2003--even more memories, some of them bittersweet (there was a girl...), were linked with the band, and especially their debut album.  Back to 2005: I had, at the time, just recently purchased the band's sophomore effort, 'Don't Look Back,' and was blown away by it.  So there I was that evening, vacillating in my decision to buy 'Third Stage', mainly because of the rather steep price--$14.99.  I stood before the thing for five minutes before, finally and on a whim, I decided to take it.  My final deciding factor?  At the time, I had strong feelings for a girl named Amanda, and of course that's the first song on the album. (Don't tell her; she must never know!)    Why did I relate this personal story?  I included it because it demonstrates the power of timeless music: It can distill memories and emotions and, when listened to years later, conjure those memories in a breathtaking flurry of nostalgia.  My musical tastes have shifted quite a bit in the past two years (if you read my other reviews you'll see that I'm a fanatic for progressive rock), but some things just don't change.  Right now there's a big, goofy grin on my face as I'm thinking about Amanda.  Your miles may vary, but for me, Boston has released nothing but timeless, memorable songs.  Those found on 'Third Stage' are no exception.    Normally I would go into a didactical description of what was going on with the band at the time, list the members, etc.  Tom Scholz makes my job much simpler for me, considering that he and Brad Delp (vocals) WERE the band.  There were a few others who appeared very rarely, almost like session players, but Tom Scholz basically played all the instruments, and his reigning decree still holds true for this album: \\"No Computers Used/No Synthesizers Used.\\"  Somehow this concept of rock and roll purity appeals to me, even if my prefered genre of rock (prog) wouldn't exist without synthesizers.  Instead of using synths, Tom exacted some ingenious studio effects, including using a pitch bender with a bad transistor to simulate the sounds produced by a launching spacecraft.  Tom was way ahead of his time, and the music really shows it.  There is a certain sound Boston has that cannot be accurately described with any of the words in the English lexicon.  The Boston sound is heard loud and clear on 'Third Stage,' albeit with some modifications.  Generally, the album sounds somewhat darker and more desolate than the previous, sunny albums.    Then of course there was the infamous eight year duration between the second and third Boston albums, and the legal battles that would have suffocated any but the most brilliant artists.  Somehow, Tom and Brad soldiered on and produced what would be the band's last great album.    So, introduction to the band complete, it's time to take a journey through 'Third Stage.'      1.  \\"Amanda\\" - Ah, the familar track that made me decide to buy the album.  The melody is catchy, the words are pretty straightforward (without being too sappy, like some love songs), and the emotional output is practically off the scale.  And of course you all know why I like this song so much.  On a broader note, the guitars sound otherworldly on this entire album, and the climax of \\"Amanda\\" is a precursor to the sound of this album.  I like the 12-string strumming at the beginning; it sort of fits the album graphic for some strange reason.    Just a tidbit: You would be astounded to realize just how many girls have been named Amanda because of this song.  If you don't believe me, ask every Amanda you know, and I guarantee you will find at least one who can trace her name back to this track.    2.  \\"We're Ready\\" - This one grew on me.  At first I thought it was all right, but there is something about this song--perhaps the more melodic nature, or the strange yet pleasant harmonizing and lyrics--that eventually captivated me.  The beginning is soft, with a repeated tap on the closed high-hat.  Brad Delp's voice, beautiful as ever, really shines on this track.  Once the track builds in intensity, it's quite clear that this is a rock song.  Througout the course of the song, the intensity ebbs and flows.  This song segues into the third track.    3.  \\"The Launch\\" - This is a short instrumental designed to be the sonic representation of a launching spacecraft--one that is organ-fueled, according to the liner notes.  There is an incredible sense of presence in this track.  There is a calm before the plunge, which begins all at once with some thunderous chords.  A Conn Theater organ is used to monumental effect.  And this is where that pitch bender I mentioned is used.  This track segues into the next cut with a powerful pitch sweep.    4.  \\"Cool The Engines\\" - This is the closest this album comes to the obligatory \\"Smokin'\\"/\\"Party\\" inclusions from the first two albums, in respective order.  \\"Cool\\" is a straight-up rocker that brims with intensity and drive.  Delps vocals take on an almost frantic, forced quality, which compliments the song very nicely.  This segues into the fifth and final track in the connected sequence.    5.  \\"My Destination\\" - This is perhaps my favorite song on the entire album.  I really like the new lyrics applied to a transposed version of the \\"Amanda\\" theme.  The track begins softly, there is an instrumental bridge, and then the music really takes off.  The climax always gives me chills, and no matter how many times I tell myself there's no way in hell I will ever be able to hit that insanely high note (it's the E above tuning A-440), I still sing along (when nobody else is around, that is).    Now letme make a few points before I go on.  First of all, about the fifth track and some criticism that has been leveled against it.  Yeah, it revamps the \\"Amanda\\" melody.  So what?  That's the point.  The first five tracks are a sort of suite.  I know from reverse experience (you'll understand what I mean if you've been there) that it does no good to try to assign meaning to AOR tracks in the manner it is sought in progressive rock, but I think Tom Scholz actually meant to say something important on this album.  I don't entirely know what it might have been, except that the tracks following the first five are markedly darker in mood.  It seems as though the final track in this series is the culmination of one experience (one stage in life, if you will), and that the next five are part of another experience or experiences.  The sixth track, a very short intermission of sorts, seems to support this interpretation of the album's structure.    6.  \\"A New World\\" - This is a very short instrumental, much like an intermission (as I said before).  It's a little over thirty seconds in length and serves much the same purpose as \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\" on Yes's 'Fragile' (1972) release (for more information, see my review of this fine album).  \\"A New World\\" segues into the next track.    7.  \\"To Be A Man\\" - This is the first of the darker songs.  It seems as though Brad is singing about introspective, relating all the things a man should be--and these are not the typical \\"masculine\\" things popular culture pounds into our heads, either.  Society should listen to Tom Scholz on this one; he has some good thoughts on the matter.  Anyway, this song is very beautiful melodically.  The \\"Rockman violins\\" (Rockman amplifier-processed guitar) make their first appearance at the beginning of this track.    8.  \\"I Think I Like It\\" - This one really doesn't belong here.  It's a cover of a John English rocker from a decade and a half before Tom rewrote it.  It's not a bad song overall (apparently it's radically revamped from the original, and since it sounds like anything else on the album, I believe it), but I have a general dislike for covers.  Plus, it can get a little cheesy at times.  But not so bad that I don't listen to it when it passes by.      If you honestly want Dr. Prog's explanation for why this song is included, then you'll have to sit through my interpretaton of the meaning of the second half of the album: The fellow who is narrating the story all of a sudden feels strongly for some girl other than Amanda, and he is starting to become aware that he likes spending time with her.  As evidenced from clues in the later songs, she's somebody he knew and loved before he met Amanda.  The next two songs have him battling with the notion of having two loves in his life, until he finally ends up with the new one (Hollyann).  I often wondered about why poor Amanda got screwed over, and I guess that sort of explains it.    9.  \\"Can'tcha Say/Still In Love\\" (the album case mislabels the second part of this track with a separate, consecutive track number) - This song has two distinct parts, with the first part refraining at the end of the song.  The song begins with raw vocal harmonies sung by Maestro Delp.  It's a medium-tempo ballad for a while, then things slow down considerably when Brad pours out his heart in the \\"Still In Love\\" section, singing the line \\"Ooo, still in love with you\\" twice.  Then, as promised, the original theme picks up and the song ends.  Overall, it's a darker song, despite the upbeat cast that pervades the ballad portion.    10. \\"Hollyann\\" - So, the narrator finally gets his beloved Hollyann.  So what happens to poor Amanda?  We never find out.  This song always left a sour taste in my mouth, only because its lyrics remind of the pretentious preaching Tom Scholz does in the liner notes, along with his endorsement for PETA.  I have no problem with Tom's beliefs, but I would rather he not use a Boston album as cheap advertisement for them.      So, all in all, where does this album end up?  I give it four-and-a-quarter stars for content, and I supply the extra three-quarters of a star for the memories I have tied to this release.  This album, more than any other Boston release, carries some pretty potent nostalgia.  If you must know, some of it involves Amanda, while other parts of it involve eating spicy chicken burritos from Taco Bell and banging away on the keyboards at Guitar Center.  Randomocity?  You bet.  But I would be willing to wager that many of you have songs and albums that remind you vividly of what you were doing around the period in your lives you were listening to them.    'Third Stage' just happens to be one such album for me.    P.S. When is this going to get remastered?  Tom Scholz personally remastered the first two Boston albums with very satisfactory results, but of course those were on the Epic (now Sony) label, while 'Third Stage' is on the MCA label.  Even if the labels are different, it really is about time with this one.  The sound quality is pretty bad by today's standards.  Or by any standards...
B00005JLD4|5.0|Rabbitproof Fence is based on a true story of three young Aboriginal girls who ran away from a government relocation program in 1930's Australia.  \\"Half-caste\\" (half-white) Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their parents by the government, placed in schools that taught the white way of life, and placed with white families.  Many children never saw their parents again.<br /><br />Against such a tragic backdrop, Rabbitproof Fence is impossibly exhilarating, not because of a happy ending, but just because someone tried to fight a racist program against impossible odds.  Three young girls seek to walk fifteen hundred miles back to their family, as they are chased by trackers.<br /><br />The extras - the making-of documentary and the film commentary by the director truly enhance the film and make it an experience you will never forget, not entertainment for a few hours.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.
B000H305U0|5.0|I was expecting this CD to be as \\"pop\\" as the last, but it was totally different.  I love the interludes incorportated into many of the tracks.

B000GRUS22|5.0|I have been waiting for this album since I heard of its future release in May of this year. To be honest I was extremely skeptical when I first heard the single. However when the album was release I was like wth ya know? So I bought it and I haven't stopped listening to it since. This album is very good; the direction I could almost foresee evolving from Screen Behind the Mirror. If you like new age/electronica (and Enigma of course) then this is a great album for you.
B000GPIPT2|5.0|After disappointingly releasing James Whale's 1931 classic Frankenstein in two previous DVD editions, I had my doubts as to whether or not this edition would be any better. Would Universal give this classic horror film the treatment it deserved? To be honest, the previous DVD's special features were always great, like documentaries, audio commentary, ect.; but the one real issue that bothered me about the other editions was picture and audio quality. I can honestly say that, even after going as far as making a side by side comparison between the first release and this new edition, this new anniversary edition is the one to own. Much has been improved over the old versions, and I could not see any blemishes that exist here that did not exist before. The film now looks sharper, with significantly less dirt and dust, and the contrast of the expressionist photography has also been improved, with truer blacks and more subtle grays giving the film's cinematography the dark starkness it was intended to have, I dare say the film probably hasn't looked this good in years. And as a plus, they let the end credits fade to black like they were intended to, unlike in previous DVD editions when they strangely paused the end credits. As far as audio is concerned, it is good and loud, somewhat hissy, but not distractingly so. Extra special features also worth while. This new edition finally fives this classic the digital treatment it deserves and proves that even after 75 years, Frankenstein is still a fascinating landmark in early American horror cinema.

B000GFLAI0|5.0|this is great bob dylan stuff. i am a huge fan. the music gets better every time i listen to it. i find myself snapping my fingers to the rhythm alot. if you love bob and his work you will grow to love this cd. it is another great chapter in an unbelievable artistic canon. bob continues to explore the same important territories; the joys and pain of love, the mystery of god, the pain and glory of the human condition and mans' inhumanity toward himself and his neighbor. this stuff is so deeply ingrained in his psyche it flows forth from his soul like a mighty waterfall. i'm not sure how much non-fans will like this cd. it's so much more enjoyable if you already connect strongly with bob's work. in many ways this cd seems like one big love letter from bob to his fans and anyone who wants to hear what he is saying. there is alot of magic in there. just keep listening...
B000002JS6|5.0|one of my least favorite AC/DC albums, but it's AC/DC, it deserves 5 stars

0743298020|1.0|I was very excited when I started this novel. It seemed to have all the ingredients for an uplifting experience. But no, the more it developed, the more it lost its potential. The characters became completely absurd, the story  contorted and not so intelligent. Overall it made me feel that I was waisting my time. I have to give credit to a sometimes evocative and poetic writing. Too bad.
B00008G9JM|4.0|I don't think we'll ever see a work like this again.Uncompromising,entirely original.The musical presentation  is inspiring.But it's the lyric that gets me over the edge.Anderson's lyrics are endlessly being labled as \\"nonsense\\"! <br />   We've got to get the typewriters away from these people, before they disuade one more free thinker from hearing this great poetry. <br />  Ian,we are out here!WE are listening!Pray, persevere plying personal prose, pending planting pretty peppers. <br />    PASSION PLAY PACKS POWER!!!!!!!!!!!
B000AADYRQ|1.0|I'm not going to say I'm a long-time Death Cab fan, but my fondness for the band has led me through their entire catalogue, from Transatlanticism all the way back to You Can Play These Songs With Chords, my personal favorite being We Have The Facts... I tend to prefer lo-fi indie rock, though the sheer strength of Death Cab's songwriting kept me a fan up through Trans. <br />  A lot of people will think I'm ridiculous for saying that this is Death Cab's worst batch of songs ever. Sure, the lyrics for Follow You Into The Dark flow perfectly from one line to the next and are even visually vivid, but it doesn't even sound like Ben Gibbard is trying anymore. It's the distillation of all the clever word-play he's been perfecting over the years, and this is the pinnacle, except the key ingredient - emotional conviction - is noticably absent. That seems to be the best way for me to describe Plans - perfectly clever and absolutely predictable songs that rely on studio polish instead of sincerity.  This is fiction, not fact, for the first time in years. <br />  It's a trait noticable down to the CD cover. Something About Airplanes comes with a textured CD book with holes punched through so you can see the subsequent pages, where-as Plans comes with a glossy, plasticy booklet. It's an entirely different aesthetic at work than on the previous albums that seemed so uniquely vulnerable. <br />  To be fair, there's only one other person I know who detests this album like I do, so odds are, if you're reading this review, you will in fact enjoy Plans. My guess is that most Death Cab fans have already purchased this and made up their minds, or have decided to steer clear altogether. If you heard DCfC on the radio, it's more than likely that big studio productions don't grate on your nerves the way they do on me, so you probably won't have the same qualms with the album I do. I just had to throw in my two cents and hope that some of you will check out Death Cab's earlier work, because this is far far far from their best. And if \\"lo-fi\\" scares you, check out The Photo Album. It's a good example of polished integrity.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|i heard about this great movie that was grizzly and bloodly but it wasnt anything that i expected it to be. It was an ok movie but dont expect anything special from it...
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Let's remember just how old this band is, where metal stared and where it is presently. I suppose music has to evolve as time passes and this album represents a stage in the evolution of Iron Maiden. <br /> <br />While the sound is different from the classic 80's metal, the song construction demonstrates a maturity in the lyrical ideology that is highlighted by the varying rhythms in most of the tracks. The more prominent soft intros are akin to classical pieces amd are complemented by the powerful guitar melodies that follow. <br /> <br />Quite interestingly, I have found this album to retain its sound value when played soft. Its not thrashy metal...it's melodic, slow then fast, then the rhytym changes. It's like a step up from Brave new World. I've often played it as background music for inspiration and relaxtion. <br /> <br />Another thing is the direction of the lyrics. They are a little more abstract and pseudo-political...well except for Passchendaele which is downright historical. <br /> <br />While all the songs are great, some do stand out: <br /> <br />Rainmaker: for its instantaneous catchy melody. <br /> <br />No More Lies: a great classical intro and geared up melody with abstract lyrics <br /> <br />Dance of Death : haunting and epic storytelling <br /> <br />Passchendael: for lovers of history, this is even better than reading a book about the battle of YPres in WW1. It gives a chilling and passionate depiction of trench warfare in no-man's land <br /> <br />Face in the Sand: abstract/political with beautiful bass and ahunting theme melody <br /> <br />Age of Innocence: great singing, lyrics <br /> <br />Journeyman: masonic overtones and a nice ballad <br /> <br /> <br />So, don't expect to hear the trooper or aces high. But I guarantee you you will get to love this album if you give it a chance. Like any Maiden fan the guys have grown 20 odd years and it shows in a good way.
B00003BDXG|1.0|I felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer. After about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so I turned it off.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is a great new millenium effort by the band. I really do love the majority of songs especially blood brothers and dream of mirrors. This is the first time that the 3 guitar thing was employed and its a great effort. the follwing albums confirm that they have mastered it. The difference between this album and the others is that they are being led by the triad as opposed to manipulating it. However it is a return to a more hardcore metal soung.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one. <br /> <br />I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English (\\"Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?\\") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.    <br /> <br />To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of \\"...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking...\\" or \\"...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking...\\" but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something. <br /> <br />Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!   <br /> <br />To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive?
B000A59PMO|5.0|Ah, where to start? It's not easy to pigeonhole Veronica Mars, the series. This quirky show from UPN contains elements of the procedural detective mystery, high school/family drama, and the soap opera show, as well as a season-long conspiracy plotline. While this series was engrossing to watch on a televised schedule, this 6-dvd package enriches the viewing experience even more. Not only are the dvds not encumbered with commercials, but there's a more defined sense of immediacy and coherence as you watch multiple episodes in a row, allowing you to soak in more of the show's nuances and plot progressions. The viewer profits from the show's tendency to smoothly mesh ongoing story arcs from episode to episode, building up the season's main storyline and adding more texture to the lesser subplots. Veronica Mars boasts a continuing, season-long murder mystery, great acting and plotting, and comprehensive character development. The series debut and ensuing shows incorporate effective flashback scenes, chronicling Veronica's prior Cinderella life from a year before, which culminate with the shocking murder of her best friend Lilly Kane and Veronica's resulting ostracism by her high school peers.<br /><br />Veronica (Kristen Bell) becomes an assistant to her ex-sheriff father, Keith Mars (the awesome Enrico Colantoni), in his newly formed private detective agency, and she proves to be a resourceful and dogged clue chaser in her own right. She hasn't at all forgotten the brutal slaying of her best friend and means to ultimately rip apart that convoluted veil of conspiracy. Every episode seems to introduce new clues to Lilly's death and progressively finds our sleuth inching ever closer to unearthing the murderer (making it hard for you to miss even one show). The payoff is in Season One's final episode, in which the mystery of Lilly's murder is finally resolved. Meanwhile, she handles the more mundane cases involving credit card fraud, missing persons, a missing high school parrot mascot, a runaway dog, a stolen BMW, a cult, etc. All that, as she continues to transition from living the life of the haves to the life of the have-nots, and while also suffering the woes and pressures of high school life.<br /><br />The show is elevated with that rare grouping of brilliant writing, sensitive directing, and gifted acting. The acting, in particular, is augmented by the talents of Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Jason Dohring. I find their respective characters to be the most developed and the most intriguing. The father-daughter relationship between Veronica and her cool dad Keith is truly wonderful to behold and so enjoyable to watch. And, while I initially disliked the angry, sarcastic, mean-spirited Logan Echolls, Jason Dohring invests his role with so many layers that he very quickly becomes one of the show's most interesting characters. Besides, Dohring has a screen presence that cannot be denied, although he does look like a bitter Peyton Manning. Kristen Bell, of course, propels the show. She effortlessly delivers with a plucky and ironic take on her role that makes Veronica Mars seem simultaneously tough and vulnerable, while being also incredibly resourceful, smart, and sexy. Yeah, I know - that's a lot of adjectives, but they all fit, yes? Even the lesser characters are given ample spotlight. Percy Daggs III (Wallace, Veronica's best bud), Francis Capra (Weevil, likable thug from the wrong side of town), and Harry Hamlin (Aaron Echolls, Logan's movie star dad) all make hefty contributions. But, with all the wrenching, dramatic scenes that went on in this season, my favorite moment still is Veronica doing karaoke, which is a nod to Kristen Bell's multi-faceted skills.<br /><br />Not much in the way of special features here: a tiny booklet summarizing the Season One episodes, over 20 minutes of unaired scenes, and an extended version of the pilot episode with an unaired opening sequence.<br /><br />So, what do we have in the Veronica Mars series? Well, it offers savage high school politics and power plays, the juxtaposed lifestyles of the priveleged and the not-so-priveleged, topical teenager problems, interesting subplots, sparkling dialogue, wicked one-liners, and rich, perfectly nuanced performances. It also offers a young girl who had been kicked to the curb but who stands up for herself and her father and who will never take flak from anyone. Following in the footsteps of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in terms of its edgy high school sensibilities (with Bell matching Sarah Michelle Gellar in the petite, cute, and dry-humored heroine department) and borrowing from David Lynch in its prevailing Twin Peaks-styled mystery, Veronica Mars: The Complete First Season is addictive watching, with several messages to impart. And I even like the theme song.ica Mars series?

B00005JKES|5.0|Moviehole announced that Twin Peaks Season 2 has been delayed to 2007. This all makes perfect sense, as Lynch has not even begun to do the transfers. Figure the earliest he would be able to begin would be sometime in November when INLAND EMPIRE should be distributed worldwide. Keep in mind that 20+ hours of Twin Peaks will take at least 2-3 months to do the audio and video transfers, color timing, and new 5.1 mixes, plus manufacturing times, and May 2007 sounds just about right. Hopefully Angelo will still be releasing the Season 2 Soundtrack at the end of 2006 to hold us over (yes, there will be a new Twin Peaks CD). Once again, if Paramount was smart, they would have had these episodes transferred well before the rights reverted to them in November of 2005. <br /> <br />If you check out the Angelo Badalamenti Myspace Page, they have just released a piano version of \\"Love Theme\\" from the upcoming Twin Peaks Season 2 CD planned for a release to coincide with the Twin Peaks Season 2 DVD. Also, look below at what might be a picture of the upcoming CD's cover art. You can read the words \\"Where the birds sing a pretty song and there's always music in the air.\\" <br /> <br />What we do know exactly is that there were all new interviews filmed with the cast and crew last year, so we can expect this box set to be as good if not better than the previous Season 1 box set by Artisan/Lionsgate. <br /> <br />Theres your updated info on the Season Two DVDs!
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I saw this concert at Radio City Music Hall in NYC. I couldnt wait for it to come out on DVD!!! Even my husband who I dragged along with me got into the music and the \\"experience\\". Great overall musical talent from everyone on stage. I highly recommend seeing this show!!!
B000H7JD4K|5.0|I've been an Iron Maiden fan since I first listened to the Killers album back in 1981, therefore I have all of their work and I love it; even the Blaze era - which most people don't like. The classic era, especially, is, for me, the best Heavy Metal life could have spawned, but I felt that you could always dispose of one or two songs on every album. <br /> <br />With A Matter Of Life And Death things are different; it's almost imposible to dispose of a single song, a single tune, a single beat. Lyrics are beautiful, most of them dealing with War and how it can be the stupidest thing in the World. Songs about living life at its full, the history of Mayflower, the magic of being born, religions, even Lucifer, are depicted in this incredible album. <br /> <br />Music-wise, well... what can I say? These guys are like wine: they get better as they get more mature (I refuse to use the word \\"older\\"). In spite of what some people say, this is NOT a progressive album. It has, though, some progressive elements that are beautifully and wisely placed in the songs; so, don't expect to find Dream Theater here. <br /> <br />I only hope that they'll release at least one more album before they say goodbye for good, and that their music lives on and on... <br /> <br />Up the Irons!
B00000K3D4|3.0|Despite some stilted acting, this is still a wildly imaginitive and fun movie with a great sense of humour. However it does get a little tedious towards the end.
1400049628|5.0|This book is a wonderful piece of fiction. I hesitate to really call it \\"humor\\", because while I find it amusing that the book is presented as deathly serious, it doesn't really make me laugh while reading it. Rather, I think this book is just well-designed as a no-nonsense guide to living through a Zombie attack. Perhaps the best thing about the book is that it advises you NOT to be a hero, it warns against trying to take on hordes of undead. It tells you to be reasonable; avoid confrontation unless necessary. It treats its reader as an average suburbanite.  <br /> <br />Brook's Zombies are based IN PART on the works of George A. Romero, famous creator of \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and the \\"Dawn/Day/Land of the Dead\\" movies. Brooks differentiates his creations, however, by keeping them solely within the realm of the mundane. There is a clear explaination on how they come about, and though the way in which the virus Solanum turns the human brain into a hard-wired, anaerobic eating machine is not fully understood, Brooks never relies on mysticism to explain the Walking Plague. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most affecting part of the book is the \\"Recorded Outbreaks\\" section, which describes actual Zombie outbreaks throughout history. Late at night, after reading some of these accounts, I would feel the need to occasionally look out the window, just in case there was an approaching pack of mindless undead heading my way. <br /> <br />This book is not for everyone, however. Clearly, it requires a certain sense of humor to be willing to sit down and read this book. I like to say that it's funny BECAUSE it's not funny. Some people don't get that type of humor. I personally have a friend who thinks the Guide is just stupid. People like this are better off watching Shaun of the Dead, which is a great movie but contains much more obvious humor that they will have an easier time relating to. <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a great piece of fiction that subtly works quite hard to present itself as fact. A must-read if you aren't ardently against extremely subtle humor.
6305558167|5.0|\\"Excalibur\\" is the greatest cinematic interpretation of the Arthurian legend, and perhaps the best film ever made in the fantasy genre. Yes, the movie has flaws: the dialogue can be a little goofy at times, the acting somewhat- shall we say - idiosyncratic, the special effects don't always work, and the internal logic is not always apparent (the Grail is Arthur? Arthur is the land? et al). But those flaws are very easily forgotten when this movie is taken as a whole. I've never seen cinematography like it; it's like watching a dream or seeing a Pre-Raphaelite painting brought to life. Combine that with the Wagnerian music (although I would have preferred Stokowski to Solti), and some scenes manage to achieve the highest Gesamtkunstwerk ideal. If you even have a shred of imagination left, you'll find something to love in this movie.
0307346609|4.0|This was a very good book. I love the concept, and I am not ashamed (well, ok, I'm a LITTLE ashamed) to admit that I, a twenty-year-old man, was kept awake at night by both The Zombie Survival Guide's \\"Outbreaks\\" section and much of this book's tales from survivors, nervously glancing out the window from time to time or pausing to listen for a distinctive moan. Unfortunately, however, I feel this book does not quite live up to its predecessor, The Zombie Survival Guide. The Guide is one of my all-time favorite books, and a major part of its clever appeal is the way in which it is presented: serious, earnest, and with almost no sense of \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" zanyness that would have screamed to readers, \\"GET IT? GET IT? IT'S NOT REAL!\\" The Guide was presented as a stern, no-nonsense instructional on how to survive an undead attack. This book is too presenting in a mostly straight-faced manner. Really, the only sections I felt were a little silly were the Grover Carlson and T. Sean Collins \\"interviews\\". They both seemed more like the author's view of the Bush Administration's policy-making and overblown charicatures of  current celebrities, respectively. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot wrong with both of those factions of America, but it just seems out of place in this book. I can almost hear the author saying \\"Oh-ho-HO, they got THEIR comuppance!\\" It really distracted me from the overall feel of the book. Other than these two grating sections, I think that Max Brooks has created a truly believable world in which humanity was nearly wiped out by zombies, and I still look forward to any possible Zombie books that Mr. Brooks may pen.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The following is from a couple of film critic reviews I read about Serenity: <br /> <br />-\\"Effectively a Western in space, Serenity is a thoroughly entertaining, smartly written, beautifully acted, rip-roaring action-adventure movie, that will appeal to both Firefly fans and newcomers alike.\\" <br /> <br />-\\"The cleverest, crankiest, wittiest, wildest, and most character-driven sci-fi adventure in 25 years; it's the best outer-space trip I've been on since the empire struck back.\\" <br /> <br />I bought the movie not knowing anything about the Firefly TV series or what to expect.  To my surprise, Serenity proved to be one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.  It has great acting, plot, characters, etc.  <br /> <br />If you enjoy the movie, you should definitely pick up the Firefly DVD set (the TV series that started it all). Let's only hope that either a Serenity 2 is made or the TV series is brought back for all to enjoy.
B00005JPBD|5.0|Pedro Almodovar has incredible insight into women, and reminds me of a cross between Ingmar Bergman, Fellini and Woody Allen; with a healthy dash of warmth and gentleness that is sometimes lacking in the others. <br /> <br />Penelope Cruz gives a award worthy performance as a young single mother with unresolved issues with her own mother that are slowly revealed; Carmen Maura is amazing in the role of the ghostly mother; Lola Duneas plays the long suffering sister who is unwittingly the one in the middle of her sister and mothers drama.  Every actor in this film gives an incredible performance, and it is truly a tribute to Almodovar, who surely will be remembered as one of the finest filmmakers making movies today,
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater, owning all their studio albums, and some singles. I loved SFAM, I&W, SDOIT, and Awake. After their peak at SFAM, I didn't expect them to release anything better. But I didn't expect them to release anything that was too bad. <br /> <br />They did. <br /> <br />Octavarium, flat out, isn't Dream Theater. No guitar or drum solos, not flourishes, no pretenstious and self-indulgent metal peices. Buy this if you like U2 or Coldplay, don't buy it if you like Dream Theater.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse just keep getting better, this album is absolutely stupendous. And yes, 'Knights of Cydonia' does sound like 'Telstar' .. that's because Matt's Dad, George Bellamy, was in the 'Tornados'. Fantastic, do not hesitate buy it ...  you won't be disappointed.
B000003TA4|4.0|This album had to come about. If you listen to your mid and late (what is now labled 'alternative') 80's underpinning music, you will find bits and pieces of the feel of 'Nirvana Nevermind' in the few previous years to its release (combine the music of The Pixies to that date and the AMAZING album by Slint 'Spiderland'). The underground was bubbling and screaming to erupt with songs like \\"Ice, Ice Baby\\" and Boyz 2 Men being presented as 'mainstream' still ecoing in our minds. We were tired of the silly sounds of 'Rap' and stale hairmetal, defining our countercultural status. I was a bit older then the target audience when Nevermind came out, but I remember the reaction of my friends....jaw dropping life changes for these people! The style, lives and friends of many people completely changed based on this album. All that was not quite presentable about the upcoming countercultural movement of the 90's existed in this album. Every guy wanted to be as sexy as Kurt Kobane.  People felt it possible to learn to chords on the guitar and be able to send chills down someones spine.  Almost every angstful grungey/'alternative' scream and distorted guitar played after this album paled in its pretentious weakness compared to Kobane. This album had to happen. Love it, but also love every music that led up to it and let it go. Open your ears!
B000F0UUT6|5.0|I am thrilled to get this 10th Anniversary edition and the book that comes with it as I am a great fan of this particular version of Pride & Prejudice.  Only one thing disappointed me however .... I don't care for the way the discs are stored in the set.  They are slid inbetween a cardboard envelope and it took alot of skill for me to get them out without feeling like I was scratching them up against the cardboard.  I much rather prefer when the discs are easily snapped into a case as I feel they are better protected.   Other than that, this is truly worth purchasing,  if not for the book & bonus disc alone, which do not come with the 2-dvd original version.  Buy it ... you won't be sorry!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Although Moore's brillant graphic novel of an anarchist against a faschist government is much darker, V for Vendetta tries its best and ends up with a slightly less impressive but totally worth it, spectacular film. The fast-talking, British humor makes the movie only better and more delicious to the eyes and ears. I literally almost cried near the end of the film because it was that powerful, although the only problem i didnt like about it is we never ever get a chance to see the face of a man who eventually saves the British people from a Nazi-esque government. Eventually he makes the one thing that Guy Fawkes failed at, destroying Parliament, while revealing the truth about the government that the people trusted. Although i would prefer the graphic novel over the film, mostly because this film was mostly made for Americans, because of the political problems that we are facing. V for Vendetta isn't about America problems. It's about freedom, its about anarchy against a corrupted government, its about England, but mostly its about the choices and the ideas you make that can change the world.
1427200246|4.0|\\"Our Iceberg is Melting\\" is a unique book that presents some of the key business tools for leadership and change in simple terms that anyone can understand.  This fast read gives you take home points to make the necessary changes in your company or even your personal life, in order to gain more success.  It's fun to relate the characters in the book to your own company and see how each personality is a vital part in running the business.  It's nice to go back to the basics and realize that in order to achieve the leader's goals, the leader should make it a priority to get everyone on the team involved and allow them to feel important.    My company just moved office locations, so the timing was great for me in relating to some of the issues involved with what the penguins experienced in this story.  It's refreshing to take a step back and see that it's not about where you are, but the people, values and support that you have around you that matter most.
0060555661|5.0|First, I just want to say that many of you might find this book boring to read. If that turn out to be the case, you can read the commentary (which uses more relevant and recent examples) for each chapter by Jason Zweig, which is worth the price of the book alone.  I got tempted to read the commentary only but I forced myself to read the entire book and I'm glad I did it.  Warren Buffett is right, this is the best book on investing ever written, by far.  This is one of the reasons in my opinion why Warren himself never write an investment book (plus the fact that it is not easy to explain Warren's intelligent on a paper.  Instead just learn from what he does).<br /><br />Now about the content of this book, it tells you everything you need to know about the investing field (not only stocks, but business in general, bonds, macro economy to some extent, psychological factor of the market, strategy for defensive and speculative investors etc).<br /><br />Secondly, Warren Buffett highly recommend this book and his favorites are chapter 20 (Margin of safety) and chapter 8 (Investor and market fulctuation).  Margin of safety should be the central concept of your investment, and understanding how the market works (and the mood and inconsistencies of Mr Market) should be the second thing that you need to know before jumping into the market.<br /><br />I also find the chapter 11 (security analysis for lay investor) very educating as it teaches us to value the future of a business (breaking down into 3 area:<br />1. Long term prospect<br />2. Quality and conduct of management<br />3. Financial strength and capital structure<br /><br />Additionally the comparison of eight companies (chapter 18) very practical and eye opening. I won't spill the content right here but when I read them, it feels like common sense to me, but back (during the tech bubble) then I was involved in several similar stocks that I shouldn't have touched with a ten feet pole.<br /><br />The bonus chapter \\"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\\" by Warren Buffett is a classic reading. This article shows how inefficient the market can be, and argue that most of the time the market is not efficient.  I have become a believer that the market is not efficient (after many years believing that the market is very efficient as the business school has taught me)<br /><br />This book also cover several useful metrics that we can use to value a company in addition to just looking at EPS or PE ratio, such as the ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) etc.<br /><br />In general, Ben Graham focuses a bit more on capital preservation (shown by focusing on margin of safety, dividend policy, and stocks priced below its tangible book value strategy.) which I think are really important, but one need to understand that there's more to investment than just those things (such as long term groth/the business itself and management) which are also covered in book.<br /><br />This book would not serve as your investing philosophy, but it should help you create your own investing philosophies.  It will help you find what your strength (defensive or enterprising) is and find/form your circle of competence.

B000002O1Q|5.0|The two songs on this album that tend to get the most attention are the two Steinman songs, Nowhere fast and Tonight is What it Means to Be Young.  While these are great songs that have a relentless beat, they are not the only good songs here. <br /> <br />The Stevie Nicks penned Sorcerer, performed by Marilyn Lartin, offers a more subdued and tranquil setting during the verses, but hang on tight, once that chorus comes along, she rocks the house.  Countdown To Love offers a barber shop type feel in an almost 50's style, sreet corner quartets come to mind here.  Ry Cooder, with Hold that Snake and the Fixx with Deeper and Deeper offer even more diversity to this soundtrack. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled, although you get a sample of epic rock, this album will almost give you a history lesson in the progression of rock through the years.  Amazing and eclectic album!!!
B000EHSVQE|5.0|I suppose my critiques of the film fall in to two categories. <br /> <br />1. How terrible the movie really is. <br /> <br />The film is 85 minutes of sophomoric humour without any real plot or empathy, but, it feels like hours of it. In terms of sheer quality, the film is worth passing up. <br /> <br />2. The ideological harm inflicted by the film. <br /> <br />After this film was released, its effect was that a lot of people started latching on to the idea of being an outsider. The only trouble was that most of those were the people who made most of the outsiders outsiders to begin with. <br /> <br />If you want a vision of what that life was really like for the rest of us, check out Todd Solondz's brilliant and unflinching Welcome to the Dollhouse.
B0000640SA|5.0|\\"Memento\\" eclipses everything which preceded it, and set the bar so high it may never be topped.  And all for $5 million in production costs. <br />Director Nolan does a remarkable job of juggling the complex plot elements, but sabotages himself with some of his rather ordinary visual schemes.  I refer you to the diner sequence in which characters portrayed by Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano converse over soup.  Given that the film was shot in Panavision's 2.35:1 anamorphic process, the scene would have played more effectively if Nolan had simply planted his camera for a medium shot of two skillful actors as they provided plot exposition.  Instead, Nolan intercuts between close ups of the two, which is a method more typical of and appropriate for the narrower aspect ratio of television.  Close ups work best when used judiciously and to provide emphasis.   <br />I mention this only because this is how detailed I have to go in order to find fault with the film.  If I didn't know better I would swear that Pearce is an American actor--his accent is that authentic.  All of the performances are convincing and it's always fun to see \\"Eve 6\\" (Harriet Sansom Harris) from that great \\"X-Files\\" episode.   <br />This film is proof of the morally bankrupt notion that movies have to cost $200 miilion or more.  I am SICK of ugly, witless, loud blockbusters which are polluting pop culture.  If the choice is to spend that sort of money making a movie...or allow the movie to go unmade... <br />\\"Now, where was I?\\"
B00005JKC3|2.0|I tried REALLY hard to like this movie. Unfortunately my high hopes for a harrowing and exiciting film like X-Men or Spiderman was completely shattered when I first noticed the way of how they were directing, I instantly knew that i wasn't going to like it, their attempts for making a comic book style film failed...well for me at least. First off, Ang Lee i think tries WAY too hard to make movies with good storylines too big. Paycheck was a good movie, but he tried to make it way too emotional, instead he gets a two dimensional image of a good actor. Before i knew it, i wasn't watching an amazing film based off an amazing comic book character, i was watching an amazingly done special effects, two dimensional characters walking and talking to each other wondering what they should do about a giant 2-year-old thats running around destroying things.
B000GFLAI0|1.0|more ravings and boring music from a never was.  Still cant stomach his warbling
B000002OYB|4.0|The title to this review says it all.  The music is great.  All the composers involved try to stay in the signature Steinman sound, yet they all have their individual differences.  The problem with this album does not lie with the producers, composers or instrumentalists, it lies with Meat himself.  It almost sounds painful to hear him try and sing.  His voice is not what it used to be.  His age shows especially as you listen to songs, such as Martha and Where Angels Sing, as he gasps for air and can barely squeak out many of the higher parts.  Operatic, thunderous voice, not here folks.  If you want a newer album of his that is good, buy Couldn't Have Said it Better.  Totally different voice.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|\\"The Lake House\\" is the best romance/love story since \\"The Notebook\\" with Ryan Gosling & Rachel McAdams. Keanu Reeves and the always lovely Sandra Bullock star together for the first time since the action blockbuster \\"Speed\\". He (Keanu) lives in 2004, she (Sandra) lives in 2006. A divine intervention allows them to correspond with each other through U.S. mail. Both are completely in disbelief at first but, when certain things become clear they realize that the impossible is in fact taking place. Eventually they plan to meet in person, while Bullock shows.. for some unknown reason Reeves does not. Bullock decides to forget about him not understanding why he didnt show up. Later we discover why he wasnt there and the story unfolds when we realize she will be the one that has to change events that have already happened in Reeves time but, could be altered in Bullock's present time. \\"The Lake House\\" has you really wanting these two stars to meet in present time. I think it's sweet and original and, I recommend it to all adults that have ever been in love or long to be.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I love Josh Groban's work. I own both his first CD and Closer. I would buy all of his CDs except I have never been fond of live concert CDs. I think the fans clapping and shouting out detract from the artist's work and so I tend to stay away from those sort of CDs. May he continue producing new work so I can continue finding new CDs to listen to.
0316666343|5.0|With all the reviews you probably already know the story but I will add to what has been previously written and say this is a horror story with a message of hope and I have not thought the same of heaven or our dead loves ones since. <br />If you are a hardcore skeptic looking to pick apart yet another popular book you will probably succeed in doing so. <br />But if you are looking for a good read that does not have the happiest ending, you have found it.
0802130208|4.0|The charector is a little too annoying, and maybe that makes this book so appealing to others. If you enjoyed \\"Catch 22\\" you should find this pleaseing after you get through the first third of the book. It definantly takes so time to pick up speed but finaly manages a strong gate through the end. Given the circumstances the book was written under, (a story as interesting as the book) this is a nice book that takes place in an time period of New Orleans that is rarely painted.<br /><br />  The charector who lives in a self absorbed world where he could solve any problem if only anyone would listen to him, stumbles in and out of fringe social circles and environs haphazardly leaving a wake of confusion while remaining ignorant of his butterfly effect all the while.<br /><br />  This would be a great introduction to dark humor and irony for a younger reader, but this may take a bit of pateince if you already have a firm background in Vonnegut, Heller, and the like.
B000HIVQK8|4.0|I pre-ordered this set, knowing that I was going to buy it regardless of the reviews that had not yet been posted.  I got it locked in at $23.99, which was subsequently changed to $29.88 as of the day of this review.  So there may be a lesson about the value of the pre-order, especially if you just know that you will indeed make the purchase.<br /><br />Being a big George Harrison fan, and now knowing that all we can look forward to are the things that already exist, I was happy to see the expansion of his catalog in the modern age of sound engineering as well as the visual arena with this set.<br /><br />The DVD made me go this route rather than the CD only, and at about nine or ten dollars for the less than 15 minute disc, I am not sure about the monetary value. I guess in the years to come, I will be happy that I spent up to the expanded set.  This DVD does one thing for my expectations for the future.  Both the previously issued \\"Dark Horse\\" DVD and this one have nicely rendered 5.1 videos from the 1991 Japan concerts, which must mean that there are videos from all of the songs on that double CD.  I hope that we can see those songs on a concert DVD in the future.  The DVD was a bit of a shock for me, because for years of listening to the CDs from that tour of Japan, I had assumed that the terrific slide work on \\"Give me love\\" was from George himself.  It was surprising to watch both Harrison and Clapton strumming acoustics, while Andy Fairweather-Low replicated the slide sound in the Harrison style.  Still, it was nice to see George playing in front of a crowd.  The rest of the songs on the DVD were basically audio soundtracks with a montage of stills and non-related video that support the songs.  The alternate take on \\"Sue me, sue you blues\\" was really stripped down and raw.  It would have been nice to have that on the CD too.<br /><br />The actual album is as nicely rendered as it has ever been.  George's voice is strong and clear, while the band's musical playing comes through exactly where it needs to.  The elements of the sounds are very nicely in balanced.  The quality of the songs is a historical data point in George's post-Beatles career.  He had a really strong album to be measured against with for this sophomore studio recording.  My opinion is that he had such a deep catalog waiting to be put on \\"All things must pass\\", that he may have set the bar too high for any future endeavors.  This is a very good album, but for me \\"All things must pass\\" was a better one, especially on first listen.  I have played this new rendering of \\"Living in the material world\\" about 5 times now, and I am just beginning to get to the point of being able to \\"know\\" the songs.  Still, this is a must have for anyone wishing to fill out their Harrison collection in a more modern media (my first LITMW was on 8 track!).<br /><br />FWIW, my enjoyment of this album and indeed all of my George Harrison albums, including the Wilbury's, has been greatly enhanced by my purchase of the book, \\"While my guitar gently weeps, the music of George Harrison\\" (available on Amazon).  It chronologically breaks down every era of George's music and offers nice details about the recording sessions for all of his work.  For this album for example, there are 15 pages devoted to the band he used, who played on which songs and even a review of how the record was received  by the fans and critics.  For true fans of George's music, this book will make all of your albums more fun to listen to, and will open your eyes to parts of his thinking that you may not have known about.ly where it needs to.

0141439688|5.0|Jane Austen's last completed novel, which was published posthumously was Persuasion and the story starts with Anne Elliot, an upper-class girl at the age of 19, falling in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth. They get engaged but her mother's great friend and her own trusted friend, the widow Lady Russell, persuased Anne to break the engagement with him. The reason for this is, that the young officer possesses no connections to the upper-class and is therefor not worth to be with Anne according to Lady Russel.     But after eight years, Anne, who truly loved Frederick Wentworth, is still unmarried and destined for spinsterhood. Until her mother has lived there was no problem with the income at the Elliot family, but according to the fact that her father wasn't careful with the money, they are now facing the situation that the family estate is gone to Admiral Croft, Wentworth's brother-in-law and the Elliots (Anne's father Sir Walter Elliot, her elder sister Elizabeth) need to move from Kellynch hall to Bath.     Before Anne moves to Bath she spends some time with her younger sister Mary and her husband Charles Musgrove, as well as his sisters Louisa and Henrietta at Uppercross. Captain Wenthworth so far had success in the wars, which brought him a considerable fortune and now he is looking for a wife to get settled ashore. He and Anne meet again at Mary's and Charles house, but though Anne still has feelings for him she tries not to show them clearly. And furthermore Louisa`s and Henrietta`s trials to flirt with Frederick Wentworth and get him attracted, makes it more difficult for Anne to be in the focus.     But on a day-walk at Lyme Regis it came to an accident when Louisa falls from a cliff thinking that Captain Wentworth catches her, which he didn't. The only person being calm and starting to organize the necessary steps to be taken after this accident was Anne. This inititates that Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne came back. But when they slowly start their relationship again, there is another admirer of Anne, her cousin William Elliot, who seperates them again by spreading rumours that he and Anne are going to marry soon...    This is a wonderful heart-moving novel and the letter at the end written by Frederick Wentworth to Anne is absolutely romantic. But this novel is also full of irony, for example when Mary wants to follow her husband for a dinner while here son is ill and she makes recommends about men and women, or when it is spoken about Bath (a place Jane Austen hated herself much): But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! They were infinitely worse. Such  scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\"
B0002B55WA|5.0|Five stars for the original film, but only two stars for this DVD.    This DVD is in acceptable video quality - but it shows video artifacts which indicate that it was saved at one stage in the transfer to DVD as an inferior quality \\"SVCD\\" file. An A/B comparison shows that my 1988 MPI VHS has vastly superior video quality - and the colours are much richer.    The problem with the MPI VHS was that it was all in HiFi mono (even though the cover claimed it to be stereo) - and the songs were dubbed from only the left channel of the stereo recordings (so they all sounded odd).     This DVD has clearly had a stereo effect applied to the dialogue and incidental sounds, but the Beatles songs sound very much as if they were transferred from original master tapes at Abbey Road Studios, as is claimed on the DVD. The Bonzo Dog Band track \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\" has been given the same phony sounding stereo effect as the dialogue (and they're miming to their original album track - which was in excellent stereo).    There's no good reason why this DVD couldn't have at least looked as good as the 1998 MPI VHS. It really is only just worth the budget price being charged in Australia (approx. US$8)     One major point of value in this film is that it contains the only feature film appearances by both Scottish performance poet Ivor Cutler and The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band. Magical Mystery Tour may be silly in places, but that's just par for the course considering everyone involved - and it's about the best quality silliness you'd ever expect to see.    My favourite musical sequences are \\"Flying\\", \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\" (by the Bonzos).    People might be tempted to quibble about minor errors (like synch in \\"Blue Jay Way\\") in the film's editing, but at least the music is all here in its glorious stereophonic entirety - and this version may be as good as we're likely to get as a DVD release.
B0000033TE|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't ready for Brain salad Surgery when it was released in 1973. It wasn't because I was 12 or so at the time, even then I liked classical and prog rock like Yes and Genesis and thought the first few ELP albums were listenable. But this was different. There was something intimidating about it, starting with Tocatta. The fast tempos, screeching synths, pounding drums, it sounded like a 33 1/3 classical LP with lots of scratches played at 78. Even the jacket art was creepy. And then there was Karn Evil 9. Wierd sci fi lyrics, keyboards that screamed and howled, all played at breakneck speed. Like a lot of things I didn't understand at the time, I just put it on the shelf. The short 2nd part of the 1st impression of Karn Evil 9 made it into the FM rotation and that became my lasting impression of this 30 minute extravaganza.  <br /> <br />Talk about wrong impressions, I picked up the Rhino remaster 30 years later and was stunned at how much I missed. Tocatta was incredible but listening to the entire 1st impression of Karn Evil 9 without interruption was a revelation. There was so much going on, so many sounds I missed on the old LP. Layer upon layer of incendiary keyboards, virtuoso drumming you could hear down to the intricate cymbal work, Greg Lake's voice at it's most powerful singing about a high tech armageddon. It was the audio eqivalent of watching a fireworks display on fast forward but it was incredibly cohesive, remarkably played and carefully produced. It took 30 years and a great remaster for me to realize this was the high point of prog rock. Classicly influenced synth rock with brains and a thrash metal attitude. Nobody, certainly not ELP, ever did anything this innovative and ambitious since and I doubt anyone will. If you don't have this historic album a big piece of your musical puzzzle is missing.

1400044162|5.0|Every novelist has a unique story simmering in her (his) head, a story that she feels she must write; Arundhati Roy had \\"The God of Small Things\\", V. S. Naipaul had \\"A House for Mr. Biswas\\", and Chimamanda Adichie had \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\". \\"This is a book I had to write,\\" Ms. Adichie has said. \\"I have been thinking about this book my whole life.\\"<br /><br />  When a writer thinks of a story for years, and then sets out to write it with care and passion, the prose flows as heartfelt, and the novel shines. As a result, long after you finish reading this novel, you will feel your mind lit with the light of this powerful, frightening and also deeply moving novel. Written in simple but elegant prose, her style reminded me of the great Indian writer R. K. Narayan: \\"He looked up at the ceiling, so high up, so piercingly white. He closed his eyes and tried to reimagine this spacious room with the alien furniture, but he couldn't. He opened his eyes, overcome by a new wonder, and looked around to make sure it was all real. To think that he would sit on these sofas, polish this slippery-smooth floor, wash these gauzy curtains.\\"<br />And like R. K. Narayan, who was well-known for his short stories, Chimamanda also has written short stories as well. (She has been compared with Chinua Achebe, but I haven't read any of Achebe's novels.)<br /><br />  In Nigeria, in the late 1960s, there was a civil war between the Muslims in the north and Christians in the south, in the state of Biafra. Ethnic cleansing and massacre of Biafrans followed. As a result, Biafrans tried to secede from Nigeria. The half of a yellow sun refers to the emblem of the flag of the state of Biafra. Using this war as the background, the author has written a story involving five central characters: Ugwu, aged 13, who arrives at professor Odenigbo's house to work as a houseboy, and Olanna, a beautiful young woman who chooses to become Odenigbo's mistress, and Olanna's not so lovely twin sister Kainene, who is in love with Richard, an Englishman. Because other reviewers have narrated the story in brief, I do not feel the need to narrate it again.<br /><br />  There are beautiful, subtly erotic passages, as well as graphic passages depicting sex and violence and blood-curdling brutality. I have no doubt that similar incidents, as depicted here, did indeed occur in Biafra. But you need to have an iron stomach to be able to read these passages without feeling sick and fearful.<br /><br />  I wish to conclude on a cheerful note however, because I really admired this novel, and so here is a passage I wish to quote. Even though it is slightly erotic, I found it quite lovely: \\"But he liked going on errands to her house. They were opportunities to find her bent over, fanning the firewood or chopping ugu leaves for her mother's soup pot, or just sitting outside looking after her younger siblings, her wrapper hanging low enough for him to see the tops of her breasts.\\"<br /><br />  This is truly a memorable novel; but it's not for the weak-hearted. It's even more impressive and more accomplished than her critically acclaimed first novel,  Purple Hibiscus. \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" is an apt title, perhaps; but the novel is luminous like a full moon.in love with Richard, an Englishman.

0192834290|5.0|This engaging mystery pits three idealistic young people in the traps of larcenous, black-hearted villians.  A mysterious woman-in-white encournters Walter Hartright, a young drawing master on his way to a new commission in the country.  From then on, it seems that their fate and lives are tangled together, this woman-in-white, and Walter and his pupils Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie.  At first it seemed like a lighthearted curiosity, that Marian searches for in her mother's letters, just a childhood acquaintance.  The first few months at Limmeridge, the Fairlie's mansion, Walter Hartright, Marian Halcombe and Laura Fairlie spend a happy companionable season as drawing master and pupils, with not a worry in their heads but the beautiful nature scenes, walks in the gardens and contemplation of the blue sky.  That is, until Laura's impending marriage to Sir Percival Glyde draws a gloomy end to their idyllic days.  From then on, the pace quickens as the woman-in-white first sends a letter of warning to Laura, and then later, lurks around attempting to deliver a Secret to Laura, only to be foiled by the maneuverings of an elderly corpulent Count who has allied himself with Sir Percival Glyde.<br /><br />Laura becomes the victim, Walter the absent hero, and it is all up to Marian, the lion-hearted defender of her sister, who stands as protector, investigator, and emotional supporter to Laura, that is until tragic circumstances force their separation.  Just when things seem the darkest, a surprising twist grabs the reader for a rousing finale that carries Walter incognito from Central America to London to Blackwater Park to Cumberland to Welmingham to an old church where the \\"Secret\\" of Sir Percival Glyde is revealed and wickedness is recompensed.<br /><br />A guaranteed page-turner that will keep you up way past your bedtime.  Everything is explained at the end, except for the reason that Laura's late father wanted her to marry Percival Glyde in the first place.
B000002JB8|5.0|This is a simple recording by Vangelis; yet, very very melodic. The harp is nicely used playing the ocean sounds not forgetting to mention the beautiful voices through out the entire album.<br /><br />I am not sure if you have seen the Movie Gattaca, but if you did you may agree with me that the music in this album fits perfectly for this movie.<br /><br />I play this album in my bedroom, almost every night. Very relaxing; melodic album.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|90 % of comic book fans wont like this movie..simply for this fact: they are all wanna be directors..they have their own imagination of how the movie should have been..basically being one sided and not being able to accept the fact that this is a movie..NOT a comic book!!...as for me..im part of that 10 % who DID like the movie...i mean..Cyclops dead? Prof. X dead too? i mean that put a whole new spin on the movie..I do agree that the movie needed more character development and more characters...but if they did, the movie would never end....i mean..you are talking about trying to put characters like Gambit, Bishop etc...Everyone would be dissapointed because there would really be no time for character development..overall this movie was good..but if your a \\"wanna be\\" director, dont buy because you will be dissapointed..and on the side note: the cure was only temporary..(watch the end-after the credits)...and ummm...HALLE BARRY IS FINE BUT SHE SUCKS AS STORM!!!!!!!!!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I really loved this story, while my beautiful unromantic wife was bored to death. The plot is slow and methodical, just like some very good books. My only grief with the story was the part that was obvious too soon. Other than that, I felt it was a fulfilling movie well worth the watching. While, we have become used to romance genre films being more or less comedic, this one is not, or tragic, like \\"Somewhere in Time\\", the logical comparison film, \\"Lake House\\" is not that either, it is a melancholy story were the end is happy.<br />This is a story that requires you to both suspend disbelief and think. That might not be good for everyone... But, it was for me.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|I remember Ebert complaining that the problem with the twist at the end of The Usual Suspects was that it negated the film - that nothing in the movie actually really happened. True enough, but the tale spun in The Usual Suspects was so entertaining that it didn't matter. Fascinating characters, excellent dialog and action. The same trick is employed here but it's not effective because: a) the trick was not done well, b) the characters are absolutely inane and the acting is appalling. I'm concerned that people who find this brilliant are hankering for something so intellectually robust that they can elevate themselves to a state of intelligencia by \\"getting it\\". There's nothing worth \\"getting\\" here, folks. It's a poorly planned mind-trick that is just not interesting enough to be worth the effort.
B000GPIPT2|5.0|All movies are dated.  Some are more dated than others, of course.  A film's dated quality can be its strength as well as its weakness.  Much film criticism has surrounded the primitive techniques used in 1931's \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\".  Lack of musical score, obvious use of studio sets, theatrical acting, pedestrian use of the camera, etc.  Yet I would argue that these qualities are what make these films unique and give them a dream-like, nightmarish quality, which the later, slicker and more polished sequels lacked.  The sound of the Frankenstein monster's footsteps coming down the hall before his entrance, the thumping of the dirt being thrown atop the coffin in the opening sequence, all would be lost had they been interpolated in a musical score.  The same goes for \\"Dracula\\"'s scattering rats, bats and night creatures among the clacking bones in the coffins.  Granted, the later \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" brilliantly used music and a far more sophisticated film technique to unfold its story, yet it was a completely different piece of art.  It was much more operatic and complex and full of irony and satire as well as horror.  Whereas \\"Bride\\" gave us thrills, \\"Frankenstein\\" gave us chills. <br /> <br />There is something magical about pre-code films.  These are films made before 1935 or so, before the Hollywood moral police enforced their censorship rules on the studio system.  Pre-code films have a raw quality, an edge, a wisecracking, bristling aura that code movies don't.  Code movies tend to be slicker, polished, glamorous and more cautious in the their content.  Just compare \\"King Kong\\" (1933), \\"42nd St.\\" of the same year, \\"Public Enemy\\" (1931), as well as the aformentioned \\"Dracula\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\" to any film of the code era and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is a raw frightfest that still has some scary moments:  just watch Karloff's face as he tries to come through the door after killing Fritz, with Frankenstein and Waldman tryingto keep it closed.  His growls are enough to still send shivers up your spine. <br /> <br />And yet look at the desperation in his face after he throws Frankenstein off the windmill and the villagers decide his fate.  It is a look of panic and helplessness. <br />You can't help feel sorry for him, despite all the terror he has caused.  This is genius movie-making and still scary stuff after 3/4 of a century!
0380729407|5.0|Carnivals are creepy. I have always thought they were creepy and I will not hear otherwise. My only source of confusion is whether I've always felt this way or only since reading \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes.\\"<br /><br />Ray Bradbury is amazing. He can lure you into a story about a planet far, far away and make you believe in the alien landscape. Or he can bring a haunted carnival to town and cause you both nostalgia and dread. Bradbury is a puppet master and guess who is dangling from the string?<br /><br />\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a perfect book for anyone who has not yet been introduced to this story telling master. It is a perfect book for anybody looking for a literary chill to go with the melancholy of an autumn night. It is damn near a perfect book in just about every way.<br /><br />It is the story of two boys whose innate love of a carnival is interupted by something unholy that lurks among the barkers, the dazzling lights and the spinning rides. Something sinister is afoot and therein lies the tale.<br /><br />This is vintage Bradbury. At its face, a simple horror story with evil men and their evil intentions set within the neon glare of the inherently creepy carnival.<br /><br />But in classic Bradbury style, it is also a look at the murky, unmanageable chasm between youth and adulthood, and the many pitfals of traversing it. An absolutely must read. The kind of book that will provoke  long rested memories of childhood while providing the kind of chills that spring from long autumn shadows. You will hear the sound of far off carousel music long after laying the book to rest.
B00002E233|2.0|You know, I used to like Renny Harlin's films when I was younger, but they really don't hold up, I've realized with my coming of age. I think he's a talented director capable of some genuinely biting action scenes ('Cliffhanger', 'Die Hard 2'), but overall his films are messy, and, if I'm to be scholarly in articulating the matter, stupid.  <br /> <br />For me 'Deep Blue Sea' has a few things going for it. One -- the beautiful Saffron Burrows, who I might add can actually act, doing at least what she can with the generally bankrupt dialogue. Plus, there's a laughably contrived scene which requires her to get half-naked; given I didn't care about much by the time this gloriously sleazy moment appeared, I can't say I wasn't all for it. Then, there's the uncommonly merciless attitude of the film; none of the characters are given sympathy, and I find that admirable and devoid of manipulation. I mean, Sam Jackson's fate... Female leads being chomped to pieces. In a film comically unrealistic (which I don't judge too harshly, for it is made on the primary premise of SUPER INTELLIGENT SHARKS), the nature of the miserable situation is played out with a welcome, sensible set of results. Oh, and I'd say that LL Cool J is surely the peak of the film's performances; I hate the guy when he's in that ultra suave, dripping sweat, buldging, chocolate Casanova, but his role here is near the antithesis of that; a goofy, Bible quoting cook, with an obnoxious bird (I can't imagine who's brain this abominable idea came from) and a past alcohol problem.  <br /> <br />And then there's Harlin, who, like I said, certainly has a knack for creating some of the most awesomely thrilling action scenes among Hollywood's finest directors of the genre. But, in 'Deep Blue Sea', sad to say, there are only a small handful. Also of some note is the score by Trevor Rabin, which covers moods from heroically cheesy to atmospheric and eerie. I think this is especially commendable for Rabin because, by andlarge, this is a horror/thriller (the former a bit of a stretch), requiring him to maintain a good deal more restraint than has ever been requested of the composer. <br /> <br />When it's all said and done though, it's just not very good. I can understand why people would enjoy it, because it is mindless and has some redeeming features spawning from that sense of recklessness -- and surely, I'm not against this particular mentality in a film -- but it's just a bit too stupid and apathetic for me to care. I got it used for a bargain, but I'm not sure it was really worth even that. And, while I'm by no means ashamed of its existence within my library, I'm pretty confident I'll never sit through the entire thing again.
B000CNE092|5.0|I love this movie with all my heart. It's a timeless classic. The music is wondeful and and all of the actors are great ^^
B000001ED1|4.0|This is a completely underrated work. I haven't ventured out and exposed myself to Osborne's subsequent releases, but if they're as good as this one, my laziness is surely getting the best of me.<br /><br />Near the entirety of 'Relish' has a breezy tone that confidentally strays away from any sense of heavy-handedness, and surely this is one of the most attractive elements of the album, and possessing such a laid back disposition provides a solid re-playability factor.<br /><br />Osborne's voice is, as most would agree, phenomenal. I haven't come across many female artists with such a refreshing degree of grace or class, and I deem that a huge compliment. And, yet, it's the 'music' here which carries the album with such a paramount force. The instrumentation and performances are able and unique, and quite varying really, and the production is crisp and clear. And despite its polish, the album still feels raw.. organic.. which, yet again, I find most contemporary artists have a difficult time claiming). Most of the album is drenched in a fine deal of pop sentiment, but it's engaging, adult pop, and the ornate instrumentation raise it to a plane above most pop, which would be potentially dismissed for its brimming simplicity.<br /><br />Quite honestly -- and I do believe very few albums can claim such reverence in this regard -- most of the songs on 'Relish' are excellent, with little to no missteps throughout its entirety. And, sure, most good to great albums are formidably consistent, but 'Relish' has this sort of uncommon finace throughout each individual tune. It's just about as stable an album as they come.<br /><br />I'd have to say that my personal favorites -- and again due its sustainable ability to near always impress, it's not the easiest task in choosing -- would be \\"St. Teresa\\", \\"Right Hand Man\\", \\"One of Us\\" (which I might add was a magnificent single, one that actually proved to transcend the mass market's severe overplay it received. Surely, if most ordinary folk were asked who Joan Osborne is, this song would be the triggered memory in their noggin's), \\"Ladder\\" and \\"Spider Web\\". For those of you who've heard the album, it's obvious the choices here revolve around a quicker tempo than much of the more reflective, resting bits, but the various moods displayed here are all affecting in at least some way.<br /><br />Osborne is an intelligent, self-respecting musician, and seemingly Human being as well, and this fact is easily gathered when hearing 'Relish'. Maybe it's just my lack of exposure to music of this particular breed, but to me, it really stands out as a distinct musical personality. I'd recommend it to anyone I know with some sense of taste, without hesitation.
B000EHSVQE|1.0|This is the dumbest, most pointless movie I've ever had the displeasure to watch and what makes it worse? People everywhere doing their impressions of the movie. This is one of the reasons humanity is progressing so slowly, in my opinion. Anyone who honestly believes this movie is a \\"5 star\\" movie then you guys have absolutely NO lives and no real sense of humor. The materials on this movie are STUPID, not funny. Unfortunately, many people today don't know the difference.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about Howard Shore's magnificent score for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy?  A soundtrack can define the whole atmosphere of a film, and this fully orchestrated work certainly does that with sweep, splendor and wonder, alternately humanizing (hobbit-izing?) the characters, imbuing the landscape with magic and capturing the world-shaking impact of events of mythic proportions.  And this was no easy task considering the iconoclastic status of the story and the superb quality of Peter Jackson's filmmaking.  This is a truly a soundtrack for the ages--a fitting accompaniment to a film for the ages!  Every aspect of life, from the extreme to the mundane, is captured in this music.  Listening to it can make every remembered moment of the movie come alive again in your mind, from the most horrific battle to the smallest moment of humor or kindness.  I think \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is my favorite of the three \\"Lord of the Rings\\" soundtracks.  I enjoy the juxtaposition of the lighter moments, like the sweet, simple hobbit theme, with the grander and more menacing sections of the music.  What impressed me most as I watched \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" was how scary the music was when the hobbits were being pursued.  Those relentless drums and eerily screaming drums made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, even though I knew the story like the back of my hand and knew for a fact that the poor little heroes would manage to escape.  But the music truly made me wonder otherwise ... Now that's good composition!  And the fact that the filmmakers chose to include background music in so many of the scenes, almost continuously ... well, that's just good filmmaking!  The other impressive thing about Howard Shore's score is how the voicing and the repeating musical motifs tie the whole thing together, like the finest of symphonies.  In \\"The Two Towers\\" all the familiar themes from the first sound track return, reinvented as need beto link the films together while adapting to new developments in the action and the story.  In this album, I particularly like the hardanger fiddle-infused theme for the Rohirrim, the Viking-like horse-riders of the steppes, and the ponderous, quirky music for Treebeard, the walking, talking tree.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of these distinctive elements, which lend levity and diversity to a sometimes depressing and overwhelmingly intense body of music.  Here, they make all-too-brief appearances, at least from a listener's point of view.  But soundtracks are ultimately slaves to the script, and in conjunction with the film itself, the timing and phrasing of Shore's music is impeccable.  Mysterious, menacing, folksy or heroic, the total effect is utterly convincing and utterly transporting.  The battle scenes in \\"Return of the King\\" are incredible visuals, blending live action and computer-generated imagery so seamlessly and densely that it boggles the mind.  But what would they be with only screams and snorts and scuffles to give them voice?  It's Shore's frenetic, string-laden, brass-filled, drum-spurred fury that truly gives them life, waxing, waning and cueing the audience as to when the greatest menace is about to threaten the war-weary heroes.  The musical themes from the first two movies continue to be developed here, wending their way in and out of expanded interpretations whose dense complexity rivals that of Tolkien's story, not to mention Peter Jackson's filmmaking itself.  Jackson chose well when he picked Shore as his score writer.  Very, very well!  Make sure to get the extended edition DVDs of the movies themselves, with hours and hours of fascinating commentaries and behind-the-scenes documentaries about the making of the films.  Truly a bargain at any price!  For more seminal soundtracks, try John William's defining scores for the \\"Star Wars\\" series and Basil Poledouris's spectacular score for the original \\"Conan the Barbarian.\\"  You can hear more hardanger fiddle music (the inspiration for the Rohan/Rohirrim themes) in the work of Scandinavian fiddler Annbjorg Lien or any of the varied releases from the NorthSide label.  Finally, for authentic music from bygone ages, why not try the real thing?  There are many fine early music groups out there.  Here's just a sampling: Anonymous 4 (pure-voiced sacred chant by four women), The Baltimore Consort (jaunty popular music from the Renaissance), David Munrow's Early Music Consort of London (simply perfection), Christian Mendoze's Musica Antiqua (lively, percussive Renaissance dance music), The Toronto Consort (great variety), Ensemble Unicorn (worlds of fun!), Wolgemut (brash buzzies and bagpipes with attitude), and the magical early/folk fusion of Cantiga and Burlap Lute.  Have some fun with them and live your own fantasy!
B000E5KJD4|1.0|Speaking as someone who has watched the dvd version 100+ times.  The soundtrack of the hd-dvd is wretched.  I have a arcam 300 with 100 watts per channel with all channels driven receiver.   AT maximum volumn the sound level is so low that you might as well be listening to dinner music while reading a book.  Fans of the dvd should stay away from this one.

B000002TYX|5.0|The whole Anthology is spectacular!!  I bought them when they came out 10 years ago.  I'm sure this has been mentioned, but if you listen to Shout! from Disc 2; which was prerecorded for a TV special; towards the end, you hear John say \\"Everybody f@@in' shout now\\" 4 or 5 times.  It went on the air that way and I don't think no one caught it.  Pretty wild when you think about it.  Incidently, that TV special was released on VHS back in the late 80s.  If you can find it, it's pretty awesome.

B000F2C87Q|3.0|OK, well I don't normally write Amazon reviews but this one needs it. OK, first off I am a Black Keys fan, although I only own their debut The Big Come Up. I really enjoy that album. This one seemed to me to be a similar endeavor to their aforementioned album. Needless to say I thought it would be a nice little addition to my music collection...<br /><br />Well, I pop it in to discover that the first 3 songs I can barely make out Dan's lyrics. The last 3 songs are a little better in that regard but it put a damper on the whole album.<br /><br />Another thing which is more of a pet peeve of mine is \\"blues\\" music that isn't 12 bar blues, much like this albums songs. The songs presented here just seem like a never-ending riff, and there doesn't seem to be any structure to them. Maybe that's the way Junior did it, I'm not familiar with his work. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this album, however I would recommend The Big Come Up if you don't already have it and are wondering what The Black Keys are all about.

6300214028|5.0|I watched \\"Reds\\" the other night for the first time.  I wondered how I may have perceived it had I seen it when it came out, a decade or so before the fall of the Soviet Union rather a a decade or so after it.  I had to make a deal with myself; I was going to watch the movie and appreciate it as a movie rather than debate the merits of glorifying socialism.  I must have succeeded in that approach because I gave the movie a 5 star rating.  I felt an impressive aspect of \\"Reds\\" was the periodic inclusion of on-camera first person recollections.  We saw the real witnesses of the persons, times, and events that we were watching.  It certainly added credibility to what we were seeing unfold and it also added perspective.  \\"Reds\\" is first and foremost a love story and the two lovers are (surprize!) Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton.  I have to admit that the two of them did very good work.  I have to give Beatty a good deal of credit for his role as director for which he, not surprizingly, won an Oscar.  I'm sure that his hard work made it difficult to edit the film down to the normal two-hour feature film length.  I'll admit that I watched the movie, on tape, over the course of three successive evenings but I don't think that I lost any appreciation of the film.  I probably could have told you just what all could have been cut if I had watched it all in one sitting.  I'll accept that some movies (and \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" comes to mind as a logical comparison) just need more time to tell a more expansive story. <br /> <br />Beatty plays Jack Reed who wrote \\"Ten Days that Shook the World\\" which did a lot of shaking of its' own when it came out.  In pursuit of a combined socialist/journalist's dream, Reed found himself in Russia on the eve of the October Revolution.  The scenes of that and other Russian events are quite impressive in \\"Reds\\".  Long before we get to that point in time, we see a relationship develop between a class conscious writer and a wannabe class conscious writer.The emergence of love between the fighter of proletarian causes and the fighter of feminist causes makes for a different sort of love story.  The expressed opinions don't always match up neatly with the heartfelt opinions.  I give Beatty grudging praise for his ability and willingness to bring out this concept in \\"Reds\\" as well as his look at an imperfect political solution to a real social problem.  While there is plenty of Leftist propaganda to duck, Jack Reed wasn't exactly going to morph into Ronald Reagan by the film's end.  Yet Beatty allowed the passion of the Movement to come to life and the seeds of its' own destruction to also come to life in \\"Reds\\".  The scene towards the end with Maureen Stapleton (another deserving Oscar-winner from \\"Reds\\") was brilliantly done with an economy of words that conveyed an abundance of nuance.  Through it all is the oft-interrupted romance of Beatty and Keaton who seem to go to extremes in their seperations and reunions.  I'm not sure I ever saw a \\"blockbuster\\" movie that was ever this passionate.  The film's ability to maintain that passion over three houres is its' greatest strength

B000EMGAOY|3.0|ever since Blood Sugar Sex Magik the chilis lost the edge they once had in my opinion.  i realize the boys are off drugs, but they must have relapsed when they decided to make this bad boy a double album.  def too much filler.  they should have released a cd that looked something like this: <br /> <br />dani california <br />charlie <br />stadium arcadium <br />torture me <br />especially in michigan <br />warlocks <br />cmon girl <br />wet sand <br />tell me baby <br />hard to concentrate <br />animal bar <br /> <br />now wouldn't that make the album much more impressive? yes, i think so. <br />some of the songs on that list are friggen good with alot of awesome playing between frusciante and flea.   <br /> <br />they are still after 20 years one of the best bands around, their live act is sick as it always has been, and they still have a couple good albums left in them, just don't expect to be blown away by this one. rock on <br />
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Cee-Lo and Danger Mouse have managed to pull together all of the innovations in this millenium of music from Moby,Beck,Outkast to Kanye West into 'St.Elsewhere'-these singers have great deep soul voices and are some of the most expressive pure soul singers of the classic Southern Soul genre I've heard in awhile.And the music?No-it's not any kind of retro throwback-'St'Elsewhere' revels in the new and is produced like an audio collage of house,hip-hop and classic soul with a lot of psychedelia.It even includes one clever stab at rap called \\"Feing Shui\\".And unlike so much music today there is no sloganeering or pointless vulgar posturing-the lyrics (even on the rap cuts) are all about emotional observations.It's a album meant to be taken in as a whole but it features two incredibly strong tunes-of course there's \\"Crazy\\",which is HUGE as of this writing and will probably go down as a classic of the southern house/soul genre-I can imagine a contemporary Otis Redding,had he survived and prospered sounding very much like this today.And while the music is great too it's a DAMN catchy tune as well.And \\"Transformers\\",like the rest of this music is seriously and is another favorite of mine.Any fan of modern day Outkast,Beck,Moby or any of those people will find themselves at home with 'St-Elsewhere' and for those who still dismiss hip-hop as useless should go out and give this a spin-it's light on the rap and has a lot of great songs too.
1400079594|5.0|As with any novel about Jeeves and Wooster, I don't want to give too much away.  Much of the humor is not just in the language but in how surprisingly complex things can get before they are resolved.  So my first suggestion is to skip the introduction by Alexander Cockburn who quotes some of the funnier scenes in the book.<br /><br />Now as for the story it involves a cow-creamer, a small leather book, two marriages, a want-to-be Dictator and a police helmet.<br /><br />The Code of the Woosters has 222 pages of some of the best dry British humor ever to come from P.G. Wodehouse's pen.  As always the dialogue between Bertie Wooster and his man Jeeves is some of the greatest you will ever encounter in your whole life.  How one book can contain so much is beyond me but this is, as any of his books are, a must for any library.
B00005R1N3|5.0|This is the scariest movie I've ever seen - more terrifying even than \\"Psycho.\\" It deserves to be better known. <br /> <br />The only element that detracts from the impact of this film is the characters' gratuitous unpleasantness towards each other. \\"Black Christmas\\" is ahead of its time in substituting japing for real dramatic interaction. The sorority housemother is especially over-the-top offensive. When a father comes looking for his mysteriously missing daughter who hasn't come home for Christmas break - this housemother is so sloppily rude to him - you can't help but wish whatever menace is lurking around the place will take her out next. <br /> <br />But the actors all do the best with the limited range scripted for their characters. Olivia Hussey provides something of a more sympathetic, leavening influence in this wasp's nest. Margot Kidder is perfect as the flip coed who injects a note of humor when she takes advantage of a police officer's limited sexual vocabulary. Keir Dullea poses a convincing threat as a moody, angry music student at the university. <br /> <br />But whatever the movie may lack in character development, it more than makes up for with sheer suspense. I have re-run this film roughly once every two years since it came out in the 70s. Even though I now know exactly what's going to happen next, I still can't bear to watch the screen sometimes. This movie is that FRIGHTENING! <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I have seen parts of the Colin Firth version, but not all the way through.  I noticed many reveiws comparing the two were not the most positive toward this one.  However, I found this movie one of the most romantic I have ever seen.  As I was watching, I got butterflies in my stomach, found myself holding my breath - the chemistry between these two was electrifying!  Rented, but plan on buying.  This is defintely one I think I could watch over and over.  I am just jealous that that is not a real story and I am not Elizabeth!  A must see!
0060920432|2.0|I appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us. However, I could see a hole in Csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning.  <br /> <br />\\"In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why. My first studies involved a few hundred \\"experts\\"--artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons, in other words, people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred.\\" <br /> <br />I'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and \\"optimal experience\\". Particularly the reference to artists and musicians, who typically have severe struggles with life, and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years. That is what I felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness.  <br /> <br />It goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life, while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed, did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness.
B00004RKIJ|5.0|This is a brilliant album, but it is worth the price just for the *23* minute \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\" Mega Mix.
B00005JPAD|3.0|Although this movie remains more or less true to the original I still found it was not as good  <br />as Infernal Affairs especially during the last 20 min or so where I felt it paled in comparison to its <br />predecessor. In spite of that I did find that I enjoyed it and would recommend it. <br />The movie runs for 2 1/2 hours but the starring cast does make that time go by quickly.
B0000C03AH|5.0|I owned a copy of the '63 recordings when it was originally released on CD and though I enjoyed it, its sonics were lacking. The Super Audio re-mastering for this release is nothing short of spectacular. The music has warmth and a deep sound stage on all discs, which make this set a real pleasure to listen to repeatedly. Even if you don't own an SACD player, these recordings sound superb on a conventional CD player as well.  From an artistic point, the presentation of the music has a continuity to it, which runs through the entire set, as well as a having a strong orchestral performance. Karajan and the BPO share a common vision of the music in these recordings and it comes through on most every disc.   <br /> <br />Symphony No.1:  Overall, Karajan balances the strings and woodwinds in this symphony, very well. The woodwinds soften the edge that the strings provide, giving this early symphony, modeled after Haydn and Mozart, a Beethovenian sound.  <br /> <br />Symphony No.2: Here Karajan's touch give this symphony a quick light feeling to the music by maintaining a lively, but by no means rushed tempo, giving the details in the music a chance to emerge. The second and third movements especially benefit from Karajan's treatment of the music.  <br /> <br />Symphony No.3: Orchestral playing and part playing is quite fine throughout, but where this performance gains it stature is in how it ends each movement- Karajan seems to know where he wants to take the orchestra, to great affect. In particular, the ending of the first, second, and fourth movement add drama, poignancy, and triumph.  <br /> <br />Symphony No.4: There is vitality to this performance, only eclipsed by the Karajan's 1977 re-recording.  Still, as in the other performances in this set, No.4 shines brightly.  The opening movement is particularly compelling, setting the tone for the rest of the symphony, giving way to a sharply performed final movement full of energy and enthusiasm.   <br /> <br />SymphonyNo.5:  This is by far the best reading in the entire set.  Throughout, notes are played with a bite, a sharp staccato edge, giving the music incredible weight throughout. Karajan and the Berliners expertly soften those edges where appropriate.  Karajan dramatically puts fourth the Ying and Yang of this work, and simply is one of the best recordings of this of this symphony available.  <br /> <br />Symphony No.6: This is where the set looses some of its magic.  Tempos are rushed, with many of the notes played with too much weight and forcefulness. If this is your favorite Beethoven symphony, and you are more used to a languidly paced walk though the country, this is not the performance for you.  On the other hand, if you want to experience a violent thunderstorm, there is no other performance to match it for its power and intensity of playing.  <br /> <br />Symphony No.7: This performance of the 7th is not my favorite.  What is interesting here is that Karajan and the orchestra seems to be going through the motions with this work, when all of the other symphonies are played with such purpose.  The first, third and fourth movements comes across fine enough, but the second movement is where Karajan's approach to the music really fails to please.  In that movement the Karajan uses too much legato draining the music of its drama and energy. <br /> <br />Symphony No.8: This is a fabulous account of No.8!  The Berliners clearly love this work, and the performance is highly polished, giving the listener a balanced insight into the piece. The first movement draws on vigorous playing from the strings, offset agreeably by the woodwinds, in perfect balance. The second movement benefits from a lightness of touch controlled superbly by Karajan throughout the movement. <br /> <br />Symphony No.9: This is possibly one of the best accounts of this symphony put to disc!  The music lends itself to turbulence and strife, save for the third movement and the final chorus, but Karajan's approach adds a significant amount of tension to the score, making the finale all the more joyous in its revelry.   Quick tempos, accentuate the rhythms in the first movement, painting a musical picture of conflict and doubt that is omnipresent, rather than something lurking in the background, as in other performances.  The second movement is given the same quick tempo treatment as the first, to great affect.  The driving rhythms, performed at such a fast pace, continue to hammer the listener, never giving you an opportunity to feel relaxed and tension free. The Third movement is a sea of calm, and Karajan does a superb job of controlling the orchestra in a very deliberate performance of this movement.  The final movement is where all the energy of the first two movements, and the tranquility of the third, pays off.  Karajan's hard-hitting style has created an atmosphere that sets the stage perfectly for the \\"Ode to Joy\\" theme and choral finale.  The Bass soloist, proclaiming that there will be no strife and discord, vigorously interrupts all the angst, and drama that is threatening the longing for a peaceful resolution, giving way to the strength of the choir.  Obviously, this is how Beethoven intended the music to unfold, but Karajan's handling of the music adds to this musical drama, and like the fifth symphony, Karajan understood that ninth is a struggle between darkness and light.  He also understood that darkness is relentless and could consume everything, unless an \\"Ode to Joy\\" or freedom as some scholars think the ode may refer to, is proclaimed loudly and clearly. The only disappointment to me in this performance is that the choral singing is not the best, but the choir absorbs the energy of the orchestra, making it easy to forgive lack of enunciation.  <br /> <br />

B00004WLXZ|5.0|After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.  <br /> <br />From its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.  <br /> <br />This movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.  <br /> <br />If you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.   <br /> <br />You sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- \\"Der Badenweiler\\". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets.... <br /> <br />Lastly, in my opinon, the commentary by \\"historian\\" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war.  The marching soliders and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience. Try to remember -- this movie was not made for YOU!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. The DVD features on this Ultimate Edition are quite good, but not superb. I truly enjoyed the interviews (including Jennifer Grey, Kenny Ortega - the choreographer, and many more). Did you know that Patrick Swayze brought his dog Derek to the set and he was normally perfectly behaved... until Patrick had to shoot a love scene. Then his beloved pooch would sit off the set and cry and howl (cute, huh?). There are several anecdotes like this within the interviews. I also enjoyed the music videos included on the bonus disc. Let's face it, the music of Dirty Dancing is part of its greatness! There are two separate audio commentaries, but I was disappointed that neither Jennifer Grey or Patrick Swayze, nor any other of the film's cast participated.<br /><br />I also own the Dirty Dancing: Collector's Edition DVD, and thoroughly enjoyed the making-of featurettes on that disc. So if you are a real Dirty Dancing fan, check out both versions.
B00005JOYM|4.0|..because this movie did it for me. Whoever has seen my review of United 93, must have noticed that I was a little disapointed with how little it touched, interested, and moved me. There where some moments where I could feel the tension and emotion, yet those moments where spare. I know, it seems a little strange to be comparing these 2 movies when we are talking about such an enormous event, but if I do, I'd chose World Trade Center over United 93. Let me explain why. <br /> <br />I, as an outsider to the whole event, heard the news of the planes crashing on my radio at home. I couldn't get a grip on the idea of \\"planes crashing in the WTC\\" and \\"gigantic fires\\" while \\"people where dying\\". I turned my head thinking this thing was small scale and returned to my usual activities. Boy, was I wrong. I've seen amateur footage that same night confirming that I made a mistake thinking that it was nothing big. Since then, I've tried to look out for documentaires and any kind of movies which might possibly give me an understanding of the real situation at that time. <br /> <br />This one did it. I was intrugued the whole way true, even if it was just a part of the WTC disaster, mostly just based on two people. It's hard to believe that a movie where most of it's time goes into dialogues of the two main characters stuck down under, can be so intruging, keeping the viewers attention the whole time. The acting is brilliant, the dialogues are amazing. Some things were a little cliche, but only added to the bigger picture. <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil anything on the movie. Perhaps it's just me that is so amazed of it's quality. Perhaps only I thought this would be a lousy try at capturing the event (after seeing trailers). Perhaps some DO find it boring. But I applaud anyone who tries to make the disaster be seen from another point of view. I applaud that they took the chance to reach out to certain people. And I can only respect that they've been able to reach out to at least one person who now has a better perspective on things, namely me. <br /> <br />United 93 and this should be next to eachother, not fighting against eachother. Each has a different story to tell, but it's all about the same disaster. Based on a true story, World Trade Center.
0743298020|4.0|The heroine of Diane Setterfield's \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a lonely and bookish woman named Margaret Lea, who is commissioned to write the biography of a world-famous author, Vida Winter.  Until now, Winter has never revealed the details of her background to anyone, and Margaret cannot imagine why this celebrity would entrust such an important task to her.  As the novel unfolds, the reader learns that Margaret and Vida have much in common. Both women adore literature and, in addition, they are harboring painful family secrets.<br /><br />\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is an example of a superior writing style triumphing over a gnarled and melodramatic plot.  The prose is gorgeously expressive, with so many brilliant and lively descriptive passages that it is difficult to single out just one.  Nonetheless, here is an example of Setterfield at her best:  \\"There is something about words.  In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner.  Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin....\\"  The writing is never less than spellbinding, and Setterfield's lush and leisurely prose is a throwback to the classic novels of centuries past.<br /><br />There is also much to admire in the large cast of Dickensian characters.  Vida Winter is a grande dame who knows her own worth, speaks plainly, and brooks no nonsense from anyone.  Hester Barrow is an ambitious and arrogant governess who tries to take two out-of-control children in hand and fails miserably.  The intellectually inclined Margaret has always used reading to escape from reality.  Working with Vida impels Margaret to finally deal with the sorrow that has crippled her for years.<br /><br />In spite of its strentghs, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is not an unmitigated success.  It is too convoluted and densely packed, with its shadowy births and deaths, a mutilating fire deliberately set, a sadistic man whose twisted deeds lead to tragedy, and at long last, a measure of solace for the book's protagonist.  This four-hundred-page work could have used a bit of careful trimming.  The last quarter is bogged down with one too many startling revelations that are more dizzying than enthralling.  Still, it is entertaining to spend time with Diane Setterfield, a talented author who has great respect for the power of myth and the beauty of language.at long last, a measure of solace for the book's protagonist.

B0000640VO|4.0|This is an excellent, intelligent and entertaining film.<br /><br />However, the love interest in the last third of the film annoyed me and it bothered me that Audrey Tautou would get involved with such an obvious nerd. Of course, the character Am&eacute;lie is something of a nerd herself, but a very endearing and wonderful nerd. The guy she starts searching for is just a nerd.<br /><br />The first two thirds of this film are as good as any film can ever get.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou is great in the role of Am&eacute;lie and it is, no doubt, a role which she will be remembered for, for many years to come.
1400095913|5.0|This book swept me up in its darkly chilling tale of a likeable, witty and charming serial killer from page one.  Well done to the author for managing to make me like a man whose crimes are repulsive in the extreme.  <br />  <br />Dexter Morgan, a seemingly normal young man, has a dark sense of humour coupled with a penchant for murdering `bad guys'.  He analyses blood at crime scenes and has an abrupt but well-meaning policewoman sister who is not treated seriously by her colleagues.  Dexter also has an uncanny knack for solving crimes committed by less scrupulous serial killers and his sister enlists him in helping her find the killer behind a recent spate of gruesome murders. <br /> <br />The best thing about the book was feeling as if I really got inside the head of Dexter.  He is unusual, sinister, funny and poetic.  His description of his `Dark Passenger', the presence inside him that compells him to kill repeatedly, was strange and intriguing.  Although some of the plot resolutions at the end of the book seemed a bit coincidental, they were still surprising and enjoyable.  I also liked reading a crime novel set in Miami, which is a new setting for me.  All in all, an original and unsettling debut novel from an author I'll definitely be watching out for in the future.
B000HKCRW2|5.0|this is what future rock is supposed to be. i love the contrast and creativity between the tracks. each one has its own soul and feeling. this band doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, a party monster. this much energy can't be contained with just ten tracks. you scream for more after each song, and yell for defness as you analize each sonic creation. i listen to electronic dance music, and have a hard time following anything in the \\"rock\\" segment. this totally keeps my interest....

0385336691|1.0|I waded through this 'action thriller' on a recent business trip and finished it in the hope that the final scenes might justify the tedium, but they did not. I abandoned it at an airport Starbucks for the next poor sap. <br /> <br />The plot, a private eye procedural in which the tough, hard-bitten dick is an ex-military policeman and the bad guys are ex-special forces mercenaries, has a few nice twists. But the writing is thin and repetitive, and the characters are completely lacking in depth or credibility. The postscript, describing what the main progatonists are doing 12 months after the final shootout, is feeble. Compared to the 4th John Rain novel I had just finished, this was dross.

0393324818|5.0|This is a perfect example of edutainment at its best.  Terrfic fun while simultaneously teaching you a great deal about the key factors that determine a teams win rate.  Aside from the style and the analysis this book also does something even more valuable: It highlights a management approach that is truly based on merit, as opposed to how \\"pretty\\" an athelete is or how much charisma they have.  For people who believe that the USA is as close as any country to being a meritocracy - this book is a shining example of just that.  I am truly astonished and dismayed by the negative reviews I have read.  I can't wait for Lewis to write his next book.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Okay, I like Mariah and this album is great. However, I'm only writing this to correct the mistake made by the Amazon reviewer who describes Mariah as the bestselling female artist of all time. She isn't; it's still Madonna, by quite a distance. According to the OFFICIAL international figures as at the end of 2005, Mariah has sold 220 million records worldwide (albums and singles), whereas Madonna has sold 280 million. It doesn't mean Madonna is better than Mariah, but I think Amazon should try and get their facts straight.
0060776757|5.0|If anyone here owns the Beatles Anthology companion book to the TV series/CD's, this isn't much different. The story is \\"written\\" by the band, quotes culled from over 150 hours of interviews done for Neil McCormick. Every phase of the band's career, from it's earliest days straight through to \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is told solely through quotes from each band member, making this is as definitive, brutally honest, unflinching and uncompromising a book on the band as we'll ever see. These aren't moments plagiarized from magazine articles or other books, but personal recollections. <br /> <br />The pictures were taken from the band's personal archives. As much as there is to read here there's just as much to look at. You can honestly say, \\"I have NEVER seen this shot before\\" over and over again. This is a beautifully laid out book. <br /> <br />Moreso than any other book on U2, this book can be accurately described in two words: \\"definitive\\" and \\"essential\\". The band has the last word on it's personal history and here it is. Now If only there were a Beatles Anthology style DVD set on U2 to go along with this....
1577314808|5.0|Previous to the first reading of this book, the principles of present moment living, quieting the mind, and being still to become in touch with my intuition or the wisdom of the universe are some I have practiced, along with others, that have enabled me to experience serenity in my life regardless of the circumstances. Though many of the concepts of this book were not new to me, I find this book very valuable. It further expands the understanding of these concepts and adds its own voice to the discussion of these principles with great clarity. It is a book I have read many times and each time, though I may just read a page or two, it quiets my mind and I feel more peaceful.(In my second reading, it helped me to be more peaceful during a time when the doctors believed my son had an inoperable brain tumor.) I have since moved on to read his next book - A NEW EARTH and I am on my third reading. I highly recommend this one as well.
0780628551|4.0|I watch a fair number of slower paced, atmospheric foreign films that kind of stew in their own juices. I enjoy them. I also like old sci-fi. This film vaguely reminded me of Tarkovsky's \\"Solaris\\"--a fave for me. I hope that comparison is helpful to people interested in this movie. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this film. It took an old B-movie story (I think it was \\"I Married a Space Monster\\"), and stood it on its head while maintaining the initial point of \\"what's the difference between body and mind, or soul and genetics.\\" A lot of body in this film and I think that was part of the point. Using an old, and predictable, story or premise as a vehicle is not uncommon--we all knew how the new King Kong was going to end, didn't we--so when it's done, the thing I look for is the shape and flavor of the things hanging off that trite story line, and how it all interacts with our imposition of predestination on a flick. <br /> <br />A hundred plus bad reviews down below--REALLY bad reviews--but after reading many of them I sense a common problem. Johnny Dep is a cult phenomenon, but he's also a fine actor. No matter what he does, he drags a large fan base with him. I think here he accidentally dragged his fan base into a kind movie that just doesn't appeal to fans of sexy media personalities. In a way, Dep's attractiveness and sex appeal work against his proven ability to be a serious and diverse actor. I never see a film BECAUSE Dep is in it, but I do often watch films that happen to have him in the cast and I frequently marvel at his performances. <br /> <br />A tiny handful of good reviews of this movie and I believe every one, no matter how sincere the opinion or well-argued the case--received ONLY \\"not helpful\\" votes. I tried to remedy that. Whenever I encounter that sort of skewed voting on an Amazon item, I sense it's almost always in regard to a product that's controversial and people are voting their personal feelings about the issue, not voting for-or-against the genuine helpfulness of the review in question. Write and post a reasoned, tautly argued negative critique of a Michael Moore film or a book on Intelligent Design and watch the negative votes roll in. It's like running for Congress. <br /> <br />What you're seeing here with these reviews of \\"The Astronaut's Wife\\" is American Marketing Culture in action. Anyone shopping for Moore or Intelligent Design or Johnny Dep product on Amazon is already an integral part of that niche market the product is carefully designed for. They've largely made up their minds about the topics at hand, so criticism of the topic (its quality, premises, facts--or lack of them--and conclusions, all legitimate targets for intelligent criticism of any book or film) is absolutely not what they're seeking. They give \\"not helpful\\" votes to people who are not part of their niche market or (or tribe or clan or cult, to use more appropriate lingo) and add in the 100th glowing five star review that is less a criticism and more a hymn of devotion and admiration; a vote FOR the the favored topic or beloved personality at hand. <br /> <br />The precise reverse happens here. Fans--through skewed one and two star voting and unrelenting damnation--are letting the world know that they don't ever want to see Dep in another movie that bores THEM. This is a signal to the marketing people who help guide Dep's career and it's a totally legitimate communication from Consumers in a Marketing Culture (and really, what else are we these days?). The feedback just isn't what can be considered serious reviews and criticism.  <br /> <br />People who disagree with the democratic mob sentiment--like that sad handful who, in the heat of a revolution, sheepishly raise their hands to vote NO in the token rubberstamp vote on whether to storm the palace--are to be slammed down hard; here by informing them (through unanimous \\"not helpful\\" votes) their errant opinion is, more truthfully, \\"not helpful to the cause\\"--the \\"cause\\" being tonever have to endure the discomfort of seeing a beloved media figure perform in a film of a \\"type\\" \\"style\\" or \\"genre\\" that is clearly not enjoyed by these fans. <br /> <br />It's a sad thing to have to note, and I wouldn't be expecting much sympathy for such a view, but within these Amazon pages we may actually be witnessing deep truths about people's perceptions and attitudes about democracy, dissent, opinion, and dialogue.  <br />
B00005JOWT|4.0|If you read the book and then watch this movie, you will be very disappointed.  The book is much edgier and more adult.  The only part I liked about the movie apart from the book was the ending and how Nick outed Heather.  That was f-ing brilliant.  I was more excited about this movie than I have been about a movie in a long time.  While I thought it was good, I think it could have been MUCH better.  Aaron Eckhart was awesome as Nick Naylor!!!  Best of luck to Jason Reitman on his sophomore effort!!!
0393327655|5.0|I would like The End of Faith to be required reading for everyone who aspires to leadership in this country.  I hope everyone I know will read it!  It is so thought-provoking, coherent and beautifully written, that it is like an island of sanity.  Some examples, to paraphrase Harris (these may be direct quotes, I can't remember) \\"Religion itself is the source of the majority of society's problems\\", and, \\"People who strongly believe assertions for which there is no evidence should be relegated to the margins of society, not sitting in its halls of power.\\"
0812550706|4.0|damn good, however, it was one of those ones i had to find time to read it and finally when i got to the end it was worth the extra push.. all my friends had raved over this book and how it was one of their favorite sci-fi books and that i needed to read it.. i am not going to lie, the book is exilerating in some parts and drags in others. ender is a third who has been trimmed and groomed to be the next great leader against the buggers to save the human race. military manipulation and just that little extra push to make a person become that never quiting machine that always gets better and better, no matter what you  throw at them. this book was very good none the less and people who read this book will not be dissapointed..
0385474547|4.0|There is a profound need for Americans to read books about non-Western cultures. This is especially true for those in political leadership positions. Things Fall Apart, by Chinua Achebe, is one such book. <br /> <br />I learned about Things Fall Apart for the first time recently on somebody's blog. I picked it up from the library two days ago and finished it today. <br /> <br />Things Fall Apart is the story of Okonkwo, a leader in the village of Umuofia in Nigeria. The story is told from the point of view that the Ibo culture of Okonkwo's people. This culture is profoundly different from that of 21st Century America. A significant part of this book is spent establishing the culture and society for the reader. <br /> <br />In the first part of the book, the cultural constructs hold the society together, even though things fall apart on occasion on a personal level for Okonkwo and others in the book. But things fall apart for the culture as a whole as a result of the arrival of Christian missionaries and British colonial rulers. The story of how this happens to Okonkwo and his village is told in a simple, accessible, but gripping way. <br /> <br />If you read this book, do NOT use the speed reading technique of reading the end first. Just read it through, and will find that the very last paragraph provides the exclamation point that makes this book's message so important.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Wow, this is one of the best cd's I have heard in years, not a bad track on here! There are elements of great bands (Zeppelin, Beatles) here but with a modern edge that makes this effort sound almost experimental.  Check out Broken Boy Soldiers and Blue Veins, freakin' amazing!  The beat on the title track is driving, raw and practically primal.  Blue Veins is bluesy with a provocative edge.  Run, don't walk to your favorite music store and buy this!  Be warned, tho, this cd has teeth, once they sink into you, it won't let go.
B000H0MKGK|2.0|When John Mayer hit the mainstream pop charts with his debut album Room for Squares, he gained both the attention of the pop world and the jazz/blues world with his infectious combination of soulful guitar riffs, witty lyrics, and catchy melodies. But he left his fans wondering which direction he would take. True, John had opened himself up to a wide variety of musical avenues to choose from, but what would his fans have to say about a drastic move one way or the other? With the release of his second studio album, Heavier Things, Mayer put emphasis on his blues roots, steering clear of his previously acoustic-heavy style with the exception of \\"Daughters\\". John, instead, opted to go with a clean cut electric guitar sound. Strangely enough, the only track that recieved above average recognition from his fans was \\"Daughters\\", the sole acoustic track on the album. However, this did not discourage John from diving deeper into his pool of generic electric guitar sounds and repetitive, predictable vocal lines. His live project, John Mayer Trio, was a nice reminder of how good a live performer John is, however, did not present us with a particularly impressive setlist.  <br /> <br />Now we have reached the album Continuum, which is just that: a continued effort on John's part to promote his \\"artsy\\" sound. John has now completely abandoned his acoustic guitar and instead lulls you to sleep with the same predictable blues riffs in every track. Instead of witty lyrics and catchy melodies, you hear blues standards and generic lyrics about love and politics. Overall, Continuum is lackluster and unimpressive to say the least. Hopefully John will refind the balance of styles that made him so successful in the first place.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I have never been a big fan of Johnny Cash.  I know, I know, that makes me a Philistine.  But his baritone never did much for me, and his hallowed status has always been thrust upon me by his many indignant fans.  Something about the Man in Black makes his most ardent fans want to fight to defend the man and his music. <br /> <br />I mention this only to say that I was not really looking forward to \\"Walk the Line,\\" the biopic that does for Cash what \\"Ray\\" did for Ray Charles.  The similarities between these two men and the two movies are striking.  Both feature heroes raised literally dirt-poor, teaching themselves music, making it big, and inflicting damage on themselves and others through colossal substance abuse.  And along the way, they make some of the most beloved music America has produced. <br /> <br />Joaquin Phoenix plays the grown-up Cash, and he nails it.  Cash, with his deep voice and brawler's physique, may be one of the most difficult of artists to channel, but Phoenix does it well.  Initially, Cash struggles as he tries to form an old-timey gospel trio.  But his life is transformed when a music agent tells him, sing like you've got one song left to sing, and God's going to hear it.  Cash responds to this challenge by belting out \\"Fulsom Prison Blues,\\" and finding the Johnny Cash sound - \\"strong as a train and sharp as a razor.\\"  That Phoenix does all his own singing, and does it well, is a plus to his fine acting job. <br /> <br />Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, a daughter in the Carter family of country music royalty.  On the radio since she was 4, she unwittingly inspires Cash, who listens to her on his old radio as a boy.  As adults, they find themselves on tour, and despite missteps and mis-marriages, an undeniable romance blossoms between these two best friends.  One wonders what she saw in the Man in Black, since he spends several years in a wasteland of drugs and booze . . . and yet while June walks away from time to time, Cash never leaves her heart.  And Witherspoon captures Carter's spunk and devotion, and provides another example of an actress who can really sing.   <br /> <br />This is powerful stuff, if conventional.  You don't go to \\"Walk the Line\\" to see anything original - you go because these are two lives that tell one great story.  And great it is.   <br /> <br />
B00000DFSK|5.0|U2's 'The Best of 1980-1990' may be straightforward, but that simply shows how important and successful they have been for harnessing passion. This compilation works because their singles are often their best material. The '[Limited Edition]' is worth the extra purchase because it has some essential material. (There are some weaker songs as well, but the B-sides will prevent the collection from becoming repetitious.) \\"Pride (In the Name of Love),\\" \\"New Year's Day,\\" \\"I Will Follow,\\" \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\\" and \\"Desire\\" have all rewritten the history of pop/rock music. They resonate well even today. The other allegedly lesser songs are merely great. Singles were their strongest suit, but their albums are solid and consistent as well. (Although the nineties found some uneven albums, but that should be saved for another day.) Passion is rock's hallmark, and Bono's primal singing, The Edge's inventive guitar, Adam Clayton's throbbing baselines, and Larry Mullen's athletic and idiosyncratic drumming all have come together for some of the best big rock band songs since The Beatles.

B0000AUHQF|4.0|`Rudy' is all the things that a good sports movie should be.  It's emotional, it's touching, it's realistic and it has some great sports action (not a lot, but enough)...but what makes `Rudy' stand out above the rest is it's heart, and that heart is elevated through Sean Astin's wonderful performance.  As Rudy, Sean shows us a boy with so much determination amidst so much rejection and lack of support.  As a boy he always dreamed of playing for Notre Dame but when the time came his grades wouldn't allow it.  No one but his best friend even believed in him, but when his best friend suffers an untimely death Rudy starts to believe in himself.  He enrolls in a school close by in an attempt to raise his grades and get accepted into Notre Dame and when he eventually does so his family is pleased (for the most part) but they still knock him down when he proclaims his determination to make the football team.  It's not that Rudy doesn't have the knowledge of the game or even the skill to play, he's just way to small to make any difference on the field.  But with all his heart and soul on his sleeve he makes a difference, in the hearts of his teammates, his coach, his town and eventually his family.  It's a truly heartwarming and tender film with a knock out performance by Astin.  Great film for any sports buff, but for all you ladies out there wondering if this is just a guy flick, it's not.  It's a movie about believing in yourself...and you'll love it if not for the fact you'll see your man cry.
0800141849|3.0|That's the name of a comically mocking song from \\"Funny Girl\\" when a group of yentas discuss the romantic prospects of a young Fanny Brice. It seems the harsh sentiments still resonate with Barbra Streisand nearly thirty years later in her third directorial effort. While she shows a sure hand in maneuvering the inevitable shenanigans of a romantic comedy, the multi-hyphenated legend lets her intractable need to convey serious-minded, self-esteem-oriented messages weigh this 1996 movie down considerably.<br /><br />At an epic length of 130 minutes, the story, adapted by Richard LaGravenese from a forgotten 1958 French film, is quite slight as it focuses on Rose Morgan, a wildly popular Columbia literature professor but also a fortyish, baseball-obsessed frump long in the shadow of her beautiful sister Claire and glamorous mother Hannah. Her lot in life seems crystallized at Claire's wedding when she weds Rose's longtime crush Alex. Meantime, Columbia mathematics professor Gregory Larkin tires of bedding beautiful women who rile him toward irrational acts and wants to find a homely woman with whom he can have a platonic, intellectually-focused friendship and eventually a chaste marriage. Greg places a personals ad to which Claire responds unbeknownst to Rose. The budding relationship between Rose and Greg turns on the inevitable moment when Rose seeks intimacy from a disinterested Greg. This leads to a physical transformation and a message-driven finale.<br /><br />As Rose, Streisand is quite good and sympathetic most of the way, even if she never looks terribly frumpy and overdoes her character's magnetic speaking skills in the lecture hall. Like the yearning Barbra of long ago, she achieves a palpable sadness when she feels humiliated on her wedding night. However, once Rose transforms herself, Streisand's ego takes over as her blonde highlights and aerobicized body bring back the execrable, soft-focus treatment from the lovemaking scenes in \\"The Prince of Tides\\". Looking more like his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves.<br /><br />At the time of release, Lauren Bacall received all sorts of kudos as Hannah, though it is a relatively superficial performance in a showy role except for a wonderfully brave, make-up-free scene where Hannah admits to Rose how she valued her beauty while it lasted. Mimi Rogers provides sharp bite as Claire, while Pierce Brosnan lends the necessary smarminess to the shallow Alex and George Segal (Streisand's one-time co-star in \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\") is relegated to a dispensable best-pal role. As with her previous two films, Streisand imbues her film with lots of background music though this time it feels somewhat more intrusive. What she does achieve is the romanticism in tone and self-image reinforcement she obviously felt a need to convey. The DVD came out only two years later in 1998 and consequently has no extras to offer.his uni-browed brother and father as he grows older, Jeff Bridges plays Greg as a befuddling stereotype who grows more unrealistic as the story evolves.

6305558175|1.0|This movie helped me understand a few things.  First, not all period pieces are worth their weight in gold (I kind of already knew that)...Second, Jodie Foster can't do all the work on her own...and Third, Richard Gere is horridly overrated.  I've never been a fan of Gere but this film really pushed my dislike for him over the top.  Sure, I like some of his movies, but he's along the same vein as Tom Cruise to me...he sure knows how to pick a film but he should let someone else do his acting. <br /> <br />The story of Jack Sommersby (Gere) who returns home from the war a changed man quickly goes from interesting to absurd.  His wife Laurel (Foster) is distant from him, and Jack even at times seems to wonder why, yet it's obvious through conversations taking place between Laurel and Orin (Pullman) that Jack was a very bitter and abusive man before heading off into war.  So the question raised is WHO is this Jack Sommersby, well better yet, is he even Jack Sommersby at all? <br /> <br />WELL, I was bored stiff through most of it...fell asleep once actually, and was borderline irritated with Bill Pullmans performance which, if it had been left out on the cutting room floor altogether would have been a blessing in disguise since his every movement is atrocious.  I guess I'm the minority here but to me, `Sommersby' is one to skip, miss, avoid and just plain forget.
0786868694|5.0|It's hard not to be enraptured by the beauteous Nigella Lawson when she cooks on television since she is obviously into the sensory experience of what she prepares. Her first and best series aired about five years ago on the Style Network here, \\"Nigella Bites\\", and this is the cookbook that accompanies her show. More than just a recipe repository, it reflects her passionate attitude toward food like few others can. It shows in the way Lawson prefaces the book by stating upfront that this is the food she cooks and eats. She also categorizes the recipes creatively into her own terms. Sample chapters include Party Girl (festive food for large groups), Rainy Days (recipes that require more time but result in satisfying dishes), Trashy (dishes that may border on kitschy but taste good) and Templefood (\\"soothing, pure, would-be food\\" you make to respect your body).<br /><br />Lawson is not kidding about her descriptions, as you will see a recipe for Elvis Presley's Fried Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich in the Trashy section. My favorites are invariably in the Templefood section where there are recipes for a wonderfully filling Hot and Sour Soup and well as a tangy Vietnamese Chicken and Mint Salad. The Legacy section, which are her family recipes, are quite a hearty treat with Granny Lawson's Lunch Dish a great meat pie alternative. Above all else, the idiosyncratic choices that Lawson chooses to present reflect her personality. She is a genuine foodie with a knowing sense of humor that makes comfort cooking a not-so-guilty pleasure. Now that she is coming to the Food Network, I am hopeful she will develop an even broader following stateside.
0743298020|4.0|The word \\"atmospheric\\" was used by previous reviewers and is best suited to describe the style of this writer, placing you at her narrator's pace through the intriguing revelations of Vida Winter, a famous, dying writer whose biography our narrator, Margaret, has been asked to write. <br /> <br /> Margaret, a girl whose life has been spent surrounded by books, is influenced not only by the tale she is told, but her surroundings: the current home of Vida Winter, her father's bookshop, the ruins of Angelfield manor and all the misty, moldy, charred and ghostly remains that run through each.  <br /> <br />The book brings to mind, and references, gothic and classic tales such as Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. It's filled with flawed and even deranged characters, startling subplots and surprising conclusions. My only quarrel with the overall story was the ending felt a little too neat, almost like the reveal wasn't as clever as the earlier parts of the book.  <br /> <br />Still, this book shouldn't be read in a hurry, although you will want to rush through to find out the secrets revealed at the end. A solid and entrancing first novel.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is a fine album that comes with great melodies, fine guitar playing, vocals with feeling, and interesting poetry. I don't know if I would call it a classic, but it certainly combines some of the best talents of two exceptional artists in a blend that works wondrously well. \\"All the Roadrunning\\" seems to ask the question of whether a musician's career is worth the pain. The answer is apparently yes as long as the dream remains. \\"Donkey Town\\" is an interesting story that makes you want to learn \\"the rest of the story\\". Although Knopfler's guitar work is exceptional, and Emmylou's vocals are as clear as daybreak, it's the lyrics that really make this whole record enjoyable for me.

You may not consider yourself a film fanatic without having seen this movie, because it is simply a masterpiece.
0307346609|5.0|An excellent vision of an apocalyptic present.  The author, Max Brooks, writes the book under the fiction that he's an investigator for the UN interviewing survivors of a war between humanity and the living dead!

The survivor's stories are often bleak but sometimes inspiring as they map out the story of their victory over the zombies.

B000301YY8|1.0|This guy sounds way too \\"effeminate\\" for me.  And, it's rather draining.  This music is emotional, but very mundane.  I want to hear music that entertains me, not gets me all depressed.<br /><br />I learned of this guy by watching my daughter making a disturbed, twisted, facial expression while his video came on \\"The Tube\\".  At first, we both laughed, and then we realised that it's not very funny at all.  This guy's voice isn't for the squeemish. Some people may find him rather uncomfortable to have to sit through.<br /><br />So my daughter and I both agree that well have to pass on this nervy whining singer.  And we hope other new singers don't follow his lead.  But, of course, we all have our own unique tastes in music.  We think he's kinda creepy.  Although he chose to sing, I don't think he found his right calling.<br /><br />You see, if his singing career doesn't quite take off, maybe he could work for Jim Hensen Productions or Walt Disney.  He could probably do a good \\"Mickey Mouse\\" voice.  Maybe even \\"Minnie Mouse\\".  He could probably do a variation of \\"smurf-like\\" voices, as well.  Or, just anything, with a high pitched outcome.  I'm sure he could do \\"screaming little girls\\" very well.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sure his (if you wanna call it) talented voice, can be applied more effectively elsewhere.<br /><br />And I'm sure, someday soon, we'll see a Weird Al Yankovic video of him doing a James Blunt song.  He'll probably have some big \\"clamp\\" affixed tightly to his crotch to add humor to why his voice is so high.

I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I bought this DVD because I absolutely loved everything about the movie: casting, cinematograhy, direction, location, etc. So I wanted some insites from the director or cast regarding the making of the movie. Much to my disappointment, the DVD just comes with the movie and no special features. Don't let this stop you from buying the movie because it's wonderful. However the powers that be lost a great opportunity to enhance our enjoyment of the movie by omitting The Making of the Lake House feature and/or the director's commentary. Bummer!
B00008CLOA|5.0|I'm not sure if I like the new cover art, but this album will stand the test of time as being the greatest piece Rock n' Roll ever. I havn't heard this version but I'm sure that the audio is just fine for your average listener. The great audiophiles of the world can disect the sounds to death, but if you turn it up (on a decent stereo) I'm sure it sounds better than on vinyl. Who are these people with super hearing anyway?? Are they memebers of the canine family??

0060934719|5.0|The great thing about reading Gaiman's work has always been his commitment to story telling.  Whilst there undoubtably enough themes and issues in Stardust for even the most pompous literary critic to sink their teeth in to.  The main strength of this book (and indeed of most of Gaiman's work - excluding his literary collaboraitons) is its ability to fire you imagination.<br /><br />From the start of the novel to its conclusion you find yourself presented with both popular, obscure and invented myth that will allow your mind to wander in a way that you thought grown ups weren't allowed to.  Heroism, romance and imagination are abundant in the novel and best of all they don't feel beneath you, they feel like something you should aspire to.

0449911357|5.0|I've seen the movie 101 times (maybe not that many times, but you get my drift) and always thought that the book may ruin the effect of the movie for me, but I was in a rut bookwise and decided to give it a try. Let me tell you - I finished it in 3 days. And while the general theme was the same, the book is completely different than the movie. The best part was that it didn't make me appreciate the movie any less because I actually thought that the way they changed the movie was ingenius.  Is it possible to like a book as much as a movie but for completely different reasons?  Well, that's the case here.  I have already loaned my book out to a friend who loved the movie and have been telling everyone I know that they need to read it.  Almost everything about it is flawless in my mind.  Seriously, read this book!  Have I made myself clear?
6305972591|2.0|\\"Children of the Corn\\" had some potential: a \\"corn\\" cult for children with a charismatic adolescent as its leader takes over a rural town in Nebraska. Based on a short story by Stephen King, this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept. Unfortunately, some very weak execution is what mars the movie. Its director, Fritz Kiersch, sometimes works as \\"Alan Smithee,\\" the pseudonym for directors who don't want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys. This movie doesn't quite warrant that, though it isn't very good either. There is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening, yet simply is not. Most egregious is the use of hokey, faux sacred music. Aside from Linda Hamilton, John Franklin and Robbie Kiger, the performances are pretty weak. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful. Isaac Chroner (Franklin) instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult, who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town. His advice nearly prevents Vicky and Burt Stanton from seeking medical help there, but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids. If the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh, the incredibly lame final scene certainly will. That is not to say this movie is all bad, however. Though never scary, there are a few effective moments throughout. (I don't want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie)  Die hard horror fans might want to check out this 1984 release, though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear. This Anchor Bay DVD is anamorphic widescreen with good picture and sound, though this is not the director's cut.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Impressive biopic about the eccentric genius Howard Hughes. There's something about passionate men that inspires others to dream bigger dreams and achieve bigger goals. And Hughes was passionate if anything. We see him strive to make his dreams come true, in spite of corrupt politicians and back handed competitors like Pan-Am. And in spite of his own very personal war against his obsessive-compulsive disorder (probably induced by his mother (who most likely had the same illness) putting it into his mind from early childhood on how dangerous germs can be).   <br /> <br />Because of this - and his deafness - he's (understandably) rather reclusive and shy. But he can be  terribly witty and to the point as well. For instance when he strike's back at Hepburn's family; the quintessential rich, bored salon-socialists. These people are all utterly blasé, and whilst they're having the typical quasi-intellectual dinner conversation about art (\\"contemporary obviously\\"), politics (\\"we're all socialists here, and we just can't stand anyone with different views\\") and dogs (\\"we don't trust people who don't like dogs\\"), Hughes is - understandably - somewhat puzzled by their rudeness and definitely 'not amused'. No-one at the table listens to one-another, they're all babbling away on their own ego-trip, trying to outwit each other and show off how great (they think) they are.  When the mother finally states offhand \\"we don't care about money\\" Hughes strikes back with \\"that's because you have and always had money, you were born with it. Other people like myself have to work for it. Good day.\\" And walks calmly from the room...  <br /> <br />Another fine example of his wit comes to light during the senate hearing, as he strikes back at the corrupt senator who has set it up to favour Pan-Am's monopolistic plans. But I won't give too much away, you really have to watch this for yourselves. <br /> <br />Seeing all those great aeroplanes from bygone eras pass the screen is a feast to theeyes by itself. The entire movie is filmed beautifully and luscious, the in-flight scenes are nothing short of spectacular. Not at least when things go horribly wrong.  <br /> <br />It's a `big' film - as Hughes would have liked no doubt - yet it's intimate enough to completely relate to the man.  So much even that I wished from time to time that Mr. Scorsese would have put a little less emphasis on Hughes' illness. It's essential to portray the man's life and battles effectively of course, but it was a bit poignant at times. Be that as it may, all in all my respect for Howard Hughes has only grown. He may have been difficult at times, for himself as well as others, but he was most of all a good man, a great man, a visionary and a huge individualist.   <br /> <br />I think this is why we all - even people who weren't born yet during this era - still know his name, but no-one remembers the likes of a Juan Trippe, let alone some dodgy senator from Maine... <br /> <br />I knew Leonardo DiCaprio could act from the moment I saw his performance in 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', and he does it again in 'Aviator'. His role as Howard Hughes is utterly convincing. Cate Blanchett's Hepburn is pleasant to watch, and so is Kate Beckinsale's Ava Gardner. <br /> <br />All in all, a compelling film from start to end, about a great historical figure.  Definitely worth buying, as you'll likely want to watch it more than once!
B00005JNS0|2.0|My husband and I saw this movie in the theater.  We were really surprised by how unentertaining we found it, and I must point out that my husband is a real animation fanatic.  He would go to any and all animated movies in the theater if I would go along, which I usually won't.  We got suckered into this one by some positive reviews on TV.  I'm sorry to say we laughed once and I looked at my watch a lot because I found it draggy.  Maybe OK as a family-friendly film, but certainly not on a level with Shrek, Toy Story, Little Mermaid, etc.  Nice animation, but it takes a little more than that to keep my attention; celebrity voices don't do it for me either. I sometimes wonder if the people who write these movies would work a little harder if they didn't have well-known people doing the voices - it seems like they think people will watch the movie just because Paul Newman or whoever is doing a voice.  I also think the people who make this type of movie feel that because there are so few quality family/children's movies that they can put anything they want on the screen and people will go to see it because they need something to take the kids to.   Anyway...my husband and I agreed that it's unlikely we would watch it twice.
B000A59PMO|5.0|It's a credit to this show that viewers have posted lots of detailed raves and other enthusiastic comments here on Amazon, so I think I'll add just a brief paragraph or two with my own two cents.  After all, it's the show you should be immersing yourself into, not just the reviews of it.  So I won't keep you long.<br /><br />\\"Veronica Mars, Season One\\" delivers a batch of clever and hearfelt episodes, with not a clunker in the bunch.  Each episode, in addition to delivering some great character stuff, does two things: gives you an entertaining stand-alone story featuring Veronica taking on a P.I. type case, and 2) advances the season-long arc detailing Veronica's investigation into the death of her best friend, Lilly Kane.  Also, to keep viewers from getting too comfortable with the construction of the show, there are also a couple of \\"mini arcs\\" throughout the season, where Veronica undertakes some longer investigations that compete in importance with the investigation of her friend's death.<br /><br />I liked the way these season-one episodes played fair and actually gave you the clues you need to figure out Lilly Kane's killer, who is revealed in the excellent final episode of this set.  By the way, here's a teeny, tiny mini-spoiler that won't give away anything big but might make you enjoy the show even more:  when trying to figure out who killed Lilly, don't just pay attention to the \\"official\\" clues discovered during Veronica's investigation of her friend's death; also pay attention to the things you see during the course of the stand-alone stories.  There's info to be mined there!  Nuff said on that score.<br /><br />I loved the close relationship between Veronica and her dad, the daring nature of some of the things that happen to Veronica, the clever banter that is almost never too clever for its own good, and the way that the show respects viewers enough to believe that they can keep up!  In other words, each little mystery is solved and explained, but the solution isn't spoon fed to you.  You sometimes have to pay attention as the solutions are quickly rattled off so the show can get back to what it's really passionate about, namely the character stuff.<br /><br />Oh, well... I seem to be falling into the trap of so many other reviewers here, and keep going on and on about \\"Veronica Mars\\".  Let me just conclude by saying that I picked up season one of this program on DVD after Stephen King raved about the show in one of his Entertainment Weekly columns.  Stephen was right.

B0000931QA|5.0|One of the best bands ever.  This is the RYCHE at its best with Operation MindCrime.
1400095913|4.0|This is a remarkable debut novel,  one in which the author has created a memorable character. So memorable is Dexter Morgan that he now has his own series on the Showtime cable network. What makes the title character so intriguing is that he is a serial killer working as a forensics blood splatter technician in Dade County, Miami, where, as a sideline, he metes out his own brand of justice. You see, Dexter, takes the law into his own hands, killing those who also kill but have gone unpunished by the law. Consequently, the author has created a killer that the reader actually likes and roots for.<br /><br />Good looking and self-effacing, Dexter is the adopted brother of Deborah Morgan, a Miami vice cop with whom he works. She is trying to follow in the footsteps of her father, Harry Morgan, the Homicide cop that adopted Dexter at the age of four, after he was discovered in the aftermath of an unspeakable tragedy. It was Harry who sensed Dexter's strange proclivity and guided Dexter into channeling it in the way that it would be of benefit to law enforcement. Now, Dexter is trying to help his sister get promoted to Homicide by assisting her in finding a serial killer. It seems that since Dexter is one himself, he has an intuitive appreciation of the work of another. He also has a nose for sensing evil in others.<br /><br />In this particular case, it goes beyond that, as Dexter finds himself confused by this serial killer whose style is strangely reminiscent of Dexter's own. In fact, this serial killer seems clued in to the fact that Dexter is one himself, leaving Dexter even more puzzled and somewhat unnerved by the fact that his secret may be out, despite his meticulous care in the public service that he clandestinely performs. Just who is this mysterious and almost mischievous serial killer, and how is it that he seems to so intimately know Dexter? That is what is at the crux of this novel.<br /><br />With a well-plotted, slightly macabre story, narrated with quiet humor and intelligence by a fascinating central character, the author takes the reader on a walk into the dark side of humanity. While to Dexter's mind he lacks that sense of feeling that makes him as others are, the reader will find oneself liking Dexter and sensing in him that one thing that Dexter seems unable to sense, that very human desire to belong.  As Dexter's life unfolds on these pages, the reader will be compulsively turning them, wanting to know more about Dexter. The author, his fondness for alliteration apparent, does not disappoint the reader, as he has written \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\", a new novel featuring our likable monster.humor and intelligence by a fascinating central character, the author takes the reader on a walk into the dark side of humanity.

B000EGDB10|1.0|Mission:Impossible, the TV series, told the adventures of the Impossible Missions Force -- an elite team of covert operatives who were sent to overthrow mob kingpins, foreign dictators, terrorists and others who threatened the security of the United States. Rather than engage in James Bond-like shoot outs, the IMF team worked together to covertly neutralize threats, leaving little or no trace of their involvement. Although the IMF had a leader (Steven Hill as Dan Briggs and Peter Graves as Jim Phelps), there was no star of the group -- just a bunch of individuals working together to achieve its objective. A truly groundbreaking show. <br /> <br />Along comes Brain De Palma's catastrophe of a remake, starring that couch-jumping Scientologist Tom Cruise. Within half an hour of the film starting, the entire IMF team, save for Cruise, is killed off, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight) is exposed as a double agent and basically the entire concept of the original Mission:Impossible is shot to hell. Granted, Ving Rhames and Jean Reno are present as Cruise's new team, but Mission:Impossible is quickly bastardized as yet another Tom Cruise vehicle where he preens and postures. Making a film called Mission:Impossible into a star vehicle goes against the spirit of the original TV series. It's obscene what Tom Cruise's ego has done to Bruce Geller's original concept. This is just another action film with Mr. Cruise flashing his toothy smile and saving the world all by himself. See the original TV series and skip this piece of bastardized trash.
1401302378|3.0|I was extremely curious about this book, as I found myself referring to it in business and felt that I better read the book real soon. For those who don't know about \\"The Long Tail\\", it's an economic theory that believes that due to the internet, cable TV and other changes in technology, consumers are no longer force fed a few choices, and therefore we have market opportunities for \\"niche\\" industries and content. Well, if you understand that, then perhaps there is no real need to read the book, unless you either don't know how music and books are sold on line or are fascinated with little details about how eBay and other online retailers work. That being said, it might be that I had an advanced understanding of this stuff (as I have a business focused on a \\"niche\\" market), so I might be too well-versed to appreciate the details. However, it's like The World is Flat by Tom Friedman. One theory - and lots of chapters of examples. Some are interesting and compelling, others, not so much. YET, if you don't know what I'm talking about in this review ... then get thee to an online retailer, and get your copy of the Long Tail, because this tail does have a good point. At least I like to think so.
038572179X|3.0|Contrary to many of the other reviews that have been posted, I thought McEwan's writing in \\"Atonement\\" was very cold and detached.  Back in high school English class I learned good writers should \\"show\\" rather than \\"tell\\"; McEwan leans much more toward \\"tell\\".  Particularly frustrating were the very heavy-handed phrases such as, \\"In later years, Briony would come to feel...\\"  Any editor worth his/her salt would have stricken these sentences!!  The one exception to this, and the part of the book that grabbed me most and stays with me, is the scene at the hospital when Briony is a nurse probationer and the casualties come in. <br /> <br />In all, \\"Atonement\\" is a decent book by a decent writer.  Not great, not terrible, just solidly mediocre.
B000E8QVWY|1.0|I wanted to like this film really I did but I found it quite boring! I thought it would leave me feeling awesome like I did with 'Ray' but all I saw was Reese and Mr Phoenix. Not Johnny Cash and June Carter. I really hated the end. I thought it would get in to their marriage but it ended as she finally said yes to his proposal.
0553208845|4.0|First off although my copy of the book has the copyright publication date at 1951, a blurb at the end states that Hesse wrote this in 1922.  That's incredible to think of considering the massive amounts of reprinting and influence of many aspects of this novel in the United States during the 1960's.<br /><br />It's a short novel, only 152 pages, and would be even less if published with the smaller font and spacing typical of most recent published paperbacks.  It's a novel of young man's attainment towards self-understanding and wisdom, via a myriad of events through life, including a humble life as a beggar, an affair with a manipulative wealthy woman, and even life as a rich man himself, and an eventual return to a humble life.<br /><br />Many of the characters refer to themselves in the third person, so this may be confusing in the first few pages.
B00005JP0A|5.0|When I saw the preview for this movie I was like I am so not seeing that. And then I saw it now on TV. Wow is it good! Great acting, very believable and you didn't feel like you were watching a movie. It felt real. Sad how Andy changed cause of her job but she realized it in the end. Very good movie. Love to see it again
B000003TA4|3.0|I really don't see why I enjoyed their music back in the day. Maybe because I was sad, depressed and unsure of my purpose on this Earth, but I really don't enjoy Nirvana's music nowadays. And its not the fact that it is dated or anything like that. Seriously, these guys were not that great of musicians, their music was not that great. And for the record, Kurt could NOT sing, no matter what anyone says. Their mish mash of punk/grunge and rock was decent at best, but in no way warrents the critical acclaim that this band recieved. A grunge band that became the epitome of what they hated the most, big deal, happens all the time to musicians thousands of times more talented than Nirvana.  <br />Sure \\"Nevermind\\" has its great parts, as does mostly every recorded album ever made.  <br />I know that many people will argue and be even disgusted with my review, but I don't praise a band just because their singer killed himself, and I don't really think these guys had much talent.  <br />I think this is a perfect example of POP music and the MTV craze that consumes our country with expendable music filled with three chords and basic musicianship. Sure, there is nothing wrong with basic musicianship, not every band has to be a complex mish mash, but to call these guys one of the greatest bands on Earth, come one, they weren't that good. <br />Kurt was obviously the mastermind behind this band, and he mastered three chord progressions, big deal. There are millions of people who have done that, but they are still playing in their garages and have virtually no fan base at all. Being a sub-par musician is not a hard thing to do. <br />I admit I used to listen to this album everyday and praise this band, but now I really don't see why, and I cannot stand to even listen to them anymore.
B000G2YD3C|5.0|Still think they should hire an artist to come out with nice artwork.  Look at that ugly packaging, it does not represent them well! <br /> <br />They make great music.  A kind of symphonic metal but not much metal, in which they throw in some modern sound to create a great atmosphere. I like their layer vocals and particularly the lady's voice.  I have not buy any female album in time.   <br /> <br />Forget the Pink Floyd, I think they have more to do with Porcupine Tree and Riverside than anything else.  The lyrics writing is obviously not their strenght, but I don't really mind. <br /> <br />My favorite song is \\"The Intention craft\\".  Starts with nice guitar and electronic effects but then they turn that same melody on the metal side until we get soft music with violins. At this point, they manage to make it metal again with a galloping bass.       <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00019PDKC|5.0|Sure, Anathema started out as a British Doom Metal group, being one of the great pioneers of the genre. They released a few albums of Doom Metal, nothing that ever caught my attention. I absolutely hate Doom Metal in all of its forms. The slow, dragging out of songs, the all too common and repetitive depressing lyrics, and the annoying vocals. There isn't much room for imaginitive or creative musicianship because everything seems to be done at a slow snails pace. Its all the same to me. <br />Then, Anathema decided to let go of the past, and embrace the present and changed their style up slowly, shedding the growls and the intense Doom approach and took on a more rock approach. Still depressing, but it was a start. <br />Then along comes \\"A Fine day to Exit\\", and their Magnum Opus, \\"A Natural Disaster\\". Two albums that have totally stepped away from their past and their Doom roots and into the wonderful and beautiful spacious world of ART-Rock, a genre that trascends traditional rock and alternative music and is more of an intense feeling of atmospheric and ambient rock that captures the heart and touches the soul. <br />\\"A Natural Disaster\\" in my opinion is Anathema's best album ever. Sure, the lyrics are still depressing and sad, but this time their approach is different. Taking on a more intellectual and artistic approach, \\"A Natural Disaster\\" works on so many different levels. A heavy influence and range of electronic elements and progressive rock elements make this album must have. Some compare \\"A Natural Disaster\\" to other artists like Radiohead. I would say that to an extent this is true, but only in the ambience and atmospheric way. <br />Literally, this album is one whole progression of musical climax and bliss. <br />There is so much beauty in this album, you have to hear it to understand. Epic songs like \\"Balance\\", \\"Closer\\", \\"Are you there?\\", \\"Pulled under at 2000 meters a second\\", \\"A Natural Disaster\\", \\"Flying\\", \\"Electricity\\" and \\"Violence\\" just grab your heart and your soul and they never let go. Compositions that are sonically and dynamically perfect along with vocals and lyrics that are top notch and fit the moods perfectly, this album is pure perfection. <br />The eerie and sadness of \\"Electricity\\" makes the hairs on my body stand even to this day and I have heard that song a million times. The climax is so beautiful. <br />\\"Flying\\" is a poignant song that is so atmospheric its amazing. <br />There is way too much to say about each song on this album and not enough time, you MUST buy this! If you like ART-Rock or emotional music you will love this album!  <br />Sure, they ditched their Doom metal for a more poppy/Radiohead-ish/Coldplay sound but with more Progressive elements, but who cares? It works really well for them, like this was what they were meant to do. Go to their web site(do a search for it), they explain how they lost a lot of fans and how many of their die hard fans do not understand why they changed styles, and the band explains that they are about letting go of the past, experiencing a moment and moving on and that they have grown as humans and as musicians, and naturally with all growth, you are lead onto different paths. True, amazing artists change and flow with time and world, their work is never the same. Anathema are TRUE amazing artists. <br />The beauty on this disc is un-matched and I am suprised that \\"A Natural Disaster\\" did not elevate Anathema into worldwide popularity status(not that I would want them to become poster boys and girl and sell out, but its really that good). The sheer depth of each song is well crafted and much better than anything I have ever heard of theirs, and I have heard it all. Much more can be said through silence, mellow music and clean sun vocals than can ever be achieved through raspy and growly vocals with tons of distorted guitar. The piano on this album says it all in a forray of emotions.I highly recommend this album to everyone who appreciates ART-Rockor amazing music and beautiful music.
0060989157|5.0|I just loved this book. Neil Strauss and the motley crue boys have a written a masterpiece. <br />It might not suit everyone's tastes but my girlfriend is currently reading it and loving it too. <br />It has a bit of a tabloid feel but don't worry about that. <br />Just enjoy it especially when Vince, Tommy, Nikki and Mick contradict each other. <br />I just finished the long road out of hell by marilyn manson and neil strauss also. Fantastic.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Judging by their latest release \\"A Murder of Crows\\", Incubus have ditched their funk/Nu-Metal/Progressive/Poppish style for a more straight forward rock sound. And for good reason. The moniker genre they were usually placed under has long since died out, and the remaining bands that attempt to release material even remotely close to Nu-Metal usually replicate the Nu-metal bands that came before them. Lets face it, Nu-Metal is dead, and it never really was that great to begin with. Incubus was one of the few great bands that incorporated Hip Hop/Funk/Metal/Jazz and a DJ all in one package. <br />\\"Morning View\\" sees the band in their most popular and at the height of their career. Now in the lime light, with millions of fans, \\"Morningview\\" does show the band ditching much of their Hip-Hop/Funky roots for more mature production and compostition. The vocals have become the lead instrument with the band taking much of a back seat. That is not to say that \\"Morninview\\" is a less-than-stellar album, on the contrary, it is an album worth owning with much to offer. The musicianship is still amazing and the vocals and lyrics are just as deep and meaningful. <br />\\"Morninview\\" takes time to break into, and even more time to find the hidden gems beyond just being a \\"great\\" radio friendly album. Just like \\"Make Yourself\\" I took this album at face value and have missed much of the magic to be found in each song. Under a new light one can easily see that \\"Morninview\\" is one of the greatest releases of its time.
B000002IGV|5.0|I had this casette way back when.  I was a juvenile rocker when it came out, I was young and dumb and embarrassingly goofy.  Now I'm almost 40 and listen to a very wide variety of music.  I happened to be at a friend's house and saw that he had this CD.  I played it and couldn't believe the A+ songs on it.  I'd always remembered Twisted Sister as some sort of gimmicky glam band that I'd listened to as a child. <br /> <br />I still think \\"We're not Gonna Take It\\" is a bit over the top, but \\"Burn in Hell\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\" are rock solid songs.  \\"Stay Hungry\\" reminded me of Y&T - and I rate Dave Meniketti as one of the greatest.  \\"The Price\\" is an achingly ripping ballad.  What vocals! <br /> <br />Well, I didn't skip through any of the songs (at the friend's house) and I bought the CD from Amazon 2 days later.  This one only got better with age.
B000002H97|2.0|and it shows because most of the songs on \\"the Black Album\\" are played constantly on generic rock stations across the US. Does that mean they are legendary? No, not to me. Radio music is hardly ever legendary, if heavy at that. Metallica is another overrated band that really isn't that talented. Their talent died with Cliff Burton, and now they make radio friendly garbage that all sounds the same. Sure, this album is rife with massive riffs and arena rock drumming and depressing moments, but lets face it, James is a horrible singer, Lars isn't all that great, and the guitar parts are average. <br />There are bands that many Metallica fans have no clue of that would eat Metallica for breakfast. <br />I admit, I used to be into this album, I used to own it and I used to love it. But when I view it now, I have no idea what possessed me to love this album so much. Metallica is a band of decent musicians, but not the gods that so many misguided people claim them to be.  <br />I am so tired of hearing these songs everywhere, and every guitar player aspires to learn a Metallica song. Everyone has immortalized these guys and they really aren't that great. <br />Sonically, musically, emotionally this album is devoid of major elements that make up an awesome album, yet poeple still claim that this is a must own under-rated classic. Under-rated? How so? Too many people praise this album, and all too much if you ask me.
B00008BDMY|4.0|The Swedes clearly figured out what worked well on their first album and decided to work with their strengths. Gone are all the little transitional instrumentation (violin, cello, female vocals) and overkill of experimentation. What we're left with is melodic death metal, filled with hooks and leads along with a more fine tuned aggression. They still run with acoustic interludes and an almost folk influence on occasions, yet the transitions are far better than on their debut album.  <br /> <br />The band hadn't yet settled on a line-up, with vocalist Anders Friden yet to join the fray. In fact, only Jesper Stromblad is still with the band today (2006) and he didn't play on the debut. So it's not completely surprising that Subterranean period In Flames is nothing like the albums released since the year 2000. Vocalist Henrik is great (also in Dawn) and Daniel's drumming is awesome, but it's once again the dual guitars of Jesper and Glenn that make this EP so good. Check out \\"Stand Ablaze\\" or \\"Subterranean\\" for exhibitions of brilliant melodic musicianship.  <br /> <br />In Flames are reaching their peak with Subterranean, both as musicians and as songwriters. With only 5 tracks and a running time of just over 20 minutes, it was an excellent teaser for the bands next couple of full length albums that would be the pinnacle of their career. Regain's re-mastered edition of this album released in 2004 has a far superior sound and is well worth purchasing, even for the fans that own the Wrong Again Records CD from the mid nineties, particularly for the bonus tracks and covers that come included.  <br /> <br />Overall, a step up in class for In Flames and a fine example of the Gothenburg sound that has been completely bombarded with clones for years since its release.
0316666343|3.0|I gave this three stars because I felt it was well written but I did not like the story at all.  I found it to be very melancholy and sad.  It was just plain depressing.  I didn't want to read such a disturbing story but I found once I started I couldn't quit.  I had to find out what happened!  Could only  read in small portions. <br />  It was a story that praised life and cherished it but at the same time left a feeling that life is \\"not all that much\\" in the  hereafter.   The whole story was just weird! There were too many sub plots going on to be developed properly. Don't think I will buy another by her.

0812550757|5.0|It is difficult to believe this is the first \\"sequel\\" to Ender's Game, because it is so vastly different from that book.  Andrew Wiggins is at a very different place & time in his life, not to mention a different place & time in the galaxy.  But how many of us are the same person today that we were at age 12?

His truth is so penetrating that others are able to see themselves as they really are, as well as the consequences of their choices. That realization provides a clearing for them, a freedom, to move forward through active choice to live the life they choose from that point forward.<br /><br />Imagine how different our world could be if we had Speakers for the Dead to share the true, unadulterated story of our lives - someone who would not glorify the dead, but simply remember their essence and encapsulate that essence in words that educated and moved and inspired others.

B00013RC8O|4.0|I guess that is the point of this movie, but there is a little more to it.  Kowalski played by Barry Newman is a car runner that always delivers his cars.  On his drive there he gets chased by a bunch of cops but he drives a Dodge Challenger, so nobody will catch him.  His back story is explained in a few scenes of how he used to be a cop and a race car driver.  Everything in the movie is very interesting but the car chases are the thing that is going to hold your attention.  Well, also the naked woman riding the motorcycle, you have to like her too.<br /><br />The dvd gives us the uncut UK version and wow what a difference.  Also a commentary by the director was a real treat to listen to.

If that's true, then either I remain a kid at heart or I just love kid's books.<br /><br />While this story revolves around child characters, albeit incredibly intelligent & gifted children, it has a depth which can appeal to all ages. The characters seem to come alive and they draw you in to make this story land on a personal level.  Perhaps we cannot relate exactly to the unique circumstances of this book, but we can all relate on some level.<br /><br />Ender's battle tactics and novel solutions to ever more complex challenges that stop most of his peers were intriguing. And the inter-relations of Ender with his class-mates is fascinating and feel very real for anyone who attended middle-school, participated in sports, or interacted with other children between the ages of 6 and 15.<br /><br />While that was interesting, my favorite aspects were the family themes that played out inside Ender's memory and self-examination. Is he more like Peter? Is he more like Valentine? Ultimately, that isn't a matter of fate, but rather a matter of choice.  In the end, we discover that the three of them each contain a bit of the others.<br /><br />Without giving any spoiler, the Demosthenes/Locke sub-plot was also a pleasant surprise and nice change of pace from the Training School. I was reminded of the Japanese manga \\"Sanctuary\\" - where two friends seek to restore their homeland to a safe place, free of corruption but utilize different avenues to reach the same goal - one uses politics & intrigue, while the other uses violence and the criminal underworld.<br /><br />Card makes a point of drawing the reader's attention to the motivation of his characters. Each one must be judged in the context of their individual situation and background. This doesn't excuse responsibility, but does provide understanding.  The Buggers, Ender's older brother Peter, even the Xenocide itself are understood differently and, in some cases, even re-conceptualized altogether as we come to know more about each of them.<br /><br />The last few chapters culminate in a fascinating change in momentum, including the closure of one door in life and the opening of doors to a new one.<br /><br />By traditional standards of age, Ender remains a child throughout most of the book.  But Ender's adult life springs directly from his childhood experiences on Earth and in the training school.  This lays the groundwork for the man he becomes and the life he chooses in subsequent novels in this series.ently and, in some cases, even re-conceptualized altogether as we come to know more about each of them. <br /> <br />The last few chapters culminate in a fascinating change in momentum, including the closure of one door in life and the opening of doors to a new one.  <br /> <br />By traditional standards of age, Ender remains a child throughout most of the book.

B00005JP87|2.0|Just a warning - those of you who are able to figure things out pretty easily may not want to read the following review, though I will endeavor to keep from giving too much away.<br /><br />THE ILLUSIONIST comes to us this year the first of an unlikely 1-2 punch from Hollywood in the form of movies about magicians, with THE PRESTIGE a few weeks away.  Indeed, the first time I saw the trailer for the latter, I thought they had repackaged ILLUSIONIST to draw in new audiences!  While THE PRESTIGE carries some slightly bigger names and a more heavy-handed Hollywood look, THE ILLUSIONIST seemed to be more ripe with promise in delivering a romantic thriller from yesteryear when magicians held audiences captive with simple on-stage antics.  Sadly, the magicians of days gone by had a much easier time of it than today's cinematic Copperfields.<br /><br />ILLUSIONIST starts off decently enough setting up a love triangle between the titular character of Eisenheim (Ed Norton), his childhood love Sophie (Jessica Biel) and monarch-to-be Leopold (Rufus Sewell).  What unfolds in the first hour is an admittedly delicious contest between Eisenheim and Leopold as the latter uselessly attempts to one-up the former.  Thrown into the mix is the police inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), who keeps a close eye on Sophie's comings and goings with hopes of earning a place of honor in Leopold's soon-to-come empire.<br /><br />In the end, Eisenheim manages to steal Sophies affections, which leads Leopold to violent actions, and it is at this point that the film takes a downward turn.  After the mid-film climax, the final hour seems to drag on to its inevitable and predictable conclusion - and the writing and performances unfortunately cannot overcome this.  You can honestly feel that writer/director Neil Burger ran out of ideas, and so had to stretch what could have been accomplished in less than 20 minutes into another hour!  The end result is that with still 30 minutes left to go, I began focusing more on things like the number of pimples on character's foreheads and the uncanny resemblence between Giamatti and Kiefer Sutherland.<br /><br />The problem with this film is that it has a particular trick ending that it wishes to take you to, but in order to do that it must sacrifice its own storytelling!  Basically, the first hour of the film is largely viewed through the eyes of Eisenheim as he brings his act to Vienna, tries to assuage the suspicions of Inspector Uhl, and reunites with and woos Sophie.  But once the initial climax hits, the demands of the surprise ending dictate that we can no longer be in on Eisenheim's personal dealings, and so we now switch to Uhl's perspective, and suddenly nothing Eisenheim does makes sense.  It isn't until that final moment that we understand things again, but by this point we feel cheated and manipulated as an audience (and believe me, this film DEFINITELY cheats!) for the purpose of an attempted \\"didn't see that coming, did ya!?\\" ending that, unfortunately, you CAN see coming from a mile away!<br /><br />The film's saving grace is Paul Giamatti's great performance. Yes, this would be the same Giamatti that saved another wretched film this summer (LADY IN THE WATER) from being total crap.  I would love to see Giamatti get the Oscar he has deserved for years now.  In this film, he plays his role with wonderful restraint, going for subtle effect rather than showiness.  You can sense that he loves his character and just brings so much vitality to it in every scene.  Paul Giamatti really and truly is a joy to behold when working his craft!<br /><br />Due credit should also be given to Jessica Biel who proves in this film that there is more to her than teen angst or vampire-slaying attitude.  Her performance makes us forget the teenie-bopper roles she came of age in and proves that she is now a mature actress (and she didn't even have to take her clothes off to do it - Anne Hathaway, I'm talking to you, sweetie!!)<br /><br/>Unfortunately, Ed Norton provides another down side to this film.  He lacks the convincing passion for such a character.  Maybe blame should be laid more at the feet of screenwriter Burger, but we just never seem to understand ultimately what Eisenheim's goal is in this film.  There never seems to be any motivation for anything he does.  He just fills in the gaps as a character.  I have read several reviews suggesting that this is an \\"UNUSUALLY\\" weak performance from Norton.  The problem is, I have read that about SEVERAL of his recent films, dating back to THE ITALIAN JOB.  This makes me wonder if anyone can even remember the last time Norton seemed to be acting!?  Was it AMERICAN HISTORY X?  FIGHT CLUB?<br /><br />In the end, THE ILLUSIONIST falls victim to the restraints it places on itself in order to provide a surprise ending.  If the filmmakers could have just realized how obvious their story was, they could have let us in on the secret from the get-go and told a much more interesting story with better character development.  As it is, we have a sub-par mystery movie with little to recommend it aside from the performance of Paul Giamatti.  My advice?  Save this one for DVD and pray that THE PRESTIGE will be the romantic magician movie we've all been dying to see!tie!!) <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Ed Norton provides another down side to this film.

B000GRUS22|4.0|Now, Enigma isn't even close to being my favorite band, but they're my favorite band on the backburner. I know that may not sound complimenting, but it really is. Musically, Enigma holds a deeply special place in my heart, because M.C.'s music has always been there for me when I needed it. I can't say that about a lot of bands. <br /> <br />On first-listen, A POSTERIORI sounded like one long repetitive song, and I nearly regretted my purchase. However, and luckily, I gave it a 100% second chance and somehow the album seemed to do a 180. My favorites so far are \\"Sitting on the Moon\\" and \\"Goodbye Milky Way,\\" because they seem to hold up better as songs and are tighter than others. The first-mentioned song harks back to \\"In the Shadow, in the Light\\" only this time running a little more melancholic in my opinion, while the latter offers brilliant vocodering and an excellent climax. <br /> <br />In giving this album 4 stars, I am not really comparing it to Cretu's previous work, although I do miss the female vocals and songs as overtly passionate as \\"Rivers of Belief.\\" Overal I am very satisfied in having bought this album, and four stars just seems right to me. Let's just hope and pray that Cretu continues to make music. We cannot take for granted his latest effort, or try to disregard Voyageur for that matter.
0596101996|5.0|As should be obvious from the large number of positive reviews, this is a great book.  I've got a well worn 3rd edition laying around somewhere as well as an abused 4th edition I just replaced with the 5th edition.  In short, if you're a new developer trying to get a grasp on serious JavaScript or otherwise looking for a quality JavaScript book, you can't go wrong with this book.<br /><br />If you're debating whether or not to \\"upgrade\\" to the 5th edition, I guess I'd throw out a few thoughts:<br /><br />1) If you have the 3rd edition or earlier - it's a no brainer, this book is worth the upgrade.<br /><br />2) If you primarily use the Core and Client-Side Reference portions of the 4th edition (the last 1/3 of the book) - I'd say its a coin toss.  The layout is a little cleaner and the information is a little easier to find, but the content hasn't changed significantly (as the APIs haven't changed).  Flipping through this section, I did notice the addition of the FlashPlayer object, though.<br /><br />3) If you used the first 2/3 of the 4th edition - the content and layout has changed and new stuff has been added around cookies, client side graphics, and (everybody's favorite buzzword) Ajax.  Enough new stuff to warrant and upgrade, in my opinion.<br /><br />For details on the changes, it would be worthwhile to read the comments from the author.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I must admit that I'm biased because I'm a girl and I associate with Veronica Mars a lot on the show. But this television series is the most well written, comical and touching, dramatic, smart, evocative thing since Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly. I love this show so much, it's the only show on television that I actually watch!<br /><br />Buy these season 1 DVD and follow it up with the season 2 DVD. Then watch the new episodes on the CW channel on tuesdays at 9pm after girlmore girls.
B00003CXE7|4.0|Russell Crowe is well-cast and in excellent form as the Roman legionnaire general Maximus, a well-loved hero of Rome and devoted servant of the aging Marcus Aurelius.  Maximus is not only a great commander, but is loved and respected by his soldiers, and deeply trusted by Aurelius.  As his death draws near, Aurelius entrusts the fate of Rome to the reluctant Maximus, precisely because he does not want the task.  Maximus has no ambitions for power -- he wants only to return to his home and family after years of hard campaigning.<br /><br />The emperor's son and heir, Commodus, however, is not pleased that Aurelius has robbed him of the throne by asking Maximus to restore the republic rather than perpetuate imperial power.  After Aurelius is dead, Commodus quickly moves against Maximus, who refuses to support his claim to be the new emperor.  Commodus' plot to kill Maximus fails (of course, or we wouldn't have much of a movie), but Commodus doesn't know that.  He does, however, succeed in brutally murdering Maximus' family, thereby sparking the unquenchable fires of revenge.  Maximus is enslaved by a former gladiator turned entertainer, Proximo, and forced to become a gladiator himself.  Maximus quickly distinguishes himself in the arena under the moniker \\"The Spaniard\\".<br /><br />Thus Maximus unwittingly is launched on a collision course with the emperor himself, as he is brought to Rome to compete in the Coliseum.  When his true identity is revealed, he finds that the adoration of the people enables him to defy the will of the emperor.  Maximus, then, is the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor.  Throughout this narrative, the noble, pious character of Maximus is starkly contrasted with that of the ruthless, perverse, self-serving Commodus.  Although the ending takes some liberties with history, it is nevertheless a quite fitting conclusion to what is essentially a morality play.  The cinematography is of the highest quality, and the gritty, gory action sequences create a strikingly realistic look back to the days of ancient Rome.  Well done!hy is of the highest quality, and the gritty, gory action sequences create a strikingly realistic look back to the days of ancient Rome.  Well done!
B000HCO840|4.0|Obviously there were a *few* things about this film which were totally inconsistent with the comic books...The Phoenix Saga.  On one hand, losing the cosmic plotline does take something away from the film, as does the demise of Cyclops so early on.  On the other hand, it would not have worked on the big screen.  Period.  It would have taken 3 films of its own to resolve.  Instead, inspiration was drawn from the Ultimate X-Men plotline, and it worked well on the screen.  And it made a lot more sense, to be honest.  Especially to the average moviegoer, which this film was geared towards.  Toss in the presence of \\"good\\" mutants as \\"evil\\" mutants, and some of the other stuff, and the uber-purists will complain.  <br /> <br />Me?  I've been reading the \\"X-Men\\" and all its spin-offs for over 25 years now, and my biggest complaint was what little time Colossus got.  *grumbles*  Great character sacrificed for Halle Berry, I guess. <br /> <br />Obviously folks were disappointed with some of the happenings in the film.  Nightcrawler gone, either to budget constraints or to Alan Cummings not wanting to play the role.  Mystique de-powered, possibly due to Ms Romaijn's hesitance to resign for more X-films.  Cyclops gone due to James Mardsen wanting to move on (which he was grumbling about shortly after the first film!).  Etc, etc, etc.  I think a lot of people are blaming this on Brett, but I'm not so sure it's appropriate.  And they're ignoring the impact some of it had...  Jean kills the man of her dreams, and has to have the man who loves her kill her.  Magneto's most important advisor (and more...?) now taken away from him at the start of a civil war.  Storm having to come into her own as the head of the Academy.  A lot of impact being glossed over. <br /> <br />As an end to the trilogy, I really did enjoy it, however.  It introduced some fresh mutants for later films, gave many of the actors who are tired of the \\"X-Men\\" their outs, and a civil war among the mutant population wasn't a bad thing.  Is Brett a good compliment to Bryan?  Oh, certainly not, and I was a bit disappointed in the lack of additional character development, especially concerning the Phoeniz saga, hence the loss of a star. When the new big bad looks bored the entire time she's playing the big bad, well, Houston, we have a problem. <br /> <br />Action-wise, it was everything I could ask for.  The casting of the new mutants was spot on, and I would certainly pay to see Ellen Page, Daniel Cudmore, Shawn Ashmore, and Ben Foster in a spin-off.  Considering the lack of lines, I was impressed with Omahydra, Mei Marcon, and some of the other \\"evil\\" mutants at least creating a \\"presence\\", and we may see more of Vinnie Jones and Eric Dane (I hope!). <br /> <br />I'd be more disappointed if there is an X4 instead of spin-offs.  Cleaning up X3 wouldn't work too well, Wolvie and Mags are slated for thier own films, Halle Berry is too demanding to be part of an ensemble cast (sorry, Halle!), and most of the characters have been irrevocably changed to the point that they would need another three films to clean the loose ends up.  At this point, spin-offs are a better idea. <br /> <br />As for the DVD, don't waste the cash on the \\"Collector's Edition\\" unless you really want the comic book.  All the extras are going to be the same, and I look forward to the deleted scenes and alternate endings, especially after reading Claremont's novelization of the film.   <br /> <br />Over all, a good last film (hopefully) with its flaws, but certainly a good ending to the X-Universe on film. <br />
0440241588|1.0|The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending. <br /> <br />As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide...
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I happened to see this movie yesterday and I must confess this was one of the best movie. I guess the reason for it could be that I very much identify with the character of this movie. People who believe that they can change the world will love it.Its a story set in 1950s when the women were newly admitted to college. Its about the social conditioning at that era in spite of being brilliant at their studies how they were forfeiting their careers and how one professor with vision make them realize their potential.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although I'm a huge fan of Joss Whedon's works, I never watched Firefly when it was on TV, because calling it a \\"sci-fi western\\" just really put me off.  I had horrible visions of Clint Eastwood trying to slay vampires in space or something. <br /> <br />But it's nothing like that! <br /> <br />Like Whedon's other works, Firefly is funny, unexpected, and will grab you; even if you aren't a fan of his Buffy series! <br /> <br />Firefly doesn't rely upon a lot of technological gizmos to get them out of trouble (unlike Star Trek), they are actually remarkably low-tech - using mostly their minds and teamwork to get out of jams. <br /> <br />You'll laugh, you'll cry...you'll curse yourself for not watching the show when it was on TV, because that you're hooked...you'll want more! <br /> <br />An excellent series, with amazing characters and stories...even if you don't like sci-fi (like my BF, who hates sci-fi and loved this series).
B000GRUMPU|2.0|What a disappointment this film was!  As others have noted, the audience barely gets to know the characters before they are plunged headlong into survival mode by the massive wave that hits the cruise ship. Besides that, the audience is introduced to some circumstances, many of which seem gratuitous. For example, we learn early in the film that the character played by Richard Dreyfuss is gay and is on the cruise to recover from being dumped by his boyfriend. For some reason, the director thought this was important for the audience to know. I can't figure out why, though, since neither this characters' sexuality nor his personal situation had any bearing on anything once the wave hit. Seems like a bit of gratuitous PC characterization to me.  The budding romance between the gambler and the mother is only marginally better.  At least the relationship between the daughter, her boyfriend, and the firefighter (Russel's character) seemed to have a purpose.  <br /> <br />SPOILER ALERT:  Perhaps the worst part of the movie and the main impetus for my two-star rating was the ending.  After all the near impossible struggles to make it to the bottom of the ship (now the top since it overturned), the survivors jump into the water, and lo and behold, there's an already inflated raft right there for the taking. What luck, huh?  And less than a minute later, a helicopter arrives to save them.  This left me scratching my head in utter confusion at first and then angry at the lazy way the director/producer/writer (or whomever) decided to end the film. After having invested two hours in the movie, I felt cheated by the ending. <br /> <br />In short, this movie stinks.
B000HA4W4S|4.0|Granted, Ta-Dah isn't chock-full o'catchy tunes as the first was. However, musically, artistically and technically this one is far superior.  I wasn't impressed at first listen.  Most likely because I was expecting and wanting more of the same of the first.  More chances have been taken here and it works well.  This work shows an enhanced sophistication. <br /> <br />I threw on the Sennheiser HD650's and cranked up the amp. AMAZING!  <br /> <br />Hey Scissor Sisters.....   Oh YEAH! I'm really looking forward to following your evolution as phenominal artists and experiencing where your vision will take you all with your next release.  <br />  <br />
B000HCO840|4.0|I can't believe all of the negative comments about this movie. Everyone keeps talking about the film was not showing good character development. Now slow down and think about it. How many Xmen characters and villains are there? Now how long would it take for the director to do this? I don't think anyone's bladder is strong enough for a viewer to sit through a six hour movie!!!! \\"Enough said....say no  more!!!!!\\"
B000I2IT44|5.0|I am one of the lucky ones that got a \\"numbered\\" edition (1883) from the band. I will get another one from amazon. It is that good. Guess I dont need to tell you what others have said already, but I just want to add a few things like the bonus features in the second disk, they are excelent, like the gavin Harrinson's cymbal. Man, if you were not convinced that he is the best drummer on earth nowdays then that short display of talent and creativity will do it. I have quite a number of musical and concerts dvds but this one tops them all !!!, an I mean the whole spectrum of bands from the past and present time. The British Kingdon has always given to the world the best bands. It seems that these five guys are the essence of skills, talent, creativity, scenery image and more. It is beyond my comprehension why this band is not that famous; my only guess is that they are real musicians who just want to perform music at its highest level of quality; I think of them like a fine classical orchestra who are solely interested at getting the best of the music they are performing. This is not the case with the majority of the musical groups today; they just dont reach the level of professionalism shown by these great musicians. The sound of the dvd is the best you will ever get, ever!! If you think that Eagles DTS dvd was excelent, wait to hear this one. Play in DTS and you would not believe your ears; It was mastered by the same guy who won an award with In Absentia DTS dvd back in 2004. I dont have any complaints of the way the image is shown a la Porcupine tree style !!! <br />Sure, there always are few minor things like why they did not include the deadwing song itself and many others from In absentia but then you conclude should have been a two concert disks instead of one. It is expected that in a few months they will come with another dvd. They should. And one more time, like some of the reviewers said, buy it and spread the word, that \\"THERE IS A DVD OF THE BEST BAND OFTHE PLANET\\" As soon as it is release, please buy at least two and give it as a gift to your best friend or whatever. This is the best musical journey that you wil ever experience. Prepare for it. One word of advise: buy it before you will get none. Run, jump, go for it people, you will never regret a single hard earned dollar spent on this marvel. Cheers.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Having watched this movie several times, I have to say that it still has the same allure which it had when I first watched it 11 years ago. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action or character driven drama. This is, in my opinion, an all-time classic and a must-own movie -  ranking right up there with the likes of Casablanca, Tombstone or Saving Private Ryan. All of the characters in this movie are first-rate and pull the plot together superbly. The authenticity behind the all of the characters and the scenes is very impressive and adds a great deal of depth to the film. It boasts a fantastic balance between action and character development - with the extra time used to really get you involved with the characters and to see what is driving them as people. Some may say that this movie is too long, but it is time well-spent and can be appreciated by those who like to get involved with the characters and not just watch a storyline unfold. I really appreciate how the movie portrays both the \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" - involving both of them in the story. This is truly an epic movie and deserves to be watched by anyone who appreciates a truly great movie. If you watch it once - you will want to see it again.
B00008RWRH|5.0|Haydn lived through the period in time which straddled the careers of brilliant luminaries such as Vivaldi, Bach, Handel, Mozart, Beethoven and even Schubert which is probably why he seems to get little mention as compared to those other greats but make no mistake, Haydn's contribution to classical music is by no means negligible relative to the rest.<br /><br />His life and death was probably the least eventful relative to the rest with the possible exception of Vivaldi which probably makes it highly unlikely we'll get to see a movie made on his life but just listening to the 12 \\"London\\" Symphonies here will make you a believer.<br /><br />Unlike the other box sets issued by DG such as the Mendelssohn and Schubert collections, despite the fact these recordings were made at different times, places and subject to the \\"expertise\\" of different sound engineers, the sound quality of this set doesn't seem to suffer at all.<br /><br />The quality of the mastering is very, very good and is consistently so across all the 5 discs.  Eugen Jochum and the LPO's interpretations of the pieces are also very, very good making this that rare collection that not only has great content, packaging and sound quality but the performances are consistently very good as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B000F4PD7G|4.0|I've read some reviews really bashing this film, but I'm with the majority here.  It was really well done!  The myth and magic is presented very subtly in the film. The locations where it was filmed are fantastic.  It is the best and most entertaining rendition of Beowulf since '13th Warrior' and Hey! No Antonio to wrench the storyline.  Very Cool.....
B00000JAKJ|5.0|This along with \\"Criss-Cross\\" have been roundly acknowledged as among the best the Monk has ever done.  Considering he had recorded dozens of albums, that's no small praise either.  This version of the classic album is a work of art in itself.  The mini-lp sleeve replica is very well done and it reproduces very faithfully the cover art on the original lp release.  In addition, all the tracks have been very well digitally remastered so that the sound quality is really very, very good.  This is by far the best version of this album that is currently out there.<br /><br />Recommended for all fans of Monk and of great jazz in general.
B0000DKQTV|4.0|This is a really nice import set. I have to admit that I really like the concept of it: 1 CD of Best Of material and a DVD with the videos of the same songs.  I'd honestly forgotten how fun some of thier videos from the earlier MTV days really were. <br />The 2nd CD of live material is very nice. Good sound quality with very energetic versions of the songs. The opening track of Calling Elvis is a really nice version. A 12+ minute Sultans Of Swing - how can you go wrong? <br />Definately worth the price in my book as a nice audio and video compilation. <br />Just remember it is a PAL dvd! You will need an all-region DVD player or most computer DVD drives should be able to handle it.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|Apologies to those of you who seem to actually like this film, but when I re-watched it recently after not having seen it in ten years or so, I found it to be . . . well, nearly unwatchable. <br /> <br />What's so bad about it?  Well, how shall I begin . . . <br /> <br />(1)  Sean Connery is a dud.  There can be very little doubt that Connery is THE James Bond, but here, he seems like he's just going through the motions.  To be fair, he had no decent material to play.  The only positives in the performance are the small little touches he puts in to show that he is playing an aging 007; he seems suitably worn-out at various points, and that adds a tiny layer of believability to the character that has never been there before.  But these are grace notes; by and large, Connery is stiff as a board here. <br />(2)  The action scenes are uninspiring.  I'm not the biggest fan of the Roger Moore Bond films, but even the worst of them have terrific action scenes.  Here, the action is strictly second-rate. <br />(3)  Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera, though great to look at, give terrible performances. <br />(4)  There is literally no reason to see this in favor of \\"Thunderball,\\" of which it is a remake; the original remains one of the all-time great screen entertainments, and this remake makes ZERO improvements.  In fact, the plot merely becomes muddled. <br />(5)  There are a series of awful performances in supporting roles.  Rowan Atkinson's comic scenes, though brief, are painfully unfunny, not to mention out of place.  The actor playing the \\"new\\" M is odious; and whoever it is playing Q isn't very good, either. <br />(6)  The music is bad.  The title song is boring, and the score by Michel Legrand frequently sounds as if it came from a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  I couldn't care less that the James Bond theme is missing; it's not what isn't there that's bad, it's what IS there. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, I'd have to say that -- unless we're counting the 1967 version of \\"Casino Royale\\" -- this is THE worst of the James Bond movies.  It's worth seeing if you've never seen it before . . . but that's about it, in my opinion.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|This movie really deserves 3 to 3.5 stars.  But, I gave it 5 stars because you should see it regardless of how many stars people give it.  I would give it 3.5 stars because it is \\"unrealistic\\"----it could never happen in reality.  As you watch the film you KNOW it could never happen.  But, you continue to watch the film anyway!  And you feel \\"charmed\\" by the acting of Sandra Bullock and Keeanu Reeves.  I think it's the acting that makes the film charming----The girl friend of the architect, the boyfriend of the Sandra Bullock character plus the two stars above mentioned.  Then there's the beautiful scenery of the city and the country...and the lake house itself...\\"Who could ever live in that thing?\\" you wonder.  Then the ending is improbable.  But, by then my attitude was \\"who cares---it's a charming film anyway.\\"  I hope you'll look at this film in the light of the above comments.  If you don't take it too seriously you'll enjoy it.  Email:boland7214@aol.<br />PS:  There's another film, produced in 1980, called \\"Somewhere in Time\\"---stars Christopher Reeve.  It also is a love story with a time lapse.  I recommend \\"Somewhere in Time\\".  I almost feel that Christopher Reeve \\"lives again\\" in that film.  Worth seeing.
B000002UTT|2.0|It was this CD that was released back in the late 1980's.  Sure, there a couple of catchy tunes on this disc that were big hits, but to me it sounds like it was all done on a single keyboard.  I guess I just don't get into the all-synth sound.<br /><br />So, imagine my surprise when I discovered that Roxette continued to exist and to grow from this point and to turn out some genuinely brilliant power-pop music with guitars and the whole shootin' match!  The more obscure the Roxette CD is, it seems the better it is, culminating in \\"Have a Nice Day\\" which is virtually unknown in the US and has to be purchased as an expensive import.<br /><br />So, I'm not trying to \\"diss\\" Roxette here, I'm just saying that if you think that Roxette was a one-hit-wonder and this was it, you couldn't be much further away from the truth.  Look and listen to the later Roxette releases and they may just blow you away.<br /><br />And, since you can get this used for less than a buck plus shipping, why not get it too?
B00009V7T2|1.0|I haven't offer reviews before, relying on other opinions to broaden my music horizons.  I just couldn't let this one go by.  This would get a half star if there was such a rating.  No value whatsoever.  Stick to Porcupine Tree, Afrocelt Sound System, Gentle Giant to name a few exploratory groups with talent.
6305428050|5.0|Elizabeth Shue shines in this film.  She plays Chris Parker,the babysitter of Brad,Sarah,and Brad's friend Darryl (Stray Dog). They go into downtown Chicago to rescue Chri's friend Brenda from the wild streets since he foolishly ran away from home.  It's one mishap after another from car jackers hunting them for a Playboy to gang fights on the subway to a college frat party.  The best part of the movie is when they sing the 'Babysitting Blues'.  Everyone needs to see this film.  It's hilarious.
B0000073NC|5.0|Most METAL people will probably say the SCORPIONS suck or that they are GAY and what have you. They only know the 80's material and unfortunately, the SCORPIONS probably do not play this kind of material anymore.  <br /> <br />ULI JON ROTH and his solo band is the only unit keeping this monumental music alive. Mere words will do this recording an injustice. The only thing I can say is that if you are a fan of RETRO 70's heavy rock, then you must seek this and LONESOME CROW by the SCORPIONS, for you would be truly missing out.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I think not. Nor, is he in fact, dead. I loved his masterful portrayal of Darcy, as I have loved everything he does, including Love Actually, but it did not prevent me from devouring this gorgeous adaptation.    To me, Knightley was a revelation, and this beautifully crafted adaptation is a showcase for her genuine versatility. When you can hold your own against a goddess of stage and screen such as Dame Judi Dench, you've got something going on. Likewise, in her beautiful interaction with a superb Donald Sutherland, when she is speaking to him about Darcy's marriage proposal. Both actors are just stunning.    I love this version equally with the Colin Version, and everything from the cinematography to the casting, production and direction all conspire to make this movie a delight for the senses. Being a fan of solo piano, I also loved the soundtrack (Dario Marianelli), especially the exquisite cascading ripples of pieces such as Liz On Top Of The World.    At the heart of this delicious interpretation is Austen's disturbing portrayal of the sheer madness of a blinkered patriarchal society in which females, even brilliant, beautiful and gifted females, could never inherit property. Brenda Blethyn's delightful performance as a mother anxious to get her divine daughters married off, is based on this shameful reality.    Even though I had heard many good things about the Knightley Version, it actually exceeded my expectations by a quantum factor, and I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.
0316172324|5.0|From page 1-100 I couldn't peel myself away from this intriguing concept. Thin slicing is something we all do, yet never realize. Blink shows us what's really behind that first impression, and gives us interesting insight to the subconscious. I recommend Blink to anyone remotely interesting in the field of psychology, or even if you just have an interest in the workings of your brain.
0375703764|2.0|I was really excited to buy this book, having been a horror fan as a teenager. I was looking forward to a book that might satisfy my adult interest in forward-looking literature yet still give me an old-fashioned scare. This book did neither. It is basically an example of media hype and unorthodox writing style serving as Emperor's new clothes for lame characterization and a moribund plot. The footnotes and the pointless appendices only served to make this book even more pretentious. I would have given it an extra star for its unorthodox structure if the idea wasn't basically plucked from the air. William Faulkner wanted to put colored text in his books seventy years ago; it was just too expensive to do back then. Just about any serious writing student knows that story. So what if publishing technology made it possible today? It's not a new idea, and neither is the accountrement of footnotes and appendices, see: David Foster Wallace. The Paul Auster-like logical puzzles of the story are also old hat. (Auster does it much, much better.)  <br /> <br />Basically, this is a book you can say you read to impress that MFA student you have a crush on, but for goodness sake, don't actually read it!
B000GIXEIG|5.0|Yes, I am an avid Gerry Butler fan but I can still think for myself! I have the movie on DVD as well as all of Gerry's movies. This doesn't mean that I'm in love with all of them. As far as B&G I gave this film a  four star rating because of the breathtaking vistas and the comedy. Yes, I said comedy. I don't know if it was meant to be, but I found some parts very Monty Pythonish. I also found some parts quite sad as far as the Troll. He was actually misunderstood because he was different. This is supposed to be what the story is all about. I wasn't happy with the dialog only because and I confess, I couldn't understand most of the accents. I had no problem with Gerry's accent as I'm used to it. He's a Scot what do you expect! All in all I would watch this movie again because I was entertained and isn't that what it's all about?
0393317552|5.0|Before you begin, ask yourself what kind of prejudices you admit to harboring! Are you sure you don't have ANY? Then, give yourself plenty of time to savor each page. Diamond takes a difficult subject and through his talent as a writer, makes it fun to read--in small doses, little stages and with plenty of time to think your own thoughts in between! Well worth the brain power it takes to stick with him.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks has taken the zombie-horror genre and raised it to a very intellectual level. The situations and events in WWZ are very very well thought out. The actions and reactions of individuals and nations make total sense and it is that believability that makes this book so good. What Max tells us about the zombie war is as important as what he doesn't tell us. He gets our imaginations going which makes things extra creepy. This book was everything I hoped for. Bravo Max.
0393035158|5.0|The voice of reason has spoken. Finally someone to comment on such a taboo subject in the most rational way possible. I read this book amazed at the calm and persuasive ways in which Harris delivers his arguments. This book delivers a new perspective on religion that has been able to reach the masses at such a critical time. We're now allowed to question the potential danger of religion, and how it can affect us in the near future; something that is long over due for attention. Atheists and religious people alike are welcome to read and grapple with the blunt logic used in this book, then hopefully ask themselves the questions they find themselves dancing around.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle is a remarkable band -- heavy, gothic, great vocals. It's like the Cure meets, well ... Tool. \\"Blue\\" is perfect. \\"Pet\\" is heavy and creepy. And \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is the most curiously endearing song I've heard in a long time.
B000002U9Y|4.0|Pink Floyd's second album was created during an intense transitional period for the band.  Although musical styles are inherently eclectic, the songs nonetheless tend to fit within two distinct territories: those on which Syd Barrett was present and those which housed an embryo of the band's future sound without Syd.  The troubled visionary plays on only three of the album's seven tracks and is credited for writing only one, being the unsettling schizophrenia billboard by the name of \\"Jugband Blues\\".  Still, while critics either praised the album for its varied presentation or panned it for an apparent lack of direction, both sides tend to agree that A Saucerful of Secrets was essentially a threshold piece for (The) Pink Floyd.  On one side was the band's early incarnation of psych-pop, and on the other a path to self actualization.
0140177396|4.0|Two friends linked together by circumstance and a shared dream, travel the country looking for work as farm laborers.  One is clever, and the other is dumb (but as strong as an Ox).  They form an unlikely bond in an attempt to create a stable life, and a place of belonging. <br /> <br />The book is beautiful in the simplicity of story and message about the need for everyone to belong somewhere, and dangerous in its final tragedy of wasted life.  The friendship between the two main characters may be complex, but the writing certainly is not.  It is just great storytelling. <br /> <br />A quick read with a wonderful understanding of our need to be loved and belong.  The friendship and the heartbreaking conclusion will stay with you long after you have finished. <br />
B00065GX64|5.0|M is a thriller that follows a serial child killer during his downward spiral, mentally and physically, to the lowest level of human depravity.  The killer, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Lorre has lost all humanity and will not stop until he is caught and brought to justice.  And this is just where it starts to get interesting because the police, in their efforts to capture the killer, are putting the squeeze on the criminal underworld.  In response, the criminals join the chase to stop this sociopath and \\"put things back to normal\\".<br /><br />Many of the scenes from the manhunt are just as chilling today as they were when this was first released nearly 8 decades ago. The film was expertly shot and the scene (that gives this movie its title) where Lorrie is trapped is one of the finest ever.<br /><br />While this film was ground-breaking for it's unflinching presentation of a serial killer, it's the relevancy of some the other themes - sociopathic behavior, child molestation, and torture as a means for information or confession that make it seem so current.<br /><br />The film is subtitled and the pacing may initially be difficult for viewers only used to modern cinema, but a little patience will be greatly rewarded.  The Criterion Collection (special edition) is well worth the extra money.  This is a movie that should be in any serious movie buff's collection.
B000H305U0|4.0|In the midst of pedestrian R&B/hip-hop beats that crowd the airwaves, FutureSex/LoveSounds represents a breath of very fresh air. The former boybander named Justin Timberlake just became a man with this record. While 2002's Justified showed promise, it consisted of mainly fillers beyond the single releases.<br /><br />With FSLS, Timberlake teamed up with hip meisters Timbaland and out comes a glorious piece of sensual funk wrapped in hot and titilating beats. Cutting down on the superfluous and obligatory rapping except for some occasional instances is a right decision made. The #1 Sexyback is a good reminder of how funky Prince was and how badly sexy our golden boy can get down to be even the swearing sounds like honey. Current single My Love features a sassy electronic backbeat that creates a grandeur for the song along with Timberlake's trademark falsetto. TI's brief appearance at the end works well rather than tarnish the song as cameo rap always does. One of the best tracks has to be Lovestones/I Think She Knows. Beginning as groovy and funk-laden Michael Jackson-soundalike track, the song plays on for almost 4 minutes before shifting into a invigorating guitar pop with Timberlake relating his forlorness. Then comes ...What Goes Around...Comes Around which also breaks into a Cry Me A River-like end. The gospel-aided Losing My Way relates the story of a delinquent man looking for direction while Until The end of Time reminds of Janet jackson's uber-sexiness ala the janet. album in 93.<br /><br />With FSLS, Timberlake has honed his craft to near-perfection and smoothness, no other male singer could rival.
1400032717|5.0|This is an amazing book.  From the first paragraph to the end, you're both incredibly sad and at the same time hopeful.  I can't wait for the next book by this talented author.
0345410025|5.0|The techniques in this book are amazing! Once you learn them they are simple and yet they work! I am now able to easily remember a list of 50 words in just two-three minutes! It is now several days from my first list, and I still remember it! The techniques in this book work, you just have to stay dedicated to it.
1594200823|5.0|I'm about halfway through this book (I've been kind of skipping around to various parts--which is how I usually read non-fiction books). Modern agriculture, factory farming, and where our food comes from are all subjects near and dear to my heart. These are topics that only people in the industry or professionally trained chefs (which I am) usually know and care about. I don't think veganism/vegetarianism is a good response (and I don't think it will fix anything). Instead, we need to be voicing our displeasure with our dollars. <br /> <br />This is something I wrote in response to Maria Sochor's Review: <br /> <br />Oh sure. Of course, you would take this opprotunity to tute the horn of veganism (which I am so completely tired of hearing about). Incidently, every single one of those studies you noted in your review have their own flaws and biases. For instance, the authors of the conclusions of the heart study failed to mention that the fatality rate was also closely linked to smoking and stress (and everyone knows Dean Ornish is a nut job). Eating meat is not out-right unhealthy for us. What is unhealthy is corn-fed beef and eating TOO MUCH meat. I'm lucky enough to live in Colorado where we have local sources for 100 percent grass-fed beef and BISON. Beef which is 100 percent grass-fed (and never given an ounce of corn) has a nutritional profile 2-3 times better than standard beef, and grass-fed bison is 5 times better than beef altogether (and bison is ideally suited to the American West--they do not need babysitting the way beef cattle do, and bison cattle naturally take care of their own environment). I think Veganism is boring and ultimately not the right solution to the issue of factory farming. I believe part of the solution lies with the consumer becoming more picky about what he/she decides to buy. The markets are flooded with cheap corn fed beef, because we demand cheap beef. If we decide to once-again regulate beef (and perhaps most other meat) to Sunday and Holiday dinner the way it used to be prior to Wold War II, we can then afford the nutritionally superior option of grass-raised meats that do not contribute to environmental pollution. <br /> <br />For those who live in the Colorado Springs and Denver/Boulder metro areas: Lasater Grasslands Beef, Buffalo Groves, and Black Forest Bison Company are our local sources. Lasater beef can be found at all Vitamin Cottage shops (and they ship directly). Buffalo Groves has a home delivery service and they also sell at some of the Farmer's Markets throughout the summer, and Black Forest Bison operates a retail outlet in Colorado Springs. Also, Colorado Elk and Colorado Lamb are also good choices for grass fed meat.
0618164413|5.0|I dimly remember reading the \\"George\\" books years ago. When I saw this collection, I couldn't resist buying it for my daughter.  <br /> <br />In a word, it's wonderful!  <br /> <br />The stories are entertaining, if unpredictable. In \\"Curious George gets a medal\\", he goes from trying to write a letter to 'borrowing' a pump and cow to riding in an experimental rocket. In \\"Curious George rides a bike\\", he goes from riding a bike to making paper boats (I learned how to do it from this book!) to appearing in a circus.  <br /> <br />The drawings themselves are also wonderful. H.A. Rey had impeccable style. And rather than be completely obsessed with the current political 'incorrectness' of showing people smoking or the minimal presence of minorities, I choose to be amused by the perspective that's given of the 40s, 50s, and 60s-it's sort of a time capsule of the period.(similarly, original Star Trek says more about the 60s than it does about the future...)  <br /> <br />Additional material providing the history and origin of George is fascinating- it's a good read for the grownups.  <br /> <br />The binding of the book is pretty durable, although it's starting to show some wear and tear. It's a havy book, but our 21-month old can carry it around.... and bring it to us when she wants to hear one of the stories yet again...  <br /> <br />Maybe that's the biggest downside- your children may enjoy it to the point that YOU get sick of it! <br />
B000059R8Y|5.0|The first time I played Reptile I was disappointed. As an avid Clapton fan this album was not at all what I expected. The second time I liked it a bit more. The third time I listened to it I was hooked, and Reptile has been playing continuously in my car for about 6 months now. What a great collection of tunes! The great thing about Clapton is that he constantly expands the range his music. Devoted Clapton fans need to stay loose and try to go along for the ride.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I liked this one way better than the original. More for my generation I guess.  I did get a little uncomfortable with dancing and the bit of sensuality (I am only a teenager!!) but other than that I really liked it.
B000H5U65C|5.0|It has all been said people.  This really might be the contender for best album of the decade.  It is staggering, amazing and highly musical.  Mastodon really are one of the very few metal bands that are expanding the horizons of heavy music. The climb to the top of Blood Mountain is a journey you will not forget in a long long time.  It's great to have the DVD version as well and see the making of the album.  'Capillarian Crest' is stunning - sheer thrash heaviness with jazz time signatures - I love it!
B0001Z37HM|2.0|i would have liked a more real story in this dvd
B000HT3P7E|5.0|... dodgy info on the DVD.  For starters, why is this a November release?  Should'a been out before the start of season two.  Second, \\"3 discs, 284 minutes\\"?  Something doesn't add up here; by my math, 22 22-minute episodes equals 484 minutes, and is really gonna put a strain on 3 discs.  I hope these aren't flippers, and I'm gonna need a lot more info before I buy... <br /> <br />Suit up! <br />

B000002UA0|5.0|Released on August 5, 1967 (about two months after the June 1 UK release of the Beatle's Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band) this excellent debut featured a heady mixture of experimental and avant-garde tendencies, psychedelia, and lengthy instrumental passages that placed Pink Floyd alongside instrumental bands active at the time such as the Soft Machine (debut album 1968).  This album, as many people know, featured the late Syd Barrett, who was the primary driver behind the Piper at the Gates of Dawn.  Although quite different than the later material that made the band famous, I actually prefer the rawer, more experimental side of Pink Floyd and find it to be a very satisfying example of the proto-progressive rock style.<br /><br />Like Sgt. Peppers, this album was also extremely influential and along with Saucerful of Secrets (1968) provided the inspiration for a great deal of the German experimental rock scene (listen to Tangerine Dream's 1970 debut for proof).  Of course, Piper at the Gates of Dawn also contributed to the events leading up to the emergence of English progressive rock too.<br /><br />The lineup at this point included Syd Barrett (electric/acoustic guitars, vocals); Roger Waters (bass, vocals); Rick Wright (organ; vocals); and Nick Mason (drums).  In addition to the standard rock instruments, Pink Floyd also treated the studio as an instrument and experimentation with sound effects, feedback, and other types of tape manipulation were very much a part of the soundscape.  The playing is also much more adventurous.  In fact, I have to admit that Roger turns in some of his finest bass playing on this album.  His style is very aggressive, features loads of octave jumps, and he generally uses the fretboard more than he would during the rest of Pink Floyd's career.  Of course, the fact that he played a Rickenbacker certainly did not hurt either.  Syd's guitar playing is also very intense and he generates all sorts of otherwordly sounds - many of which sound nothing like an electric guitar.  Rick's organ work also provides another nice touch.<br /><br />The songs themselves are very interesting too and run the gamut from short (and bizarre) songs with frequently shifting time signatures, to lengthy and wild instrumental \\"freak outs\\".  The (approx.) 10 minute Interstellar Overdrive is a great example of this.  The subject matter is also fairly interesting too, and the album lies somewhere in a brambly, dark dimension populated by scarecrows and gnomes etc.  I would imagine that this album may have frightened a lot of folks when it came out - it is extremely intense and fairly \\"intellectual\\" in its approach.<br /><br />As has been well documented in just about every book written on Pink Floyd (for example, see Nicholas Schaffners' Saucerful of Secrets (1991); Pink Floyd: In the Flesh by Glenn Povey and Ian Russell (1997)), Syd Barrett's drug problem shattered his already fragile emotional state and a series of increasingly bizarre actions led to his replacement by Dave Gilmour.  It is worth noting that Syd was allowed to contribute the track Jugband Blues to the Saucerful of Secrets album, although it was to be his last recorded performance with Pink Floyd.<br /><br />All in all, this is yet another amazing album to come out of the heady, psychedelic rock scene as it existed in 1967.  For those prog rock fans that are interested, other exciting albums from 1967 that might prove enjoyable include Days of Future Passed (Moody Blues); After Bathing at Baxter's (Jefferson Airplane); and two from the Beatles including Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Magical Mystery Tour.like an electric guitar.  Rick's organ work also provides another nice touch.

B000GIXEIG|2.0|I had a hard time getting thru this movie. Why on earth was all the bad language put in there. It was just so out of place to see men of this period of time using the \\"F\\" word, and more, over and over again. It just didn't fit. The acting wasnt bad, just the scripts. It could have been a good movie done properly. My impression was Poor Low Budget Film! Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Hopefully I can resell it.
B00005NTJM|5.0|I am a performing musician with some 40+ yrs of presenting music in public. <br /> <br />When I first heard \\"This Was\\" I was blown away.  I think I wore the grooves out of the record. <br /> <br />This work by Jethro Tull is one of their leanest and finest.  It impacted me greatly before I entered music school at NTSU.  It impacted my sense of \\"groove\\" and remained a part of my own efforts to recapture that magic sound they had.  Not that my own work sounded like that, but the feel, the groove and the ambience of the whole LP captured a magical world that had not yet been put in a recording. <br /> <br />So, this record is not only a classic, it is one of a kind.  After this, JT made good records, but I fell away as a fan as they became more \\"commericalized\\" with their themes.  I felt they sort of lost their way from this sound. <br /> <br />Anderson is a consummate musician, with much vesatility and is capable of blending with a number of musical genres.  Musicianship is not in question with him or Barre.  I wish they would go back now after all this time and recreate a visitation to this era of their own music.
0385732554|4.0|The Giver is a book of epic creativity. Lowry offers an indepth look into a society unlike any ever imagined before. Jonas, the protagonist, is a young boy in a colorless (literally!) world who is selected to become \\"The Receiver,\\" or the person who receives the memories of the entire human race. From birth to death, war to peace, animals to gods, et cetera, all is made aware to young Jonas through his mentor, \\"The Giver.\\" Once receiving these memories his world is flipped upside down, and you would have to read it to truly enjoy it's astonishing events!  <br /> <br />Overall, I would highly recommend buying this book. Whether it be for yourself, your child, or your younger brother, I am sure anyone would appreciate the quest that Jonas has to endure in this classic piece of literature.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Finally, 90210 on DVD. It's been a long time since the pilot came out and I am really looking forward to the 1st season and all 9 other seasons. Will be stuck with the TV for awhile.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Someone, quite recently, as well as long ago, said that the film version of the musical was dead. If memory serves, they said it died with \\"Hello Dolly\\" or some such work. Anyone who believes that will need to watch \\"Phantom: on DVD.  <br /> <br />Let me start by saying that while I liked the Broadway show, I was able to see it for what it was: a bit over the top with regards to sets and a stretch as far as some of the choice of orchestrations, etc. So I was expecting pretty much a filmed version of that, much as the film version of \\"Sweeney Todd\\" ---and I loved the show AND the film---is.  Not so. This DVD version will grab you by the throat and not let go until it's through with you visually, psychologically, and emotionally.  <br /> <br />I'm truly amazed that I had not even heard of this movie, until I stumbled across it by accident. The opening is remarkable, with black-and-white footage of Paris and the \\"aftermath.\\" The transition from BW to color is even more remarkable, with camera techniques that are perfect and a set that outdoes the original--if you can believe that. Truly, the set design in this movie is the real star, but it doesn't overshadow the performers or the music and plot. It all works together wonderfully. Visually, this film is perfectly stunning and you'll have to watch it more than once.  <br /> <br />My only concern was with the quaility of some of the singer's voices. For the most part they were superb, but there were a few raggady notes here and there. Other than that, not much to complain about. <br /> <br />Back to why I liked it:  Stunning costumes, sets, and beautiful music (made even more so by better orchestrations---there must be at least twelve French horns in the orchestra on this one) all add up to a great emotional and intellectual experience. The timing is right on, and there's never a moment of bordeom. Suffice it to say that if the film version of the American musical is dead, \\"Phantom\\" has awakened it.  <br /> <br />Frankly, I wouldn't go to the B'way musical another time, but I've watched this movie now, probably, say, five times, and have yet to get bored or find great fault with it.  One of the best.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie turned out to be FAR better than I was expecting. I had heard a bit about it, but I rented it with no real knowledge of what the movie was about or even what genre it fit into. This film is thought-provoking, with excellent acting performances and great action scenes. Hugo Weaving is the absolute standout in this film. As V, he is engaging and interesting. He was perfect for the role and I don't believe that anyone in the business could have outdone him in this role. He delivered in terms of action and dialogue- wonderfully on both counts. <br />Natalie Portman also gives quite a powerful performance. Not to give anything away, the interplay between her and Weaving is excellent.  <br /> <br />The storyline is unique and is done very well.
B000HEWEE4|2.0|It really feels like someone tacked on an alternate ending to please the crowd and otherwise ruined a average/good movie.<br /><br />The photography is very nice.

B00011RPB0|5.0|I've watched this film many times, and it never ceases to impress me. Much has been said about the Western actors in this film, but I want to comment on the Japanese side where the actors also do a magnificent job.  Their portrayals fit seemlessly into the heady milieu of this story. It amazed me the way the film immerses the viewer into the Tokyo scene so realistically, giving one the sense of cultural vertigo. After living in Japan for more than 10 years, I can attest this story uncannily captures the feeling, the sights and the sounds of a foreigner's experience in Japan.      I would also like to add that Sofia Coppola seems to have managed to do something few Western artists could ever hope to do by conveying the character and humor of Tokyo with a story rooted in the Japanese perspective. The restrained romance between Bill Murray and Scarlet Johansen reflects the style of great Japanese literature. While this film is a comedy, its central story is of a fleeting relationship immersed in a sensory whirlwind which is very much akin to the stories and novels of, for instance, Noble laureate Yasunari Kawabata. It is the classic cherry blossom theme, and the symbolism in the film is enough to establish that fact. Coppola has woven the texture of beauty and sadness, of love and fleeting happiness, into the fabric of the film as a Japanese novelist would have. One cannot help wondering how she acquired such a deep feeling for Japanese society at such a young age. Her artistic powers of observation and imagination are proved in this film.    The comedy is almost a separate story from the central love interest and springs from the natural friction one encounters in a totally foreign society. The genius of this film is that Coppola displays what is funny to both sides of the cultural gap. My Japanese father-in-law, normally a humorless salary-man type who rarely smiles, burst out laughing most uncharacteristically when he watched this movie. Rarely does humor cross theboundary between English and Japanese, as almost always the important things really are lost in translation. Coppola manages to bridge that gap with hilarious effect.     I'm in complete agreement with the other reviewers who have praised this film, only adding that Coppola has done more than create a comedic and romantic masterpiece---she actually manages to do it in a Japanese way.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|The Scissor Sisters self titled debut album was an amazing first time effort, worthy of all the acclaim the band was showered with.<br /><br />Much anticipation was resting on this second album, and it has exceeded those expectations far and beyond.<br /><br />The band takes retro styles of the past and adds a modern touch to create a sound that truly only belongs to them.<br /><br />This is a real band, not a studio produced and arranged effort. I saw the band last week in concert, and there is no doubt that these five band members are amazingly talented. Jake Shears' flawless voice has a distinct and unique sound. He is able to hit all the high and low notes without effort and has a sexy stage persona all his own. The band members play increadibly tight, and Ana Matronic is the perfect icing on the cake. On this second studio effort, \\"Tah-dah\\", the band keeps the same feel good sound, and many different genres of musical styles, while adding some lyrics that are at times, a bit darker than the debut. This only adds to the many layers this band has.<br /><br />In a decade that is over-crowded by artists with no soul,creative vision or talent, the Scissor Sisters are a refreshing breath of fresh air.  This is not a band that chooses to play anything safe. And the result is playful, sexy, fun, and not without meaning. Thankfully, the U.S. is taking noice this time around, and they are getting decent airplay on mainstream radio with the playful, fun, first single, \\"I don't feel like dancin'.\\"<br /><br />\\"Lights\\" is an impressive tune, that sticks in your head long after the cd is out of the cd player. \\"Intermission\\" is a darkly comical ditty that gives kudos to something Bowie might have done in his heyday.  \\"Kiss you off\\" is a worthy homage to Blondie and the Divinyls, with Ana Matronic doing lead vocals. \\"Might tell you tonight\\" is grgeous and beautifully arranged. The album closes with the anthem, \\"Everybody wants the same thing,\\" A great upbeat mid-rocker. There is no filler on this album. Every  tune is fantastic. Simply put, this is a steller effort. It is a must have cd to anybod that appreciates good music. It is great to see the band evolve without changing their sound. And for a bonus treat, I suggest getting the deluxe version as it contains two cd's, which include remixes, demos, and suprises. The Scissor Sisters new release, \\"Tah-dah\\" is a supreme collection of music. I think this band will be around for a very long time.m. Every   tune is fantastic.

0307276902|4.0|My mother has introduced numerous authors to me, and I am glad that she has. She has introduced to me to classics, to modern day litature, and some crud books. I learned what to pick from her. I know what to read. When she introduced this book to me, I had no prior knowledge about the author, James Frey. For all I knew, it was a \\"drug\\" book. After my mother had finished it, She gave it to me to read. I was skeptical about it. I felt that I could not read it, because it didn't sound intresting. It was a story of a man that defines rock bottom. He wakes up on a plane, covered in body fluids, and has a hole in his cheek which he has no recollection of getting it. He is then taken to a rehababilitation facility, where he detoxs and thinks about life. He then meets love and finds himself there. It is a uplifting story.<br /><br />Prior to finishing or during the course of my reading it. I found that there were accusations of lying in the story. I was flabbergasted by it. I didn't understand why he would make up stuff in the book, but I got over it and understood that it was a solid story and had solid writing. I felt that the people that blasted it for being fabricated probably read some or none at all of the story. They were probably understandbly upset at his success with the book. I am not blasting them, but they need to open their eyes and read what is in front of them.<br /><br />Frey's writing stylye is highly unorodox for a writer. He doesn't write in paragraphs or is highly detailed. He just is honest and to the point. He doesn't hold back when he writes. Some people might find the story annoying, but I find it original and it helps showcase the conversations which usually are in \\"\\" but not the case in this book. It kind of reminds me of ee cummings and his poetry, but Frey doesn't do the random placement of punctuation. He does get his point, his mood, and his feelings across though.<br /><br />The conteversy of the book has severly damaged Frey's reputation as a Author. He probably is spit on by the other authors for the fabrications. This society is totally obessed with bringing out ONE key aspect of a person or thing and blowing the whole thing out of poportion. Frey is a solid author that deserves another chance. He possibly has helped millons of people with his book get through whatever they were struggling through. It is a inspiring book, that is, if you take off the goggles thrown on by the conteversy and read the book.s reputation as a Author. He probably is spit on by the other authors for the fabrications.

B000FQJAIW|4.0|DVD Overall Quality<br /><br />Disc 1, ****<br /><br />Clean transfer, great sound.<br /><br />Disc 2, ***<br /><br />Old transfer; probably from laserdisc. Dirt and grain pronounced at times, but not overly distracting; the story still pulls you in. Imperfect effects shots are endearing, fond reminders of multiple viewings in the theater. Sound is good, ships traveling nicely back to front.<br /><br />Most important, however, is that the feature presentation on Disc 2 is the original-original STAR WARS. The opening text crawl is NOT prefaced with \\"Episode IV: A New Hope\\".<br /><br />Yes, this reviewer would have appreciated remastered picture and sound from the original source (otherwise unaltered; perhaps for a boxed set once the high-def wars are settled), but the original feature on this two-disc set accurately presents the film as it was seen in theaters in 1977.
B000002MTR|4.0|I'm giving this album about 3 1/2 out of 5. It's a good, solid album.  It's the kind of album you can just press \\"play\\" and not have to worry  about throwing a shoe at your cd to skip a track.    Many songs have a funk feel to them, and many songs are bass guitar  heavy. It's still a pop album though. I did enjoy some of the wit in  these songs and, being Australian, I picked up on Australian references.  Wonder if Flea was pushing those references!    I only really bought this album because the RHCP Best Of compilation did  not have Aeroplane it, and that's a song I've liked when I've seen it  played on music video show. Regretting now not buying the earliest  version of that Best Of, which also had a DVD of many good songs that  don't appear on the CD version of the album alone.    Anyway, this CD is a MUST BUY for two reasons: the songs Aeroplane and  My Friends. The former is a really good song, and the latter is a great  song.    I'll just make a note of some of the things I jotted down when listening  to this album:    Track 1-Warped: sounds a bit alternative, with a hint of Pearl Jam.    2-Aeroplane: I'm not sure, but I think the CD version of this song is  more adult than the video release, from memory. Some of the lyrics are  provocative \\"I like pleasure spiked with pain\\" considering that the song  ends with children singing. Has swearing too. Overall, a good, poppy,  singalong kind of song.    3-Deep Kick: has a spoken word introduction-quite poetic. Hint of Jim  Morrison in this approach. Sensual intro-with whispering. Nice chorus  and melody.    4-My Friends: The stand out track on this album. Some good lyrics-\\"They  want to give her seven years for being sad\\". Features a pretty,  accoustic guitar melody.    6-Pea: this song is a bit of an Easter Egg. It's extremely short, but I  find it a lot of fun and funny. I sort of get the feeling that the lead  singer is perhaps taking revenge on his part, or on the part of all  'artistic' people on childrenwho used to bully them in school or  something. That's gotta hurt a 'cool' kid at school who pales by  comparison against a rock/pop star singer.    8-Walkabout: another song featuring spoken words. Weird guitar sounds  too, perhaps.    11-Falling into Grace: bass heavy song, guitar effects utilised.  Features a buddhist chant and the guitar perhaps mimics this sound too.    12-Shallow be thy Game: a terrific song, lyrically speaking. It's about  the lead singer's views on religious conceptions. E.g it has good lyrics  like \\"Trashing ancient ways is par for the course...you're Hell is  something scary I prefer a loving god...we are not the centre of this  funny universe\\".    The lyrics in the song above are the kind of territory I would have  like the Peppers to have explored more in their career. It's good to  have meaningful lyrics.    Overall, a good album. Good if you like albums that are slightly  experimental and poetic. This album is better than the Pepper's  Blood Sugar Sex Magik in my view, in that it is a solid album. BSSM is  more the kind of album you would buy for just the singles. Maybe the  title track on that album isn't too bad either.    One Hot Minute doesn't have as many quality singles as BSSM, but it  makes up for that in having a very listenable quality which engages you.    P.S. I've also reviewed \\"Californication\\" by this band at this site.
1400032717|4.0|This is a very entertaining book that is very well thought out and executed. The author uses a great many inventive story-telling devices to make up for the fact that the main character is incapable of explaining emotions throughout the story. These work well and never stray into the territory of the gimmick, which could have easily happened. The main character, Christopher, is 95 per cent of the book, and the novel rests comfortably on his shoulders, as we are invited, however briefly, into his world.
B00005JNEW|5.0|This is a well-made movie and true to life in every way. I'm not a fan of cursing and sex in movies, but I must admit that even the party scene in this movie is (unfortunately) an accurate reflection of life in such an environment. I've lived in a small Texas town and can vouch for the fact that star athletes (or entire teams in the case of a winning tradition like Odessa Permian's) are treated as heroes in such places. These towns live and die by their football team, and ex-players who remain in the town past high school love nothing more than to relive their 'glory days.' All of this has already been stated by previous reviewers, so let me add a different twist.    This movie should be shown to all high school student athletes so that they can learn that, while athletics are fun and can be an important component in a person's life, academics are more important and will take you further (yes, I know, there are the ones who do make the big time, but they are few and far between). I am not talking about trying to discourage kids from participating in athletics or quashing their dreams, but I am talking about being realistic and having an education to fall back upon. Boobie Miles, the star running back in the film (and in real life), is a classic example of this. The biggest college football programs in the nation were pursuing him until he had a serious, season-ending knee injury. The most poignant scene in the film, in my opinion, occurs after Miles has cleaned out his locker and is sitting in the car with his uncle. He begins to cry and tell his uncle that he doesn't know how to do anything but play football (Miles was shown earlier in the film having difficulty reading one of the letters of interest he had received from a university). At the end of the film we find out that Miles lives with his twins in Monahans, TX (another small town in the desolate Permian Basin of Texas). Interestingly, although the end of the film tells us what other players - Mike Winchell,Brian Chavez, Don Billingsley - are doing now, no mention is made of what Miles does for living. I can't help but wonder if this is due to embarassment at what he does (though, personally, I believe that if a person is a contributing member of society, then his occupation - as long as it's legal - isn't important).    At the opposite end of the spectrum, however, there is Brian Chavez. As a student athlete he had his priorities in order: he loved football, but he made sure that he also did well academically. We find out at the end of the film that he attended Harvard and now practices criminal law in Odessa. He obviously knew that football wasn't going to carry him forever.    We have seen examples of what can happen to even those athletes who do make it to the professional leagues but don't have any plans for what to do once their careers end (whatever the reason may be for them ending: injury, substance abuse, or simply reaching the end of the line athletically). Former Washington Redskin Dexter Manley stands out as the most glaring example of such an athlete; years after substance abuse brought his career to an early end and poor business decisions left him bankrupt, Manley came forth and admitted that he was illiterate. That says a lot about how messed up our society's priorities sometimes are, and so does the film \\"Friday Night Lights.\\"    Enjoy the film - it's definitely a well-done movie - but don't be afraid to use it as an object lesson for those who prioritize athletics over all else (and if you're one of those people, then maybe the lesson will get through to you). My wife shares my love of sports movies (a rare thing in a wife), but she didn't like this movie because she thought it was \\"depressing.\\" I didn't agree with her that the entire movie is depressing, but I do agree that the fact that there are so many cases like Boobie Miles and Dexter Manley in this country is depressing.
0060763280|4.0|If you are tired of scraping by month-to-month, tired of putting your future in the hands of others, and you want to revolutionize your financial fortunes, by all means, get and read this book.  Part One is a very useful section about your \\"money blueprint\\" -- namely, the way you have been programmed (by parents, society, school, experience, etc.) to view money and why you will subconsciously support or undermine your own success.  Part Two, lists 17 ways in which rich and poor people think differently:  e.g., choosing associates, playing to win, committing to win (rather than \\"not to lose\\"), focusing on opportunities (rather than obstacles), etc. The book has some very encouraging quotes, e.g.:  \\"Success is a learnable skill. You can learn to succeed in anything. . . It doesn't matter where you are right now. It doesn't matter where you're starting from. What matters is that you are willing to learn.\\"  Or this: \\"If you're going to climb mount Everest, would you hire a guide who has never been to the summit before, or would it be smarter to find someone who's made it to the top several times and knows exactly how to do it?\\"  Eker describes his own path to becoming a self-made millionaire (many times over), and how he then started an apparently thriving school in the \\"personal development field,\\" complete with trainers, coaches, seminars, materials and the like. Attitude is certainly a major player, so by all means, put down any resistance you might have and read this book.  It can help you.<br /><br />Two or three things do annoy, however.  The first is encapsulated in this quote: \\"The key to success is to raise your own energy;  when you do, people will naturally be attracted to you.  And when they show up, bill 'em\\"  (p. 10). Fine principle.  However, this book is a study in self over-promotion -- every other page, both subtle and overt.  By the time you are finished reading the book you'll know this one thing for sure:  If you are serious about success, you'll attend the seminars! (Even to question this point is a sign of a negative attitude.) This book is a prolonged advertisement for the seminars.<br /><br />Second, an inconsistency in the book is the attitude about giving and receiving.  Throughout the book, the notion of getting rich in order to give to and help others is stated.  However, on the principle, \\"It's better to give than to receive,\\" Eker says: \\"Let me put this as elegantly as possible: `What a crock!'  That statement is total hogwash . . .\\"  Hmm.  Well then, why get rich to give to others?  Why not just keep it?  Too bad Gandhi and Mother Teresa did not know about this.  They could have saved themselves a lot of pain and trouble. Certainly, Eker is right in pointing out that learning how to receive is a good thing.  But perhaps getting and being rich so that you can give to others does not necessarily mean you actually understand the principle of,  \\"It is more blessed to give than to receive.\\"<br /><br />Third, the book is just \\"a tad\\" too general about the way \\"rich and poor people\\" think. Wealth File #6 is this:  \\"Rich people admire other rich and successful people.  Poor people resent rich and successful people.\\"  Actually, the point is about modeling those who have done it themselves and who can inspire you.  That's a great point. But as written, this is the worst (most damning?) section of the book and in the very least should be scrapped and rewritten. The story about driving a new black Jaguar to a \\"lower-end neighborhood in San Diego, delivering turkeys for charity at Christmastime,\\" with the sunroof open, only to have some grimy looking guys use it as a basketball hoop for their beer cans, actually conjures up a few questions:  Is flaunting one's success an admirable thing?  Is it true that the poor never have good reason to be resentful against the rich?  Were you giving the beer can guys the turkeys?  In the end, who felt the best:  the people who needed and received your charity, or you who wereable to give them the charity as you threw the beer cans out of your Jag?<br /><br />Finally, the notion that the seminars are actually $2,590 and are being given away for FREE (excepting a small \\"administration fee\\" of $97, simply because you bought a book), is just tiring. The opening seminars might actually be worth $100,000 in information, but don't tell me they are free.  How is it that the $97 \\"administration fee\\" just happens to be one of the main pricing point numbers in sales and marketing?  Either make them free or just tell me what the discount is.<br /><br />Despite these annoyances, in truth they are minor.  There are a lot of great and useful things in this book.  By all means, buy the book and read it.  Then go to the web site and listen to Eker speak for yourself. Then go to a seminar if that is what you decide to do.

B000G759LW|3.0|I am a HUGE Christina fan and bought the CD on the day it was released.  While I like it, I'm not blown away by it.  After the versatility and incredible range she showed on Stripped, this was a bit of a let down.  I would have prefered one disk chock full of great music.  Instead, this release has two discs with 6 tracks each, and a lot of what feels like \\"filler\\" material.  For example, the intro on disc 2 which comes out of nowhere and is rather bizarre.  I didn't buy the CD to listen to circus music, and including 3 minutes of it doesn't make sense.  There's also a random song about Christina's disregard for someone she worked with on Stripped.  Again, why include this on a release?  There are a few great tunes, but also a lot that don't contribute to the CD.  And the music is more one-dimensional, with almost every song about finding her \\"man\\".  Stripped had songs about love but also heartbreak, lust, strength, confidence, power, etc.  Back to Basics is a little too basic for me. I wish she had put out one dynamite disk instead of two mediocre ones.
0525946284|4.0|I like Ken Follett, and this is no exception.  The characters are interesting, the story believable, and there are enough twists to make this whole story an enjoyable read.<br /><br />In this book, Follett's villain was a likeable character.  In other books, Follett's portrayal of the villain caused the reader to dislike him.  But in this one, Franck was a likeable villain, and the reader almost cheers for him, especially with his clashes with the Gestapo.<br /><br />If I was forced to criticize the book, it would be regarding the ending.  Of course we know that the good guys win before even starting, but the sabatoge story and the subsequent stories (details omitted so as not to ruin the story), went too fast, and without many things going wrong for the Jackdaw team.<br /><br />But I enjoyed it.  It was an entertaining read.
B000H305U0|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of Justin's music (although I like the guy himself!), but when I heard SexyBack I had to buy the CD.  It is AWESOME!  A great mix of dance songs you can't sit still to with some ballads thrown in for good measure.  I LOVE this CD and have listened to it non-stop since I got it.  It's the best money I've spent on a CD since Christina's \\"Stripped\\".  If you like SexyBack, or dance music in general, you will love this CD.  BUY IT!  You won't be disappointed!
B00004TX5F|5.0|EXPERT FUSING OF TWO VOICES CREATES A SEMI-CASTRATO SOUND!    This film is an excellent portrayal of the famous castrati singer 'Carlo Broschi (Farinelli), whose castration occured when he was a young child, and supposedly was his older brother Riccardo's doing; Riccardo being several years older and more or less in charge of his younger brother as both parents were dead.      It shows the method of castration often used at that time,but there were many other methods also used.  Carlo wows friends and foes alike with his larger than life stage presence and strong, beautiful singing in 18th century Europe. He sings the mediocre opera compositions of his underachieving older brother Riccardo, who rides the coattails of his more talented and popular younger brother.  Although Riccardo tries to prevent Carlo from going to London (because he knows that once Carlo hears the music of Handel, that would be the end for his mediocre efforts).  And that is exactly what happins.  Carlo begins singing Handel arias and the 2 brothers are separated for many years; Carlo actually throws Riccardo out because he finds out that Riccardo had him castrated!    The soundtrack of 'Farinelli', which features the recreation of the castrato voice using a digitally 'morphed' mixture of a counter-tenor (Derek Ragin) with a soprano voice (Ewa Godlewska), was directed by Christophe Rousset, director of Les Talens  Lyriques.  The recreation of the voice of Farinelli, with its superhuman quality was the greatest challange faced by Gerard Corbiau.      There is really no accurate existing recording of the great castrati singers.  One cannot classify the disc of the late Alessandro Moreschi, dating from 1902 as a true picture of that glorious voice described by the listener historians of the 18th century.  Thus the fusing of 2 voices to obtain the vocal range of a castrato (three and one-half octaves).  In my opinion, the whole thing comes together very accurately and pleasantly; and has a great mixture of Handel opera arias.
B000001ED1|5.0|Relish is a masterwork, and among the most complete CDs you'll come across. This highly underrated release is surely in my top 10 of all time. But let's start by getting this out of the way: while One of Us is a clever pop song, it's the weakest on the CD and the only one that requires some endurance on the listener (or maybe it was just overplayed). Luckily, the remainder is a hell of a ride. Joan's vocals alternate between screamingly raw and virginally sweet---she's an actual singer rather than some over-rehearsed scale warbler. Sorry singer wannabes out there---you're simply born with a voice like this one. Not quite Janis, but capable of doling out the chills on various occasions. It's the kind of voice the producer will let go off-key now and then---it's honest and thus still sounds good.<br /><br />What else? Well, Relish has everything, except the lyrics. I'd wager my Martin guitar that the villainous record company vetoed their inclusion due to their darkness. Fantastically dark; very good. For wry, laugh-out-loud humor, check out Let's Just Get Naked. The awesome, mournfully sung Crazy Baby prowls the depths of human despair---he's stuck in it; she's stuck on him. Ladder is sheer female-ality---pride-free devotion to a guy who likely doesn't deserve it. If that sounds like the stuff of an unliberated woman, nonsense---the entire album is an ode to liberation, sexual and otherwise. Right Hand Man--monotonous and grating only at first listen---is pure repetitious sexual gyration, the joyous exultation of a (highly successful) one-night stand. It lends the most moral of offerings: life is meant to be enjoyed. When planted in these fertile soils--free from regret, guilt, self-flogging, and other American mainstays---art can bloom. This is true sexuality, and true art--worlds apart from the painted-on variety of most female singers, whose life experience generally consists of experimenting with untried shades of makeup. Joan isn't classically beautiful, but mando you want to play a hand with her after 40 minutes with this CD. You know she's experienced plenty in her day--it's clear to anyone who's spent a chunk of youth treading these same waters.<br /><br />Every song is well-written, well-performed, well-produced. Its flaw--maybe a crappy cover? And then there's the let-down that follow-ups didn't add up. But this is one that invariably goes in your CD carousel at a party--all substance, no filler. And free of generational musical influence, it's destined to last. How many in the last 25 years can you say that about?

The Director's Cut sheds so much more light on the goings on in Jerusulem then the other version.  It should also be said that with this new light comes a nearly completely different story line.  All of the main events from the original movie happen in this one, but this cut is so much more detailed and far easier to get into than the original version.  I would definetly spend the extra 4 bucks for this version of the movie.

B000E8QVWY|4.0|WALK THE LINE focuses primarily on the early career (1955-1968) of Johnny Cash, Country Music's legendary Man In Black.<br /><br />Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) is raised by an emotionally distant father, an ineffectual mother, and is haunted by the death of his brother Jack in his early teens. Starting out from Arkansas as a ne'er do well, Cash does a brief stint in the Air Force and works as a door-to-door salesman before taking his amateur band into Nashville's legendary Sun Records to take his first steps on the road to stardom.<br /><br />Playing in a succession of honky-tonks, school gyms, and other seedy venues, Cash hones his craft on endless and huge road tours in the company of such other rising stars as Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, and Elvis Presley. His growing popularity with his female fans puts breaking strains on his marriage. Along the way, he meets June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) of the famous Carter family. The two begin a tempestuous on-again off-again relationship that is punctuated by Johnny's bouts of heavy drinking, amphetamine abuse and womanizing, as well as June's emotional travail at being an absent twice-divorced mother of two young girls.<br /><br />Witherspoon, known for her fluffy comedies, won the Best Actress Oscar for devouring the scenery as the deep, emotionally complex, feisty but firm June Carter, who refuses Cash's constant entreaties to marry him, argues him into responsibility, drops him when his behavior goes over the line, and is there absolutely as Johnny battles his demons, kicks the amphetamines, and at last confronts his vicious father. Cash finally walks the line, mostly because of Carter. More than lovers, the two are best friends.<br /><br />Although Phoenix did not win Best Actor for Cash, his performance is on a par with Witherspoon's. Starting out a bit tentatively, Phoenix's portrayal of Cash gains freight-train momentum as the film progresses, until at the end, Phoenix becomes Johnny Cash. His concert at Folsom Prison is electrifying and profoundly real.<br /><br />Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the songs, and do it amazingly well. Their performance reaches its crescendo at the close of the film, when Johnny proposes (for the seventieth time) to June onstage in Ontario, and she at last says yes.<br /><br />Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash remained married from 1968 until their deaths, weeks apart, in 2003. Loving best friends, they stayed together even then.olsom Prison is electrifying and profoundly real. <br /> <br />Witherspoon and Phoenix sing the songs, and do it amazingly well.

B000002G8L|5.0|gran edicion de clapton, inspiracion y polenta, versiones despojadas de clasicos y no tantos.....la guitarra de clapton en esa epoca estaba realmente en forma!
1594200440|1.0|Plot outline suggests an interesting narrative, but does not live up to this promise. Limited character development, obviously hyped up.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|realmente es sorprendente como tamaña coleccion de canciones no presenta altibajos ni baches... como suele ocurrir muchas veces en ediciones dobles donde se advierte la falta de seleccion..aqui el material es muy bueno, con puntos sobresalientes.... el espectro musical es amplio, con referencias a diversos estilos funk, rock, rap, etc.. todos obviamente con el sello caracteristico de la banda: polenta y desenfado. una edicion muy recomendable, de un grupo que parece estar atravesando su momento culmine.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I watched just for the Tim Burton FX, but surprisingly got caught up in the story.Never read a Roald Dahl story, saw a piece of the 70s \\"Willy Wonka\\" movie, but couldn't stay there long. <br /> <br />This movie starts out very cold,dark and bleak (better for the uber-Technicolor entrance into Wonka's factory.) Depp's portrayal is rather unnerving in its similarity to Michael Jackson. Wonka is getting old, needs an heir and wants Charlie to divorce his family and come live with  him in the factory without any other adult intervention. Kinda creeps me out. However, up to that point the movie is quite entertaning and a feast for the eyes (up to the ride in the candy Viking ship it's best), after that the sets get a little sterile. <br /> <br />What surprised me was that Wonka does not like kids; he especially despises RUDE kids (and isn't society over run with these nowadays!!!) Each little rude punk gets punished, but the punishments are not at all imaginative, in fact each one gets more boring. If Burton stayed true to the Dahl book, I wish he could have come with more interesting punishments. <br /> <br />Overall, very good. I started to watch just to see the effects, watched the whole thing and watched it several more times. 4 stars for sets, effects, 2 for story.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|This, simply, has it all - whether you are a casual fan or a more hardcore follower.  I remember watching \\"Live at the Rainbow\\" when it was shown on Nickelodeon back in the early 80s (it was among the first of the home video concert releases.  That was a jewel for me, because it was my first experience seeing Iron Maiden - on TV when I was 12.  I'm more than a casual fan, but not quite the full-on devotee of all things Maiden...and this DVD is everything I love about them.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|Who would have thought? A queen of folk/ country teaming up with a british rocker.Think again!!!!It has happened before,I'm sure.Who cares?What matters is this wonderful jewel gone CD thought up by Emmylou and Knopfler.Consider the marital romp\\"This is us\\".You tap to it as you listen to the borderlinish tongue-in-cheek lyrics.Then you have \\"Donkey Town\\"an unifinished story whose end you yearn to figure out ..Then,the bluesy ballad\\"Right Now\\".Well,just play it and see how wonderful this work is.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album is one of the best in Opeth's carreer. The influence from Steve Wilson is so rich and powerful, the clean vocals and guitar solos are truly impresive and emotional. The Procupine Tree sound is present in the whole album, yet you can feel the true sound from Opeth. Opeth at its best, no doubt. After listening to this cd, you almost forget that Mikael Akerfeldt has the devil inside him...<br />Essential.
B000002J09|5.0|Review no. 930. Originally released to a very deserving and loving public in 1971, as this was of course Zeppelin's fourth record. Eight tracks here,EACH and every one a masterpiece in it's OWN right. Sure, after the first hundred or so times you hear \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock And Roll\\", they may grow a tad thin, but tunes that N-E-V-E-R grow stale are \\"Battle Of Evermore\\", probably FM radio's most requested song of all time \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", \\"Four Sticks\\" and the unforgetable \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" (I've heard radio staions actually play this cut DURING heavy rainstorms, ha-ha!). Anyone who has heard/owns a copy of this CD reissue can tell you that Ked Zeppelin -'IV' is both a music AS well as lyrical classic. Highly recommended.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|This Rockin' Rydell edition comes loaded with extra features, including clips of interviews with John and Olivia on Grease's 1977 / 78 premiere, and the cast's song numbers during the DVD launch party in 2002.  Plenty of entertaining reminiscing from the cast, director, choreographer, producer, and other crew members, as well as videos and stills taken behind the cameras.    The movie is timeless.  It's well-loved by many people I know, who come from different cultures and age groups.
B000F8O2LU|5.0|There have only been a few films like Syriana, a moving no-hold-barred look at the Middle East's position in the world market as the chief supplier of OIL.  It's gripping and a bit tedious at times, but the plot, an intricate tale of intrigue and international double crossing will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br />George Clooney seems to have found his pace in this wonderful study---all of which snacks of the real collision of modern ideas and political positions.  <br />It's the real deal!
B00005V9HH|5.0|Skillful direction, screenplay, camera angles, acting. :-)  I couldn't understand Benicio del Toro's mumbling.  It turns out he did that on purpose, as he said in the special features.
B000AA305M|5.0|There is something very cinematic about David Gray's \\"Life In Slow Motion\\". It begins like a dream drifting back in time - like snow falling on a quiet troubled world (that's what I'm feelin). The next song \\"The One I Love\\" is a poignant love song from the lips of a dying man. Next song - depression - \\"honey lately I've been way down\\". What follows are more songs of depression, desperation, and beauty. What a soulful voice David Gray has. \\"Life In Slow Motion\\" is very well produced - with piano, strings and the occasional well placed synth. It sounds contemporary and yet old at the same time. I love it - I think it's his best album.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|This Version is by far better than the one released in theatres. If you thought that the theatre version had alot of gaps in it than the R-Version fills it up wonderfuly. My complaint about the PG-13 Ver. is that is did not show the lawyer side of Matt Murdock and mainly focused on who killed his girl. The new one makes it more like the graphic novels you read all the time. <br /> <br />One thing you will find disapointing is that this is only a one disc with only 15 mins. of extra footage. But if you have the 2-Disc as well then there is a simple solution for that. Throw away the first disc of the PG-13 and put the R-version in there. Because the 2nd disc has alot of wonderful special features. This is the version that you should have seen if you are afraid to see it because you hated the other version than I understand but you will be missing out on a much improved version.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Fritz Lang's imaginative, awe-inspiring and revolutionary epic is the stuff of legend. It is a film that has left a permanent imprint in the world of motion pictures and has been praised by many as one of the greatest films ever made. The production as a whole with its intricate sets, inventive costumes and state-of-the-art special effect (which were ahead of it's time) are still impressive today, 80 years later.<br /><br />The story offers a bleak interpretation of the future, a society divided in to two groups; the \\"thinkers\\" (the wealthy) and the \\"workers\\" (the exploited lower class). The workers live in underground dwellings underneath the glittering, modern, upper city of Metropolis where the wealthy reside and they work countless hours in order to maintain it and keep it operating. The workers leader, Maria, is their beacon of light. She is constantly preaching peace; love and understanding hoping that one day a \\"mediator\\" will rise among them and unite the two rivaling classes. Secretly watching Maria during one of her meetings is Freder Fredersen, the young, handsome son of Johhan Fredersen, the mastor of Metropolis. Freder falls deeply in love with Maria so Joh Fredersen orders Rotwang, an inventor who has just created a \\"man machine\\", to give the robot Maria's likeness. Joh Fredersen's plan is to set it loose among the workers and have them turn on her. Rotwang, however has other plans and decides to use the robot \\"Maria\\" to destroy Joh and Metropolis.<br /><br />Power, greed, corruption and slavery are the main focus here and are enhanced by the constant use of religious imagery throughout the film. Despite the films age, the complicated sets and backdrops are spectacular and beautiful to behold. From the sweeping views of the ultra-modern Metropolis with its imposing skyscrapers, endless stream of cars and airplanes which fly within city limits to the workers' smog-infested dwellings and the majestic work machines that run their lives to the thousands of extras who were carefully set and choreographed all contribute in giving \\"Metropolis\\" its trancelike quality.<br /><br />After 80 years of mistreatment and mutilation, Fritz Lang's extraordinary, expressionist masterpiece can finally be seen in a restored authorized edition that is crisp, clear, visually stimulating and with very minimal impurities present. It is surprising that they were able to \\"clean up\\" the film so well considering it's tumultuous history and the pain-staking restoration process but fans of fantasy, sci-fi and movie buffs in general should be thankful that \\"Metropolis\\" can now be seen with no blurred images and unsightly scratches. We are able to experience the overwhelming beauty of the mythical sets, the costumes and the surreal, dreamlike images that adorn this marvelous film like no other in recent memory.<br /><br />There are certain films that need to be viewed at least once and deserve to be in everyone's DVD collection no matter what one's personal taste in films is. \\"Metropolis\\" is one of those films. It's bizarre, splendid images of a futuristic society where half of the population is subjugated may be far-fetched (or is it?) but few can deny its utter impact, its grisly beauty, its haunting surrealism that has inspired countless of film makers to this very day and of course, Fritz Lang's undeniable creative genius. This film is a masterpiece of the highest order and one of the greatest silent expressionist motion pictures ever made. You will be doing yourself a disservice by denying its existence.<br /><br />Highly recommended and a \\"must have\\".extras who were carefully set and choreographed all contribute in giving \\"Metropolis\\" its trancelike quality.<br /><br />After 80 years of mistreatment and mutilation, Fritz Lang's extraordinary, expressionist masterpiece can finally be seen in a restored authorized edition that is crisp, clear, visually stimulating and with very minimal impurities present.

0380977788|5.0|This deliciously creepy novella won a well-deserved Nebula award, and is emphatically not just for children. I'd put off reading it, thinking it wouldn't be my kind of thing. Boy was I wrong. Young Coraline's adventures in the mirror-world are the best sort of fairy-tale, lovingly understated, full of archetypes of good and evil. Coraline's other mother -- well, let's just say you wouldn't care to be locked up in her house (said the spider to the fly). I can't imagine there are many people here who wouldn't enjoy CORALINE. Look for the edition with the wonderful illustrations by Dave McKean. My highest possible recommendation.<br /><br />Happy reading,<br /><br />Peter D. Tillman
B000AP04MO|5.0|I fell in love with this movie at age 14, when it played for several months at the Plaza Theatre in NYC, where I saw it no less than three times.  Although, at that age, I was a little confused by the film's structure, in which scenes from four different stages of the marriage of Mark and Joanna, the main characters, are juxtaposed, I did understand and appreciate the film's basic theme, that passionate love is enduring and, seemingly irrationally, can survive even the boredom that is inevitable in a long relationship.  The energy and intelligence of Finney and Hepburn give this quirky little film an added vitality and render the relationship of Mark and Joanna believable and even endearing.  This may be a serio-comedic film, but like serio-comedic life, it is infused with joy.  I loved it in 1964,and I love it now.  Everyone who is a little quirky should buy it, because it captures the essence of something special and a little off-center -- whatever it is that keeps Mark and Joanna together -- that will never be outdated.
B000EJ9MTW|1.0|This is simply bogawful. Annoying vocals (another Robert Plant wannabe --- I've lost count already!) coupled with substandard, boring and repetitive riffs played by a garage band who struck a record label deal.  Sorry, but these rookies are just too lame and pretentious to compare them to any hard rock band who played in the '70s.     Don't waste your money on this garbage and get any CD recorded between 1970-79 by a REAL HARD ROCK band instead. Retro?... c'mmon, this is getting so tiresome and absurd, such as these guys' stupid lyrics. There is no need to cash out on hard rock's greatest era, much less by a low-level bunch of puny novices who are just yelling and starting to learn how to play guitar and drums.    Please save your hard earned money and get the real thing.    (ONE star for the cover art)

B000HEYVD6|2.0|A secret service agent joins forces with a band of conspiracy theorists to unmask a plot aimed at PODUS with nuclear dimensions.  A very mildly entertaining book, with characters that might have been interesting if they had stayed on scene for more than a cameo at a time.  (I did love the bit with the antiquarian book seller charging the villains with his car.)  You can also expect amazing leaps of logic to magically accurate conclusions, generously set off by pedantic soap box oratory on Western Imperialism.<br /><br />Kudos, by the way, for recognizing the undeniable influence of Western colonialism and inconsistent US foreign policy in the Middle East as a progenitor of unrest and violence.  Very true.  Also, the much repeated, but valuable point that western democratic traditions are likely inappropriate and very probably incompatible with the deeply rooted religious and cultural values in many Middle Eastern nations, was also well taken.<br /><br />But the failure of the author to recognize that responsibility for Mid East de-stability can also be traced to local actors undermined the effectiveness of his argument.  Is all the world merely a helpless victim of Western encroachment and greed?  Reducing locals to puppets manipulated by the West is just as demeaning to them as a group or groups of people - and just as inaccurate - as characterizing them as unilaterally fanatical and violent.<br /><br />To sum up, this book is more of a farce than a serious foray into US foreign policy, or an action-packed thriller.  Aside from a few amusing moments sponsored by the Camel Club eccentrics, there was little to recommend the book, and I doubt I will invest in another Baldacci.
B000268QB2|4.0|This is a very good album.  Lyrically, it doesn't do much for me, but musically, it's simple but poignant and says much deeper what the lyrics shallowly convey.<br /><br />\\"Bedshaped\\" is to me the best song on the album.  It took me 2 years to realize this as I initially purchased this album when I was in Helsinki of all places, near the Esplanade at Stockmans.  \\"Everyone Changes\\" was the song that got me into this album.<br /><br />There's a coldness to the sound yet the vocalist has very clear, warm falsetto that at times reminds me of Freddy Mercury.  The music reminds me a lot of Gangway: programmable synths, what not.<br /><br />Update:  \\"She Has No Time\\" is now my favorite song on this album as well as \\"We Might As Well Be Strangers.\\"  They really strike deep into feelings that are desperate.<br /><br />If you don't mind the piano, give this one a try.
B000H5U65C|5.0|I'm not even to sure what to say about this album. Being a fan of Mastodon for years now I knew this would be a great album. Although, I was not prepared for the musical onslaught I received upon purchasing this piece of musical history. Listening to this album has given me and my friends the sense of listening to something that is really important. Not just musically important but life changing important. I strongly urge everyone to give this album a listen. You'll be amazed at what you will begin to think.
B000DWMN2S|2.0|Jonathan Safran Foer's book is a truly literary work and this movie is not a book. And, as many have already said in Amazon's ratings, this movie is not like Foer's book.  It is, unfailingly, cinema and with that in mind it should be judge upon cinematic criteria. Thus, although I will grant the impressive visual beauty of this movie (the cinematographer captures an oddity, serenity, and disturbance) I cannot agree with those who give it high marks.  The plot is sparse, as is much of the character development.  I am especially disappointed with the portrayal of Alex and his grandfather.  I found myself empathizing little with the grandfather or Alex in the movie's final dramatic scenes.  The grandfather's emotional turmoil seems underdeveloped as does Alex's reaction to his Grandfather's action.  Morevover, the parallels between the JSF character and the Ukranian characters seem forced.  The only things they share are contrived connections in the narrative's backstory.  Overall, I felt untouched by this movie.  And one last note, why is it even called \\"Everything is Illuminated?\\"  That title illuminates little within the movie.
0446677450|1.0|I'd heard about this book from a friend of mine.  He recommended it to other friends, and they had a chance to read it before I did.  They also praised the book.  Finally, I decided that I should make time to read it.  What a waste!  I was hoping for enlightenment of some sort since that's the impression that I had gotten from many who had read it.  I read the first couple of chapters, and the more I read, the more angry I got.  The author is great at making money because he has suckers like us paying 7 some odd dollars for the most ridiculous book ever!  He's fantastic at rambling on and on without having a point.  He lays out obvious statements about saving money and making money work for you rather than you work for your money.  Ok, then what?  Do you plan on giving examples to the readers, smart guy???  He repeats the same thing 10 times over throughout the course of 3 pages. <br />I stopped reading the book, and went back to my friend who had recommended it.  I told him that none of the points raised in the book were novel concepts.  We all know these points, but not all of us choose to apply and exercise them on a daily basis.  He thought about it, and agreed with what I said.  To sum it up, if you're trying to educate yourself about personal finance, chances are you already have some idea of what you need to do.  You don't need some guy to write 200+ pages of nonsense to tell you what you already know.  I'd recommend using various money articles on MSN or other sites (Motleyfool, Morning Star, etc.).  They give you pointers, but they make it short and sweet.  And the best part:  It's FREE!  How's that for your first step in smarter personal finance???
0515125024|4.0|As I have said before when doing a review of a Lee Child book, I started with his most recent effort and have been working my way back since. Die Trying is the second book in the Jack Reacher series and not withstanding what some others have said about it, I found it to be very readable, highly entertaining and very good writing. <br /> <br />Other novels have been done about militia units and their paranoia.  <br /> <br />In this case, Reacher is, as he describes himself, \\"an innocent bystander\\" who happened to be passing a Chicago dry cleaner when Holly Johnson is exiting it with a full load of freshly pressed clothes. She is struggling with the nine hangers and trying to manage a cane as she has hurt her knee playing soccer. Reacher takes the cleaning to assist her and the next thing he knows they are surrounded by three men with guns, hustled into a car at the curb and taken away. <br /> <br />Holly is an FBI agent. She is also the daughter of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President's god-daughter.  <br /> <br />You might imagine that her kidnapping rates attention. <br /> <br />The rest of the book plays out as Holly and Reacher match wits with the militia mastermind and the government tries to deal with the kidnapping in a low profile manner. <br /> <br />I found it to be a page turner. I think you will too.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|For an old fashioned contemporary movie with some unexplained phenomena, this movie is pretty good.  For Christian families who care, there are a few references to Jesus (using profanity), and there is some shacking up in the movie...but no sex scenes.  So if you care about that, it is in this movie.<br /><br />Otherwise, the plot is interesting and holds attention most of the way through.<br /><br />It is nice to see Bullock in a movie where she is not acting nutty for a change.  I enjoyed her more on this movie than on any one I can think of for a long time.<br /><br />It's a romantically charged plot with great turns in the 90 minutes.  It's a good date movie.<br /><br />The mix of an architext, a lawyer and a doctor moves the lifestyles up towards the high end of American living.  But the plot kinda demands that so that certain things can happen.  So it actually enhances the movie.  We saw a flaw in the movie....some trees that were planted in 2004 were about 10 years older looking in 2006.  That was not a big flaw, but I noticed it.<br /><br />In my opinion, the final turn in the plot requires some thought to understand the intricacies of what really happened and how, which makes the movie worth seeing twice (per my wife and daughter).<br /><br />Overall we have to say this is the first Bullock movie we have been able to highly recommend in a long time!  Way to go Sandra!
B000HCO8IQ|4.0|This is the best album cut in 1977 ten years too late. But should that stop you from owning it? Heavens no. The Scissor Sisters whup the sophomore slump with an album that is as crisp and funny as their debut. Even as they trot out Sir Elton John and channel Leo Sayer for the first single \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancing,\\" name-check Paul McCartney and cuissenart Abba, The Bee Gees and glam through the whole of \\"TaDah!,\\" the result is purely a band that is more than the sum of its influences.<br /><br />The tongue rarely leaves the high fashion cheekbones of Jake Shears as he chews the scenery and the microphone. \\"She's My Man\\" (\\"with all the balls we need\\") and the Elton John funky \\"I Can't Decide.\\" are snarky double entendres, and the glam-rock of Ana's \\"Kiss You Off\\" is her fab moment. Still, it is Elton that casts the greatest influence on \\"TaDah.\\" Much of the album sounds like it could have been culled from Elton Outtakes circa \\"Caribou\\" through \\"Rock Of The Westies.\\" To the Sisters' credit, they plow into this legacy like they are to the manor born. And you can bet that the darker material on \\"TaDah!\\" (\\"The Other Side\\" - with its \\"I have a right to be loved\\" - and \\"Kiss You Off\\") will be as giddily fun live as the best of their debut.
B0000844MR|5.0|It took an infinity of imagination to make The Dark Crystal, a film so overflowing with invention that you literally have to watch it about 100 times just to take it all in. Everyone involved, from the director to the best boy gave the film such loving affection and made it the best it could possibly be. Kid's movies (if you want to call it that) these days simply are not what they used to be and probably never will be again. This is yet another thing that makes The Dark Crystal so damn precious.<br /><br />The film is set in another world, in another time in an age of wonder. It has been 999 years and 1 year since the powerful, life-giving crystal cracked and stopping shining. Since then the land has become barren and the Urskeks (a race of God-like beings) have split into two separate races, the peaceful Uru 'Mystics' and the evil Skeksis-a horrific cross between bird and reptile. The three suns that shine upon the land are about to line up in a great conjunction that only happens once every 1000 years. If the crystal is not repaired before then the cruel Skeksis will rule the land forever.<br /><br />Jen is a Gelfling (a sort of fairy creature), believed to be the last of his race. A prophecy tells of a single Gelfling defeating the Skeksis and restoring peace to the land. Raised by the Uru, Jen begins a journey to repair the crystal when the Skeksis Emperor dies (in a truly disturbing scene). On his way he meets Aughra, a sort of witch creature and Kira, another Gelfling and her race of Podling people (sort of like Fraggles). Though there is no specific love scene between them, there is a very nice romance developing through-out the story.<br /><br />Filmed in gorgeous locations across England and Scotland (with the use of a lot of matte paintings of course) the film really, really does take you to another world. There's not a single human in sight (a perfect world or what) and, with exception to the awful Skeksis, almost every creature is cute and fluffy (such as Kira's Fizzgig). The production design, in particular the genius contributions by Brian Froud, is so immense and impressive that you wish you could jump through the screen and actually be there in order to appreciate it more.<br /><br />Trevor Jones' breathtaking, beautiful score is among his best work (tying with Merlin in 1998) and is surely some of the best film music you are ever likely to hear. Ever! There was a limited edition of the score put on CD a few years ago but only 5000 were ever printed. It's sure to be quite expensive now but it's so goddamn worth it! Henson, Oz and Froud teamed up again a few years later to make Labyrinth which seems to be more fondly remembered as it's not as sinister as The Dark Crystal and has human actors in it to make it more accessible to those with narrower minds. I prefer this one though (no fruity songs, no David Bowie!) as it has a certain edge to it that Labyrinth lacks.<br /><br />An epic. A masterpiece. An unforgettable classic. The Dark Crystal is magical, mystical timeless classic. I can't recommend it enough. If only we still had movies like this. I'll take risk-taking The Dark Crystal over PC Disney drek any day.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great with a 2.40:1 1080p picture and DTS HD-MA sound.production design, in particular the genius contributions by Brian Froud, is so immense and impressive that you wish you could jump through the screen and actually be there in order to appreciate it more.

B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Although the setting of the story is a little bit overstretched in terms of reality (a whole class of teenagers is punished to take the \\"Battle Royale\\" course of self-extermination in futuristic Japan) the result is a very powerful film which presents the feelings and behavior of ordinary youths put under extreme stress in a fascinating way. There is a profusion of blood and brutal violence in some scenes but the film is so terrific that fixes you in your seat. Expect a big surprise in the finale!
B000005HN6|3.0|I think a lot of people are exaggerating the greatness of this cd.  Twilight is My Robe and The Apostle in Triumph are the only songs that are consistently good.  In Forest of October, I really only like the guitar solo and maybe one other climactic moment.  I feel like some fat could be trimmed off the song.  The acoustic breaks in the first track are also a bit awkward.  They cut off the energy of the piece, so that I don't care very much about what happens next.  If you concentrate on the music note-by-note, Opeth seems really clever, but if I wanted a cerebral musical experience, I'd listen to Magnus Lindberg.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|Denzel Washington comes through for Spike Lee again in this awesome thriller. And Denzel is joined by other A-listers like Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Willem Defoe and Christopher Plummer in this extremely well-done bank robbery movie...seemingly.<br /><br />Seemingly is the key word here. The robbers are trapped inside the bank and take hostages. As the situation escalates, Denzel's hostage negotiator character discovers that, as he says in the movie trailer, \\"this is no bank robbery\\", and the details of the criminal's more \\"perfect heist\\" are revealed.<br /><br />Spike Lee clearly has the talent to put together a classy, well executed action movie, and he will hopefully devote more of his talent to these kinds of films, because Inside Man really works.
B000002U82|5.0|'Dark Side of the Moon' marks the point where Pink Floyd were catapulted from being a decent size rock/psychadelic band with a healthy following, into the realms of musical immortality. This album is an astonishing and groundbreaking achievement in terms of both its musical, and lyrical content. <br /> <br />Musically there is no band that is as mind-blowing as Pink Floyd and 'Dark Side of the Moon' is where they had fully honed their talents. The opening track 'Speak To Me' fades in on a combination of a heartbeat, footsteps, random voices and a cacophany of bells. This heady blend prepares the listener for the eclecticism that is to follow. The song that is perhaps musically the most astonishing is 'The Great Gig in the Sky'. Completely devoid of any lyrics it is given its power and passion by the beautiful but harrowing voice of Clare Torry. This track certainly ranks among the most inspired and breathtaking from the extensive Pink Floyd repertoire. <br /> <br />Lyrically this album is also very impressive with a maturity and wisdom that the band are famous for. The lyrics show a dis-satisfaction with adult life in tracks such as 'Breathe' and 'Time'. Roger Waters reflects and proclaims in his lyrics \\"Run rabbit run/Dig that hole, forget the sun/And when at last, the work is done/Don't sit down it's time to start another one\\". Lyrics such as these would appear to suggest that the album is gloomy and unpleasant. However this is not the case. The musical abilities of the band lend these lyrics a sort of tragic beauty. <br /> <br />Although it is somewhat of a cliche to say that every music lover must own this album, it is also a fact. Such a phenomenal piece of music comes along only once or twice a decade and these days, they appear to be getting fewer and further between.

B000HCO83Q|2.0|Probably not worth buying on DVD, but as a rental (actually saw it in the theater) it is just fine or as my friend would say: \\"fun fluff\\". <br /> <br />Not being a consumer of the comics, I am not prejudiced to what may or may not have been included in the storyline.  As a movie buff, I have to say the effort here was poor to fair.  There are just some things that make no sense.  Why Alcatraz Island?  Why does the winged one escape and only reappear to save his father?  Why ARE their so many characters in each film?  Why was Halle Barry brought back as Storm, at least in a somewhat pivotal role?  Why did the producers even hint that there might be a sequel?  Why?! <br /> <br />To be honest, I only ever saw the three X-Men films because my friend is an X-Men fan.
B000AP04MO|5.0|In this chronicle of a tempestuous marriage, told in a series of flashbacks, that takes place entirely on the couple's road trips in France, director Stanley Donen shows us a  more adult, complex Audrey Hepburn than we usually see on film. She and Albert Finney play Joanna and Mark, a chic British couple, who quarrel their way across France in a variety of wonderful, compact European cars during their twelve year marriage. Since they both take turns driving during the course of the film, it's clear that this is a marriage where no one person is in the \\"driver's seat\\"--this is a marriage that (despite Mark's boorish behavior) is based on equality. The fact that they're usually in tiny cars also signifies the sometimes claustrophobic intimacy they experience with each other.<br /><br /> Joanna and Mark argue their way around a long-gone France, that has little traffic and a bucolically undisturbed countryside. But Mark's an architect with a wealthy French client, whose developments will destroy the pastoral rural areas that he and Joanna equate with the beginnings of their relationship. Both the countryside and their marriage have lost their original purity and innocence. Mark is a blowhard who is constantly making arrogant claims for himself, but he continuously looses his passport, which Joanna always manages to quietly retrieve. She is the one who really anchors his identity, and the fact that underneath his arrogant facade, he realizes it and loves her for it, gives the film its emotional depth.<br /><br />An added bonus is Hepburn's charming mid-sixties \\"mod\\" wardrobe. I particularly liked the  dress made out of what looked like little mirrors that she wears towards the end of the film (how'd she get that in her suitcase?) and the Courreges dress and bug-eyed sunglasses she wears in the final scene. Highly recommended.
0783240236|4.0|I saw this movie again a few years ago and found that I could not view the scenes of the birds attacking the house or the telephone booth.  And the scene with the birds occupying just about every available space near the school yard once again gave me the heebie-jeebies! <br /> <br />I did not give it 5 stars simply because it is starting to show its age.  It would be interesting to discover what someone thought who was seeing it for the first time (an older person, since kids today have been inundated with quick cuts and plenty of action.  This film is not about action.)
068987474X|5.0|This book would have saved me a lot of heartache. Greg Behrendt takes a straight-forward approach in telling women that rejection isn't always a bad thing. Why force a square peg into a round hole? All the excuses are just that, excuses. And who wants a man full of excuses? The scenarios are so realistic, I could swear he's talking about someone I know. This book is very empowering to women. Not only does it help you identify the ones who just aren't into you, it also helps you appreciate the ones who are.

0790729350|5.0|The Summer of 1969 seems a thousand years ago.  I was eighteen years old, had just graduated from high school, was on vacation in Hawaii with my family, and terrified of the draft because the Vietnam War was at its height. <br /> <br />Watching Michael Wadleigh's Oscar-winning documentary, WOODSTOCK: 3 DAYS OF PEACE & MUSIC (1970), on letterboxed double videocassette, I don't know how I survived that Summer of 1969.  For those of us not gathered in a field in upstate New York over one weekend, the movie is a priceless cultural record of an era.  No one got killed, and at least one person was born.  The crowd size was estimated at 500,000, with minimal toilets and highways turned into parking lots.  At one point, mention is made that \\"This is the third largest city in New York\\".  Fences were broken down, so some people got in to the musical concert for free.  People were making love in fields--it was called \\"balling\\" in that long ago era.  There was nudity elsewhere as people washed their only clothes in a muddy river.  Maybe because there was so much drug use, almost everyone was too stoned to be unruly or unhappy.  There was a loudspeaker announcement that some of \\"the pot\\" was bad.  \\"Use it at your own risk, people.\\"  Wadleigh, at least five camera operators, and a huge team of editors (including Martin Scorsese and his future collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker) brilliantly employ split screen to show the crowd trying to get in by any means possible and the owners of the land talking about the kids; their opinions naturally vary.  Certainly, it was difficult to helicopter in medical supplies and food for half a million people.  But through it all, everyone survived and seemed to have an adventurous time.  And now everyone can see it all on home video in their homes or apartments, whether they were there or not. <br /> <br />Originally just titled WOODSTOCK, the movie ran 184 minutes.  But now it is called WOODSTOCK: 3 DAYS OF PEACE & music and runs a whopping 225 minutes.  The 40 minute running time difference is mostly music performances, making this maybe the greatest concert film of all time.  Included over nearly four hours, often in split-screen Panavision and Dolby Surround Stereo, are three numbers by Crosby, Stills & Nash, two songs by Richie Havens, \\"Joe Hill\\" and \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\" by Joan Baez, The Who doing an enthralling number from \\"Tommy\\", Sha-Na-Na doing \\"At the Hop\\", Joe Cocker and the Grease Band, Country Joe and the Fish, Arlo Guthrie, Two Years After, Jefferson Airplane doing two songs not in the theatrical cut, John Sebastian, a song by Country Joe McDonald,  Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, Janis Joplin in a song cut from the original film, and Jimi Hendrix ending the weekend with three numbers (one cut before), including \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" on an acoustic guitar.  It is one mindsucker of a musical lineup. <br /> <br />To especially watch The Director's Cut of WOODSTOCK and in one evening is to be grateful that Michael Wadleigh, his camera people, and his editors  put up with inconveniences galore over this 1969 Summer weekend.  They have captured, now and forever, what one aspect of that drugs and sex era was like for 500,000 attendees.  And they have preserved on film for the rest of America--and maybe the world--what Woodstock was like as a concert event.  Set aside a weekend and watch this almost-four hour musical masterpiece.  (REVIEWED ON LETTERBOXED VIDEOCASSETTE). <br /> <br />
B000G759LW|5.0|Just like one of the songs on her album, she's here to stay! After almost a 4 year break from her last album, \\"Stripped\\", Christina comes back with a vengeance with \\"Back To Basics\\".  <br /> <br />Unlike most pop stars who produce mediocre stuff a year after their last album for the sake of new material, Christina is truly in a class of her own! You can tell a lot of effort went into each track. What's even better is that there's 2 discs worth of material, with great tracks on each. Disc 1 offers her current hit, \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", with it's great throwback to 1940's style jamming done in a modern style. \\"Without You\\", a haunting ballad which showcases Christina's beautiful God-given voice and \\"Here To Stay\\" is a sassy number proving she's no late 90's teenybopper pop star and proves she has staying power. <br /> <br />Disc 2 offers even more great songs. \\"Candyman\\" is probably the catchiest song on both discs, with a great chorus and great beat that's sure to get you hopping around. \\"Welcome\\" sounds like something you'd hear at a circus, with it's great melody and dramatic lyrics. \\"Hurt\\" can be considered the album's \\"Beautiful\\" (her hit song from 2002).  <br /> <br />Both discs are 20's, 30's and 40's-inspired songs that are both classy and listenable. <br /> <br />Next to Pharrell and Beyoncé's new albums, you gotta go pick this great album up now! Christina's come a LONG way from her \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" days. It truly shows in \\"Back To Basics\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw Serenity on DVD and loved it. Only discovered recently that Serenity was based on the firefly series so ordered the complete firefly dvd set, thinking that if its half as good as Serenity it will be a good buy. Just like reading a good book, I just couldnt hit the stop button on my dvd, watched all the episodes at once. The firefly series is as good as Serenity if not better. <br />Casting of firefly is first rate, all the actors were brilliant bar none. The script is also brilliant, rarely does a tv series make me laugh out loud, but I found myself belly laughing many times each episode. The special affects are breathtaking for a tv series, special effects zooming really was a nice touch that takes you right into the action.  <br />I have never been entertained so much by anything else I have seen on screen. Why was it cancelled, can only guess that tv producers put it in the wrong timeslot. It would have reaped millions over time - star trek was slow to catch on when it first started as well.
B000006OAM|5.0|NATALIE MERCHANT's OPHELIA is one of the most lyrically cohesive CD's in popular music today. It features guest vocalists and an incomparable instrumental accompaniment. OPHELIA spans the gamut of joyous celebration to the depths of alienation and depression. The title track tells of a woman who seeks validation in external realities, from politics to romance--only to be left wandering alone in the corridors of her mind. My Skin describes human sensitivity that has been denied beyond the point of endurance. This theme is emphasized in Effigy in which the persona is equated to social self-immolation. Tibetan born Yungchen Lhamo whose cameo sends shivers up the charkas.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002HHB Tigerlily]]
B000063S6Z|4.0|The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it.<br /><br />I needed to hear it a couple times before I saw the composition as a whole. Each trak seems to represent a totally different style from the others. In large part the foundation of the entire CD is grounded in African-American gospel, blues & jazz--and this lends strength to the over all quality of the piece. The themes are love found but lost, and separation from God/lover. Now this might sound intimidating, but the CD is in no way a downer--just the opposite is true. It's like Aretha Franklin--she might sing the blues, but always in an exciting way.<br /><br />The lyrics are minimal in the extreme, many selections having a single line such as, \\"Lordy don't you leave me all by myself..\\" But this line develops beautifully within the context of the song.<br /><br />\\"The Great Escape\\" has several verses, but it too is a simple song that manages to conveys a great depth of feeling.<br /><br />This was my first Moby experience (outside an elevator or tv set) & I was a little sceptical--influenced by what seemed to be an ordinate commercialization of his music in the late 1980's to early 1900's.<br /><br />However, Moby 18 has become a mainstay in my favorites collection.<br /><br />Oddly, it raises my spirts when I feel down.<br /><br />Now THAT'S saying a lot...<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000IPY3 Amazing Grace: The Complete Recordings]]<br />[[ASIN:B0000032VS Queen of Soul: The Atlantic Recordings]]<br />[[ASIN:B00000IFVX Definitive Collection]]
B0000657UB|4.0|This CD is reproduced from the LP of one of the very first folk rock groups that drew directly from English-Irish-Scot lineage. On it is a rousing rendition of the ill-fated & adulterous affair of the farmhand Matty Groves with the Lady of the House; an atmospheric version of the vampire Reynardine leading his victim over the misty mountain; and the intiguing Tam Lin, with a text replete with alchemical-like references. The rock backup music is a bit primitive judging by today's standards, but there's charm in the simplicity. Highly recommended for the folk/ethnic music connoisseur. Oh yes--the bonus track Sir Patrick Spens is a wonderful folk ballad. Sandy Denny's purist vocals provides the perfect delivery for this material.
0393061434|4.0|First of all, I'm one of the longtime Apple faithful, an early Apple II user and an original 128K Mac purchaser. I've been waiting months for this book to be released.    I must agree with an earlier reviewer who felt the book seems to have been written for a younger audience. Based on many, many hours of recorded transcripts and personal interviews, it has a folksy, easygoing style, as if Wozniak is reciting a long story to one of his kids. It's effective, though, because the work is pretty much a long, personal narrative.    Loved the \\"engineer as an artist\\" metaphor. Wozniak's designs certainly rate amongst the computer world's historical best, no doubt about it. I only wish he had touched on the Macintosh vs. the 'bread and butter' Apple II marketing struggle just a bit. Or, perhaps, how a model of the IIgs bore his name and autograph.    Or, after moving down from the hills to a place off Shannon Road, he picked one of the hottest (degrees F) canyon views in the LG area and customized his home with underground children's caverns and dinosaur playrooms.    I quite enjoyed the book. I also understand why Steve Jobs was reticent to pen the foreword, though. He'll never get over not having the ID badge of Apple Employee #1.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Wow!!GNR were terrific. Civil War is their best song they created in history!!! Paradise city is a bad song though. Listen to most of the songs,this is good. <br />
B00004XQP4|5.0|Green Day in my opinion were one of the greatest groups in history! <br />Warning is their best before American Idiot. To all the one star reviewers below known as, STEVE MORSE, PINK FLOYD'S SAMURAI, THE INFIDEL, MR. CRANKY, LED ZEPPELIN ROCKS, SIX SIXTEEN, I don't need your opinion of Green Day. They were the greatest group along with Dire Straits, and Foreigner. Their albums are good. The band that you love like ACDC are horrible. And the bands you hate were LEGENDS!!!!!! <br /> <br />Warning is absolutely the greatest song ever recorded in HISTORY!! <br />Get this. Green Day are legends.

B000HCO8IQ|5.0|Although the Scissor Sisters often get labelled a \\"disco\\" band, their sound is really a little more diverse. Difficult to pin point, but the music of \\"Ta Dah\\" is more like a retro-inspired blend of pop, dance, disco, country and sixties rock n' roll. <br /> <br />From one track to another, the sound can change from The Bee Gees to the Beatles, from the B-52s to Blondie. Lead single \\"I Don't Feel Like Dancin'\\" is a fun, country-disco track, and a great way to kick of a fun album. Other stand outs include \\"Lights\\" and \\"Ooh\\" (which is reminiscent of Goldfrapp). The band also expirements with some down-tempo beats on \\"Land of a Thousand Words\\" and \\"The Other Side\\" and the female vocals on \\"Kiss You Off\\" make it one of the most interesting tracks on the album.  <br /> <br />An excellent follow up to their last album, this is a talented band that deserves to get some mainstream attention.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000FTWB7G|5.0|it's great. i feel it has more depth than Fallen. best cd ever!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|\\"The Open Door\\" is hard to digest at first given that half of the creative team that made Fallen a great album are long gone. In my personal opinion, it was for the better. At first listen, it became apparent that Amy was held back by Ben Moody. While Fallen was more catchy and mainstream, The Open Door is more experimental, heavier and better musically. The songs are more epic and contain a ton of gothic overtones that makes this a album that could be playing at Halloween this year. Songs like \\"Snow White Queen\\", \\"Lacrymosa\\", \\"Cloud Nine\\" are creepy and eerie sounding in a good way. \\"Like You\\" is about the passing of Amy's sister written in a child's perspective. The lyrics, melody and of course, her voice makes this the most haunting and best track she ever recorded. The album kicks off with the heavy \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" which has a very catchy melody but overall it could've been a bit longer than just 3 minutes. \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\", the first single, is up next. Even though that song doesn't fit well with the rest of the songs, its still a great showcase of Amy's powerful voice. \\"Lithium\\" is said to be the next single and I'm positive it will be a big hit. The choir and strings appear once more in \\"Your Star\\" followed by the final rocking track \\"All That I'm Living For\\". Then comes the standout track, the beautiful ballad \\"Good Enough\\", which is the first time in the hour that a upbeat \\"happy\\" song appears. A great way to end this album after all the painful but empowering journey that Amy has been through. I suggest people who did not like this album right away to give it a few more listens to see how great it really is. Amy and guitarist Terry have created something wonderful here and I just hope her fans see that.
1591840562|5.0|What a great read this book is! It can be read just for the fun of understanding Kawasaki's personality, his open approach to business, or it can be read as a primer of how to really start that business. Obviously the man's words are well field-tested and there are many practical suggestions that really cut to the bone and make you stop and rethink a strategy. <br /> <br />But, let's say, you don't want to start a business that requires investors and venture capitalists. Say, you don't have the time, the financial wherewithal or grand plan that requires these things. Then the book to read is \\"Internet Riches\\", by Scott Fox. Let's say you take Kawasaki's ideas to heart and you want to \\"make meaning\\" in your life and/or \\"make the world a better place\\" and increase the quality of your life or others, but you have little money. Should this stop you? Do you need venture capitalists?  <br /> <br />In \\"Internet Riches\\" Fox challenges you to find what makes meaning for you. There are exercises to discover your particular niche, plus many life stories of people like yourself. You can relate to this book if you are in Podunk or L.A., and then he mentors you through all the start up stages. It is very hands-on and a useful handbook for entrepreneurs. And guess what? you can afford to do it. <br /> <br />Taken together these two books are a great complement to each other. The \\"Art of the Start\\" will get you in the mood with great theoretical underpinnings, the \\"Internet Riches\\" shows you how to do it now, with strategic and practical ideas.
1400049628|4.0|I expected to be disappointed with this book . . . but it is destined to be a classic!  And when I read the section on \\"zombie outbreaks throughout history,\\" it was written so convincingly that I actually did a series of Google searches to see what came up!  Apparently, the guvmint has suppressed all mention of these events . . . .<br /><br />My only complaint is that there isn't enough practical information on actual emergency preparedness to qualify as a true \\"survival guide,\\" and there were a few minor technical errors pertaining to tactics and weaponry -- although the average reader would not catch these mistakes, and it in no way detracts from enjoying the book.<br /><br />As one who has watched Romero's 1978 epic adventure, \\"Dawn of the Dead,\\" over 20 times, I liked this book so much I bought copies for friends who I knew would appreciate it.<br /><br />It is a shame that zombies aren't really overrunning our cities, as that would solve SO MANY social problems, and likely reduce the number of B.S. laws on the books (or at least eliminate enforcement of them . . . then we'll all be free to put straight pipes on our muscle cars, ignore the speed limit, and fire our sawed-off shotguns out the window whilst drinking beer).  Here's hoping that advances in nanotechnology or biowarfare will someday go very wrong, resulting in armies of zombielike mutants attacking random passersby in the street.  That'd be awesome!
0761129235|5.0|This book is a valuable extrapolation of the adage \\"By the yard is hard; by the inch it's a cinch.\\"  It uses the concept of Kaizen or continuous improvement via small steps to help people achieve goals.  Maurer's neurological explanations are consistent, though he does not back them up with references, with current neurological knowledge about how the brain adapts to circumstances and helps change behavior, i.e., by taking small Kaizen steps, a person bypasses the amygdala's fight-or-flight response, and allows the individual to gradually but surely progress towards their goals.  This book confirms what other self-help authors have advised - take that first step, however small, toward your goals, and take another one the next day, however small.  You will eventually gain momentum and achieve what you desire.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|Why pony-up for a second edition of an album released a mere six months ago?  Well, for one thing it includes a slew of bonus tracks, all worth shelling out another ten bucks for.  But the stand out is \\"How Can a Poor Man Stand Such times and Live?,\\" a 1920s blues song about the depression by \\"Blind\\" Alfred Reid that Bruce remolded the last few verses to fit the plight of New Orleans.  He posted this song on his website shortly after the original release of this album and it became a big request for fans to get their hands on as well as the centerpiece of his live shows on this tour.  And for good reason.  The song is absolutely brilliant - in sound and lyrics.  It fits perfectly amongst the folk standards on this disc but could also stand alone as a classic rock/blues single on a \\"normal\\" Springsteen disc.  You can almost hear the E Street Band pumping this one out live.  Ditto the still fresh and invigorating tracks like \\"O Mary Don't You Weep\\" that were on the original release.      There is also a DVD that includes the bonus content that was on the flip side of the original album's \\"DuelDisc,\\" plus bonus live performances from the tour this summer.  This is merely a sampling of the whale of a show that these concerts were, but as such they do a terrific job of capturing some of the energy.  Truth be told though, there were so many other great versions of Springsteen classics and other blues covers (like a phenomenal \\"Rag Mama Rag\\") performed throughout the tour that these bonus performances really make the viewer wish Columbia would have just forgone the re-release of this album and just done a live disc and/or DVD.  Any of you who were skeptical that this would be a downer of a show or some corny hoedown sorely missed out.  The show I was lucky enough to attend was a huge party and rocked as much as the average E Street show.  Springsteen put more energy into this performance than anyone could have expected, even by his high performance standards.  He knew whathis fans would want and he did not use this different type of music as an excuse to slouch.  Hopefully Columbia will release something indicative of those shows down the line.  Although, I thought his intimate shows for \\"Devils and Dust\\" were brilliant in showcasing the Boss' playing chops and strong vocals, but there has yet to be any sort of Springsteen acoustic collection (\\"D&D\\" was actually his second acoustic tour following a similar stint in the mid-90s) collection so I won't hold my breath for Columbia to release any of his more experimental music endeavors.    And finally, as many have begged for, this version does away with the \\"DuelDisc\\" format.  Many of has had no bad luck with them, but look at the reviews for the first release and you'll see that a ton of people did.  So here you get the music plus bonus tracks on a normal CD and all the DVD content of the DuelDisc plus the new live performances.  So whether you hated the DuelDisc or just want the new content or both you simply can't go wrong here.    There will be some of you who will write posts here saying things like \\"oh, they are just gouging us for money,\\" or \\"why release this again,\\" etc.  Remember, just because it's on store shelves and is out there for those so inclined to double up or feel the performances and new tracks are worth the money, does not mean you have to purchase it.  It's only a rip off to you if you buy it, otherwise its just there.  And those that choose to pick it up won't be disappointed.
6304754019|2.0|I'm giving this movie two stars because of the supporting actors, and, the book from which the movie is taken.  I believe those are what the rest of the reviews are truely applauding without realizing it. <br /> <br />Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and, seems like a nice guy, but, he needs to figure out what movies he is 'right' for, and, which ones he should turn down.   <br /> <br />Tom, Tom .... that accent...ouch!  Sounds like you NEVER tried actually talking to someone from Alabama.  If you really did...well, honeychil', accents just aren't your thing - don't do no more of 'em! <br /> <br />They should have asked an English actor - they do spot on southern accents.  Maybe, it's time for a re-make with Jude Law.  Forrest was not a handsome man in the book, but, apparently, that doesn't transfer to the screen, so, get a hottie who can do an accent.

Her interpretation of S'Wonderful  is M'Wonderful! Magical.     Besa me mucho is done very uniquely. Didn't think there could be an interpreation after uncountable great ones, that can catch my attention.
B00005221M|1.0|Ok....by now anyone reading this review has read other reviews and is intimately familiar with the general plot of this film. That having been said, I will add my comments not so much with regards to the plot, but on the overall nature of what remains a stereotypical Hollywood feature. <br /> <br />Why is it that every single box-office Hollywood movie that deals with Native American subject matters has to have caucasian actors as the central figures? <br />Take any of the \\"Indian\\" films made since \\"A Man Called Horse\\" in the 70's, and you'll find some disturbing commonalities in ALL of them. <br /> <br />Let me point out a few of these disturbing facts. <br /> <br />1. The hero is always caucasian....though sometimes the actor may portray a native american character, but the the actor is caucasian none the less. I suppose in the eyes of the producers making this junk there are no native american actors good enough to play in feature films about their own history. <br /> <br />2. Real Native American culture and language is never represented as it historically existed. Hollywood changes things so as to make it more \\"sell-able\\" to the masses....who of course are not the Native American people. <br /> <br />3. The leading female role is, of course, almost always caucasian. Again....even in \\"Dances with wolves\\", a movie as relatively historically correct as any ever made, the female lead is a caucasian woman. <br /> <br />Ok....I've made my point.  <br />So, now you see why I don't like this film. Sure, it has a sort of handsome (caucasian) super hero type lead man, a somewhat attractive (caucasian) leading lady, and of course, a few natives...most of whom are not native american at all, to make for a high budget Hollywood feature but that's where the fun ends. <br />This move has nothing to do with the Mohicans who, by the way, are not now, nor ever were extinct. It has even less to do with the French - Indian wars. <br />This movie is a lame love story. The whole plot revolves around this caucasian man who was raised by Indians who falls in love with...hold your breath....a caucasian woman who ever so conveniently falls in love with him almost right away. <br />Aside from that, the movie does not flow and the music is terribly sappy and could have come from any other lame Hollywood feature...strings and all. Basically it's the same theme over and over for 2 hours. <br /> <br />While I'm at it, let me give you some examples of films that perfectly illustrate my point. <br />-Dances with Wolves (the best Hollywood movie on the subject but still very much un-native in many ways) <br />-Grey Owl (this movie should never have been made...it's another lame love story that has nothing to do with Native American history) <br />- A Man Called Horse & The sequel (Another film where a caucasian man is elevated to savior status of the oh so helpless native people...most of whom are actually played by mexican actors) <br />- Spirit Walker (here they went so far as to cast a british, and very caucasian, actor in the lead role. Ironically the role is supposed to portray a dying Indian Chief....way to go) <br /> <br />So there you have it. Even after all these years Hollywood loves it's people....and everything that comes out of it's studios is geared to \\"it's\\" people...even if it's at the expense of an entire races' culture, language and history. <br /> <br />It's a sad commentary as to how Hollywood still views the Native American people. I wonder what would happen if a Native American producer were to make a film about JFK but used only native american actors to portray the main characters? Would such a film ever see the light of day, much less garner 5 star reviews from the public? I leave the answer to this question up to you.....
B000BW7QWW|2.0|Nothing personal, but I cannot stand new TV Sci-Fi. I had no idea what this was, and no idea that this was a TV series made into a movie. How incredibly awful. The actors act like it's a TV show. The script reads like a TV show. And when it's all done, you feel like you were watching TV. Sorry, this is not what the crowd is cracking it up to be. If you consider good Sci-Fi to be movies like Blade Runner, Alien(s), Fifth Element, or Terminator, this movies not for you. If you're part of the new generation of \\"Television is actually good\\", then you can take it. <br /> <br />I really wish they'd marked the box - I would've stayed away. I knew after the first 5 minutes that it was a full step below \\"B\\" movies, not even up to the level of Pitch Black or Chronicles of Riddick. <br /> <br />TV Sci-Fi comes in at C- everytime. This is down there with Laser Hawk, and even worse than Star Ship Troopers II (and that was just awful). <br /> <br />Shallow script, half-baked story, sketchy FX, and poor TV style directing.
B00005B36H|5.0|what can i say about this album. words cannot do it justice and it seems like everthing's already been said before. i guess i will just be one of the millions by saying that this album is a pure unadulterated masterpiece. it gets that claim for a reason. i think - no, i KNOW that in the future this album will be seen as one of the greatest albums of our time... and in my opinion it is the greatest album of my time. this album is a highly spiritual experience. when you're done listening to it you feel like you've just finished a long meditation... it is cleansing. listen to this album by yourself in dark room with a candle. close your eyes and don't think. just surrender yourself, because wants it starts it takes you over and that's all that you can do.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|After watching the deleted scenes from the movie offered on the new DVD and checking out the three optional endings, I've got to wonder what idiots Rattner has working in the editing department. Some of the scenes cut out for the ones we saw in the movie made a hell of a lot more sense than what they put out on film.  <br /> <br />One of the cut scenes is the Phoenix demonstrating her powers in the Brotherhood camp by disentegrating a metal cup levitated in front of her by Magneto, and turning it into a glowing orb that she sends out above the camp as she starts DISENTEGRATING the entire Brotherhood just for her own dark fun and giggles. Why? Because she's the Phoenix and she wanted to, of course! That was a much better depicting scene of the Phoenix than the one with her just levitating darts at Magneto making him almost piss himself. One of the alternate endings is Rogue returning to the mansion after NOT getting the cure after all, saying she just couldn't do it to Bobby, who was cool with that. Another of the scenes they edited for some moronic reason was the fight scene at Jean Grey's house, where the extended cut showed Wolverine shoving his claws into the back of Juggernaut's head and having Storm zap him so it would send the lightning through his claws into Juggy's skull, which was frickin' cool! So many of the scenes should have been left in, because it would have made for a much better movie.  <br /> <br />But instead they went with the sappy feel-good addition that showed the director's, writing staff's, and editing crew's complete lack of experience in putting out a GREAT super-hero film, which this movie could have been if they truly knew what they were doing. <br /> <br />The movie misses the edge that the first two had, the true X-Men film flavor that had been built by 1 and 2. The offing of Xavier (at least until the end of the movie and credits), poor Cyclops (who lasted about five minutes before being killed by his wife), and the neutralizing of one of the best villians in super-hero movies ever in the form of Mystique early on was just poor writing and a BAD script. The same could be said of Wolverine's personality having the edge taken off of it by the script, instead showing us the more softer, compassionate, and emotional Wolvie all the sentimental types have been waiting for... WHAT?!?! Wolverine's personality personified the character in the first two flicks, and they just had to try and change it in X-3 for some reason. You see glimpses of it here and there in number 3, but not NEARLY enough as it was present in the first two. But give the Wolvie his due, because he clawed the crap out of alot of members of the Brotherhood camp as he went looking for Jean, which was just totally cool. <br /> <br />The reduction and absense of certain characters sticks out like a KKK member in Harlem as there was no Nightcrawler, a virtual non-existant Rogue, an occasional Bobby, Shadowcat and Colossus sighting here and there, and brief appearances by many of the new characters introduced.  <br /> <br />On the flip side of the newbies, Beast I thought was played very well by Kelsey Grammar, and Vinny Jones as the Juggernaut was just frickin' cool. His one liner of \\"I'm the Juggernaut, b***h!\\" was just awesome, and really just personified his character to a tee. The Phoenix aspect of Jean Grey could have literally ended that film half way through if she got pissed (or bored) enough, because I have been told by comic enthusiasts that the Phoenix being, entity, whatever in the X-Men comics had destroyed entire STAR SYSTEMS in the past, much less the little thing we call Earth, so the rest of the cast kind of lucked out due to non-aggressive script writing and not following the comics completely. I'm still upset about Mystique being neutralized so early in the film, and then being turned on by Magneto, whom she had helped rescue in X-2 and followed for so long. The term'ungrateful and pompous jerk'does not even come close to covering what Magneto did to Mystique after she was turned human by the cure and he gave her the cold shoulder send off. \\"I'm sorry my dear, but you're not one of us anymore.\\" He deserved the four cure darts in his chest that he got in the end of the final fight scene via Beast for that one. <br /> <br />All in all, its an entertaining movie and worth a watch. I bought it because I was a fan of Jackman's Logan/ Wolverine character, Janssen's Jean Grey/ Phoenix, Rebecca Romjin's Mystique character, and Ian McKellen's Magneto. If you're a purist of the X-Men, you'll be pulling your hair out by the end due to how badly Ratner and his crew messed things up from a plot perspective, but the movie is actually pretty descent. Its a fun ride and a 'good' super-hero flick. <br /> <br />Not as good as it could have been, by any stretch of the imagination, but a good film none-the-less and worth watching. So watch it and make your own judgments... and check out the deleted scenes and endings to see if I was right about how they should have been left in the actual movie, where some of the stuff they left in should have been left out.
B00000K3D4|3.0|If you're looking at this, you've probably seen the movie as a kid or with your children and want to share it with the next generation. So I won't waste your time with a review of the movie. I loved it and bought it to show my son, since I'm slowly getting rid of my VHS collection. <br /> <br />I can't express how disappointed I am that the movie was not cleaned up, at all, for this DVD release. It's grainy and faded. The old VHS copy I have looks and sounds better and it's at least 12 years old and has been played countless times.  <br /> <br />That said, if anyone does bother to show the film some love and clean it up, it'd be nice if they also touched up the few CGI effects (the bubble/crystal ball, for example) in the movie with something a little more current.

B000002JKA|5.0|Masterpiece is the only way I can describe this album! The first few times I listened to it I wasn't instantly blown away, but the more I listen to it now the more compelling it gets. I will not describe each song in detail becausze that has been done already. However, I will say that every song on this album fits exactly where it should be placed on the album, and every song is surperb. <br /> <br />The opener, 6:00 is terrific, which is one of the best opening songs I ever listened to. Even though this is considered a heavy album, it is listenable to the ears of most music listeners. I never heard music with as deep as an emotional impact as I heard on this album. Even though Jordan Rudess does a fantic job on the keyboard I must say I miss Kevin Moore's approach. <br /> <br />If you want an album to cherish for a long time then do not hesitate and buy this one. You will be extremely satisfied that you did.
B0000004V2|4.0|Mike and the Mechanics ushering in the Madchester scene? You must subscribe to Roling Stone magazine, 'lad'. \\"The Living Years\\" was just soft adult fake prog pablum created (or should I say, manufactured) by a bunch of aging second string hipsters with greying ponytails who couldn't usher in their own garbage tin from the street much less a new pop scene. In addition, they weren't even from Manchester, where you had to be from, to usher in the MADchester scene. Get it? The Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses were the real proginators of the Madchester scene. <br />Now, after all that, is the 'Stone Roses' perfect? Absolutely not. At the time it was touted as the best debut ever, alongside the Beatles, which it kind of seemed like at the time if you were 16-18 yr old kid with a good weekly pot allowance. It is still a great guitar album, and still holds up for the most part, but it has gone from 5 stars down to 4 due to some sub par filler which wasn't filler to me when I was that 18 year old kid with a sizable pot allowance! Bottom line, it is a great album by a great band whose flame burned out quicker than their ambitions and a wonderful and important part of late 80's early 90's pop music scene. <br />Cheers \\"Lad\\"
1932907009|5.0|I've been writing screenplays for 8 years now, and after being a semi-finalist in the American Film Institute's last screenwriting competition, and having a major Hollywood agent say \\"you can write kid, and I can sell you, I just need a studio caliber script,\\"  I STILL wasn't able to sell a thing.  Why?  Because I didn't really know what a studio caliber script looked like.  What exactly does Hollywood want?  It seemed that no matter how often I posed the question, all I got were blank stares and shrugged shoulders.  I was ready to give up, until I read SAVE THE CAT! And yes, I'm a seasoned reader of all things screenplay, so I've read Syd Field, Viki King, Linda Seger, Chris Vogler, and Robert McKee.  I suppose I learned something from every book, but NOTHING compared to what I learned from this one. <br /> <br />To say that SAVE THE CAT! changed my life is an understatement.  First of all, it's written by a guy who's made his living from screenwriting for the past 20 years.  A guy who's sold to Steven Spielberg.  For a million dollars.  I don't know about you, but I want to learn from someone who's actually done what I want to do.  Who's done it over and over again. <br /> <br />Blake Snyder's charming and at times \\"laugh out loud funny\\" style made the read a breeze.  In all of the years I've been doing this and reading about it, NEVER has anyone cut to the chase and explained to me why some stories sell and some don't, the way Blake has in this book.  He discusses genre, character, structure, rewriting, selling and everything in between.  All in a delightfully simple and easily understandable format.  He offers short cuts that are super effective and that save time and anguish, and sure fire ways to check your work so that you KNOW when you're finished you'll have a great story and a saleable piece of work. <br /> <br />If you're a beginner, this book will save you YEARS of trial and error.  If you're a seasoned pro, I still recommend this book because it's a great tool to help streamline the process. <br /> <br />Blake Snyder, in SAVE THE CAT!, has not only given me the confidence to move back into the world of screenwriting, which I love so much, but he's also given me the tools I need to create a studio caliber story BEFORE I put pen to paper. Chapter 1 ALONE is worth the price of admission.  It offers a simple method to help you come up with stories that fit the Hollywood paradigm AND it teaches you how to find out whether the story will sell or not.  Amazing!   <br /> <br />I'm working on a new screenplay as a result of this book, and I have no doubt that it will sell.  I've never felt that deep down in my gut before, no matter how many kudos I'd received for my scripts. <br /> <br />Buy this book, you won't know what you're missing until you do.
B00005JOQS|1.0|IT IS SO CONFUSING. WHAT THE HELL IS LEX LUTHOR DOING? WHAT IS HIS PLOT? TO MAKE CRYSTALS TO PISS OFF SUPERMAN. AND IF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE AFTER SUPERMAN 2, WHY DOESN'T LOIS KNOW WHO SUPERMAN IS. IN SUPERMAN 2, SUPERMAN TOOK LOIS TO THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE. AND HE EVEN TOLD HER AS CLARK THAT HE WAS SUPERMAN. ALSO THERE WAS LIKE NO ACTION IN THIS MOVIE. THERE IS THE AIRPLANE RESCUE, THE BANK ROBBERY, AND THE END. AT THE END IT KEEPS DRAGGING ON. AFTER SUPERMAN DIES, THERE WAS STILL AT LEAST FIFTEEN MINUTES OF TIME UNTIL THE CREDITS. IT WAS A RUIN TO THE SUPERMAN SERIES. FIRST OFF, RICHARD WHITE DOESN'T EXIST IN THE COMICS. WHEN THIS MOVIE WAS OVER THE FINAL TIME WAS 2 HRS. 26 MINS. THIS IS A BRYAN SINGER FILM. NOT A PETER JACKSON FILM. IF PETER JACKSON DIRECTED IT, I WOULD UNDERSTAND THE LENGTH. BUT IF HE DIRECTED IT, IT WOULD SUCK. HIS FAILURE WITH KING KONG MADE ME HATE HIM. BRYAN SINGER IS A GOOD DIRECTOR, BUT NOT WITH SUPERMAN. THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A REMAKE OF THE AMAZING ORIGINAL SUPERMAN WHICH WAS DIRECTED BY RICHARD DONNER, THE GREATES DIRECTOR ALIVE. I OWN ALL OF HIS MOVIES. AND SINCE WHEN DOES BRYAN SINGER OVERLOAD MOVIES ON CGI. I WISH BRYAN HAD STAYED WITH THE X-MEN SERIES INSTEAD OF GIVING IT OVER TO THE WORST DIRECTOR BRETT RATNER. GET REAL GUYS. BRANDON.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Disney's 1989 animated film THE LITTLE MERMAID is a very formidable movie, surpassing the combined visual and musical artistic talents of all concerned. Character development is one of the strong points of THE LITTLE MERMAID achieved through concise dialogue, music and simplistic yet effective images. However, most effective to the success of this film are the songs that advance the story line and define the characters. That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman's contribution to THE LITTLE MERMAID. He and composer Alan Menken developed songs that in several minutes clearly define Ariel's reckless but innocent curiosity about the humans above and her yearning to discover that world. Every song in THE LITTLE MERMAID bolsters the depth of the characters, advances the plot or enhances the significance of a scene in addition to being very melodic and well written. So in THE LITTLE MERMAID we are given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time. There is not a single frame of wasted footage in this film. The combined effort is one of a splendid and effortless looking perfect creation of a classical animated Disney tale. THE LITTLE MERMAID has become a beloved film for all of us that ever grew up with it with our loved ones. It brought magic to each of us and that that magic was brought into our families and into our homes and it will remain there forever.
B000GY729M|4.0|I loved \\"Hot fuss\\" and the follow-up is a solid effort. It requires more than one listen in my opinion...and I'm not a huge fan of the Enterlude...but other than that, some catchy stuff.
B000H5U65C|5.0|Someone who has listened to the other Mastodon albums: Leviathan, Remission, and Lifesblood over and over and over, like me, thinks they know what to expect from Mastodon. Catchy and steel-hard riffs, growling poetic vocals. And since they switched from Relapse to Reprise, gaining a much bigger production budget, you'd think the acoustics would sound different, maybe a little less fuzzy.  <br />No, this Mastodon album breaks the mold. Instead of the formula they've established, they tend to a much broader style on this album, with long melodic interludes hinted at by such previous tracks as Hearts Alive and Joseph Merrick from their Leviathan. There are several guest appearances, also a first, from the members of Mars Volta and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age, which lend quite a different edge to the tracks to which they contribute. The volume is turned down a bit, but no intensity is lost, as they've moved from a hard and heavy formula to a hard and varied formula with this entry. Seldom can one pick out a repetitive riff from a song, as they seem to be writing it as they go, with incredible results. <br />This makes Mastodon's second concept album, and this is no less awe inspiring. In fact, the progression of the story is a little more clear than Leviathan, which is nice. Each song rather complements the one to either side of it, instead of giving it a \\"let's try THIS now\\" feel the previous disc had. <br />The sound is still a little fuzzy, but getting better.  <br />If you buy one CD this month, or even this year, buy this one. In fact, buy several copies for christmas presents.
B000021Y77|5.0|`Run Lola Run' is like `Groundhog Day' on speed, with maybe a hit of `Kill Bill, Vol. 1' in there for good measure.  It follows Lola (Potente) as she races to get 100,000 deutschemarks for her boyfriend Manni (Bleibtreu) who is in debt to a seedy gangster with no patience or mercy.  She has twenty minutes to do so and what makes this film unique is that it is very time conscious.  Tom Tykwer accurately takes twenty minutes (or VERY close to) with each of Lola's attempts to save her boyfriend. <br /> <br />Lola's first attempt is to ask her father, a bank manager, for the money.  This goes horribly wrong and Lola is forced to take another route.  She makes a few attempts, and each one explores cause and affect in a strange way, showing the outcomes of everyone involved and all whom Lola interacts with until the film ends unexpectedly.   <br /> <br />The camera style here is great, fast paced and edgy, and it keeps you glued to the screen until the credits begin to roll.  I was also very impressed with the acting on the parts of the two leads, Franka Potente in particular who embraced her character with pure panic and conveyed a very convincing and realistic portrayal of a woman fighting for the life of her lover.  I haven't seen too many foreign films but after this one I'm surely going to give them a try.
B000F4PD7G|4.0|BEOWULF & GRENDEL as the title of this wonderfully atmospheric retelling of the myth is well selected: the usual name of the myth is simply BEOWULF but Sturla Gunnarsson, with the aid of screenwriter Andrew Rai Berzins,  appreciates the importance of the 'creature' Grendel and gives him equal billing.  Not all audiences will agree with the decision to make Grendel 'humanized' (he was actually a giant troll monster in the original tale), but the manner in which this story is related makes this concept of Grendel as a being with memory and feelings more pertinent to contemporary audiences.<br /><br />King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgård) once killed a troll whose son Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson) survived and has been vengefully killing the Danish court of the king to the point that the king has lost all power.  A monk, Brendan the Celt (Eddie Marsan), comes to Denmark (the time is 400 AD) to spread Christianity, baptize the population and pray for the protection of the people form Grendel. King Hrothgar calls upon a Hero in the form of Beowulf (Gerard Butler) who travels the seas, only to be shipwrecked and come ashore with his few men to aid the decimated kingdom and king.  Once in Denmark, Beowulf strategizes his attack on Grendel, the mighty son of the original troll, survives the many attacks that leave many dead and torn limb from limb, and finally is responsible for ridding the land of Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf is aided by a witch Selma (Sarah Polley) who defends Grendel's philosophy: we later discover that she bore a child by Grendel.  After many chases and conflicts Beowulf is responsible for Grendel's death and the kingdom rejoices while Beowulf is conflicted by the fact that he has killed a troll with a heart and soul.  There are many metaphors between Christianity and mythology that are beautifully explored by the story as told here.<br /><br />Filmed in Iceland and Canada the mythic mood of the tale is well served by cinematographer Jan Kiesser and the musical score by Hilmar &Ouml;rn Hilmarsson.  One is reminded of the paintings of Odd Nerdrum.  The stormy darkness of the entire film fits the story well and the actors, especially the always superb and charismatic Gerard Butler, make their characters as credible as myth allows.  The many accents of the actors make understanding the lines a problem and even though the dialogue is in English, subtitles would have greatly helped understanding the storyline as it unfolds.<br /><br />Many people will object to the character of Grendel as extracted here from the original myth, but for this observer the way in which we are allowed to understand the motivation of this rather pitiful beast makes the story far more poignant.  The added features on the DVD include  Gerard Butler discussing his role and his decision to accept the Beowulf persona.  And equally as interesting is a behind the scenes track that demonstrates the difficulties in filming a story in rugged terrain.  In all this is a visually stunning, emotionally moving film well worth the attention of the audience.  Grady Harp, October 06er and the musical score by Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson.

B000FTWB7G|4.0|The first song I heard of course was Call Me When You're Sober and quite frankly I was not too fond of it but I did not panic because it still had that amazing Evanescence sound but the lyrics well to me were not as Evanescence as I am use to but thankfully this song is not a good representation of the rest of the album.  It does not surprise me that its the first single because it will appeal to other not so big Evanescence fans.   <br /> <br />I have Origin, Fallen, and the EPs and this album still sounds Evanescence but is it not missing something?  At first I could not put my finger on it but the reason why I like Evanescence so much is because they put this other worldlyness to most of their songs especially in Fallen.  This album is really good and I cant stop listening to it, but it seems to be ment for people to relate to it in a specfic way which can be found in so many pop songs elsewhere.  With previous Evanescence music the meaning is unclear and anyone can relate to it in their own way but lines like Call Me When You Are Sober are way too specific. <br /> <br />I still love this album because I love the music and even though the songs have a different meaning this time, Amy Lee still puts it in that poetic way I am used to.  Most songs are garbage without the music and the good thing about Evanescence is that their lyrics are sooo poetic and can stand by themselves.  There was some sentuality to this album too which I have heard with them before but here it comes out more than usual and I thought this band was trying to get away from that mainstream theme thing but thankfully its nothing like the overtness and inappropriateness of the mainstream.   <br /> <br />I know I sound like I hate this album but I dont, I love Evanescence to pieces and that is why I had such high expectations because their songs never bore my like other music.  I love this album but I still have to get used to which for me was not the case with Fallen which I fell completely in love with in one listen and I thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever heard in my short life.  Yes this album is a bit different for but at least it did not disapoint me to tears it was more like an \\"oh okay\\" and that is good because they cant stay the same or it will be boring and I am sure that in the future they will continue to change the types of depth they have while still retaining their originalness (not with capital O) and their unusalness to the mainstream which is why they will never fade away. <br /> <br />So yeah I recomend this album to all fans and non-fans and prepare to take a journey of epic proportions.  Which reminds me I was probably thinking The Open Door would have a Narniaish feel to it.  Is it true Evanescence made music for Narnia but it was turned down?  The soundtrack and chorus are great but the songs with words in them are nowhere near as good as Evanescence would have made them.  If they would have made the music for Narnia I am sure the movie would of had a bigger impact since is was already a great movie.
B000HCO840|1.0|Thank God he left the Superman Returns film, but why oh why did he have to go and RUIN this last installment of the X-Men Series????  It's not that I'm comparing him to Bryan Singer at all. It's just that he's a sub-par director that does NOT have the talent to make movies any better than \\"Family Man\\".  A director of this low caliber simply cannot follow-up on the work of a genius like Bryan Singer. That said, if you like over acting, zero character development and pacing that makes no sense whatsoever after the opening sequence, by all means watch this film! But alas, I will be passing this up and spending my hard earned cash on \\"Superman Returns\\".

0307341542|5.0|Sharp Objects is a breathtaking, suspenseful, beautifully crafted novel. Not exactly a mystery, not exactly a thriller, not exactly horror, the novel has bits of all of them, and fine writing rarely associated with popular fiction.  <br /> <br />It's hard to say too much about the novel without giving anything away, but one thing that especially impressed me is the twist Flynn puts on the classic \\"don't open that door!\\" moment in books and movies. You know - when we know something bad will happen if the door is opened, but the dumb character does it anyway. Well, here the protagonist is not dumb; she knows along with us what is being revealed and share our sense of impending doom - but cannot help but open the door even so. Brilliant!
B000F8O35U|5.0|After two decades of inexorable decline, Disney animation took the giant leap into its renaissance with the story and songs of the beautiful, beloved teenaged mermaid Ariel. The magical combination of the fresh and fun Ashman/Menken songs, the gracefully characterized animation of Glenn Keane, the charming vocal performances (especially of Jodi Benson as Ariel and Samuel Wright as Sebastian) and the compelling coming-of-age storytelling became the template for a decade of lucrative blockbusters.<br /><br />The success of \\"Little Mermaid\\" let its creators dare to dream big and the Best Picture-nominated \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" could never has existed without it. I can't wait to see this newly restored edition of the one that started it all.
0743454529|4.0|A cousin of mine --and a survivor-- who has experienced cancer in her own family several times over (herself, her husband, her daughter) once said to me, \\"Cancer consumes the whole family's life--not just the patient's.\\"  My Sister's Keeper, aside from raising important ethical questions, certainly shows just that. Throughout, I found my judgmental attitude toward various family members turning sympathetic and then back again.  This is a compelling story that raises lots of questions but no  comforting assurance of correct answers.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Anyone to slam this album either caught on to Evanescence from the radio and was attached to Fallen, or has no idea of where the band is coming from. This time around there is more artistic freedom, more depth than Fallen, less pretense, and any real fan of Evanescence can listen to this album and love it, because it is simply evolution. I wish this album was Evanescence's breakout hit because it would have given them so much more credibility and respect. <br /> <br />Buy this album... <br /> <br />If you love Origin and Fallen, this album has a mix of both, with more maturity and a broader writing subject...There is more choral arrangements, more dreamlike sounds...but The Open Door still retains the hardness from Fallen. I love it. I understand at first listen The Open Door sounds very different, but you need to listen to it for a few days and then you'll start to get into each song and hear it for what it is.
B000GY729M|4.0|Just like everyone else, I've been anticipating this release for quite a while now,  but unlike most other people, my first opinion of this record is actually a positive one.  Yeah, they've kinda ditched the 80's synth sound that helped make \\"Hot Fuss\\" such a hit, but too me, it's still the Killers.  It's still catchy and still has great melodies.  It's just more \\"raw\\" i suppose and carries much more of a \\"fresh\\" sound.  Too me, these are all good things.  Don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed \\"Hot Fuss\\" just as much as the rest of you, but to expect musicians not to evolve and develop their sound is unreasonable.  If you are only going to be happy with more Hot Fuss, maybe this ablum is not for you, but if you enjoy the Killers sound and crave something new, by all means, give this record a try!  They are still a great band and, in my opinion, will continue to be for years to come.  This album shows a band maturing and finding themselves.  Don't listen to it once and give up on it.  Long live the Killers!
B00005NGAL|5.0|It's kind of funny... I guess I have a different perspective on this.  I remember playing the music from selections from Cats... from Memories... to Skimbleshanks, The Railway Cat... to Old Deuteronomy's music. <br /> <br />When I saw this online, I decided to purchase the DVD... and absolutely loved it. <br /> <br />Then I went to see this live at the theater.  As interesting as this was in real life, I actually honestly preferred the DVD.  I was comparing the actors on stage to the actors on the DVD.  Only two of the live actors even came close to the performance of the folks on the DVD (one being Grisabella and the other being Old Deuteronomy). <br /> <br />I actually feel like the DVD ruined me for the live show.  Five stars, without a doubt.
B000FVQM2Y|1.0|I never write reviews unless I feel pretty strongly. I made it 3/4 the way through this movie (would have stopped earlier, but I thought it had to get better) and had to shut it off.  It was trying to be new and different, but just ended up to be cheezy and boring.  Maybe I just didn't 'get it', but I think a lot of people may not then.
0066620996|5.0|Mr. Collins has done a fantastic job analyzing how good companies have and can become great.  <br /> <br />His analysis is very well done for corporation but what about non-profit organizations? For that I highly recommend Collins's Good to Great and the Social Sectors: A Monograph to Accompany Good to Great. It spells out how you can apply the same principles, with minor variation, and achieve great results. He gives several case studies and success stories in this category. Quite interesting!
0618680004|4.0|If God does not exist, it would be a cruel irony that mankind has evolved to the point where it can comprehend its own aimless existance-- only able to invent a moral purpose of its own, given none conferred on it externally.  But if God does exist-- how does He *know* He's God?  Maybe He just *thinks* He's God-- a mere megalomaniacal inmate of some cosmic asylum?  Even if the omniscient truly knows all there is to know-- such a one still cannot rule out the possibility that there is something outside its ability to perceive and therefore potentially subject to an even greater external moral purpose (however mysterious).  What could possibly be more utterly fantastic, more completely *unbelievable* than an invisible, mysterious super-being?  Is one to be held accountable to such patently unbelievable entities?     No, ALL are left to invent their moral purpose, Gods and mankind alike, as the alternative is to abdicate the responsibility for it in deferring to a phantom superior.  A daunting responsibility no doubt, considerably more difficult to think through, than is simply accepting someone else's conveniently packaged and marketed solution.      Dawkins does a pretty good job of covering the bases. I have two disagreements with him-- first, is when he suggests that God could prove his existance if he so chose by putting in an appearance. My disagreement with that is that there is nothing that God could actually do that could prove that he's actually God, either to us or himself. For us, no matter what magical prestidigitation might ensue, a simpler explanation would be an alien with a holographic projector of some kind, or some other advanced technology ala Arthur C. For God, he cannot prove a being that oversees even him does not exist, and therefore he may not in fact be the ultimate uberbeing. Even God cannot prove for certain that he is not a brain in a vat, or logical equivalent.  Therefore, even God cannot insure he has the moral authority to rule over us--at best, just the power.  And thus, the best reason to disbelieve in God is not in even covered in Dawkins' book, and that is that a coherent definition is lacking.    Second, Dawkins could do a better job of addressing those outside the atheist choir. Unfortunately, right off the bat, Chapter 2 starts with a laundry list diatribe that essentially says \\"I don't like the Christian God because [he sucks].\\" And then refers to the \\"insipidly opposite\\" Jesus. Few Christians will make it past those two paragraphs, I suspect, and it is therefore unfortunate they occur so early in the book, if at all. While I tend to agree with his characterization, it makes a piss poor sales presentation. He need not water down his points, just relate them in a somewhat less inflammatory manner, which in fact he does pretty well for most of the rest of the book.    The remainder of the book thus was somewhat a letdown once realizing that few Christians will actually make it that far, and they are the ones who really need to \\"get\\" the points. I enjoyed his points, but for the most part already agree with them-- I'm not someone he needs to convince. Chapter 5, \\"The Roots of Religion\\" had some particularly interesting ideas regarding religion as a by-product of something else, though it's clear further thought needs to be done in this area. Chapter 6, \\"Roots of Morality\\" should be required reading in school.
0141301120|4.0|This was a really odd book. By the end of the first book, Charlie, his grandparents, his parents, and Mr Wonka are all in a glass elevator, shooting into the sky. From here, they go to outer space where a space hotel is opening and some American astronauts find them and assume they are enemy aliens. They, along with the infantile and incredibly stupid president of the United States contemplate blowing up the glass elevator and all inside to protect the soon-to-be occupied space hotel. With Wonka's gadgets, they manage to board the hotel, find real and very dangerous aliens, escape, and save the foolish Americans from being gobbled up...for the most part. When they return to the factory, Wonka offers a volatile youth potion to his grandparents, but only the selfish Josephina gets any...and all of it. She disappears as she becomes uninvented, Charlie and Wonka find her in the mysterious place where negatives live, and that's pretty much it. A series of non-sequitors, but funny nonetheless.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|So much has been written already about this album, and many people have posted excellent, thorough reviews, so I'll be brief and to the point.  If you like the work of Evanescence from their early demos to Fallen, you will be very pleased with this album.  I thought they might 'mellow out' some, boy was I wrong.  Just as \\"Fallen\\" grabbed me from the very first track, the same happened with \\"The Open Door\\".  Powerful and consistent.  A++ !!
B000BBOUU4|3.0|The newest adaptation is nothing like the book; if anything, try the Gene Wilder one, which better captures the fun-loving nature of Wonka and the silly laughs resulting from the rotten kids visiting the delicious funhouse. That screenplay, as it happens, was written by Dahl, so you know it is true to his intentions. That, and the music is more fun and catchy, whereas this one fails to impress. <br /> <br />The visuals are typical for Tim Burton: beautifully dark, twisted, and a little scary. The humor is there at times, but is overshadowed by the overwhelming artistic vision and really unpleasant version of the oompa loompas. The various elements are mostly exciting, but don't quite add up to an engaging film. Nice try, but not the best.
0060920084|3.0|I think Bill Bryson can be very funny. \\"In A Sunburned Land\\" was hilarious, whereas this was pretty much trite and dated humor. In fact it reminded me of the kind of humor undergraduate English Majors at overated eastern liberal arts colleges would find funny. The beginning of the book is an ongoing insult of everyone, the middle he calms dawn, and he ends really trying to force some funny. It's a very dated and poor effort by a usually funny man. Skip it.
B0000013GT|5.0|Damn, seeing that Outkast had a movie and a new album out, I realized that I haven't reviewed not only one of their albums except their greatest hits album. Outkast has really represented the hometown since '93 when V103 (ATLiens know this station) used to bump \\"Player's Ball\\" on the radio airwaves. And \\"Southerplayaisticmuzik\\" back in mid '94 help place Atlanta on the map. Two years later, they come out with their sophomore album \\"ATLiens\\" in Sept 1996.<br /><br />This time, they flipped their whole concept around compared to their first one. While their debut was mostly about pimpin and smoking weed, this one was more \\"out there\\". The production by Organized Noize was more laid back and smoother sounding. Their first single \\"Elevators (Me & U)\\" was heavily rotated back in summer of '96, and everybody was trying to memorize that hook \\"Me & U/Your momma and your cousin too...\\" (lol). Antwan \\"Big Boi\\" Patton and Andre \\"3000\\" Benjamin's rhymes took a side step (not saying they didn't improve, but just went a different direction with their rhymes). On the song \\"Two Dope Boyz In A Caddilac\\" would be a good example of what I'm saying, as well as their second single \\"ATLiens\\". The most \\"out there\\" concept on this album would be the two songs \\"Millenium\\" and \\"Extraterrestrial\\" that will garuntee to have you head nod. The latter song may sound wierd to many listeners because the song doesn't have any drums, so it sounds like they're freestyling accapella.<br /><br />Guest wise is pretty dope too. Goodie Mob's Khujo and T-Mo appear on \\"Mainstream\\" as well as Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, and Cool Breeze on \\"Decatur Psalm\\". Witchdoctor would handle the hook on the song \\"Ova Da Woodz\\".<br /><br />As much as I LOVE this album, I have to gripe about one thing (and I may come back and edit this to a 10 rating, because this should have been on the greatest hits album). \\"Jazzy Belle\\" was the third single back in early '97, and if you remember it was remixed with Babyface singing the hook to the song. On this album, that isn't on here (eventhough the origonal was a good song) I believe that this album should be remasted and that should be on here. Thats my only tiny gripe on this album. Otherwise this is an awesome album to catch musical vibes off of. If you're new to this Outkast, I highly recommend \\"Dre and Big Boi Presents: Outkast\\" before you buy any of their albums.<br /><br />Lyrics: A+<br /><br />Production: A+<br /><br />Guest Appearances: A<br /><br />Musical Vibes: A<br /><br />Overall: A+<br /><br />Other Notable Tracks: Wailin', Wheelz Of Steel, 13th Floor/Growing Old<br /><br />Chandler Infamous, and I'm ghost, Peace!k to the song.

B000HCO840|4.0|I loved this movie.  It went a little out there at points but it was a fitting ending to the trilogy.  I wish Brian Singer had done this but all and all Brett Ratner wasn't that bad.  I cant wait to see the bonus features and alternate ending. <br />
0618551050|5.0|What is really cool about this book is its survey of theories of physics that have been considered since the renaissance to the present. It describes both successful theories and unsuccessful ones. Its discussion of unsuccessful attempts is very insightful, and many of the theories discussed I have never heard of before. Its survey of string theory at a lay-person level is the most detailed yet readable I have seen anywhere. I also very much like the insights into the mindset of how successive generations of physicists worked. I still have about a hundred pages left to read -- the review whim comes rarely to me, so I striking while its still hot -- but at this point this book get a definite thumbs up.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Other people have commented on how the editing cuts so fast in this movie.  I loved it.  You always know what is going on on everyones faces right after something is said.  It is a very frenetic style.<br /><br />Supremacy picks up where Identity left off.  Having not read the books, I can't compare it.  I can compare it to other movies at this time though and tell you that this and Bourne Identity are far superior to most.  The story is very complex and we have all types of backstabbings going on(literally).  I was taken in by the whole movie.  As a whole I can't consider it as good as Bourne Identity, but the finale has to be one of the best endings to a movie I haev ever seen.<br /><br />DVD extras include a bunch of featurettes including making of and interviews.  Karl Urban gets to further explain his character.  There is also a director's commentary.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Beck rules! People who were introduced to Beck through \\"Geuro\\" and looking for another of the same might be disappointed, but what is so great about Beck is his versatility while remaining true to his own voice. \\"The Information\\" does not disappoint, especially this long - time Beck fan.
0743298020|5.0|This is the third TWIN story I've read in as many weeks! But okay, it's still good. And if you like language and books about books and mysteries and wonderful writing--stick around. Some of the twists at the end seemed contrived to me, however I still kept turning the page. The setting is wonderful and the family (however strange) will keep you riveted. For a story about a girl who must choose between the woman who wants to adopt her and the mother who abandoned her, check out my first novel, RETURNABLE GIRL. Or come visit me at my web site: [...]
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I bought this album not being a huge fan of the Chili Peppers, in fact this is the first of their albums I've bought, but I was surprised with how quickly I fell in love with all 28 songs on this album. I found this to be one of those rare albums in which you hear a song, thought it was just ok, only to find that it gets stuck in your head until you just have to hear it again and again. For me every last song had this effect on me (and my friends as well).   <br /> <br />If like me, you heard Tell Me Baby and Dani California on the radio, liked them and thought about buying this album, but were hesitant because you aren't a devout fan of the Chili Peppers, don't be afraid to spend the money on this album. You'll find that every song carries an appeal of its own. This won't be a CD where you're really just buying two songs, this is one of those rare albums where you can listen to the whole CD without having to skip any tracks. <br /> <br />Buy this album.
B000HDR9NG|5.0|i love these guys and had to get this cd as soon as it came out. frankly, this cd is quite different. they took a new approach with this cd, but i like it, although many may not. overall, a great killers release.
0618680004|1.0|Not just a disappointment, the book simply not very good.    Dawson claims his intent is to persuade to atheism those who are uncomfortable with their own religious belief.  Yet his mocking, sneering condescension to and contempt for religious believers will put off many whom he might otherwise have influenced.  He is oblivious to the intensity of religious experience.  Religious belief generally correlates negatively with intelligence, but many believers are of course extraordinarily intelligent. While that doesn't count for or against their belief, Dawkins does not do well to treat believers as fools.  He should reread (I hope it's re-) William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience; doing so might add depth and humanity to his view of believers.     Dawkins seems curiously unfamiliar with contemporary philosophical thought, perhaps because it tends to undercut his desire to subject religion to \\"scientific\\" analysis.  He isn't very good at the history of philosophy either.  I am neither believer, unbeliever, nor agnostic.  I can't make enough sense out of the use of \\"god\\" to know what might count for or against the correctness of its use to denote anything.  Dawson doesn't understand this position, although it isn't original with me and requires little philosophical sophistication to grasp.  By the way, Anselm's ontological argument is by its own terms valid, but does not prove the existence of \\"god\\" as Dawkins uses the term.     Dawkins takes as his paradigm the argument between creationists and evolutionists.  Creationism is both wrong and silly.  But Dawkins will not dent those who previously resisted his arguments.  It is easy to mock the vagaries and inconsistencies of religious conservatives.  Fundamenatalists are in fact powerful forces for ignorance, irrationalism, and intolerance.  For that very reason, if H.L. Mencken couldn't finish them off, Dawkins is unlikely to.    Dawkins wanders from his \\"delusion\\" theme when he speaks of the damage wroughtby organized religion.  Evil done in the name of god is obviously irrelevant as to whether god exists.  Dawkins justifiably points to awful historical effects of belief, including 9/11.  He does, however, ignore the political component of many, if not most, \\"religious\\" conflicts such as the Thirty Years war and the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  Dawkins speeds past secular outrages such as Russia under Stalin, China under Mao, Rwanda, Cambodia, American lynchings of blacks, the Armenian genocide, King Leopold in the Congo, the near extinction of Native Americans.  Religion is not necessary to human vileness.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|Listening to this album started off as a direct comparison to Escapology which is a mistake.  This album is a lot more sophisticated than some of Robbie's previous works, but it is still excellent album.  I have to admit that the first time I listened to Intensive Care, I was less than happy, but it has actually grown into one of my favorite albums.  His lyrics never disappoint in their witty and creative nature.  I highly recommend this album and if at first you don't like....don't give up.
B000002J3W|2.0|so the image conscious marketing geniuses wanted to make SR more grungy and less glam? fair enough, but SR wasn't very glam to begin with, and with S to the G, they had already made all the transition they needed. SubHmn Race is just grunge for the sake of grunge, SR's distinctive style is lost, the songs are non-descript, and Baz' vox are restrained, sounding more like a Pantera imitator than the guy who was giving Axl a run for his $ in the range dept.
B000HCO840|4.0|With Bryan Singer and his writing team moving on to the Superman franchise, Marvel and Fox scrambled to get the third, and for now final, X-Men film out as quick as possible, with director Brett Ratner getting to direct the installment.  Now make no mistake, Ratner is a hack director at best, and his best talents are displayed in the many action scenes throughout the film, many of which are nicely done.  The story picks up a while after X2, with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Storm (Halle Berry) training a young group of mutants including Iceman (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin), Shadowcat (Ellen Paige), and Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) while Cyclops (James Marsden) is still mourning the death of Jean (Famke Janssen).  In the meantime, a cure for mutants is announced, prompting Magneto (Ian McKellen) to organize his Brotherhood as Jean returns from the dead to make short work of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and anyone else in her way.  For the most part, X-Men: The Last Stand is solid enough to stand out on it's own, but it really misses the touch that Singer and his crew had on the characters.  The dark tone is still here, but the characterization injected in the previous two films gets the second tier treatment here.  Many characters, mainly Cyclops and Rogue, are almost completely ignored to make way for new characters like Beast (Kelsey Grammer, perfectly cast) and Angel (Ben Foster, who plays a much lesser role than you would think), while new villains are introduced including Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones, yes, Vinnie Jones in a fake looking muscle suit and all) and Multiple Man (Eric Dane), while Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) get a backseat.  There's loads of in-references that longtime X-fans will get (the Days of Futures Past nod is a nice touch, and Stan Lee and Chris Claremont make cameos), but to believe that this is the last X-Men film is just silly.  It could have been better (and longer, the film is over way too quick), but it could have been a lot worse too, so maybe we should count our blessings.ld have been a lot worse too, so maybe we should count our blessings.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence has once again recaptured it's ethereal beauty with another masterpiece The Open Door. They still have the ethereal sound, it's different if you can't hear it then you must be deaf. Definetly one of the best if not the Best album of the year. The Open Door is less commercial, more experimental and the lyrics are more of an empowerement than singing to pain and sorrow.  <br /> <br />SWEET SACRIFICE: the album's opener captures the same way as Going Under did to it's audience though the lyrics are more of an overcoming your fear. The guitar in here is also diverse <br />CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE SOBER: it seems as that it's the only song that fits in the album still it's an amazing track. The blending of the theartrical strings and intricate guitar works along with Amy's soulful vocal and piano is definitely the hightlight of the song. <br />WEIGHT OF THE WORLD: the song opens up with an arabesque type of song that really is enchanting. The guitar solo accompanied by the chanting is just WOW.  <br />LITHIUM: only one word can describe this piece, Perfect. The Lithium certainly beat My Immortal. It's one powerful power ballad. <br />CLOUD NINE: almost danceable which is great. The chanting at the beginning, middle and end gave this song an eerie sound.  <br />SNOW WHITE QUEEN: about her stalker, it has a reminescent of Even In Death tone during the verse but it created it self with it's own niche to call it self one of Evanescence most powerful song.  <br />LACRYMOSA: A perfect rendition of Mozart's Lacrimosa. The heavy guitar work, the choir, Amy's voice and the amazing guitar solo are just mesmerizing. <br />LIKE YOU: a song dedicated to her sister just like Hello, beautiful and dark,mournful yet hopeful.  <br />LOSE CONTROL: starst off with a playful piano soon becoming Evanescence most bizarre song. Though it's still an amazing track. <br />THE ONLY ONE: it's perfect for a Lost Soundtrack, it's about closemindedness. Amazing track <br />Your Star: starts offwith a piano then it soons build up to become an epic masterpiece. <br />ALL THAT I'M LIVING FOR: a song dedicated to the band itself, a power ballad that makes you want to headbang during the chorus and relax at the verse though it gets heavier at the end. <br />GOOD ENOUGH: with the intro to the \\"Narnia Song\\", the track sends you into a reverie. A very hopeful song sang in an almost melancholy melody, landing it self as one of Evanescence best ballad.  <br />The ethereal beauty is still present in this album and surely The Open Door is an EPIC MASTERPIECE <br /> <br />IF YOU THINK THAT EVANESCENCE LOST THEIR SOUL APPARENTLY YOU MUST BE DEAD THE ALBUM IS MORE \\"SOULFUL\\" THAN THE LAST WITH EMOTIONS RANGING FROM JOY, SORROW AND ANGER.
B00004RF97|4.0|This is still a lot of fun, but it is also showing its age, nearly 70 years after it began life as a Broadway play. But Hepburn and Grant and Stewart in a romantic triangle (or a square, considering Kate's got a stuffy fiancee as well) is going to be worth seeing, even now. Many fine moments here, my favorite ones all belonging to Cary Grant. If you are a fan of any of these three legends of Hollywood, you would consider this movie a must-see.
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Bourdain is a person I would be friends with if I knew him.  He's cynical, he's blunt and he loves food.   <br /> <br />\\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is a collection of tales from Chef Bourdain's past-- these stories are all very memorable.  As many other reviewers have stated, the book is funny and eye-opening.  But what I also want to add is that Bourdain is a very good writer.  He knows how to tell a story that is fast-moving, interesting, funny and worthwhile.  The bulk of the book takes place in the New York City restaurant scene, which is a universe unto itself.  Bourdain's personal experiences through this maze of liars, drugs, cheats and the mafia are fascinating.  When I was finished, I was sad that the stories ended.  I have since vowed to go to Bourdain's downtown bistro Les Halles to experience this guy's menu.  But \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" is first and foremost about the insane people that make the food.  I highly recommend this book.
B00005JOFQ|4.0|I found this a little too long, a little too slow, a little too sad to rate five stars. Worth seeing once, it is an honorable effort to portray the power of forbidden love between two modern-day cowboys who would obviously vote Republican on all but gay issues, and perhaps even on some of those. Now that the film is a couple of years old, I think it is safe to reveal that one of the leads does not survive the film. That was the most disappointing part...we come to care about the men, yet one passes from this world with only the briefest of depictions. I was surprised it did not win the Oscar as best film, but the awards were given out before I saw the movie. Now that I have seen it, I think it can be fairly called one of the ten best films of its year, and one of the three most talked about, but not deserving of the top honor for its season. Good performances for sure, but the script could have used some trimming and some punch.
B000FZERIG|4.0|First the important question does this remaster/reissue improve on the previous version released nearly a decade ago? Yes. The sound is fuller with slightly better detail. It is remastered a bit louder as well but the most important improvement is the inclusion of the B-sides \\"Deep Blue\\" and \\"Miss O'Dell\\" The former song was the B-side to \\"Bangela Desh\\" and \\"Deep Blue\\" was written about George's loss of his mother and the latter is a lark with a Dylanesque quality to the music. The lyrics go from serious to humorous with George cracking up during the chorus.<br /><br />What's disappointing is that the two demos from the two disc set aren't included here as well. I understand providing additional value to fans who pony up for the more expensive set but frankly both have been available on bootlegs for years. It would have been nice for fans to have ALL of the music tracks in one place and the DVD material on the other. That way if you did want the DVD you could purchase the two disc set.<br /><br />I'm also disappointed that George's rehearsal for \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" with George on lead vocals (he co-wrote the song with Ringo even though he wasn't credited as such until recently)isn't included as he provides a spirited version of the song. Finally it's a pity that the single version of \\"Bangela Desh\\" wasn't included as well.<br /><br />The booklet included has some nice rare photos from the inside cover shoot which feature George along with musicians that appeared on the album. We also get a brief essay discussing the recording of the album and the secular world's reaction to one that focuses so much on spiritual issues. Although it isn't George's finest album (\\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Cloud 9\\" and \\"Brain Washed\\" are my favorites ahead of this one)it has two songs that rank high up there in the Beatles/Harrison canon; \\"Give Me Love\\" and the bluesy \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" a witty take on The Beatles legal square dance.

This band has always inspired me in many ways and are important role-models in my eyes of what it means to be dedicated to your craft and pour out your soul in a musical and sharing way.

B000GIXEIG|3.0|This is a story that has been told for centuries around smoky fires, written down early, and treasured by multiple cultures. So why does a screenwriter feel like he can change Grendel to a vengeful, misunderstood human? It makes the action scenes laughable that these strong, well equipped warriors cannot kill a barehanded human. And instead of a mighty clawed limb nailed to the hall pillar, there is just the pale arm of a mister universe runnerup. Generations of storytellers have wisdom that should not be overturned by some hack. All the beautiful scenery, all the fine acting, all the atmosphere are spoiled by a monster who is not.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Since I bought this album a year ago I've moved onto harder and heavier bands, like Slayer and Cradle of Filth, and even some older ones too, like Iron Maiden and Ozzy. Avenged Sevenfold has evolved into something that fits right in the middle of all of that. They even seem to have an anti-war feeling in two of the songs, despite the fact that they claim to not be a political band at all.<br /><br />Many fans of Waking the Fallen and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet will be disappointed over the fact that M. Shadows chose to tone down his level of screaming. They may also be upset over the feeling that the band's music isn't exactly as heavy as their prior two albums. Despite this, the band has managed a very solid album, especially for one that spans over a full 78 minutes.<br /><br />The disc takes right off with the band's brutal second single, Beast and the Harolt and continues right through to the album's first single, Bat Country. The song was rated the 2nd best song of the year by Fuse for 2005 and is extremely overplayed on the radio, but that doesn't mean it's not a wild ride. In fact it's really quite insane and the music video just adds enough sex and comedy to make it that much better. Next is Trashed and Scattered, which is very vulgar yet keeps turning from heavy to interestingly catchy. Seize the Day is up next and what a song it is! I personally like this song more than the amazing ballad of Warmness on the Soul from their first album and the music video for it is nothing short of brilliant. Sidewinder kicks it off slowly but turns very catchy after a good few minutes of listening when the bongos are added. The Wicked End is a dark and awesome tale of apocalypse by demons, as, I'd assume, prophecized in the Book of Revelations. Strength of the World has a very powerful story behind it, where a man's family is shot before him and he seeks revenge for their deaths. Betrayed is a tribute to Dimebag Darrel of Pantera who was shot and killed on-stage by a crazed fan. The title to the track itself is a reference to both sides, I feel, as the fan probably felt betrayed that Darrel had moved onto a new band or Darrel for having a fan kill him. M.I.A. ends the album with an 8 minute war story of a man in Iraq who is forced to kill and forced to see death around him and live in fear and then, in the aftermath, he must live with guilt and rejection from others.<br /><br />Overall the album proved to be a true masterpiece however it detracts from the feeling of A7X's previous efforts. It also strays from the death metal/metalcore style and leans more towards nu-metal. But that also means, at the same time, others may begin to have a bit more appreciation for the music (my parents, who aren't very fond of metal at all anymore, loved it).<br /><br />--4/5 Stars--zed fan.

0452257743|5.0|\\"The Long Walk\\" is my favorite novella in this series.  Never in so few pages can any author amaze me like King can.  The way he writes is so matter-of-fact in this story. <br /> <br />I bought the book when I was in Jr. High, but things were much different then.  People kept their problems to themselves and suffered in adolescent silence.  Because of recent events concerning the youth of today, the book containing \\"Rage\\" has since been banned, I heard.  Maybe it's for the best.  If you're a preteen and you're reading this, it probably should be best read by mature audiences only.   <br /> <br />Treasure this book if you don't like to read his longer volumes. His snippets suffice for your horror fix.
0618551050|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I've been fascinated with theoretical physics for a long time, but lately the things I've read have made me suspect that physics (or at least particle physics) might have lost its way.  This is exactly the thesis of Smolin's book; string theory, the dominant theory in particle physics, is according to Smolin  a very complex theory that has so many forms that it can be adapted to almost any data, and therefore isn't falsifiable, can't generate testable predictions, and thus isn't really science.  Smolin spends a lot of time setting the stage for the emergence of string theory as the currently dominant paradigm for particle physics despite having essentially no experimental support.  He gives a good description of string theory's initial appeal as well as its slow evolution (devolution?) into a \\"theory of anything\\" that seems to be unable to be tested as normal scientific theories are supposed to be.  I enjoyed having the gaps in my knowledge filled in in this way, albeit by an admittedly biased source. <br /> <br />Then Smolin gives an all-too-brief description of some experimental results which challenge the dominant paradigm (or ones that will happen in the next few years that look like they might challenge it), as well as some theoretical alternatives to string theory.  The impression one gets is that the alternative theories are fascinating but not nearly as thoroughly worked out as string theory, which is hardly surprising given the far fewer number of people who work on them.  To his credit, Smolin doesn't suggest that any of the other theories are the \\"right\\" theory that will \\"fix\\" string theory's errors; he believes instead that there is something fundamentally missing in our understanding of space, time, and the quantum that is adversely affecting all current theories.  I found this section of the book really intriguing, as nearly all of the theories and experimental results in this section were new to me. <br /> <br />However, the best part of the book is the last, where Smolin gives a somewhat angry description of academic politics and the need for a recognition that theoretical physics (and science in general) needs not just people with good technical skills (the \\"craftspeople\\") but also people whose expertise is in dreaming up radically new theories (the \\"seers\\").  He argues that academic institutions (especially in the US) are set up to exclusively favor craftspeople over seers, leading to a dead end when science needs seers to create a revolution.  My own (fairly extensive) experience in the scientific community tends to support this view, but with a major caveat that Smolin mentions but doesn't spend much time on: it's easy to distinguish who are the good craftspeople, but it's pretty hard to distinguish the true \\"seers\\" from just cranks.  Smolin's answer (that other seers can tell who the real seers are) is not really that satisfying, because if all of them are cranks, who cares what they think of each other? <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I think that the distinction between seers and craftspeople is a fundamental one, and this book deserves a lot of credit for introducing these concepts into the scientific dialogue.  In this sense, the book is reminiscent of Kuhn's _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, but much less dry. <br /> <br />Since I'm not a physicist, I can't evaluate whether Smolin's statements about physics are fair or not.  What would be interesting is to see a non-hostile, non-ad-hominem, reasoned rebuttal to this book by someone in the string theory community who knows how to write (Brian Greene, here's your next project!).  Regardless, I think anyone interested in physics and in science will find lots to think about in this book.
B0000U5RNU|1.0|I saw this movie with a bunch of family and friends at a theater in Brandon, Florida. I like lots of different kinds of movies and can find something redeeming in most. This wasn't one of them. Unless you really get into toilet humor (no pun intended) or are a pre-teen (see toilet humor), or maybe like torturing small animals (and this movie made me feel like the animal), it is a total waste of time. There is nothing creative or unique...and little that is funny. To compare it to Austin Powers is a farce. The trailer was funny and promising. Unfortunately, that's all she wrote.
B000003TAW|5.0|Once in a while an album will be produced and it will have no name, simply because the amount of talent and energy put into it could not be defined or summed up in any set of words. And these albums will go down in history as being the best of their time. The White album in 1968, Metallica's Black album of 91, and Weezer's Blue album of 94. That's right, I hold the Blue album up next to the White album. And why not, Rivers is not only the appealing front man but also the humble song writer and lead guitarist. The album creates an immediate first impression on your ears with a catchy verse chorus verse, but with better guitar riffs and licks then you would hear any normal punk rock musican pull off. The album progresses through and all of the feelings that 90's alternative (yes alternative) rock gives a fan come shooting into your veins. The teenage angst pulls you back into your garage by your sweater and you find yourself staring at old posters on the wall and when you ask your friend...whats the name of this album...you are surprised of his response when you only hear....\\"the blue album\\"....
B00005R62K|5.0|let me start off by saying, that this album as a whole is just a killer album & I love everything the band ever did (Halford years), but in my opinion, if I had to rate the songs on this album I would not say that \\"Beyond The Realms Of Death\\" is the best Priest song there ever was nor would I say that it's the best song on this album. Don't get me wrong, it's a great song, but I think there are a few better songs on here such as \\"Exciter\\" \\"Better by you, better than me\\" (even though it's not theirs) & \\"Invader\\". I know this comment will probably receive some head scratching but hey. I also would like to add, that this album shows the band still experimenting with their sound, growing from the Pro-Rock sound to the more straight ahead rockers for which they would become known for with their next album \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\"..Turn it up.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|The rating is for the movie itself! Repeat, the five star rating is for the movie only! This new \\"platinum\\" edition gets a BIG ZERO!!  <br />  The only new features on this edition are gimmicky, unnecessary and and definitely not worth the double dip, triple dip or added cost over already released editions. If you own the anniversary edition stick with it. (the Box is even better) <br />   So, If you really need a counter for the \\"F\\" word and the number of bullets fired, because you are unable to count yourself, by all means dole out more of your money. Just bring someone who can count so you don't get ripped off even more! <br />
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I first heard Ray Lamontagne while driving to work in Indianapolis.  I was listening to the independently owned radio station broadcasting out of Bloomington and 'Trouble' came out of my two-door Honda's meager speakers.  People may question whether love-at-first-sight exists and the discussion can go around the moon and back without a definitive answer but I'll never question falling in love with a song.  'Trouble' became a definitive song in my life and the album as a whole solidified Ray Lamontagne's place among my favorite artists. <br /> <br />So, when I was purchasing a book in a major retail bookstore in downtown Boston, their last-minute-marketing attempts caught me unawares as I stood there looking at Ray's new album.  I admit, I'd lost touch and wasn't even aware that a new album was being released!  I bought it without a second look and it lived in my bag for over twenty-four hours until I had the opportunity to break it open and listen to it from beginning to end. <br /> <br />First listen:  Solid follow-up album that is clearly more-produced that the debut.  Initially I felt it might have been a little over-produced with splashes of horn-sections and strings.  It was clearly in contrast to the bare-bones, mostly-accoustic debut album. <br /> <br />Second listen:  Wait...what's the name of the second track?  This song is beautiful!  Absolutely haunting and...start it over from the beginning.  Resist the temptation to put this one track on repeat. . . <br /> <br />Third listen:  This album is not at all overproduced.  It's brilliant and, as I would expect, the lyrics and melodies are gorgeous.   <br /> <br />And to shamelessly make an allusion to the fourth track, \\"Three more days\\" I implore you to give it three more listens if at first you feel ambivalent.  This album is a treasure.
B000GY729M|4.0|On The Killers' epic sophomore disc Flowers and Co. have jettisoned the New Wave stomp of \\"Hot Fuss\\" and replaced it with expansive hook-filled nostalgia. The album opens powerfully (much like the adrenaline kick of \\"Fuss\\" opener \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\"), the signature propulsive drums and keyboards raising the curtains and unveiling cinematic vignettes of Midwestern Americana. \\"I've never really known anybody to die before,\\" Flowers croons, painting a vivid picture of a grandmother's wake.  <br /> <br />The title track is followed by \\"Enterlude,\\" a short thematic primer whose melody is later reprised in the excellent album closer \\"Exitlude.\\" \\"We hope you enjoy your stay, it's good to have you with us, even if it's just for the day,\\" Flowers sings, as if the listener is a drifter passing through an old western town. This being a concept album (supposedly), it makes sense to frame the songs in the context of a brief excursion into \\"Sam's Town.\\" In fact, the album works best when viewed in this way. As demonstrated on \\"Hot Fuss\\" the Killers are good at inhabiting a musical niche. \\"Fuss\\" itself was a concept album of sorts, the '04 Killers were a bunch of eyeliner wearing, androgynous disco-dwellers with an affinity for synthesizers. The new Killers have taken a fancy to the mythic American West, and instead of cribbing from Bowie they've grown scruffy beards and are now taking lessons from Springsteen. He is, after all, the Boss.  <br /> <br />In addition to the title track and single \\"When You Were Young,\\" highlights include the bouncy \\"For Reason's Unknown,\\" the earnest \\"Read My Mind,\\" and the Queen inspired \\"Why Do I Keep Counting?\\"  <br /> <br />Only time will tell if \\"Sam's Town\\" will be the mass success that it's predecessor was. I for one am relieved this disc is as good as it is. After hearing \\"Hot Fuss\\" for the first time, The Killers were one of my favorite bands. It's good to report that after hearing \\"Sam's Town\\" they will remain that way.
B000HEWEJO|1.0|As additional information about this release became available after I wrote my initial review, I have decided to go back and revise my comments as follows:  the DVD is in B&W after all.  And that's as it SHOULD be.  Those complaining that the movie on this disc was not colorized probably prefer full-frame DVDs over properly letterboxed ones too.  So, just so we're all clear here:  this 'new' DVD is basically the same as the 'old' DVD.  It has new color cover art which is very misleading, and for that reason I will retain my one-star rating.  The film itself, of course, gets five stars.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|When the Special Editions were released on DVD I was one of the people who felt let down. I was amongst the legions of fans that wanted DVD versions of the movies we saw in the theatres as kids. I even wrote a review on amazon in which I suggested that both editions should be made available to the public. I never expected them to be in the same package, but that is a nice little bonus and I'm grateful.     People here seem to complain alot about release after release of these movies, as well as a lack of Dolby digital 5.1 and no anamorphic wide screen on the originals themselves. Right now I really don't mind because:    1. I waited for something like this to happen, so I am buying the movies on DVD for the first time. Since I already had the older Special Editions on VHS this wait was rather easy.    2. I have not invested in a fancy home theatre set up, I just have the stereo speakers on my TV. (Home theatre set ups keep improving and dropping in price, so I may buy one some day. But I keep finding so many other things I'd rather spend my money on that I haven't gone beyond the basics.)    3. I have no interest in spending thousands of dollars, even hundreds, on a HDTV at this time. So my standard TV does just fine and the anamorphic feature would be wasted on it. (Yes, I know that standard signals are going to be cut off 12/31/09, but I'll do fine without them. Who knows, I might even read a few more books next year instead.)    If I ever get a fancy home set up (highly doubtful), then I may miss all of these features. But until then I am very grateful for a chance to relive some childhood memories.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|I love this recording, and all the other reviews have discussed the many reasons why it is so great.  I just want to mention something that Herb Ellis said about playing with Ray Brown.  Herb said that Ray's bass playing made him feel like he was being physically lifted up and carried along by some super-strong giant.  Mr. Brown is the model of powerful swing - massive,deep tone, atomic sense of time.  On this (and other) OPT recordings you can hear him lift-'n-carry the whole band.
B000GY729M|5.0|This album is superb from start to finish. \\"Sam's Town\\" proves that The Killers are real artists and a great band in the making. This is a huge step up from their previous effort. I'm glad they didn't blindly recycle ideas from \\"Hot Fuss.\\" They tried something different and it's refreshing. I can play \\"Sam's Town\\" from start to finish. This album showcases their real talent. \\"This River is Wild\\" is my favorite song. It's so grand and epic, like Springsteen meets U2. It reminds me of the Wild West, a stylish backdrop to a great Western. \\"Sam's Town\\" is a stunning sophomore effort. It shows real growth and maturity. Make no mistake, they have made a superb record. This is a departure from \\"Hot Fuss\\" or at least it appears that way at first, but it's a welcomed change. I would encourage people to have an open mind and the true brilliance of this record will shine through. \\"Sam's Town\\" gets better each time I play it. And it sounds more and more like a Killer's album on repeat listens. This is a classic. It's sharp and sophisticated. Pure and simple, this is just GREAT music. I wish all sophomore albums could rise to this epic occasion. I love \\"Sam's Town.\\"    Favorites: Sam's Town, When You Were Young, Bones, For Reasons Unknown, Read My Mind, This River Is Wild
B00005V1B2|5.0|This album is so good, I didn't even notice there were no vocals until after I had already finished listening to it for the first time.  The guitar lines are perfectly woven in between the drums, keyboards, and bass.  Although no lyrics are present, the instruments tell the story, and do a terrific job.  Although Camel had a couple of ther five star albums, I can say with confidence that this is their best.  Don't hesitate to buy this masterpiece of progressive rock. <br /> <br />P.S. It must be listened to as a single work, much like The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, The Wall, or Days of Future Passed.  This is not to say that the tracks are weak on their own, but they work together to provide an overall product that is worth more than the sum of its parts.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Other than the slightly confusing chronology of the very last scenes (made up for by an overwhelming and very sudden ending), this is one of the most gorgeous and brutal films I have ever seen. The cast is flawless, which actually aids in the discomfort factor...when Monica Bellucci's character is raped, it isn't just the ultra-raw, minimal camera style (the camera stays completely stationary) that causes you to flinch-it's the moans and screams that she makes during the entire ordeal. You actually feel like you're watching a woman get brutally assaulted...and even with all that going on, the director manages to add another disturbing elemant to the shot toward the end. While a lot of \\"disturbing-film-list\\" movies can be pointless and gratuitous, the violence here is not only realistic and essential to the storytelling, but actually underscores the even more disturbing \\"can't turn back time/no matter how bad it is it can get MUCH worse\\" message contained in the characters' actions and futile attempts at \\"justice\\". Not for the faint of heart, but if you love the artistic aspect of movie-making, this is an amazingly crafted film that almost makes you feel as if you're being slapped in the face while watching.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Have you ever seen a sticker on the front of a new CD that says, \\"their highly awaited CD,\\" and wondered \\"highly awaited by whom?\\"  Well, in the case of this new Evanescence disc, it IS highly awaited by millions of fans.  It seems like forever since their debut CD came out.  This new CD, the Open Door, has beautiful packaging and art, but the important question is how's the music?  It turns out to be an excellent collection of tunes that will please those long-suffering hordes.  I don't think there's any one song with the instant impact of \\"Bring Me Back to Life,\\" but then again, that amazing first hit was a rare thing.  It is interesting to me that the first single from Door is \\"Call Me When You're Sober,\\" which is a decent enough tune, but not nearly as great as some other new songs such as \\"Weight of the World\\" and especially the powerful \\"All That I'm Living For.\\" I also like the variety of material on the Open Door.  I've listened to a few too many CDs lately where every song sounds roughly the same, but on this disc there are lovely melodic ballads (ex., \\"Good Enough,\\" which some might find boring but I liked), mighty rockers, and even a hint of hip-hop rhythms (on \\"Cloud Nine\\").  And to top it all off there's the angelic singing of Amy Lee.  One other thing: there will be a lot of discussion about the departure of Ben Moody and the arrival of Terry Balsamo.  Sometimes a major personnel change like that can really hurt a band, but I think the 2006 version of Evanescence is just as good as before.
B000E6UWE4|5.0|Gardens of the Moon is like few fantasy books you'll ever read.  The author drops you into a world at the beginning, without any explanation, and lets you slowly absorb the personalities and locals he has created.  Since this is the first of a 10 volume series, Erickson is in no hurry to push the push the plot along, but by the end, you can't wait for the sequel.  As in any really good book, the author uses seemingly unimportant acts to have important consequences later in the novel.  The world that Erickson has created can be dark and gritty.  The characters can be either good or bad, but sometimes making a value judgement is not easy. All in all, a really good piece of fantasy writing.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Finally something different and great.  Everytime you watch it, you'll find something new to enjoy.
0786714875|2.0|someone wrote this review above, i want to second it.  the book could have been a lot better, was quite disappointing.  i got into the habit of skimming through a lot of pages at a time, the last hundred pages or so are the best and worth reading, the rest is just a quick skim. <br /> <br />\\"From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing.\\"
038572179X|5.0|This is one of the finest 3 books I have read in the last 10 years. The others being \\"As Meat Loves Salt\\" by Maria McCann and \\"Ghost Road\\" by Pat Barker.    Ian McEwan's writing is virtually flawless. His brilliant descriptions and phrasing makes reading effortless and engaging. His character development is of the highest level, comparable to Austen. His sense of history and the effects of history on the individual's life trajectory is superb, much like Tolstoy's War and Peace.  His acute ear for the signs of classism and its destructive forces compares to Dickens and Hugo. His description of the horrors of war were both matter of fact and moving, much like that of Pat Barker's World War I trilogy.    Rather than discuss the plot, which has been discussed numerous times in many of the posted reviews, I would prefer to discuss the themes that McEwan explores with great insight.    The first theme that I found engaging was that of maturity of emotion and development of personal character/courage, as exemplified in the character of Briony. What is it within us that matures? Briony finds that with time her emotions mature, allowing her first to engage as a nurse probationer in an army hospital and then to engage her sister Cecelia and Cecelia's lover, Robbie, both of whom she had wronged many years before. Maturity means forsight into the consequences of our decisions and actions and this force is hopefully paired with character which is the willingness to accept responsibility for those decisions and actions when they go astray. Thus experience that results in increased control of emotion, forthought, and assuming responsibility when wrong are those forces that bring about a healthy maturity with corresponding character development. McEwan develops this theme beautifully, even to the final passages of the book where the elderly Briony reflects on this process that she underwent so many years before.    The second theme I found engaging was the effects of classism, a social structure that acts as a barrier but can be overcome by those with courage and compassion. Cecelia and Robbie's love was first impeded by class until a happy accident allows Cecelia to understand the level of passion that Robbie secretly holds for her. In this regard McEwan explores a theme often explored by E. M. Forrester. Forrester in \\"Maurice\\", like McEwan in \\"Atonement\\",reveals that passion can move us beyond social definitions and toward a more authentic life. When Robbie accidently sends the obscene note to Cecelia, its authenticity breaks every barrier and releases them to experience pent up and held back affections and passions. The note, with its direct crude language, hits Cecelia almost like Zen enlightenment, revealing to her all that she had felt but hidden under a veneer of social control.    The third theme I found engaging was that of the creative impulse and the maturation of that force. Movement toward the state of artistic control means curtailing and directing the imagination, rather than allowing it to run wild. Briony learns this lesson and many are punished as a result.    The fourth theme of the book relates to the nature of atonement itself. Atonement has both internal and external manifestations, depending on whether the transgression has damaged the self or others or both. Briony makes both an internal atonement as she persues life as a nurse, treating the horribly wounded soldiers. But she also makes an external atonement as she attempts to recify the damage she has done.    Very few works of art are as profound, moving, and sublime as this novel.    The final aspect of the book I found engaging was McEwan's incredible ability to produce a tangible 'place' in the mind of the reader. The English country house with its Triton fountain; the sandy beaches of Dunkirk filled with thousands of wounded English soldiers; the army hospital fully of the maimed and dying; all come absolutely alive under the careful writing style of McEwan.
0060763280|1.0|To really get the most of this book, I would just use it when I'm down or not feeling confident.  This book is a real motivation booster.  But it should just be that.  The book basically consists of 3 parts.  The first part is about the \\"Millionaire Blueprint\\".  That is, what is limiting you may be a result of your past.  But, by becoming AWARE of this part of the past and UNDERSTANDing how it is limiting you and by being willing to DISSOCIATE from it and then DECLARING the change, you can develop this \\"Millionaire Blueprint\\".  Bascially, to make a long story short, millionaires walk the talk so take action.  The second part of the book, which makes up the bulk of the book, consists of traits of millionaires.  Whether it's true or not, we don't really know.  The author doesn't give any evidence that millionaires possess any of these traits.  There is nothing to support his claims even though he gives some compelling arguments.  The traits are questionable but reasonable.  If you want facts you are better off reading \\"The Prime Movers\\" or \\"The Millionaire Mind\\" - these books actually offer proof.  The last part of the book contains more marketing for the author's seminars which is littered throughout the book.  I mean if the title doesn't smell fishy, the constant marketing of his seminars in the book will really bring the smell home.  Also he supports Kiyosaki and Robert Allen, authors of other so-called \\"Get Rich\\" books and it is no wonder why they praise this book.  He also supports network marketing...run!  You have to wonder about this.  I have yet to know someone that became rich from network marketing.  Also, network marketing companies love books like these because they inspire their workers to work harder and at the same time, help the author sell more books so this works out for everybody except for the poor suckers that buy into this (again, inspiration should be checked with reality).  In case you don't know, Amway's backing of Kiyosaki's Rich Dad book is what made it into a best-seller.  Again, I think this book is very inspirational and if that is what you want, that is what you are going to get.  But it does not tell you specifically how to get rich (no such book) and you should not look for it to help you in any other way but to inspire you.  It's better to read books by reputable authors to get a feel of what you really need to do to get rich.  Better yet, read autobiographies or biographies of successful people.  I read all of these and from them, I learned that it's not enough to take action as this book suggests.  If you take action and it's totally the wrong action, that won't get you any closer to being rich.  Action must be guided by a balance of reality and calculated risk.  Blindly diving into something will probably cost you more than doing nothing.  Drive that is powered by emotion only will not do the job.  Anyway, it's hard to take this book seriously when I see names like Kiyosaki and Robert Allen.  Good luck.what made it into a best-seller.

B00003CXCT|1.0|NOTE: This review is not about the trilogy (which is great). This review is about the many DVD releases. <br /> <br />The worst thing that ever happened to George Lucas is when Peter Jackson released the Extended Version of LOTR. Jackson showed fans we could demand, expect, and receive more from Hollywood. The impact of Peter Jackson sent shock waves among fans, who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time. Even old Hollywood guards, like Ridley Scott and James Cameron (no surprise they are not Americans) took notice and improved their DVD releases. This change has been powerful, except in the case of Lucas and to some degree his pal Steven Spielberg, who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers.  <br /> <br />The many re-releases shows greediness, stubbornness, and lack of respect for fans. No one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version, but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality. In addition, please stop using the \\"Limited Edition\\" you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of Star Wars; it is both false and tiring. Release these films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release. <br /> <br />Lucas's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his Star War movies. Unfortunately, his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar. His shady practice of video/DVD releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him. <br /> <br />One must wonder what went through Lucas mind when Peter Jackson won an Academy Award for Best Director and not him. Maybe if he focus on making quality films (like he once did) and not playing the DVD re-re-re-release game, then he could win one. <br /> <br /> <br />
0440237688|5.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is an excellent work of literature. It presents a stunning example of a futuristic, dystopian society where all facets of life are controlled by various rules and regulations in an easily readable format. Jonas, the novel's protagonist, is chosen by the council to become the successor to the Giver, a man whose job is to mentally store the collective memories of society. The book focuses on situations such as a society without individuality, the importance of choice, and how people react to finding out that the accepted truths of their world were at one point not the case. Ms. Lowry uses chilling imagery, such as the lack of color, the inability of most people to love, and the unemotional \\"release\\" of those who don't fit into the government's carefully laid out plans for a perfect society to establish a mood that, while somewhat bleak, is not entirely without hope. The story picks up as it progresses, shifting to a more tense, but still equally atmospheric, form. This tension is skillfully maintained until the story's conclusion. I would heartily recommend this story to all those who enjoy fictional works that focus on either individualism vs. society or potential visions of the future. <br /> <br />- Benton Wilson (a member of the Mythology and Folklore VHS class)
B00005JO9J|5.0|I recently bought season 1 of Grey's Anatomy. I think the show is great.  I am not much of a tv watcher but this show peaked my interest.  It has many great actors in the show, especially Chandra Wilson. She is a powerful actress.  The cast is diverse and the show keeps you wanting more. I just ordered the 2nd season and I can't wait to watch that one too.  Its nice to find good shows on tv once again.
B000GY729M|5.0|There are many negative reviews of this album and I'm quite sure it's because some people like their melodies easy, catchy and bordering on Indie and bubblegum crap. I loved Hot Fuss and when I listened to this album the first time it really turned me off. A day later, I listened to it and the songs felt different to me. A few hours later, I hit \\"Sam's Town,\\" \\"When You Were Young,\\" \\"Bones\\" and \\"This River is Wild\\" and wondered why I disliked the album. <br /> <br />This is completely and utterly NOT Hot Fuss Redux. This is a different album built on a similar philosophy of song writing, but the band seems less interested in being pigeon-holed and more interested in being varied. If you liked Mr. Brightside, Somebody Told Me and Midnight Show but thought the rest of Hot Fuss was sub-par, you won't like this disc much, I don't think. It's got a lot stronger instrumentation, pounding basslines and overall great production value. <br /> <br />And for anyone who complains about any band, anywhere being \\"all in the studio,\\" grow up, would you please? That's not a critique of an album, that's a complaint that should be lodged against the entire music industry. The Killers pride themselves on a new take of using synthesizors, of course they rely on a studio heavily. Listen to the VH1 acoustic sessions or the Live at the Wireless bootleg and you will hear the merit of the Killers' musical capacity. That's like complaining that someone's voice doesn't sound like it's got a vibraphone in person, and here's the reason why: it's a studio invention. <br /> <br />The Killers, contrary to what most would like to think about modern music, do have the ability to write well. All of the songs, save perhaps Uncle Johnny which is vaguely boring, have strong writing. The strongest among all the bands in the world? I wouldn't know, I've certainly not listened to all the music in the world. But it's very solid, backed up by a band that knows how to play and play well. <br /> <br />This is avery solid album and the term \\"Sophomore Slump\\" shouldn't be used in the same sentence with it.
0553801503|5.0|There are a lot of reviews expressing disappointment about this book, but I enjoyed it immensely, and it's MUCH better than anything else out there.  Two of the best and most interesting characters are in this book -- Cersei and Jaime.  In fact, I would have to say they are my \\"favorite\\" characters at this point, despite hating them in prior books.  I agree that some of the characters are less interesting, but all of them add to the story.
B000GRTQXY|3.0|Primal Scream came up with an interesting idea to mix a bit of their \\"Give Out But Don't Give Up\\" album with some of their newer material and then try to make it sound a little like \\"Exile On Main Street\\" by the Rolling Stones. Sounds like a great idea seeing that both the Stones and Primal are two of my favorite bands. And I like both Primal's older and newer stuff (Give Out But Don't Give Up probably being their best album to date). But what sounds like a good idea and looks great on paper somehow just didn't come out right with this album. Overall not a bad album (I give it 3.5 stars) but it just doesn't have that mystique, edge, catchiness, or whatever you want to call it to make it a great or classic album. Quite boring at times and even a little cheesy in some parts (look at the song titles). \\"Country Girl\\" is one of the highlights of the album.<br /><br />The below reviewer, \\"svgtom\\", is correct, the track listing is incorrect. The song \\"Stone Ya To The Bone\\" is not on the album.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|It's been a damn long wait, but Evanescence have returned to the scene after being M.I.A. for the past two years. Lots has happened to inspire and fuel the material on the band's highly anticipated third disc. For starters, there's the obvious gap left by co-founder Ben Moody, who bailed-out on the band in 2003, at the height of the band's popularity. There's his replacement, ex-Cold guitarist Terry Balsamo. And personal turmoil for frontlady Amy Lee, from lawsuits to a break-up with Seether frontman Shaun Morgan (who is tastelessly put in the hot-seat on \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\"). It's fair to say that the band had a lot to prove going into this record.<br /><br />Sounds like: \\"Fallen\\" redux.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Evanescence have finally put something new out.<br />- The songs are darker, more ambitious and less poppy.<br />- Balsamo is a better guitarist than Moody.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- For all the waiting, it's not nearly as awesome as it should be .<br />- The album seems to be a carbon-copy of \\"Fallen\\" at times. For example, \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" is to \\"Going Under\\" as \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" is to \\"Bring Me To Life.\\"<br />- Balsamo doesn't bring the goods here like he did in his Cold days.<br /><br />Hits: \\"Weight Of The World,\\" \\"Good Enough\\" and \\"Lacrymosa.\\"<br /><br />Misses: \\"Call Me When You're Sober,\\" a horribly tacky Kelly Clarkson-esque song that didn't need to be written.<br /><br />Future: \\"The Open Door\\" is standard fare for Evanescence. I predict it will be a huge hit, and like it's predecessor, will be imprinted into our memory, thanks to excessive abuse on the radio.<br /><br />Personally: I like this album quite a bit for now, but I feel that it won't have as much shelf life as \\"Fallen.\\" It's good, but it's really more of the same. A lot of what I expected the band to come out with wasn't delivered.<br /><br />Best Listened To When: You're Bored With \\"Fallen.\\"
037571457X|4.0|This is a really good story of a young girl that would be inspiring to anyone of any age and is told in a particularly interesting way. It's definitely one of my favorite graphic novels, especially since it's such a different sort of topic than most. I liked the black and white images...it was the perfect way to present them.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|wow this movie blew me away, i saw it with a mind set that i was gonna hate but i didnt it was really good, and it had some comedy in it as well.<br /><br />now there are a few part that are a little cheap but its a fine damn movie. besides what other movie has a giant bunny?
B00005JMEW|3.0|I borrowed this from a friend, my buddy Bobby Asslong, who is normally very keen in his reviews and referrals. But he missed the mark with this one.  He called it a true classic, with the markings of an award winner. I call it, a bloody awful, overrated Shanghai extravaganza.  Not bad, but certainly not as good as it was hyped.<br /><br />I would recommend renting before you buy.  Maybe my friend, Mr. Asslong would be willing to lend you his copy.<br /><br />MC White said:  Just a'iiight!
B000HIVO64|4.0|I felt OK writing a review on release day because Beck was leaking videos and other new tracks on his myspace page for a month or two before.  I appreciated that and because of it, I must admit that I cannot remember the last time I was so eager for an album to come out.  That being said, I definitely have favorites already.  They include:    \\"Elevator Music\\" - very danceable tune, should have been the 1st single.    \\"Soldier Jane\\" - constant head bobbing, (important for me after Guerolito) definitely has some psychedelic qualities; I like the synths here.    \\"Dark Star\\" - I have never done acid, but the media has convinced me it must be something like this.  Cool song and by far the best video on the DVD.  It is as if Stanley Kubrick directed the video laced to early 80s underground beats.  One person commented that Beck resembles Willy Wonka a bit here.    \\"We Dance Alone\\" - I just added this one because it caught on with me after a while.  This is probably a song that showcases Beck's eclecticism more than any other, many different things going on here.    \\"No complaints\\" - Very catchy; one of the most stripped down tracks on the album, perfect for the MP3 player, walking outside.  Great lyrics.    \\"The Information\\" - The title track has a hard bass beat and is solid overall.    The last song is a montage of a couple different tracks, focusing on change.   This album was marketed different from the others; Beck is telling us the music is changing.  Example: I went out and bought it rather than downloading this . . . Why?    Partly because of the DVD that comes with the album, partly the releases on myspace.  Brilliant marketing focusing more on the album as a package.  And I'm still split on rating it vs. Guero.  Even though there were some tracks I could do without, (e.g. - Motorcade) when rating this album you have to keep in mind that Beck made a video for every song.  Has anyone done that before???  And then NOT charge us a lot for it?  At well under $15 here, this is a bargain for an album with 15 tracks and 15 videos on DVD.    I could go on about the stickers, but I won't.  Beck has attempted something different and I liked it, hope you do too.  Let's watch if the rest of the music industry follows suit.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence has promised us a bigger, better album, and this album it shows. They've clearly pushed all of their limits and the used all the talents they could. Amy used her powerful voice much more than on Fallen. The vocal was just utterly amazing and gave the album sort of a dream-like, gothic-powerful, carefree and windy feeling. The lyrics weren't as complicated as the last one but it worked well and, as others say, gets their messages across. And they came out with an album not like any other albums out there, and clearly not like Fallen, just as they've said in previews. <br />The album does take a little time to get fully use to. Simply because we aren't adapted at hearing different things. Fallen was a success simply because it was something new and different, and a breath of fresh air from other music. And we were fascinated at this \\"new genre\\" (of course there are other albums of this genre, they are just not very well known). So now after three years adapting into Fallen, they come out with something else and yes, coming out of Fallen and adapt into this new album- The Open Door, takes a bit of time to get use to. But it still sounds every bit like Evanescence, and that's the most important thing. When I heard this album, my first reaction was the relief that it still sounds very much like them, second reaction was the amazing quality of Amy's vocal and the complications of the sound/background-music mixing.   <br />The thing is, you REALLY have to keep an open mind and give it a bit more chance before throwing the \\"it's so TERRIBLE\\" out there. I mean, what do you expect? They are only human, are you expecting they come out SO incredible that it'll terminate all the other albums that ever existed on earth? You already know that they aren't coming out with another Fallen, as Amy repetitively said that it's gonna be a surprise and that it's totally different from Fallen. You may like Fallen better but I can bet that that's because of the first-initial bias, if they came out with this album first and then Fallen, I bet there are gonna be numerous complains about how they became more mainstream, how they became more pop-sounding, how they've \\"fallen\\" blah blah blah. Of course, critics will always be critics. But just remember that what is \\"better\\" isn't a statement, it's an opinion of acceptation. In fact, I have friends who like Evanescence but haven't heard all of Fallen (basically those people who aren't as adapted into Fallen) have said that they liked this album very much and that it sounded just like them (in fact, they say that they couldn't distinguish The Open Door from Fallen) <br />However, for myself, there are a few minor things about the album that I find disappointing: Call Me When You're Sober as the first single- I totally get that this is probably the most stand-out song (but then again, that could also be because of the first-initial bias of things, if they came out another song as their fist single things would most likely be different who knows), but if you look at their lyrics from the chorus: \\"don't cry to me, if you love me, you would be here with me, you love me, confine me, make up your mind!\\", if you haven't heard their song and didn't know it was an Evanescence song, would you believe it was an Evanescence song? The lyrics from the chorus have bugged me a little, and whenever I hear it I always go (.......) because it sounded more like one of those complaining lyrics like Avril Lavigne's  than their soul-bearing, poetic lyrics. I've had no problem with any other of their lyrics on any other songs, just this one. Could be because it's their first single, but the first time I heard it I got the (..........) feeling (especially at the end when she sings: \\"don't lie to me, just get your things, I've made up your mind\\"). But the first time I heard their other songs I had no problem whatsoever with their lyrics. I didn't like the music video either, it was too overdone and the only good about it was the scenery and costume. The story simply isn't moving, at least not as moving as their previous music videos. And also I tend to like more complex lyrics, which they had more on Fallen, so that I find a tiny bit disappointing, but just a tiny bit, all the lyrics does get their messages across very well so I'm not complaining.  <br />The best thing about this album is that it's very different than anything I've heard before. It's darker, more carefree, better vocal, and it wrote about more variety of things than just plain feeling. That I like. This album also clearly showed that they are growing and that they aren't afraid to try new things. Also, the story of this album did follow up to Fallen, for they build up on top one another in their similarity. For example in WOTW she sings \\"I won't be held down by who I use to be, she's nothing to me\\" kind of follow up on Everybody's Fool. And another quite clear example is Like You follow up to Hello in which she talks more about her pain of losing her sister but this time she even formed the thought of suicide in order to join her sister(wonder if she's willing to sing this one on their concerts). Even Good Enough (which btw, isn't really as \\"happy\\" as one would think, it's more of a yearning song) kind of followed up to My Immortal when she sings \\"so take care of what you ask of me, `cause I can't say no\\" <br />Another good thing is that the album is 10 minutes longer YAY! `cause I was worrying that they are gonna put in one of those ridiculous interludes to waste the time and space. Thank god they did not waste anything- instead of giving us a break in the middle with slow songs like on Fallen. It was rocking through almost the entire album and then ends with a slow ballet, I really like that.  <br />Overall, this album definitely does not mark their fall or their \\"evanescence\\" anytime soon. It is quite an extraordinary album and well worth for fans to own.  <br />
B000HWXS2S|5.0|I've loved this band since I heard \\"Once sent from the golden hall\\" way back when... I gotta first say that they absolutely couldn't make a bad album if they tried to... something that most metal bands today could only dream of. Every one of their albums has their \\"sound\\", but is also different, and memorable. So upon purchasing this, the very day it came out no less, I expected to enjoy it... I wasn't expecting it to be their absolute best album to date though, which imo, it is... the songs will be permanently burned into your brain forever and the lyrics are the best so far as well... Very rarely is a bands latest effort the place to start if you've never heard them, but in this case I don't think you could go wrong here. This album will make you a fan and have you diving head first into their back catalog if you're any kind of metalhead... AMON AMARTH rules!!!
B000FTWB7G|2.0|For me, this album was an indefinite let-down. I have listened to it a few times and I can't seem to force myself to like it, and I shouldn't have to. The first two CDs were amazing and full of emotion. As for this album, I cannot say the same thing. It does not have enough of anything. Not enough emotion really and not enough melody. Amy's voice overpowers every instrument played, and I don't necessarily think it good. You can't really feel the advanced guitar solos in here or those amazing vocals. It almost sounds like she's on crack for half of the songs. I think her voice gets on my nerves now and I just don't feel that the songs are deep. The only decent song on here is the \\"Weight of the World\\", although I even had to listen to that a few times before I thought it was okay. This is an okay album, and not something I really feel is worth my 10 bucks. Most people will argue it is less commercial and different since Ben Moody left, but I think he was a vital part of the song writing process which this album apparently lacks. Most of the songs are slow melancholy piano candlelit songs to me with high pitched female vocals, and nothing more.

B000GY729M|5.0|This second album finds the Killers departing the sound that made them famous on Hot Fuss and developing a \\"concept\\" album that is anything but typical.  The lead singer Brandon Flowers told MTV that this would be \\"the best album in the past 20 years\\".  Well...I don't know about that but it definitely is the freshest album that has come out in the past 20 years.  The album sounds like country western music that has been put in a synth meat grinder and added with some U2ish cord styles, all in the layout of the Beatle's Sgt. Pepper.  The album is a vast depature from the mood of \\"Hot Fuss\\"...this album is more complete, more optomistic, and maybe even more flamboyant.<br /><br />The album begins with one of the most charged up songs I've heard in years called \\"Sam's Town\\".  With Flowers screaming \\"why do you waste my time? Is the answer to the question on your mind\\".  The song might be the best on the entire album.  It is certainly my favorite.  If you ever need to psych yourself up...just put this beauty on a turn up the volume!<br /><br />Next is \\"Enterlude\\" which welcomes you to the album and bids that its \\"good to have you with us even if its just for the day\\" behind a few catchy keyboard cords.<br /><br />\\"When you were young\\" is the first single off the album and probably one of my least favorite songs however it is still great...another charged up chord style rock song.  Very fast paced and edgy.<br /><br />\\"Bling\\" is a very kind of whimsicle song that really grows on you after a few listens.  The song builds into a very catchy mix of all kinds of synth sounds behind powerful bass line.<br /><br />\\"For reasons Unknown\\" is a great kind of 80's throw away song that sounds like it was made in the middle of the desert.  Really neat song.<br /><br />\\"Read my mind\\" probably the most catchy songs on the album and one of my favorites...sounds very 80s movie soundtrack-ish.  A slower song with an aluring simple guitar riff that repeats with the corus...very chordal.  Great song and sure to be another single.<br /><br />\\"Uncle Johnny\\" is a dark, guitar heavy ballad that really adds a edgy mood to the album...which is overall very optomistic...a huge departure from Hot Fuss which was very dard and pesimistic.  Great song<br /><br />\\"Bones\\" the second single to be released and another gem.  Its kind of an eiry-tune with a trumpet blowing chorus...very catchy and a lot of fun.  You will be sure to love it.<br /><br />\\"My list\\" is a slow building song that ends up becoming very catchy towards the end of the song...a really cool, fresh song.<br /><br />\\"This river is wild\\" and \\"Why do I keep counting?\\" are both very fun laid back songs that take the album into kind of a friendly direction that adds to the overall feel of the album.<br /><br />The album ends with \\"Exilude\\" which is very reminicent of the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club band with the band singing once again \\"we hope you enjoyed your stay, it was good to have you with us even if its just for the day, outside the sun is shining feels like heaven ain't far away\\".<br /><br />All and all a great demonstration of the talent this young band has, as well as guts.  Many band never do a \\"concept\\" album...let alone one for a follow up sophmore album.  The reason is that many \\"concept\\" albums escape the realms of normal \\"singles\\" music in exchange for a crazy adventure.

B000HT386M|5.0|Don't listen to anyone who tells you that this movie sucked or did not live up to it's potential.  People who went to see this movie and did not like it were exspecting your basic toilet humor that one might see in early Sandler movies and were disappointed when it turned out to be a real heart felt story.  This movie was exellent.
B000FGGE68|3.0|Nice visual, effects and fighting scenes, but the plot is quite weak. <br /> <br />Still worth watching it, since the heroine is gorgeous, but be warned and don't go in expecting an outstanding movie. <br /> <br />
B000GY729M|5.0|Like the Scissor Sisters, The Killers have come back with an excellent follow up to their debut album.  I've had the album for almost a week, and mine has 2 bonus tracks as well, but it is excellent. If any of you reading this have \\"Hot Fuss\\", you are going to want this one as well. Get it today.  \\"When You Were Young\\", very nice. <br /> <br />
B000FQJAIW|5.0|All I can say is I felt like I was watching the film for the first time.  I felt like that kid so many years ago, walking into the theater, not expecting much, but seeing something amazing.  No, the sound isnt perfect (and I have a very dope sound system).  No, the colors aren't enhanced, there's no special features, nothing.  Its pure.  Its like seeing an old car that you loved - not fixed up, just like you remembered.  And for the record, I also have every release - but unlike most of the reviewers - dont feel \\"duped\\".  Hell, if you dont want it, dont buy it.  I bought it, watched it, Han shot Greedo first, and I wept.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc. <br /> <br />That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT \\"DL\\" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT \\"DL\\" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO? <br /> <br />Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory ...
B000HEWEE4|3.0|Reviews are only valid if coming from someone with a similar taste as you. <br />So if you're someone that cares about details in a movie, like \\"this makes absolutely no sense\\", you probably won't add this movie to your top 10. <br /> <br />It is definitely a cute movie. A love story between 2 people that meet through letters, but they can't meet personally because they live in different times. <br /> <br />Fits more into the \\"chick flick\\" category, but if you're into that kind of movies, go for it. If you're being forced by your girl to watch this with her, just be prepared for a sweet movie, but don't expect a great plot (or even acting).
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Quite frankly, the only thing I hate about this album is how it leaves me wanting more!  With this release, Amy Lee takes the reigns and easily establishes herself as one of the best vocalists of her generation.  I've always said that anyone can sing a rock song, but it takes a special someone to *sing* a rock song.  With \\"Fallen,\\" Evanescence demonstrated that they were for real, and needed to be taken seriously in the market.  With \\"My Immortal,\\" Lee established herself as having infinite potential not only as an amazing singer, but as an amazing interpreter (how can one walk away from the video not feeling that?!).<br /><br />Vocally, this album picks off right where their debut picks off.  Lee demonstrates more vocal prowess, especially in the use of both her registers.  (For you non-musicians, humans have two \\"voices,\\" which is technically labeled by the location of resonance.  The \\"chest voice\\" is also called \\"belting,\\" and is what you normally hear in contemporary music.  The \\"head voice\\" is the higher, lighter voice which most vocalists do not know how to access correctly.)  Another area that impresses me is just listening to her harmonies in the background.  They are present to the point that you can hear them, but you really gotta be paying attention to actually hear how intricate some of them are.<br /><br />Sweet Sacrifice - In true genre fashion, the song is low key for 45 seconds before Lee starts vocalizing in her head voice.  Near one minute, the rock commences, as does the belting.  And it doesn't stop.<br /><br />Call Me When You're Sober - It's funny... I could argue that this is the weakest song on the album, although I enjoy it none-the-less.  However, it was a great lead-off single for reacquainting listeners with the sound that they loved, and propelling them for what is to come off the album.<br /><br />Weight of the World - The awesomeness continues.<br /><br />Lithium - Great ballad beginning with Lee singing and playing.  Great sound, great flip into head voice in the end.<br /><br />Cloud Nine - Starts out with a filter on the voice, then breaks out into fifth straight track of \\"can't go wrong.\\"  Backed up by more voices than just a simple harmony, but a full choir is waiting in the wings.<br /><br />Snow White Queen - A song about the pressures of stardom... Starts out low and sultry, but doesn't stay there.<br /><br />Lacrymosa - Yet another good reason to give Amy Lee props - classical training.  After watching the movie Amadeus, she was so stricken with the Lacrymosa Dies of Mozart's Mass, she always wanted to incorporate it into a song.  Backed with full \\"goth choir\\" reminiscent of \\"Whisper\\" off of \\"Fallen,\\" she incorporates the classical genius's music into the song.  Sample lyrics:  \\"I don't want to hold you back now, love, I can't change who I am, not this time, I wont lie to keep you near me, And in this short life, there's no time to waste on giving up, My love wasn't enough, And you can blame it on me, just set your guilt free, honey, I don't want to hold you back now, love.\\"<br /><br />Like You - Like \\"Hello\\" off of \\"Fallen,\\" this song is a tribute to her deceased sister.  Hauntingly beautiful.  Sample lyrics:  \\"I hate me for breathing without you, I don't want to feel anymore for you... There's room inside for two and I'm not grieving for you, I'm coming for you, you're not alone, No matter what they told you you're not alone, I'll be right beside you forevermore.\\"  Extremely passionate, don't expect this to appear live.<br /><br />Lose Control - Another great song, starting out low, ending big.<br /><br />The Only One - Arguably the best vocal of the album, using both chest and head extensively in the melody.  At 2:00, she is floating high Fs and Gs before coming right back in belting that same high F.  Great cut.<br /><br />Your Star - Great melodic line to start out.  She keeps hitting that leading tone of the scale and it really just peaks your interest in everything she's singing,knowing the resolution has to come.<br /><br />All That I'm Living For - Another great song.<br /><br />Good Enough - Arguably the best lyrics and interpretation of the album, which is saying a lot, considering this entire album is phenomenal.  The \\"My Immortal\\" of the album, although I think in many regards it surpasses the artistry of the previous single.<br /><br />sample lyrics to \\"Good Enough:\\"<br /><br />Drink up sweet decadence, I can't say no to you<br /><br />I've completely lost myself and I don't mind, I can't say no to you<br /><br />Shouldn't have let you conquer me completely<br /><br />Now I can't let go of this dream, can't believe that I feel<br /><br />Good enough, I feel good enough<br /><br />It's been such a long time coming, but I feel good<br /><br />And I'm still waiting for the rain to fall<br /><br />Pour real life down on me<br /><br />'Cause I can't hold on to anything this good enough<br /><br />Am I good enough for you to love me too?<br /><br />So take care what you ask of me, 'cause I can't say no<br /><br />In closing... once in a great while, a vocalist comes along that has the natural ability just to sing.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|Blake Edward's masterpiece is  bright, funny, intelligent, and thoroughly winning, thanks to his deft direction and the singular presence of its stars.  Stunningly gowned by Givenchy, Audrey Hepburn makes the part of Holly Golightly completely her own, and is so captivating, one couldn't care less how greatly the film differs from Truman Capote's much darker novella.  George Peppard is her praiseworthy partner in his most memorable role.  To better complement his spirited co-star, he plays Paul Varjak quietly, radiating a natural humor, pride, warmth, and grace.  With astonishing blue eyes, perfect hair, cardigans, tweed jackets, and penny loafers, Paul is achingly handsome and infinitely desirable.<br /><br />New York shines in a way that no place can anymore. The film is an unabashed love letter to the City where, in 1961, gorgeous young people could live quirky, bohemian lives in brownstones on the Upper East Side, expect to be treated with courtesy and humor in upscale enclaves like Tiffany's (but not, I'm afraid, in the Public Library), and throw parties that you'd love to attend, with delightfully zany guests.<br /><br />A professional escort, Holly's dates give her $50 for the powder room and another $50 for cab fare.  A struggling writer, Paul is kept in style by a rich older woman.  But no matter: these pesky realities, played down to appease 60's sensibilities (and censors), become moot in the refracted light of their beauty, style, and poignant vulnerability.<br /><br />Modern viewers are justly scandalized by Mickey Rooney's shamelessly stereotyped Japanese neighbor, but one must simply chalk it up to a silly theatrical convention of the time.  Countering this unfortunate image is the appearance of a rather chic Japanese woman,  presented with no special inflection whatsoever, at Holly's kooky cocktail party.<br /><br />Elegant photography sets the stage, and Henry Mancini's Oscar-winning music frames it.  From the poignant opening musical sequence to the last full-orchestra arrangement of `Moon River', with soaring French Horn obligato, Mancini displays his complete mastery.<br /><br />What can one say for such a rich gift but THANKS.ce to the last full-orchestra arrangement of `Moon River', with soaring French Horn obligato, Mancini displays his complete mastery. <br /> <br />What can one say for such a rich gift but THANKS.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|As a Sci-Fi fan, I decided to get this movie based solely on the rating. Didn't even bother reading the reviews. <br /> <br />I've never watched the TV series, and didn't even know they were related.  <br />But after this movie, I immediately got the TV Series. <br /> <br />So, I guess that what I can tell you that's gonna be useful is that you don't need to like or even know the TV series to like this movie. The characters are great, and the plot is quite catching. <br /> <br />All you need in order to like this movie is to like Sci Fi movies. And if you're like me, this movie will convert you into a fan. <br /> <br />Hopefully they'll see that this show is worth it by the sheer number of DVD sales and maybe return it to the small screen.
055358202X|5.0|I was surprised to read the reviews for this book on Amazon. Some people feel that the story did not progress very much in this book, but I feel that it did. <br /> <br />The Cersei chapters were the most interesting, because it is a character study in how power corrupts. We initially see her drive Jaime away, and then slowly she begins to isolate herself because of her paranoia. By the end she is alone and powerless, and everything begins to unravel around her. I love it when Petyr says that he expected her to disintigrate, but not this quickly! <br /> <br />Jaime is another interesting character study. Throughout the book we see him struggle with his vows, and he tries to keep them even when it is quite difficult. He is known throughout the realm as the oathbreaker, and rather than descend even further he tries restore his honor. He slowly drifts away from Cersei until at the end he no longer loves her. <br /> <br />After the seven kingdoms come apart at the seams in the first three books, we begin to see the effects it is having on the people. As the nobles play their game of thrones, the suffering masses begin to turn to their religions. Throughout the book we see the slow rise in power of the High Septon and the masses of \\"sparrows\\" who are his followers. I think you are seeing the rise of an inquisition-style cleansing of the noble sinners. Now that they are armed they have real power in the realm. <br /> <br />There are also other forces at play such as Catelyn in the Brotherhood Without Banners, the Iron Men attacking the Tyrells, Jaqen H'guar and Samwell in Oldtown, and Arya's new training in Braavos. Will the Iron Men take Oldtown, and if so will the realm break apart further as Sam indicated?  <br /> <br />A great read and I cannot wait until the next book.
B000065VA1|5.0|Many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career.  For Peter Gabriel, every album is an experiment.  Usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm; however, on Gabriel's fifth experiment, SO, the ex-Genesis frontman does the exact opposite.  Gabriel, beloved for always doing something different, decided on this album to play it safe - and for Gabriel, that is an experiment.  Previously he was a sort of cult performer, but on SO, Gabriel finally made it into the spotlight.  Big time.  SO was an immense success, peaking at number one on the Billboard Top 100, receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews (in 2003, So placed 187th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time), and resulting in a sold-out tour.    Which brings us to one nagging term: \\"sellout\\".     Though most who loved Peter Gabriel's first four albums loved SO as well, there are still many who call SO Gabriel's sellout album.  To me, that's just foolishness.  Peter Gabriel has never \\"sold out\\" and I have no doubt that he never will.  It's clear that on SO he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction, but that's probably the biggest experiment Gabriel has ever undertaken, save for his subsequent release, PASSION.  One popular theory amongst Gabriel fans is that the album's title, SO, is in fact an acronym for \\"Sell Out\\" (hence the uppercase capital \\"S\\" and the lowercase italicized \\"o\\").  I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was.     SO does sound very different from Gabriel's earlier albums (though then again, none of those sounded alike either).  If anything, it resembles Gabriel's third self-titled release, nicknamed MELT.  The thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on SO - is a feeling of warmth on that album, unlike the harsh, gritty darkness of MELT.  Perhaps that's why listeners found SO so charming.     What does SO have to offer?  Well, a lot.  For one thing, there's the atmosphericopening, \\"Red Rain\\", one of Gabriel's finest tracks.  Like many of the tracks on the album, it's dominated by ethereal guitar from David Rhodes and heavenly synthesizers, courtesy of Gabriel himself.  Then there's one of the biggest hits of 1980s (which also spawned what may be the best music video in history), \\"Sledgehammer,\\" inspired by the motown music Gabriel listened to as a child.  With its pounding, industrial percussion, playful bass (by Gabriel's exclusive bass man, Tony Levin) and clever, sexually suggestive lyrics, it's no surprise that \\"Sledgehammer\\" was a hit.  After letting his silly side out, Gabriel tries to inspire with \\"Don't Give Up\\", a nice song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician, Kate Bush.     The subsequent track, \\"That Voice Again\\", is my personal favorite song from this album.  It features some excellent drumming from Manu Katche, an immensely-talented drummer who has also played with artists like Sting, along with misty guitars, delightful synthesizers, and fine lyrics hit home by Gabriel's pained singing.  Like the best tracks on SO, \\"That Voice Again\\" manages to be fun, moody, uplifting, powerful, warm, and inspirational, all at once.     Gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy, powerful \\"Mercy Street\\", a song inspired by and written about Anne Sexton, an American mental patient who relieved her depression through writing.  As on his previous albums, Gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out \\"Big Time\\", a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video.  \\"Big Time\\" features heavy drumming from Stewart Copeland, the former drummer of The Police, as well as some awesome CMI by Simon Clark.  \\"We Do What We're Told (Miligram's 37)\\" is about the experiments of Yale professor Stanley Milgram.  Milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors, who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible.  Milgram observed that his subjects would do what hetold them to do, despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors.  He follows that rather cold song with \\"This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds)\\", a tensely surreal tune.     The album closes with one of Gabriel's most famous songs, \\"In Your Eyes\\".  Most people are familiar with the song from its usage in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy masterpiece ... SAY ANYTHING, where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history.  It's one of Gabriel's warmest and most romantic compositions, and also one of his best.  On the original LP version of SO, \\"We Do What We're Told\\" closed out the album.  That's a fine way to end it, but it's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album.  When the album was re-released remastered on CD in 2002, Gabriel placed \\"In Your Eyes\\" at the end of the album as he originally intended.  Now that is the way to end it!     So - how does SO rank among the many other brilliant works of Peter Gabriel?  Well, it ranks quite highly, actually.  It's one of the pinnacles of Gabriel's career, though whether it truly is the peak or not is hard to say.  After all, how can one compare Gabriel's albums when they are all so vastly different?  Certainly, though, SO is one of the finest Gabriel masterpieces.  This is fun, well-crafted, emotional music.  SO is SO wonderful.
B000002H2H|5.0|In my oppinion this is their second greatest album, only becuase it is thier second album.  But people who were worried that Metallica couldn't top their first effort were more then pleasantly suprised by this release.  Metallica just went forward and produced another one of metal's greatest albums.  Ride the Lightening has it all... blistering riffs and solos, awsome vocals, and a touch of maturity in songs like Fade to Black and Call of the Ktulu.  This album is non-stop greatness that pounds you in the skull and leaves you for dead.
006085880X|4.0|This book was a page-turner. The chapters alternated between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\", before and after one of the characters dies from a gunshot wound to the head. This was effective in building tension in the plot and helping the reader learn more about the background of their story. Character development, particularly of the two teenagers, is broad and detailed. In my mind, the title is just a bit misleading, because the majority of this book is not about a \\"Suicide Pact\\". It is about the different perspectives and how the parents react and handle the death of one of the teenagers. It is about a lot more than a pact.     There is a highly suspenseful courtroom drama which I enjoyed. The best part of the story was the exploration of a relationship (two kids grow up together, next door to each other, their families are great friends, and the children are best friends who are inseparable and eventually become involved as boyfriend and girlfriend as teenagers.) It brought questions to my mind about the difficulty that one might not anticipate as the relationship changes from childhood best friends to teenagers \\"in love\\".     I would rate the ending about a three-star, but overall the book is four stars. The book includes humor, pathos and a sense of despair as well as a love story. This is the third Jodi Picoult novel I've read. It is on par with the other two, My Sister's Keeper and The Tenth Circle. I don't know the general audience that reads this author and her stories, but I expect you won't be disappointed if you've read any of her other novels. If not, this is probably a good place to start, as would be My Sister's Keeper.
B000G75AE8|4.0|Brutal, fast paced, relentless, as if Dave Lombardo had never left the band. Guitars riff more and solo less than before but this album picks up where Seasons In The Abbyss had left.Lyrics are still satanic but deal more with present subjects like war and religion (enough evil there to write 100 albums ).Production is( maybe purposely) very raw and dirty (similar to the latest Venom album) and lacks bottom end and upper treble, making it a nightmare to eq. Vocals are very low in the mix but I like that way.Great band, great record; this album comes to rescue them from their horrendous past albums like God Hates Us All and the like.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|Words fail me on this CD, but not in a bad way. With so many expectations arising from their hugely selling CD \\"Fallen\\", and with the turmoil that came with Ben Moody leaving the band, I wasn't really sure what to expect from this CD. After listening to it a few times over the last couple of days, I'm still not sure what to expect. The first thing that hits me is the fact that this is clearly the Amy Lee show now. There are no male backup vocals, not that there were many before, but the beauty of songs like Anywhere was the dichotomy of Amy's voice with David Hodge's was what made the song. Now this almost feels like Amy Lee and the Evanescences. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. <br /> <br />Now, on to the music. I wish I could say I was an old school fan who listened to them before they got big, but that would be a lie. I first heard of them through the Daredevil soundtrack, got Fallen when it came out, and was very impressed. There was so many layers and so much depth, yes it was MASSIVELY overproduced, but in reality, what isn't these days? I then went back and through the magic of the internet, acquired Origin and their early EPs, and the change between their early stuff and Fallen was incredible. It was barely even the same band. Gone were simple little songs dealing with their lives (Exodus, Solitude), and in were grandiose songs with Christian allusions (let's not kid each other here, if you think there's not Christian overtones to their songs, listen to Hello or the latin part - well really the whole song - of Whisper). They were both good, but clearly two different bands. <br /> <br />Now, why all the background? Because I think it's good to know where a review comes from. I've heard most, if not all, of the songs the band has created. Now, on to The Open Door. This CD still has some huge songs, lots of strings, lots of layering of vocals, but it just doesn't seem to have the same feel as their previous works. This CD is much more personal, and deals with issues that I'm assuming Amy was dealing with (I don't know anything about their personal lives, and I don't care about their personal lives), but the subject matter is much different here. The prime example of that is Call Me When You're Sober, the first single. This is a nice song, but it has the feel of any other radio-friendly single. It has the pounding guitars, the meandering piano, all topped off with Amy's unique voice. This is an intensely personal song, but it just doesn't fit with the old Evanescence sound. That can be used to describe much of this CD. <br /> <br />In all of the songs on here, the one that truly stands out is Lacrymosa which takes one of the most powerful pieces of music ever (Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem, if you haven't heard Requiem, go buy it). The latin lyrics (\\"Lacrimosa dies illa\\" - Tearful that day) add so much depth to the song, but I can't help but feel that this song has a distinct resemblance to one of their unreleased songs called Anything for You. It has the same feel, the huge opera, and if you take away the techno beat in Anything for You, you have this song. That's not a bad thing, since that is an unreleased song, but simply an observation. There are a few other songs that really stand out on here too, Cloud Nine, with the pounding guitars and the orchestration that leads into the bridge, really quite a good song. Their ballads are quite nice as well, this is getting to be too long of a review. <br /> <br />Anyway, this CD, it's good, but not stunning. It will keep most of their \\"new\\" fans happy, although my guess is that most of their fans from the olden days, those from Arkansas who saw them before they were anything, are long since gone. This band has gone through many changes through the years, and this is just another one of those changes. When I'd heard Ben left, I din't have much hope for this CD, when you lose your main songwriter, there is naturally going to be changes. Amy and group really do try, but there's just not the feeling that I get listening to the old songs, like you're listening to something special. This just feels more run of the mill, interesting, but nothing to write home about. But hey, what do I know?
0684135051|3.0|EZ's breezy style is fun and inspiring, it's a good theory book, but her actual patterns are vague and not so easy to follow. I made one of the hats she described and had to do quite a bit of unraveling and puzzling over her instructions to get it to come out decent. For a more specific guide to knitting sweaters in the round, try Ann Budd's \\"Book of Sweater Patterns\\".
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I loved Evanescence's first album Fallen and their previously unreleased album Origin.  My biggest fear since being a fan in the early days was that their fame would have them churning out sub standard music.  And now that's happened.  This album is ok.  It's not terrible but it's lacking the soul that they used to have.  This feels like a mass produced album to make money rather than a heart felt musical expression.

B000GY729M|4.0|When an artist or group has a mega selling debut album, most record companies prefer groups to follow up that mega hit first album with more of the same type of music on the artist's second release.<br /><br />But instead of releasing an album of songs that sound like a continuation of HOT FUSS, the Killers show off their versatility & that they are not afraid to take chances by releasing songs sounding distinctly differant from their first album.<br /><br />The rock driven first single WHEN WE WERE YOUNG might be the 3rd or 4th best song on the album which is filled with more rock oriented music than the first album.<br /><br />The one constant on SAMS TOWN is that even the rock oriented songs are songs that could very easily be remixed for the clubs and become dance favorites.<br /><br />If you are looking for a MR. BRIGHTSIDE part two, READ MY MIND is probably the most potential radio friendly single of the album. The song's catchy chorus, layered keyboards, & hard driven beat make this song a sure fire potential hit.<br /><br />BONES is another catchy up beat 80ish sounding new wave type song that would sound as good at the clubs while dancing on the dance floor, as it would sound on a rock radio station.<br /><br />Other stand out songs & potential singles include the title track- SAMS TOWN, FOR REASONS UNKOWN & THE RIVER IS WILD.<br /><br />Buy SAMS TOWN. It is a nice change of pace from HOT FUSS but yet has A lot of the same catchy driving beat uptempo type songs that made you like HOT FUSS.
B00005OWEG|5.0|A long awaited version of this cult film. Even Francis Ford Coppola has been submitted to cuts in one of his most important films. They say it was commercial. They know it was not... entirely. One main scene was cut off : the French plantation scene that reveals how the Americans had played a double game during the war in Indochina between the Viet Minh and the French : they had helped the Viet Minh and hence had produced the French defeat. Poor loser's explanation, for sure, and yet not entirely false. Think of the Americans helping Saddam Hussein against Iran, or the Djihad in Afghanistan against the Soviets. We know the results. Double agents are always those who lose in the end. But this full and final cut of the film, though it does not change the meaning of the film, does change the depth of this meaning. We get down into horror little by little as we go up the river. Of the five men on the boat the first to die is the black soldier, and then the second to die is the black sergent. The blacks have been eliminated first : quite a symbolical truth. The third victim will be the white soldier from New Orleans who speaks French. It is also very symbolical today, though maybe less in those days, though it was symbolical of what happened to the French in Indochina : they were defeated. The only two survivors are the two white pure Americans. But what is shown under a new depth is the meaning of this horror. We could have thought Kurtz used the basic and daily horror of those historically-retarded jungle people to impose savagery and total carnal violence. But what appears now is that it is not the savagery of these people that produced their war but it is the war imposed from outside that produced the savagery, or liberated this savagery from its box. In other words a war that comes from outside, and I have the propension to think all wars always come from outside, even the most patriotic and justified defensive war, such a war liberates the deepest layers of the survival instinct in man, not even the animal instinct of survival. These men who commit gratuitously-embellished violence do not plainly aim at surviving which would simply imply killing their adversaries, enemies or challengers.They survive in a completely different way : they have the feeling to be alive because they make the other die in atrocious suffering and in the most barbaric way. It is not so much the dying of the enemy that gives them this feeling of being alive, but the torture, the suffering, the horror in which this death is performed. In other words it is no longer only the survival instinct that is at stake but it is also the pleasure instinct. In other words they transform the cold necessary killing of an enemy into a hot pleasurable sexual event that replaces real sexuality. Killing in such a horrible way becomes a pleasurable intercourse and the victim is seen as fulfilling its destiny, just like the buffalo that is killed at the end of the film. A man who enters such a war is supposed to accept his dying in such a sacrificial way because that is his ultimate function. But then where is the war ? We have regressed to the emergence of humanity from animality, of man from the animal he was before : this dire moment when human beings felt that killing animals had a religious dimension, when human beings felt that killing their enemies had a religious dimension, that is to say in both cases a pleasurable power dimension. That led humanity to inventing religions, religions that originally always justified the killing of enemies and that provided the believers with the conviction that they had special powers enabling them with unfailing and totally justified capabilities, powers. But what will remain after this thrilling sensation of absolute power provided to soldiers by those sophisticated new technologies that kill with a micronic precision ? The horror, nothing but the horror, the haunting and gnawing question : Why did I do this ? Why did I feel pleasure when doing it ? Why does it feel so easy to go beyond limits that should never be trespassed, such as into torturing activities ? And for us the film brings up one question : Is there a Kurtz in each one of us ? Is there an Eichman in each one of us ? Is there an Auschwitz in each one of our memories ? Coppola seems to tell us that war is a Pandora's Box that we better not open. Coppola is in phase with Clive Barker who tells you war, and maybe life, is a secret cube that you must not open because beyond it there is nothing but suffering and the pleasure of inflicting as well as receiving that suffering. The old film was a masterpiece, this new director's cut, or redux is a biblical masterpiece : think of Abraham who is going to sacrifice his own son with the full assent of everyone around him, or at least no protest from them, including the son himself, and God replacing the son with a ram at the very last minute to symbolise that humanity has to move away from any type of human sacrifice, even in war. Human life is sacred and no human being has the right to take one single human life away. That's where Kurtz is wrong : everyone has the right to judge him, to call him a murderer, but no one has the right to perform justice and to kill him to do so, except in a completely perverted version of rightfulness.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnesure when doing it ?

0634049011|5.0|Many people are comparing this to Logic because they purchased that first, however, I bought this title first and I love it, I can finally find my way around the fretboard in a methodic manner instead of just wandering around until I found a note that I'd needed.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|You guys have to be prepared with this album.  I know a lot of Evanescence fans can't wait to purchase this cd, rip it open and let your ears pick up the blissful paradise that is Evanescence.  Heck, I expected that too.  It didn't happen though.  Some first thoughts might be that there are not too many mainstream songs on this album.  Some of these songs you might even hate on first listen.  Being a huge fan of all of their previous work (Before Fallen as well), I was severely dissapointed in this album.  But being the Evanescence fan that I am. I gave it a second chance, and then a third.  Still didn't help.  But suddenly I would start humming certain verses in my head randomly during the day.  And then I realized that I got caught in the magic of this album.    This album is no way near as catchy and glammed up as Fallen.  However it doesn't take a complete turn around from the album.  Which is very smart of Amy to do.  She gave us the stuff we were looking for (like \\"Weight Of The World\\", and \\"Lithium\\"), and then she finally got the chance to do stuff that she wanted to do (like \\"Lose Control\\" and \\"Good Enough\\").  This album is like an under rated treasure.  You have to appreciate what's inside.  The more you listen to this album and understand what it's about, the more you will crave it and get addicted to it, and you will just be washed away by this honest to god MASTERPIECE.  Fact being that every song is not radio material, but once you look beyond that you will realize that each song was very well written and each song can stand on it's own.  The more I listen to this album, the more infatuated I become with it.  Its so good that it gives me chills.  (The good kind)
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse has done it.  This might be the first epic record that I've heard since Soundgarden's Superunknown, however the two are totally unrelated musically.  They sure have picked up and surpassed the incredible album Absolution.  This album just flows right from the get go.  From the opener \\"Take a Bow\\", we get the intense Starlight, which just rocks.  Other standout tracks are Supermassive Black Hole, with it's poppy groove beat, the beautiful \\"Invincible\\", and the rocker, \\"Assassin\\".  They weave their synth beats in with crazy guitars and excellent rhythem sections.  The stand out track though has to be the last, \\"Knights of Cydonia\\".  A throwback to 70's glamrock.  Awesome!! Get this album
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence's 'The Open Door' isn't as bad as some say. I personally found it to be an exceptional work that belongs with their other compositions. However, it did take a few listenings to really enjoy it.<br />Here are the tracks and what I thought:<br /><br />1. Sweet Sacrifice- Nice, upbeat song that really gets the album started and leaves the listener pumped for the rest of the album. 10/10<br /><br />2. Call Me When You're Sober- 1st single of the album, kind of pop but still good nonetheless. 9/10<br /><br />3. Weight of the World- Nice song, about not being held back by past decisions. 9/10<br /><br />4. Lithium- Slow, emotional song, probably the \\"My Immortal\\" of the album. Unbelievable lyrics and vocals. 10/10 (It is also supposed to be the 2nd single of the album)<br /><br />5. Cloud Nine- Another song about not being held back. Still cool, though. 9/10<br /><br />6. Snow White Queen- My personal favorite. The vocals give me shivers up my spine when I listen to it. 10/10<br /><br />7. Lacrymosa- Cover of Mozart's \\"Lacrimosa.\\" Cool mix of Evanescence and Mozart, along with meaningful lyrics. 10/10<br /><br />8. Like You- The lyrics to this song are kind of like the theme of \\"Even In Death\\" on Evanescence's 1st album 'Origin.' (\\"I long to be like you, lie cold in the ground like you\\" and \\"You're not alone, I'll be right beside you forevermore\\") 9/10<br /><br />9. Lose Control- Odd song that really sticks out in my mind. Cool lyrics that are wonderful and creative (\\"Mary had a lamb, his eyes as black as coals. If we play very quiet my lamb, Mary never has to know\\".) I don't know why, but I like that. 9/10<br /><br />10. The Only One- Good song, basically saying you're not alone. Good lyrics and awesome vocals. 9/10<br /><br />11. Your Star- This is one of those songs you have to read along with the lyrics to fully appreciate the beauty of it. 9/10<br /><br />12. All That I'm Living For- I think it's cool how Amy's vocals sound in the chorus. Also has very good lyrics. 10/10<br /><br />13. Good Enough- The intro to this song is supposed to be taken from the \\"Narnia Track\\" Amy did for the movie, but was rejected for being 'too epic.' The song itself is sad and happy at the same time. Don't know how, but Amy pulled this off. The lyrics are about how she's finally out of her sadness, yet doesn't know if she's good enough to be loved. 10/10<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this album a 9.5/10 because I could tell all the lyrics were from the heart, the vocals were phenomenal, and the cover art was also great. I just hope the coming singles will have some b-sides so I can enjoy even more from them!Track\\" Amy did for the movie, but was rejected for being 'too epic.'

B000GY729M|4.0|The follow up to Hot Fuss reminds me a lot of David Bowie mixed in with a little bit of Depeche Mode, especially with Brandon Flowers' keyboard in the songs and the heavy bass lines. \\"Why do I keep counting?\\" - this song is very much like something you'd hear on a Queen or Bowie album.  The song almost reminds me of \\"Under Pressure\\" by Queen and Bowie.  <br />\\"Take me to the place where the white boys dance\\" - This song has a very good bass line and good guitar riffs, but to me just sounds like early depeche mode stuff.  If you like depeche mode or Bowie, then you will love this album. It still has that element that we all love in the first Killers album, but shows a lot of growth and maturity.  <br />\\"When you were young\\" - This song is very much like something you'd find on Hot Fuss with it's synth background and melodic guitar barely punching through from the background. This is a great song, especially with the tempo change late in the song.  <br />\\"Uncle Johnny\\" - The first thing I think when I hear this song is Oasis or perhaps Bowie. This song actually at first listen reminds you of something you'd hear on an early Cure album. The song has an addictive background guitar riff. Overall a good catchy rock tune. <br /> <br />\\"This River is Wild\\" - Definately shows that Springstein reference, but is done well and doesn't really copy his sound, but merely polishes it, which in itself is a compliment. Overall a great song. <br /> <br />\\"Sam's Town\\" - One word describes this song; Talking Heads. The music and the way Flowers sings this song is very Talking Heads. It seems as though on this album the Killers decided to pull out all the 80's alternative albums and mix them all into one album and throw in their own small blend of lyrics. They did it well. This is one catchy album after a couple listens. <br /> <br />\\"Read my Mind\\" - My favorite song on this album hands down. The harmony in the background is gorgeous. This song reminds me of something you'd hear FreddieMercury belting out in some 80's teen flick. Great song! <br /> <br />\\"My List\\" - By far my 2nd favorite song on this album. I think I enjoy it so much because it reminds me of one of my favorite Depeche Mode songs called \\"Judas\\" of of their album \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\". This song is great and reminds me of something you'd hear in a romance movie while a guy is walking down the street and they keep flashing scenes of his lover and their breakup. Excellent song and definately shows the versatility and growth of the killers.  <br /> <br />\\"For Reasons Unknown\\" - This song reminds me very much of Natalie from Hot Fuss. A good song and very vintage Killers. <br /> <br />\\"Exitlude\\" - this song reminds me a lot of the Beatles at first listen, especially the background harmony sounds like Ringo belting out some Sgt. Pepper's tune or Let it Be closer. A great way to close the album with a song that sounds like you'd hear it in a small bar somewhere with close friends. <br /> <br />\\"Bones\\" - Once again I hear that Depeche Mode sound especially with the keyboards in the beginning. A great 80's feel. This song sounds a lot like something you'd hear from a band like Soundteam or Pete Yorn. Nothing special, but a catchy tune none the less. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall the follow up to one of my favorite albums of all time \\"Hot Fuss\\", this sophomore album was not a dissapointment. It is different than the normal killers we are used to hearing, but they show growth and pay homage to some great 80's idols and do it without copying, but by putting their own unique blend of themselves in each song. This album is one that gets better with each listen much like Hot Fuss did. This is a good road trip album. I highly suggest you get it and if you really like it I suggest you check out some of the bands they harkon to such as Depeche Mode, The Cure, David Bowie, Queen, and Sound Team. You won't be dissapointed.
B00000DNCF|4.0|i'm surprised that with all of the \\"scholarly\\" reviews of the covers on this limited edition, nobody has pointed out that the lyrics on \\"into the void(sealth)\\" are not the original lyrics from black sabbath's version.  they are actually from a speech delivered by chief seattle(sealth) during treaty negotiations with dominant white settlers in the 1850's.  refer to the children's book \\"brother eagle, sister sky,\\" by susan jeffers for the lyrics to this version. <br />also, having been a soundgarden fan well before this album came out, i cannot agree that this album is their best, although it was the beginning of their commercial success.  in my humble opinion, \\"ultramega\\" and \\"louder than love\\" really capture the essence of soundgarden and the underground scene pre 1991 and the seattle explosion that made \\"alternative\\" music mainstream. <br />it's a shame the albums that enabled these bands to enjoy commercial success often overshadow the albums that are lesser known and capture the music scene in it's undiluted form.  i guess it's like san francisco and the \\"summer of love.\\"  by the time the rest of the nation new about san francisco in 1967, the real essence of the renaissance that had happened had already been replaced by runaway girls from all over the country, speed, and the commercialism of what was going on.   <br />anyway, if you really want to check the seattle music scene, skip the pearl jam and go for the mother love bone.  check out mudhoney, melvins, green river, and don't forget queensryche.  oh, and contrary to what some may say, jimi hendrix was never a part of any seattle music scene.  he was born in seattle but came up on the east coast before going into the millitary and eventually going to england to form the experience. <br />ranting aside, badmotorfinger is a great album and i burnt it up when it came out.  gwan head an gittit.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The Open Door is definitely an open door to great music. <br /> <br />In my mind it is a masterpiece and the best album of 2006. <br /> <br />To me, this album is much better than fallen and a definite maturation and growth for Evanescence. <br /> <br />It is an album full of very emotional, deep and dark songs which are heavy to take in at times, but these songs are so well put together and have such powerful lyrics that once you listen to it over and over again, they begin to take on meanings that transcend sound into pure feeling. <br /> <br /> <br />The music is wonderfully classic goth rock and so beautiful and painful, some songs make you want to cry (Like You). <br /> <br />The standouts of this album are: Lacrymosa, Like You, Lithium, All that I'm Living for and Snow White Queen. <br /> <br /> In addition I have heard the song \\"The Last Song I'm wasting on You\\" and it is a gorgeous song and the song that best shows off the maturation and talent of Miss Lee as composer, singer and songwriter. <br /> <br />I applaud Evanescence for coming out with a great, classic album!!! <br /> <br />This album is definitely worth buying!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This is pretty nice laid back, enchanted music. I like all the songs but still enjoyed the music of tool better. Though I was always trying to find a more laid back version of tool with a darker, more melancholy mood.  To me a very unknown english band more than fills in that void, a band called Anathena. I so happened to come by the album by a refrence from 10 years review. I cannot believe the album isn't very popular in the states, it amazing, layred, melody's flow from it and you become obsorbed in the etheral state it puts you in. If you like this 13th step, check out Anathemas judgement, or any other album, it smokes maynards side project, but is right up there with tool, just more laid back.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence broke grounds with their debut album, Fallen. Since then, they've gone through many struggles. From losing band members, to firing their manager, to one of the band members having a stroke. You'd think all of these things would result in a weak follow up album. Think again.<br /><br />The first thing you'll hear when you pop in the CD is the lyrics \\"It's true, we're all a little insane\\". That right there should set the tone for this amazing album. The first song, Sweet Sacrifice, is a catchy opening song that will having you singing along as soon as you hear it. It's much more experimental than anything on Fallen.<br /><br />Call Me When You're Sober, the first single off the album, mixes bluesy tones with rock. The result being Amy Lee's take on her relationship with ex-boyfriend Shaun Morgan. It's a good song, but suprisingly is probably the weakest on the album. It's not that the song is weak in nature, but it pales in comparison with some of the other songs on this album.<br /><br />Weight of the World starts out with a great insrumental intro. Once you get into the song, you'll notice that Amy tends to use some of her lower register during this song. There really isn't an accurate way to describe it, other than there is no way that you won't like it. It's that awesome.<br /><br />Lithium. Oh, Lithium. This is by far the most amazing song on the entire album. It's a true highlight on an unbelievable album, and that's obviously saying something about the quality of this song. First off, it's a ballad from Evanescence. It follows in the footsteps of their Fallen mega hit \\"My Immortal\\". I personally think that this song outdoes any ballad that they've ever done, including \\"My Immortal\\".<br /><br />Cloud Nine starts out with a creepy tone to it. The first thing about this song that will hit you is it's not you're typical rock song. It's more pop-rock than anything. With Amy's voice, believe me, that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />Snow White Queen is probably one of the most lyrically satisfying songs I've ever heard. It's a song from the perspective of a stalker. Basically the stalker is saying that if you give him or her the chance, you'll understand them better. It's quite creepy, as you could imagine<br /><br />Lacrymosa is classical music taken to a whole new level. Amy's classical music training really shines through on this song, and the choir background makes this song even better. It's a brilliant update to a classic Mozart piece. What more could be said?<br /><br />Like You is this album's \\"Hello\\". It's a song dedicated to Amy's sister that passed away when she was young. Like \\"Hello\\", it's lyrics are haunting and sad. With lyrics like \\"I long to be like you, lie cold in the ground like you\\", it's obviously a very personal song to Amy. Also like \\"Hello\\", don't ever expect this one to be part of Evanescence's live show.<br /><br />Lose Control is unlike anything you've ever heard from Evanescence. The synthesized quality of this track makes it unique. Not to mention lyrics like \\"Mary had a lamb, his eyes black as coal -- If we play very quiet my lamb, Mary never has to know\\", you can expect you'll be keeping this song on repeat for quite sometime after you get used to the style of it.<br /><br />The Only One is a true anthem for any loner, plain and simple. Anyone who's never been understood, for any reason, can relate to this song. Songwise, this is a very strong cut. She uses alot of her higher register in this song too, so that's also pleasing to the ears.<br /><br />Your Star starts out slow and passionate. Then it quickly shifts into an upbeat, catchy chorus that may possibly make you start dancing if you're not careful. It's a very original song, and should not be looked over. I wouldn't be suprised if it is considered for to be a single in the future.<br /><br />All That I'm Living For is classic Evanescence. It's probably the most Fallen-like song on the entire album, with a mature edge to it. Obviously that's not a bad thing. If you liked most of the songs on Fallen, then you'll love this song.<br /><br />Good Enough ends this amazing album on a positive note. The album goes through many emotions, but the one emotion that this song will envoke is happiness. The song starts out with a lengthy instrumental intro. The song itself, oddly enough, is very gospel-like. Beyond that, it's hard to explain how the song feels. It's a very passionate song that ends the album on a high note.<br /><br />This album is a must buy. It may take a few listens to truely sink in, but once it does, I can assure you that it won't leave your CD player months. Like Fallen, every single song on the album is amazing in it's own way. In a day and age where you'd be lucky to find more than one good song on an album, Evanescence always seems to pack their albums with quality songs. To sum it up, go ahead and purchase this album. I promise you that you won't regret the decision.sly that's not a bad thing.

B00005JOYM|3.0|This was probably one of the toughest movies I've had to review. There are tremendous emotions portrayed here and without question will bring tears to your eyes. It isn't a 5 star movie, and it isn't a 2 star movie. I mean, you could give it 4 stars out of sympathy and respect for the people portrayed in the film, and that would be the only reason I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />The movie is about 2 port authority officers who were pulled from the rubble after 9/11, their families & their ordeal. It doesn't cover the whole event like you might think. In the film, it's interesting to see how they found themselves under the rubble and how they kept themselves alive. It's interesting to see the world from their vantage point, yards beneath the piles of medal and concrete.<br /><br />So, where does WORLD TRADE CENTER fall short for me?<br /><br />It may be unfair to compare, but I watched UNITED 93 about a week before and it was by far, a superior film. After watching UNITED 93, and seeing the mostly unknown actors knock it out of the park, I was taken by the OUTSTANDING realism and the attention to detail. When you looked at the actors portraying the real life victims in the film, you saw the real life victims, not the actors. The anonimity of the unknown actors brought a sense of realism to the project.<br /><br />That brings me to WORLD TRADE CENTER. As the movie began to unfold, I caught myself thinking like this.... \\"Hey, that's Maria Bello. She was in HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. She was hot in COYOTE UGLY. There's Nicholas Cage. Jesus, is he in everything? I wonder when GHOST RIDER is coming out? Who's that guy... oh, yeah, he was in CRASH and MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Oh, yeah, and that's the guy from CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL. Man, there's a lot of stars in this. That's the kid from TITANIC, Leo's friend, Danny Nucci. Ooh, that's Maggie Gyllenhaal. I like her. SECRETARY was good. Her brothers Jake. Oh yeah. That's Stephen Dorff... where's he been? Oh, wow, is that Frank Whaley? Man, where's he been. I remember him from like CAREER OPPORTUNITES. Ooh, wasn't he the guy that gave Sam Jackson his big gulp in PULP FICTION? That's the guy from LOST. The other who posed as a crash victim.\\"<br /><br />To put this point into a shorter prose: the recognizable actors throughout the film were a COMPLETE DISTRACTION. Watching these actors ACT was distracting. It came across too Hollywood to me. The watching through a time window effect that was so amazingly captured by UNITED 93 was NOT at all captured by WORLD TRADE CENTER. It came across like actors portraying someone.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage, one of the most recognizeable stars today, played real life port authority officer John McLoughlin, and it felt like a Hollywood movie and that to me, doomed it. WORLD TRADE CENTER deserved better. When you're looking at these REAL personalities, like McLoughlin & Will Jimeno, you don't want to see big hollywood star Nicholas Cage & the guy from Crash, you want to see the men they're portraying.<br /><br />I don't want to be too harsh on the film. It is a good film, and as much as I hate to say it, I wanted to be brought back to that day. I wanted to be reminded of what happened, like we all should every year, so we never forget why and who did this. I was reminded, but the constant bombardment of recognizable actors kept me from completely being sucked into the film.Whaley? Man, where's he been. I remember him from like CAREER OPPORTUNITES.

0425156842|4.0|I think the breadth of philosophy covered here was very nicely strung together.  Gaardner's explanations and examples are great--they clarify some esoterics.      I feel I benefited from this book, because my curiousity has been piqued.  This may very well be why this book was written in the first place: To ignite readers' interest in philosophy.  That being said, I'm going to be checking out books written by or about a few key people mentioned, most notebly: Hume, Kant, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Hegel.
B000H7JD4K|3.0|Ok, so I am a Maiden fan... but I still don't like this album, even after listening to it for about 15 times now. Maybe I've been listening to too much power metal to enjoy Maiden anymore, but I love Bruce Dickinson's solo career... Why can't Maiden sound like Bruce's music?<br />Many of the songs are very slow and drag on for too long. Due to this reason, this album can easily be classified as Prog Rock rather than Metal.<br />In my opinion it is unfair that some reviewers are comparing this album to the albums Maiden released in the 80's era, this is misleading to many classic Maiden fans.
B000G759LW|4.0|\\"Back To Basics\\" is an incredible 2 disc album. The first disc gives off vibes of early motown, soul, and funk legends such as, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, Ray Charles, etc. It's amazing. The second disc has more of a seductive Marilyn Monroe feel to it. I know Marilyn Monroe wasn't a singer, but the songs gave off that type of vibe to me. The second disc wasn't as good as the first one, but still a great effort from Christina. You definitely get your money's worth with this album. I applaud Christina...\\"Back To Basics\\" is amazing.
B000H305U0|2.0|I really enjoyed \\"Justified.\\"  It was one of those rare albums where I liked every song.  The R&B vibe, coupled with JT's clear falsetto and clever lyrics made for a great disc.  \\"Future Sex,\\" however, is sorely lacking.  In fact, I was bored.  This album could've been one long song because I wasn't sure where one track ended and another began because they're all the same.  JT overuses the breathy, supposedly sexy vocals--leaving his falsetto for the choruses.  On many tracks the lyrics are barely discernable.  Overall, I want my money back.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard JT fan, then buy this.  If you just happened to enjoy the first album, give this a listen before forking over any money.  I wish I had!
B000H7JD4K|3.0|I am a maiden fan, have been for almost 20 years- but i gave up on them a long time ago. They hadn't released a really good album- in my non-expert opinion- since SOMEWHERE IN TIME. This album, first off all, seems to have the band in a state of renewed vigor. The songs here, even though they are very dynamic and have slower parts and intros, pack a bigger wallop this time around. Honestly, I never bothered with DANCE OF DEATH, so i can only compare this to BRAVE NEW WORLD, which was a major letdown to me. I don't know why, really, I mean think about it,..same writing styles, song structures, mostly songs over 7 minutes- maybe it just took three albums back together to really click. I'm impressed this debuted at #9 on the Billboard Charts, thats actually the main reason I got it- I figured something must be up. Best song is the song everyones talking about...\\"Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\"- a powerhouse of a Maiden song. A lot of the songs will take a few listens to sink in, since they are between 7 and 10 minutes long. KILLERS is still their best, and one of the best three metal albums of all time...period.
B000G759LW|5.0|I've enjoyed all her albumsb, but I was still suprised at how good this album is!  When modern artists try to re-imagine classic-era music, they usually fail dismally.  Not so here.  I was particularly impressed with her 'Big Band' songs like \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and \\"Candyman.\\"  The jazz inspired tunes are also good, even though I'm not really a fan of jazz.<br /><br />But, the sexy singer from \\"Stripped\\" can still be found with tracks like \\"Still Dirrty,\\" which is a great dance song and \\"Nasty Naughty Boy,\\" a slow tortuous ballad which made me envision Michelle Pfeiffer in \\"The Fabulous Baker Boys.\\" (You know the scene--in the red dress singing on top of a piano?)<br /><br />Other notable tracks include \\"Slow Down Baby, \\"Oh Mother\\" (as high calibur as \\"Beautiful\\")and \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray.\\"  This may be her best album to date, and certainly it shows she has tremendous talent.  Buy it, there is something here for everyone.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Last night, I watched the documentary, Fog of War, about former Secretary of Defense, Robert S. MacNamara, the Harvard-educated whiz kid who many call the architect of the Vietnam War.  It is the portrait of a brilliant, but profoundly troubled old man who weeps about selecting a plot of ground in Arlington in which to bury JFK, but is steel-eyed as he recounts bombing sorties that destroy hundreds of thousands.  While fighting hard to stay composed, it is evident that MacNamara is haunted by his own dark deeds and the human condition but remains stubbornly out of touch with the part of himself that orchestrated them. <br /> <br />The experiences he recounts - most notably, in WWII, devising ways for U.S. bomb to destroy most of Japan, killing over 100,000 civilians a day to presiding over the Dept of Defense for eight years of the U.S. in Vietnam - are stunning in his application of sophisticated management techniques and statistics to destroy lives and nations.  Were he not on the side of good, he observes at one point, he would surely be tried as a war criminal, to which I would add, on a scale equal to Hitler.    <br /> <br />MacNamara is a very bright man and the film is well done, even if the interviewer couldn't quite decide whether to be in it or not, and therefore doesn't use a microphone for his own questions.  It's also a very valuable instructive tool - recounting in chilling detail how close we came to nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crises, the Cold War, World War II and finally Vietnam.  It is also heavily edited, I would imagine so that MacNamara could be firmly in charge, pulling back and stepping forward as suits him.  It is therefore filled with omissions and lies - the willingness of the U.S. to go to war to protect its economic interests and the fabrication at Johnson's insistence of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, a perfect analog to the trumped up intelligence Bush used to justify invading Iraq.     <br /> <br />Although it is about history and the role of a man who dedicated much of his professional life to efficiently killing people (in the name of ideals and for our leaders, he would hasten to add, sounding very similar to generals in the Third Reich), the film is especially chilling as it lays out Eleven Lessons for our nation, several of which we are flagrantly violating today in Iraq; namely, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8 & 11.  In fact, the parallels between the folly of believing we could win the war in Indochina and our present situation in what was formerly Persia are so profound, it's a wonder there aren't more documentaries, novels, essays and intelligent discourse on the subject.  (Read Graham Greene's The Quiet American, written in the late 50s, and the folly of our efforts in Vietnam is plain enough for an 8th grader to get). <br /> <br />   1. Empathize with your enemy. <br />   2. Rationality will not save us. <br />   3. There's something beyond one's self. <br />   4. Maximize efficiency. <br />   5. Proportionality should be a guideline in war. <br />   6. Get the data. <br />   7. Belief and seeing are both often wrong. <br />   8. Be prepared to reexamine your reasoning. <br />   9. In order to do good, you may have to engage in evil. <br />  10. Never say never. <br />  11. You can't change human nature. <br /> <br />What's even sadder is that as many mistakes and as much damage as MacNamara committed, he is head and shoulders above Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush administration.  That George W. Bush is out of the class of statesman is so obvious, I won't waste time describing how poorly he fares next to JFK, Kruschev and even fellow Texas cowboy, Lyndon B. Johnson.   <br /> <br />Fog of War is an excellent film.  In MacNamara, Shakespeare would feel vindicated for creating some of his darkest characters.  Pure evil does exist.  It is, in its most extreme, as Hannah Arendt alleged after WWII, banal.
0307277674|3.0|After resisting the hype and curiosity to read Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", I finally caved more through desperation than anything. Despite all the debate and the controversy, I found that Brown had written a shocking thing: a novel.<br /><br />The so-called \\"Fact\\" in the novel leaves a lot to be desired, if that is one's thing. However, even when the reader keeps the unreliable nature of these \\"facts\\" in mind, the book is remarkably replete with detail. In my own opinion, this would not even be a problem, if Brown had left it at that without the \\"accurate\\" claim on an early page.<br /><br />The book reads like a rather normal U.S. action movie, with breaks in the narrative at remarkably predictable places, and with remarkably predictable suspense elements. In some cases, this seemed all too contrived and did not work to the best degree. The breaks in the narrative about the cryptex were a case in point. Additionally, the stringing out of the ceremony that Sophie caught her grandfather in became all too much like a cheap infommercial. In this sense, I think other authors are that much superior to this book.<br /><br />I have to agree with another reviewer with their comment that the characters bordered on caricatures, such as Silas the albino assassin and his mad obessession with the cilice and \\"the Discipline\\". Quite often, the psychological development of the characters was just not there, though there is a lot of monologue in the thought and remembering of the characters. A greater psychological depth would have added so much more to the people that flow in and out of the story.<br /><br />While Dan Brown's writing and style may be average, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a great and light read. It is not too taxing on the mind, and it balances the detail well with the action and the details.<br /><br />It was a book that I enjoyed thoroughly. I recommend it, though with the qualification that the hype and sensationalism surrounding it were not justified, in my opinion. Considering the industry that this single book has spawned, I was expecting more from it. Despite this, for a no-brainer read that is fast paced and entertaining, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is quite good.my opinion.

B000E1MTY0|5.0|Watched this HD DVD last night, the picture quality was breathtaking and the TrueHD Sound was superb. It blew away the SD version that I already owned. It was an excellent transfer from film to HD DVD. The picture was very sharp and detail, among the best HD DVDs. The sound was rocking the house during the part where the bat mobile was jumping from roof to roof. The storyline is pretty good showing the childhood of Bruce Wayne to how he became Batman. A must have for any movie fan.
B000006UD8|5.0|This is a two disc set with both the orginal mix and a wonderful remix by bassist Roger Glover. It also includes a great booklet. Machine Head is without a doubt a classic album. Highway Star, Smoke On The Water, Space Truckin', Lazy, Pictures Of Home and list goes on. A masterpiece! Essential music for your home!
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is, perhaps, my favorite movie of any genre of all time. Since I have been a movie addict since I was a teenager many years ago, that is pretty strong stuff. I think the Pixar team outdid themselves on this movie, and I've loved every one they've released previously. The animation is fantastic (machines as people?), the scenery is breathtaking, the story and subplots are rich and well-done and the characters are believable and endearing. The storyline brings alive to the American public the way our desire to \\"save ten minutes\\" has essentially destroyed the towns and businesses along Route 66 at the same time destroying the values and innocence of a period in our recent history when family and neighbors were the strength of our nation. This is not a nostalgia piece so much as it is a wake-up call to what we have left behind in our cellphone/internet/instant-everything/lowest price/high tech/do-it-now society. The funniest scenes: tractor tipping and Mack making faces in the tank truck reflection.

B000E1MTY0|5.0|I will not write a review on the actual content of the movie, but I will rate this 5 stars for the HD picture quality and sound.  I was able to pick up a copy of this before the release date, and it is one of the best titles for picture quality on the format so far.  The image had a nice \\"pop\\" to it and the cityscape scenes were stunning in HD.  The True HD soundtrack is absolutely incredible and shows that the HD-DVD format has more going for it than just a great picture.  I'm sure that the majority of HD-DVD player owners will be purchasing this title, and I can say that it is well worth it.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This album is great.  A wonderful sophomore release from Evanescence.  Amy's songwriting is spellbounding, and it is a little deeper than \\"Fallen\\".  My favorites are \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Lacrymosa\\", and \\"Good Enough\\".  I was a little disappointed UNTIL I got to the last song because I thought that Amy didn't put a slow. beautiful one on there.  I was wrong.  \\"Good Enough\\" is an amazing love song.  \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" is one of their best rock songs, and \\"Lacrymosa\\" is very epic with the choir backing Lee's vocals.  If you are undecided on buying it, I HIGHLY recommend it.
B000GY729M|5.0|Since I love 80's new wave music, it's no surpise that I'm a huge fan of The Killers.  They combine rock and new wave music while giving it a modern twist perfectly.  I thought Hot Fuss was more unique, yet this album is by no means of bad taste.  The whole album is great, \\"When You Were Young\\", \\"Bling\\", and \\"Read My Mind\\" being some of my favorites.  And in response to someone's accusation that The Killers are talentless and can't perform live, I saw one of their \\"secret shows\\" in Vegas, and they couldn't have sounded better.  Brandon has an impeccable voice, and sounds amazing in person (he's also easy on the eyes).  Don't let the sounds of the synthesizer fool you into thinking they're a \\"studio-produced\\" band.  These guys are awesome and I know they'll be around for years to come.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Being a fan of Evanescence since they released ORIGIN back in 2000, I was highly anticipating this release and for the most part it does deliver. However I would be lying if I said that I liked it as well as FALLEN. Some songs on this album are fantastic (such as \\"The Only One,\\" \\"Weight Of The World,\\" \\"Snow White Queen\\" and \\"Lithium\\" come to mind). But other songs on here just seem like a waste of time (\\"Your Star,\\" \\"Lose Control\\", etc.) I will go through now song by song and then give an overall summary of the album.<br /><br />1.  \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" - This was a good song to start off the album. It's not a great song but for an intro, it has a good feel to it.  8/10<br /><br />2.  \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" - For a first single from this album, I don't think it was the best choice because none of the other songs really sound like this. Plus it doesn't sound too radio friendly. But a decent track nonetheless.  6/10<br /><br />3.  \\"Weight Of The World\\" - I love this song, it is easily one of the best songs on this album. It would make a good radio single. 9/10<br /><br />4.  \\"Lithium\\" - This is an obvious choice to become a single. I will be stunned if this song is not the 2nd or 3rd single.  9.5/10<br /><br />5.  \\"Cloud Nine\\" - What the heck is with the ghost singing vocals? The 'ghost singing' in the background of this song really suck because the chorus is otherwise very strong. I just can't get over the ghost vocals though. It takes this song down quite a bit. 6.5/10<br /><br />6.  \\"Snow White Queen\\" - I was afraid this song was going to end up sucking when I heard the verses, however I was pleasantly suprised when I heard the chorus. A great, catchy Evanescence song.  9/10<br /><br />7.  \\"Lacrymosa\\" - A lot of fans seem to really like this song, however I unfortunately am unable to figure out just what is so great about it. I appreciate the bridge in this song starting around the 1:50 mark and the following guitar solo, but otherwise it just comes off as 'annoying and nauseating' to me. 5.5/10<br /><br />8.  \\"Like You\\" - This song is different in the way that I actually love the music during the verses and bridge better than the actual choruses. I still really enjoy this one though. 8/10<br /><br />9.  \\"Lose Control\\" - This song was just...boring. It did not appeal to me at all. One of my least favorites on the album. The only thing I like is the bridge of the song starting around 3:25.  4.5/10<br /><br />10.  \\"The Only One\\" - Now this song is easily my very favorite off of this album. Everything about this song (except the ridiculous 4 second intro) is perfect! This is probably one of my top favorite Evanescence songs overall. Just an incredible song.  10/10<br /><br />11.  \\"Your Star\\" - Unfortunately my favorite song leads right into my least favorite song on the album. I am not quite sure why but this song is just one of their very worst. I think the way she sings \\"I can see your staaaaaarrrrrrrrr\\" just makes me cringe. 4/10<br /><br />12.  \\"All That I'm Living For\\" - This is a really good song when it starts out and then overall it becomes a solid rock song. One of the better heavier songs on the cd. 7.5/10<br /><br />13.  \\"Good Enough\\" - This is a mixed song for me. I like how it is mainly just piano and Amy and some of the melodies during this song are rather pretty, but the song has more of a 'jazz' type feel to it that doesn't fit well with me. Still, it is a good song for them because it is different. 7/10<br /><br />I think overall that this is a worthy album of purchasing. But it lacks any fantastic radio hits. There is no way any song on this album will gain Evanescence the same success that they had with songs like \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal.\\" This album also lacks any of the beautiful solo piano songs that Amy sings the best on. The label and band should both be slapped for leaving the song \\"The Last Song I'm Wasting On You\\" off of this release. That was the only \\"pretty\\" song from any of the new material that I have heard. I wish it were illegal to cut songs recorded during an album's sessions from the final album. It burns me so bad because it is the exact same as tearing chapters out of a book. Damn to hell whatever idiots ever started this whole decision that certain songs should not be included on the final versions of a cd and instead make them 'b-sides'.<br /><br />Anyways I believe that the band Within Temptation has spoiled me with their latest masterpiece called THE SILENT FORCE. That album destroys both THE OPEN DOOR by Evanescence and KARMACODE by Lacuna Coil (who became my very favorite female fronted band after their incredible album UNLEASHED MEMORIES). I will have to wait until Within Temptation releases their next album to determine whether or not they will raise the bar even higher for Lacuna Coil and Evanescence.song from any of the new material that I have heard.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|15,000 years ago most of the northern hemishere was covered in ice, sea levels were 300 feet lower and huge deserts formed due to a lack of rainfall.  Such ice ages occurred many times. <br />50,000,000 years ago the poles had melted and tropical fish were swimming aound the north pole. <br />Humanity may indeed be causing global warming and such a warming may indeed have consequences for human convience, but to imply the planet is threatened with descruction is fear mongering.  The planet has seen far more severe climate changes than what we might experience and such changes have neither destroyed the planet nor the life upon it. <br />Humanity has a tremendous capacity to adapt and any climate changes will happen slow enough that we can adapt to them.  So we have to move beach houses or plant crops in new areas, does any thinking person really belive that we can't handle such changes and that humanity will drown becouse we are too stupid to avoid seas that rise by a few centimeters per year?  Give me a break. <br />The real agenda behind Gore's tirade to create fear.  Liberals love to create fear, it is one of their power bases.  Just listen to NPR, one fear story after another.  Oh woe is us!  The planet is dying!  It's all our fault!  It's all Bush's fault! <br />All this handwringing is simple political manuvering.  The liberals want to create fear and then use that fear to obtain votes.  You can read the other reviews to see how successful they have been in brainwashing thier supporters.
B00005JP87|4.0|Eisenheim the Illusionist (Norton) is taking Vienna by storm.  The year is 1900, and Eisen heim is so talented that his tricks are so good that his audience believes him to be supernatural.  In fact, they may not be wrong.  Crown Prince Leopold (Sewell) is a doubter though, and he gives Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) the task of proving him a fraud.  At a performance, Leopold sends his fianc&eacute;e Princess Sophie (Biel) to the stage as a volunteer.  Little does he know that Sophie and Eisenheim were in love as children, and this reunion will rekindle their romance.  This only intensifies Leopold's determination to end Eisenheim's act for good.<br /><br />Edward Norton is perfect as Eisenheim.  He makes the character likeable and even a little mysterious.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, Rufus Sewell makes Leopold a character that is easy to hate.  Biel and Giamatti deliver solid supporting performances as well.  The story is great, keeping the audience guessing about Eisenheim's gifts until the final minutes.  I recommend finding a theater near you that is playing \\"The Illusionist\\", and check it out.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|This is one of Krall's few albums where most of the material is not familiar to me yet it stands out as her best album yet. Instead of the trio she used  in her earlier sessions, she is again backed by a massive orchestra which can fill your listening area with such wonderful music. Some high points on this album such as 'Isn't It A lovely Day', 'Day In And Day Out' and 'Come Dance With Me'. Carressing voice and big bands are a winner every time. Keep it up Diana!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Let me just say that my little one is absolutely captivated by The Little Mermaid. We're lucky to catch The Little Mermaid during its designated stint out of the \\"Disney Vault\\". To think that she could have otherwise been deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that.<br /><br />I will say that if you indeed do have a little princess that would like to be able to see some of the other Disney princess classics now, it's nice to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy some of the other 5 Star Disney Princess classics that are currently \\"back in the Disney Vault\\" for my young princess through a few of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White, Beauty and the Beast & Sleeping Beauty by the time Disney released them again.<br /><br />So along with your Little Mermaid Amazon purchase, consider taking advantage of purchasing any of the other \\"off-the-market\\" Disney princess classics now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate them as much when Disney decides that it's time.<br /><br />And indeed, you will enjoy all of the Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.<br /><br />Side Note on Resellers: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|This has to be one of the best examples of the music being produced on the west coast in the latter half of the 60's. Unlike so many other \\"psych\\" albums this one holds together superbly - every track has merit. The songs have a wide range of diversity - the rocking \\"Somebody to Love\\", country \\"My Best Friend\\", the raucous \\"3/5 of a mile\\", the acid laden \\"White Rabbit\\" and the haunting tracks \\"Today\\" & \\"Comin' Back to Me\\". The musicianship is excellent and the singers both solo and in harmony work to great effect - what a voice Grace Slick has on this album.  <br />If you have an interest in music and want to add another classic album to your collection then you could do a lot worse than buy this one.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD for years and it has finally happened. My favorite all time movie. I can't imagine why they waited so long to release it. Thanks to whoever made the decision to finally release it.
B000001FRY|5.0|The start of it all. OK so it doesn't sound like their more recent stuff but don't neglect it because of that. As a debut album they don't come much better than this. The sound is spartan and simple - but effective. The one thing about their first three albums was they were complete. Later albums I found to have \\"fillers\\" but there are none to be found here. The anthemic \\"I Will Follow\\" kicks off full of post-punk energy resplendant with Edge's choppy guitar style. There isn't a poor track to be found even the somewhat experimental \\"The Ocean\\" acting as an interlude fits well. I actually fail to understand how anyone who likes U2 couldn't consider this one of their classics. An essential addition to any U2 collection and certainly worthy of interest to any music fan.
0393317552|5.0|Most readers of those two books read \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" before \\"Collapse\\" in the order in which they were published. I, however, read them in reverse order of publication. Many were critical of \\"Collapse\\" because it was too close to \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" in theme and topics covered. I suppose that I am a bit disappointed as well, but not too much.<br /><br />Yes, they cover some of the same material, but really they are the twin sides of the same coin - the rise of societies and the fall of societies. With a little bit of editing, Jared Diamond could have merged these two books into one and created one monster-sized tome (800 plus pages)on the rise and fall of societies around the world.<br /><br />Diamond's theses are cogent, coherent and clear. Really, it is a wonderful volume for the student of world history who wishes to take some steps into the deeper end of the scholarship pool. Despite the easy writing style (Personally, I've never had much respect for some serious scholars who seem to delight in making their texts as dense and difficult as possible), these are lofty thoughts that are often painstakingly laid out.<br /><br />On occasion, Mr. Diamond's descriptions were a little too detailed (especially concerning the domestication of grains) and I found myself skimming several pages. But, those moments were rare and normally I found it to be interesting in the least and from time to time I had an Aha! moment while reading.<br /><br />If you enjoy this one, be sure to read \\"Collapse\\".<br /><br />I give this one an A-.
B000001FA4|4.0|This album was a departure from the first three and was a forebear of the U2 \\"sound\\" which has been their trademark ever since. It lacks the drive and energy of the first 3 albums, instead Eno and Lanois bring a different palette of sounds to U2. It isn't \\"The Joshua Tree\\" but it certainly shows how they got there. \\"Bad\\" is the highlight - used to wonderful effect at LiveAid. \\"Pride\\" and \\"Wire\\" have a fuller sound but reminiscent of their earlier works. Unfortunately the pace is let drop a couple of times giving an incomplete feel to the album. It isn't one of their classic albums but it is definitely worth checking out and should find its way in to any complete U2 collection.
0440234743|5.0|I do not read a lot of book but this was a must read as soon as I started it.  John Grisham describes places and people like very few can do.  If you are anything like me the author must capture me in the first few pages or else I find something better to do.  Loved the book and felt it was worth the time it takes me to read.
B000001FS3|5.0|This album is quite possibly their crowning glory and is what all their other albums are judged by. It continues in the direction that Unforgettable Fire paved the way for. The opening three songs show U2 looking inward, loneliness, relationships, have become rock anthems and a staple for their concerts. The sound is carried over to In God's Country & One Tree Hill. The other tracks display U2's interest in America and it's music. And the way Exit builds is simply superb. An essential album in the annals of rock history and an essential addition to any music collection. Their recent offerings pale compared to this. What do you mean you don't own it yet?
B00005CDNK|5.0|Updated review - March 2015<br /><br />Along with the much loved \\"Super Trouper\\" album, \\"The Visitor's\\" is one of ABBA's best original albums. It is the sound of a group that had matured and the end result is so alien to some people, that many may not even believe ABBA was capable of creating such dark, hauntingly beautiful poems set to ravishingly beautiful music.<br /><br />The title track is a fascinating piece of work. The lyrics and chorus are interesting enough but Frida's solid, uncompromising vocals during the versus combined with the embellished synthesized sound transforms \\"The Visitors\\" in to one of ABBA's most unique and enduring songs.<br /><br />Throughout ABBA's years as a group, Agnetha was chosen as the lead vocalist in several of their tear-jerker ballads; \\"Hasta Manana\\", \\"SOS, \\"My Love My Life\\", \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Happy New Year\\", \\"The Winner Takes it All\\", \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" and in \\"The Visitors\\" she's given several; \\"One of Us\\", \\"Soldiers\\", \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" and as an added bonus \\"The Day Before You Came\\". One of my favorites from this album is the hauntingly gorgeous \\"Soldiers\\". The lyrics recall a war-torn place and time and a sense of helplessness and dread are conjured up (\\"What's that sound what's the dreadful rumble?/Won't somebody tell me what I hear?/In the distance but drawing near/Is it only a storm approaching/All that thunder and the blinding light/In the winters night/In the grip of this cold December...\\") and Agnetha's sorrowful vocals add a touch of pathos to the already solemn atmosphere of the piece. The chorus is also worth mentioning because it's constructed almost like a tongue twister and the meaning of the phrase \\"Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing/The songs that you and I don't/won't sing\\" isn't really clear.<br /><br />\\"Soldiers\\" is followed by the even more enigmatic \\"I Let the Music Speak\\" with Frida on lead vocals. This song has always intrigued me because I don't fully understand what the song is about. It's a whole array of incredibly poetic images (\\"Where Beauty will defeat the darkest day\\"), phrases (\\"I'm hearing images/I'm seeing songs no poet has ever painted\\") and places (\\"I find myself a blind man in some Ancient valley\\"). It's also one of the most theatrical songs Bjorn and Benny ever wrote for ABBA. \\"I Let the Music Speak\\" is also one of Frida's best vocal performances to date along side \\"Like an Angel Passing Through My Room\\". The latter song is simple in form but strikingly beautiful in sound and mind.<br /><br />There are a couple of upbeat songs in \\"The Visitors\\". \\"Head Over Heels\\" is a charming ditty which features Agnetha as lead vocalist and showcases her beautiful voice and her ability to adapt to various styles of music. Bjorn takes the lead in \\"Two For the Price of One\\". Listening to \\"The Visitors\\" from beginning to end is a moving and sometimes depressing experience, these 2 songs are a welcome change from the darkness and sorrow.<br /><br />\\"The Visitors\\" was released in 1981 becoming a commercial hit entering the UK album charts at number one. The album also reached the Top 40 in the US peaking outside of the Top 20 but it was a disappointment considering their previous records; \\"Arrival\\", \\"The Album\\", \\"Voulez-Vous\\" and \\"Super Trouper\\" all peaked within the Top 20 of the Billboard Album Charts. The biggest single to emerge from this was the magnificent ballad \\"One of Us\\" which peaked at number 3 in the UK. The other Agnetha lead vocal track \\"Head Over Heels\\" was also released as a single there and became a meduim sized hit reaching number 25. This was the first time since 1975 that ABBA had a single peak outside of the Top 10 in the UK.<br /><br />In the US, \\"When All Is Said and Done\\" and \\"The Visitors\\" were the two chosen single releases. \\"The Visitors\\" peaked at number 63 and \\"When All Is Said and Done\\" fared better reaching the Top 40. It should be noted that these two songs became ABBA's 19th and 20th singles to reach the Billboard Hot 100 within an 8 year time span. For a Swedish group to accomplish this was simply amazing.<br /><br />Please keep in mind the following:<br /><br />There are several re-mastered versions of \\"The Visitors\\", all having bonus tracks but they do differ.<br /><br />The original re-mastered edition released in 1997 has \\"Should I Laugh or Cry\\", \\"The Day Before You Came\\", \\"Under Attack\\" and \\"You Owe Me One\\" while another edition, released a few years later omits \\"You Owe Me One\\" and replaces it with the more poignant \\"Cassandra\\".<br /><br />A few years back, the Deluxe edition was released and although the price tag on this one is a bit higher, it is probably your best bet as it contains all bonus songs along with some worthy additions, the catchy \\"I am the City\\" (previously found only in the \\"More ABBA Gold\\" CD) and the previously unreleased \\"From A Twinkling Star To A Passing Angel\\", an earlier version of the song \\"Like an Angel Passing Through my Room\\". The deluxe edition also comes with a DVD which features some delightful footage. Most interesting are the live performances of 2 numbers- \\"Slipping Through my Fingers\\" and \\"Two for the Price of One\\" from the Dick Cavett Meets ABBA TV Special taped in 1981 (Too bad they didn't just release the entire show) and some promo clips.<br /><br />Out of all the bonus tracks, my favorite is the melancholic \\"The Day Before You Came\\" sung by Agnetha. In my opinion, it is one of ABBA's masterpieces and one of their most beautiful ballads. Like \\"The Winner Takes It All\\", it's simplistic but due to Bjorn and Benny's creative genius and Agnetha's gorgeous voice, it tugs at the heartstrings. There is nothing remotely depressing in the lyrics. It reads like a journal entry of a desperate, bored woman who cites off her daily activities before a person; a good friend, a lover, came in to her life. This song should be joyous and hopeful but it is not. Agentha's voice wreaks loneliness and sadness making one wonder that tragedy became this individual she is remembering. Benny stated in an interview that they had instructed Agnetha not to use her \\"vocal abilities\\" in this song in order for her to sound like an ordinary woman. Although he later regretted it by stating that you don't have to under use your abilities as a singer to play a part in a song, their idea worked wonderfully here. Unlike Agentha's previous solos where she adorns the songs with power and vibrato, her desperate, vibrato-less vocals in \\"The Day Before You Came\\" makes it more intimate. It is a shame this song wasn't appreciated when it was released as a single in 1982.<br /><br />\\"The Visitors\\" shines like a glittering jewel within the ABBA catalogue. It was an album that was ahead of it's time. It is also the sound of a more mature ABBA who musically evolved and who were interested in creating more than just perfect pop songs. Several of these songs are meaningful works of art and that's probably the best way to describe this album; a work of art.<br /><br />Highly Recommendedgroup to accomplish this was simply amazing.

B000001FLA|5.0|I won't give to this album five stars just because this was the first album I heard from Yngwie and I was completely blown away by his guitar fireworks. No! Instead, I will give five stars to this album because it contains a subset of the greatest solos Yngwie ever spitted in the middle of his songs. From the expressive-but-flashy ones on  \\"You don't remember I never forget\\" and \\"Queen in Love\\", the furious guitar-keyboard lines in \\"Liar\\" and \\"Fury\\", the beautifully dark solo in \\"Dark Ages\\", to the meaningful and tastefully neoclassic solo on \\"Fire\\"; Yngwie showcases here why he was one of the greatest gunslingers (if not the greatest!) in the middle eighties. <br /> <br />And if good, impeccably played solos weren't enough to earn five stars, then I'll add that the opener \\"You don't remember I never forget\\", as cheesy as it gets, is one of Yngwie's catchiest songs ever. Also, listen to \\"Queen in love\\". Isn't that one a memorable song too? Ok, Mark Boals perhaps doesn't sound like Jeff Scott Soto (matter of taste!), but he still does know how to sing. And he sings GREATLY here. Mark Boals is a top metal vocalist for sure! And what about the Johansson brothers on the keys and the drums respectively? These guys add a lot to this very tight incarnation of Rising Force, just to deliver the goods with high energy and professionalism. Five stars to the band as to the album! <br /> <br />But wait, there's even more to \\"Trilogy\\". For example, do you still think that Yngwie is just about a flurry of notes? Well, I'm afraid you are WRONG! Yngwie has a lot of feeling too, as well as a great control of dynamics, a great lead tone and a great finger vibrato. You could still listen to any solo from this album to see what I mean, but I'll instead make a special mention to the masterpiece \\"Crying\\". You listen to that instrumental song, and only a deaf would come back to talk again about \\"emotionless playing\\" and \\"Yngwie\\" on the same sentence. \\"Crying\\" says it all, as the guy goes from a gentle weeping to a total anguished crying at the end. Yngwie Malmsten was the real deal back then, believe me! <br /> <br />Thus, no matter how egocentric Yngwie might look (or really be), I give credit to him for redefining what metal lead guitar is about. For the dessert, just have a listen to \\"Trilogy Suite Op. 5\\" to taste how the scariest guitar chops a human being can play are put to work for a true musical opus. Nowadays Yngwie might have ruled out of ideas, but in the eighties he was the man, no doubt about it. Just listen to the \\"Trilogy\\" album on its entirety to confirm that fact. Five shiny shredding stars!
B000H7JD4A|2.0|If your expecting \\"Powerslave\\", \\"Piece of Mind\\" or \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\", then this is not the album for you.  I was hoping this was going to be a rockin' album, thinking maybe Iron Maiden would get back to some of there old roots.  Well I was definately wrong and this album sounds similar to the last one \\"Death on the Road\\", which sounds more like a continuation.        I am more of an old schooler, and I feel that Iron Maiden didn't put much effort into this album like they did with such albums like \\"Powerslave\\".  Then again this is my personal preference.
0767805712|5.0|Many people spend their lives searching for their place in life, and many movies are made that deal with this theme; examples include \\"The Majestic\\", \\"As Good as it Gets\\", \\"Lost in Translation\\" and \\"X-Men\\".  But what about the exact opposite, what about those who know for certain their place in life and are not happy with it?  This is the central underlying theme in this movie.  It is the future, and mankind has progressed to the point where genetic engineering of newborns is a common practice.  Some kids are born naturally without any genetic improvements, and have set limits and expectations for their life.  These are known as \\"invalids\\".  Others are born with genetic improvements, and they are born into a different life with different limits and expectations; usually higher.  These are \\"valids\\".  This movie is about both individuals, brothers really.  One is a Valid and rises high within the ranks of Gattaca, a futuristic corporation that sends people to space.  The other is an \\"Invalid, and being unhappy with his fate, uses his wit and the friendship of a thoughtful Valid to rise even higher.  Their fates intertwine at the very end in a triumph of the human spirit over predisposed social constraints.  The movie moves briskly but not too quickly.  The dialogue is quite sharp and natural.  The personal relationships are well-thought out.  And Jude Law is probably in his best role as an actor.  All told, a great movie and worth the time to watch.  Premiering in the mid 1990's, it touches on many of the themes now surfacing in the era of biotech and genetic engineering.
B00023GGFI|5.0|I bought this album in 1969 when I was in high school, and I was completly blown away.  By the time I graduated from college I had pretty much worn it out.  This year I \\"rediscovered\\" it on CD.  It's still one of the best examples of blues guitar I have ever heard, and I've been listening to it at least once a week for the last 5 months.  I'm still trying to figure out which version of \\"Dallas\\" I like better.  (The next album I bought was BB King Live and Well, but that's another story).
1559277246|3.0|for those of you that enjoyed the first 7 books on cd and thought the voice was perfect - will not like the voice on this one.  the voice is nice - but it is in no way a jersey girl!!  names are pronounced differently - and once the wrong name is used.  I will think hard before I order book 9 on cd!
B00004X01U|5.0|Contrary to what she wore in the cover photo,Madonna has not gone country. This ten-track album spawned the Top 20 hits,the title track,WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL and DON'T TELL ME. The guitar on GONE sounds beautiful. The other tracks are great.
038572179X|4.0|This was the first Ian McEwan book that I read, and overall I was quite impressed. McEwan has a definite knack for illustrating the complexities of his characters and his prose, though sometimes tedious, is overall quite beautiful. <br /> <br />Atonement is divided into 4 sections. The first, and longest book, takes place several years before WWII. This section, which comprises nearly 170 pages, takes place over a single day at the Tallis household in the English countryside. The main characters are Briony, a precocious 13 year-old, her older sister Cecilia, who is home on break from Cambridge, and Robbie, the cleaning lady's son, who, despite his humble origins has managed to graduate from Cambridge thanks to the beneficence of the Tallis family. There are also a number of peripheral characters. The plot of this first section consists of Robbie and Cecilia discovering that they have feelings for one another. Briony in her youthful naivete misunderstands Robbie's intentions toward her sister, and this misunderstanding, plus a fair dose of class prejudice, contributes to Robbie being convicted of a crime which he did not commit. <br /> <br />The first section, although it starts a bit slowly, really picks up as the narrative gathers steam, and I found it hard to put the book down. This section ends on such an intense note, with Robbie accused of this crime, that the reader wants an immediate resolution to the conflict. However, Book 2 does not offer such gratification. It takes place several years in the future, during the war. Robbie is in France trying to make his way to the shore in order to be evacuated back to England. Only very gradually do we find out what has happened in the interim years and how the various characters that we met in the first book have been transformed. Book 3 also takes place during the war, from Briony's perspective. She is now a nurse and we find out that she has come to realize that accused an innocent man. The question hanging over thewhole narrative is whether Briony will in the end seek forgiveness from Cecilia and Robbie. <br /> <br />The main problem I had with the book and the reason I deducted a star is the disconnect between Book 1 and the subsequent books. Books 2 and 3 stand very well on their own. McEwan does a masterful job of conveying the horrors of war, from the vantage point of both the soldier and the nurse, and their are some moments that are genuinely memorable (such as Briony's efforts to comfort a dying soldier). However, Book 1 ended on such a furious note that the reader wants a quick resolution. The numerous pages detailing Robbie and Briony's respective travails during the war often just seem like an interlude. When the atonement does finally come, I will leave it other readers to decide whether it satisfied their expectations.
B000002LLC|4.0|One year after the 1989 release of LIKE A PRAYER,Madonna goes into the style of jazz with many of these tracks that were inspired by the Buena Vista film DICK TRACY,in which she co-starred with Warren Beatty. Beatty is the guy in the cover photo. The only Top 20 hits are VOGUE and the lounge jazz piece HANKY PANKY. VOGUE,ideal for nightclub play,became a part of THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION,released in November 1990. SOMETHING TO REMEMBER is not to be confused with a later recording of Madonna's of the same title(from 1995). The cover photo is a promotional photo for DT,theatrically released in June or July 1990. The other songs are great.
0380729407|5.0|Well, Ray Bradbury pulled off something I never thought I'd see: heartwarming horror.  Something Wicked This Way Comes is a truly frightening horror story about two boys living in a midwestern town visited by a mysterious carnival and its group of evil proprietors and \\"freaks.\\"  The boys see too much and become the target of the malevolent forces of the carnival.  Bradbury writes these characters to be truly frightening. <br /> <br />The horror story itself would have been very solid, but Bradbury marries it seamlessly to the story of one of the two boys coming to see his father in a different light, even as the father finds something within himself that has sat dormant for far too long. <br /> <br />A truly deep story that will scare you, inspire you and keep you turning the pages.  This one should be read more often, it's a real gem.
B000002LGQ|5.0|1984's LIKE A VIRGIN was first and won Grammys,1986's TRUE BLUE was second and won Grammys also and this 1989 release was Madonna's third megahit and of course,won Grammys. The title track caught the attention of many church groups since it was,as the editorial review mentions,gospel-infused. Aside from the title track,Top 20 hits include EXPRESS YOURSELF,CHERISH,OH FATHER and KEEP IT TOGETHER. All but the latter two became part of 1990's THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. The short ACT OF CONTRITION sounds a little bit silly with Madonna arguing(in speaking voice) with someone(\\"What do you mean it's not in the computer?\\"). The other songs are great.
0743454537|4.0|Like other readers, I am disappointed at the ending of the book.  However, it isn't the twist in plot that was disappointing.  This book was a page-turner for me and I really enjoyed reading the first two-thirds of the book.  However, the last section of the book felt like it wrapped everything up too quickly.  Picoult was so thorough in her development of the characters that the style of the ending didn't match the first portion of the book.  In order to do justice to the characters, I wish she would have added more breadth to the ending.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This November 2005 release begins with the awesome disco-flavored HUNG UP. Get a load of the auburn-haired Madonna positioned like a stripper in the cover photo. FORBIDDEN LOVE is not to be confused with the same title from 1994's BEDTIME STORIES. The other tracks are incredibly awesome!
B000HIVO64|5.0|If you are a fan of any of beck's previous releases, you are in for a real treat.  This album contains tracks that borrow wonderfully from Beck's other releases.  There are many highlights here.  The first 6 tracks are so well done.  Elevator Music, Think I'm In Love, Cellphone's Dead, Strange Apparition, Soldier Jane, Nausea, The Information, and Movie Theme are true Beck classics.  Movie Theme in particular has an ambient smoothness to it that reminds me of my favorite Beck album(Sea Change).  Nigel Godrich returns to produce this album and he and Beck add such lusciously gorgeous backgrounds to all of the songs.  Trust me, any fan of Beck will most certainly appreciate the glorious head candy that he has once again graced us with!!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I saw this when it first came out in video.  It is pretty cool seeing again after many years.  It is worth the money.  Also, if you can find an old copy of his \\"Education of a Bodybuilder\\" that is an interesting read as well.
B000H305U0|4.0|On his sophmore CD, Justin takes the music to another level and that's not a bad thing. Justin may not be the most soulful white boy in America (that title belongs to Robin Thicke) but he is the funkiest. Timberlake stands out on Sexyback, My Love feat. T.I.(can't wait to see the video) and the killer slow jam Until The End Of Time. Timbaland has blessed Timberlake with some of the best production of the year and one could see the two as the next Michael Jackson & Qunicy Jones (not only a talent level but just as a winning music making duo). My only compliant with the CD is the lack of baby making slow jams. All in all a very promising album.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|The genius of the Chilli Peppers - what sets them apart from all other bands - is the fact that they are so outrageously and beautifully eclectic, diverse, original, catchy, with so much depth, drawing from so many different genres of music and somehow making it work in a strange way. Stadium Arcadium embodies this -- its a wonderfully musical blend of 80's retro with punk, rock, hip hop, folk. It seems I have different some ideas of standout tracks, but here they are [not in order]: <br /> <br />1. Hey <br />2. Wet Sand <br />3. She's Only 18 [The guy who said this is nothing special needs to tune his ears; it emphasizes their 80's/early 90's hip hop element with an interesting lyrical/delivery display reminiscent of their past with catchy vocal contrast in the chorus] <br />4. Death of a Martian <br />5. Hard to Concentrate <br />6. Especially in Michigan <br />7. 21st Century <br />8. Turn It Again <br /> <br /> <br />ASTONISHING, multi-layered album.
1400032717|4.0|I wasn't familiar with Mark Haddon's work, so I played it safe and started with one of his shorter novels.  This approach paid off, since I was able to dive into his next book that much sooner.  Some people might initially be put off by the methodical way the character of Christopher tells his story (he's autistic); but trust me, it pays off in a big way.  His need to look at things logically and literally leads to some unexpected turns, and makes this book about so much more than the death of a neighbor's pet.  Definitely worth checking out.
1594481938|5.0|I hesitated immensely before getting this book.  I had it in my hands many times, and would always put it back on the shelf.  I was afraid to read a book on suicide, and I had not really enjoyed \\"How to be Good\\" by the same author.<br /><br />But this book, is really wonderful.  Funny, touching, a fast-read that makes you slow down because almost every sentence is worthy of contemplation.<br /><br />Great definition of each character.  You \\"get\\" each one, because they are so flawed, and desperate and real.<br /><br />I think it's the perfect book to be made into a film and I hope it gets done.
B00000720W|5.0|Hello, first off let me state that I am neither Issobel stevens nor STEVENSPW or whatever the name on this 'review' has been posted as I am in fact Gregit Gutterheid S-Lungs.  Right, I have never heard this CD but I know that I will.  The reason I am writing this review type thing is to voice my believe about the reviewer at the end of this list or perhapsat the one before last.  Anyway my belief is this: that, that little **** (insert approately hideous expletive) second from the last or last (you'll soon figure out who, even if I have gotten the placing wrong, which I may have) knows fine well about Mayhem's bloody history but is just speaking (typing) as though he dosen't to further incense those he hates or just conciders pathetic.  Well that is my 2 cents worth (equivelent to around one pence ion Scotland (where I hail you from)) so I hope you'll join me in hoping that that fellow DOSEN'T suffer a particularly agonising form of cancer and that his entire family dosen't  disown him.  Any hoo byee (I'm going to the doctors now).
B000GG4XJM|4.0|\\"The American Land\\" version of the Seeger Sessions album adds several \\"new\\" songs to the original release. OK, so most of the songs are not new, since the whole point of the whole album is that these are old songs. The only real new song is \\"American Land\\" and it's one that Springsteen should be proud of. It perfectly fits in with the tone and style of the other songs on the album that, when taken as a whole, create the tapestry that Bruce describes in \\"American Land\\".<br /><br />If you are reading this thinking that \\"American Land\\" will be a retread of the fervent patriotism of \\"Born in the USA\\" then you clearly have not heard either one of those songs. It's a song about what immigrants thought about America before they got here and how our country did not live up to their expectations. Great, vivid lyrics like \\"Diamonds on the sidewalks, the gutters lined with song...\\" prove that an abum of century-old covers has not dulled Springsteen's writing prowess one bit.<br /><br />The other new additions to the record are great, but a couple of down points keep this being a five-star release.<br /><br />First of all, the booklet gets the lyrics to \\"American Land\\" wrong. This is such a gross oversight, that hopefully Sony will fix it in upcoming pressings.<br /><br />Second, why put in a music video for \\"Pay Me My Money Down\\" which was one of the (many) amazing highlights of the recent tour instead of a live performance?<br /><br />I sincerely hope that a full-length video from this tour will be forthcoming because I know that a lot of people did not see it, expecting it to be some kind of moonshine-jug hootenanny, but these shows were incredible. I'm jealous of the European audiences who are now getting a second leg of the tour. This show deserves to be seen by more people, and this record deserves to be heard.<br /><br />By the way, I never had any issues with the Dual Disc in any of my cd players, so I could care less that this version comes with a separate dvd, but the dvd is nice to have anyway..
B000B8QF00|5.0|What else could you expect from Alanis!!?? <br />This album is full of great songs, I consider myself Alanis' biggest fan, I have every single one of her albums, which means I already know every song on 'The Collection', but it seems very convenient to have the bestest of her songs all in one album. I LOVE IT!!
B000FQJAIW|2.0|I now own 5 versions of this film, and this is the first time I truely felt like I wasted my money.  Each version I had previously purchased had been a clear upgrade in quality from past versions, and I was so excited to see the original theatrical versions (as they should be seen)finally available on DVD. Sadly, the picture and sound quality on this is worse than my VHS versions from the 80s.  This set is a total rip off and George should be ashamed of himself.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|1. SWEET SACRIFICE 4/5 <br />A very strong opening track to set off the whole album. Amy takes a deep breath at the begining of the song to somehow say 'here is my soul, my dark and tormented f**king soul.' I love how she toys with the higher notes of her range and the effects on the vocals only add to the severity of the message being conveyed. Not my number one, but as with all the tracks, it grows on me the more I listen to it. <br /> <br /> <br />2. CALL ME WHEN YOU'RE SOBER 3.5/5 <br />This song sticks out on the abum as a whole. On it's own, it functions as a very strong and emotioal entity that spawned one of the coolest music videos to come from Evanescence. The styling of the song is totally different from anything else on the album, and I personally think that it puts forth a strange and inaccurate expectation for people about ToD. <br /> <br />That aside, the music itself it quite wonderful. Amy's strong vocals are very well executed while the rock sound offsets an otherwise blusey arrangement. I found the acoustic version on the single better. <br /> <br /> <br />3. WEIGHT OF THE WORLD 5/5 <br />This song totally works every major aspect of Evanescence's music that I have loved since 2003. it sarts with a stunning guitar intro that captivates the metal side of my persona and leads us into the creepy sound of the first line. Amy's octive split vocals offset by the metallic xylophne notes meld to make a very effective and VERY creepy sound. This song simply ROCKS. Deffinitely my 2nd favorite track on the album. <br /> <br /> <br />4. LITHIUM 5/5 <br />This type of ballad is what I come to expect from Evanescence. The lyrics take on a mind of their own and completely separate themselves from the instrumental track, until BAM the guitar comes in with power never heard before from this troupe. It sets off an amazing series of events that truly makes for a catchy and hard hitting song. Amy's vocals begin to toy around with long and drawn out notes at the end of the 2nd verse that power through on to the next. A song that had to grow on me. At first, the repitition of the word 'Lithium' bothered me, but now I see it as an important part of the vocals that really hit the message deep within. <br /> <br /> <br />5. CLOUD NINE 5/5 <br />The vocals at the beginning/end of this track did not appeal to me at first listen because they felt very cliché. I feel less like that now. <br /> <br />This sounds like it would be a good single to me. It has enough pop in it to carry it through to the masses, and enough individuality to make it hard to become annoying. <br /> <br />Amy sounds kinda Christina Agulera to me at the chorus, which is NOT a bad thing (I kinda like her style), and it's interesting to hear that style mixed with good music and hard hitting lyrics. It gives me the chills. <br /> <br /> <br />6. SNOW WHITE QUEEN 4/5 <br />I mut say that I really didn't like SWQ at first listen. It was very strange and bizarre. It grew on me a lot after it got stuck in my head. <br /> <br />The cool chord progression crrates a very aurally satisfying song. The funky instrumental effects throughout it remind me of Fallen's 'Haunted,' retaining an eery vibe that sorta lingers with you on through to the next song. <br /> <br /> <br />7. LACRYMOSA 4.5/5 <br />I had this song WAY before I heard the rest of the tracks (like almost a whole week) and it gave me time to listen to it individually a lot. As with CMWYS, it stands alone very well because of it's epic sound. The strings from mozart's piece of the same name are fun and playful and lend themselves beautifully to Amy's sassy vocals. Terry's guitar solo towards the end will forever be one of my favorite moments in Evanescence's music. <br /> <br />When put in with the album as a whole, it stands out to me, almost disrupting the flow, though not nearly as bad as CMWYS. Maybe this will disipate as time goes by, but I somehow doubt it. <br /> <br /> <br />8. LIKE YOU 5/5 <br />Disturbing. Plain and simple, this song is miraculously disturbing. The simple guitar part mixed with the piano subtly accentuate Amy's amazing voice. A simple rythm bit mixed in every once in a while satisfy the needed structure to the complex melody. <br /> <br />Truly impressive Vocals from amy. She performs with such emotion that it's impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> <br />9. LOSE CONTROL 29,000/5 <br />My absolute favorite evanescence song ever, though probably the strangest decision to fade in from the previous track to. The two songs have such different meanings, but the musical simmilarities make for a very pleasing transition. <br /> <br />This sexy track makes for a good soundtrack for some hot love makin'. <br /> <br />Intense music rght here. I can understand why some don't like it for it's unique approach to the lyrics. Though the subject matter stands out like a sore thumb, musically, it fits perfectly on this album. <br /> <br /> <br />10. THE ONLY ONE 4/5 <br />I rate this 4/5 because...I have to rate it something...an it isn't my number one favorite song, but I still really enjoy it. <br /> <br />Amazing vocal work from Amy. Hard hitting chord progressions and musical ideas. A true pearl on the album. <br /> <br /> <br />11. YOUR STAR 5/5 <br />A very strong track. Makes a very amazing point and lyrically flows the best out of any song on ToD. Starts off light and desolate, but when it explodes, IT EXPLODES with power and eery encouragement. The lines of the chorus are perfectly executed and give me such a chill down my spine. <br /> <br />Another favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> <br />12. ALL THAT I'M LIVING FOR 4.5/5 <br />Crazy good song. Maybe one of the poppier songs, I can see it also being a single. It has a certian hard powerful body that just makes me want to hear it on the radio. It fits well with the rest of the album, but would stand on it's own perfectly. <br /> <br />Kudos to John Lecompt for writing such a great song! I always love hiswork. <br /> <br /> <br />13. GOOD ENOUGH 4/5 <br />The intro is AMAZING with the complex and classical string/piano arrangement that flows as easy as a light Brahms lullaby. It leads us into a very positive, and somewhat jazzy song. Though the lyrics are supposed to be happy, it still sounds rips at your heart like a spear. <br /> <br />The subject of the lyrics is makes it a logical end to the album, but it needs...a long outro or something to serve as a satisfying musical conclusion for an album, but the more I listen, the more I get used to it. I guess I was expecting 'Whisper' and got something better and didn't even know it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The album deffinitely hits hard at my soul, personally, and I just love the music and the people involved. <br /> <br />Deffinitely not my OH MY GOD NUMBER ONE FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIMEEEE ('Fallen' fills that space very nicely), but pretty high up there. Deffinitely top 10, and gaining strength every time I listen to it...
B000FQJAIM|2.0|I now own 5 versions of this film, and this is the first time I truely felt like I wasted my money. Each version I had previously purchased had been a clear upgrade in quality from past versions, and I was so excited to see the original theatrical versions (as they should be seen)finally available on DVD. Sadly, the picture and sound quality on this is worse than my VHS versions from the 80s. This set is a total rip off and George should be ashamed of himself.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Luc Besson is often described as the \\"French Spielberg,\\" preferring large stylish popular films.  For this film, the French Academy of Cinema nominated him as Best Director.  While he would eventually win the French award for \\"The Fifth Element,\\" this film also represents Jean Reno's sole French award nomination as Best Actor.  Neither did the film win the 1994 Best Film award in France, for which it was nominated.<br /><br />While much recommends the film, historically it may come to be best remembered as the launching pad of Natalie Portman's career.  She of course has gone on to \\"Star Wars,\\" \\"Cold Mountain,\\" \\"Zoolander,\\" \\"V is for Vendetta\\" as well as her Academy Award-nominated performance in \\"Closer\\" which also earned her a Golden Globe.  As 12-year old Mathilda, Portman expresses a huge range of emotions and a profoundly deep performance for this young actress born in Jerusalem.<br /><br />Jean Reno is also amazing as the assassin Leon.  His performance as the fastidious loner who discovers that there is more to life is moving.  The final sequence in the hallway as his death approaches and he knows that he's got villain Stansfield is classic cinema.  Besson allows nice touches such as the plant put in & out of the window and eventually planted by Mathilda.<br /><br />The three supporting performances are also on an excellent level.  Michael Badalucco from TV's \\"The Practice\\" does a good job as Mathilda's weak-willed drug-dealing daddy.  Gary Oldman is over the top as the dastardly dire DEA-corrupted Stansfield who shoots Mathilda's 4-year old brother.  Danny Aiello whose sole Oscar nomination came in 1989 for \\"Do the Right Thing\\" turns in a good performance as the restranteur Tony who books hits and keeps all of Leon's funs \\"for safe keeping.\\"<br /><br />This little gem of a film is well worth checking out.  Besson keeps the action brisk, the suspense tense with imperfect characters who nevertheless charm.  Enjoy!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|There was a lot of talk wondering if Evanescence could pull off a CD as great and as successful as their first one. Especially after the departure of fellow bandmate and co-writer to lead vocalist(Amy Lee) Ben Moody a few years back. Not saying Ben was not an asset to the group but, they are just as fine without him.<br /><br />The Open Door SOARS with greatness! Well worth the long wait for it to be released.<br /><br />Amy Lee has one of the best voices around today. Very powerful and at times chilling. She is also an amazing songwriter who writes from such raw emotion and that's what makes each and every song on here excellent!<br /><br />Every song on here stands out from music that is out today from a combination of Amy's amazing voice and her fantastic songwriting.<br /><br />The lead single: \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" speaks for itself. They are back and back with a splash! The album only gets better. The CD kicks off with the guitar heavy: \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\" a song that has some strings in the background (at some more quiet parts of the song). Great lyrics and a very catchy chours. \\"Weight of the World\\" continues to rock on with Amy's superb voice to be altered at times throughout the song to add some different dimensions to it. GREAT! \\"Lithium\\" has Amy singing to a piano and is primarily a ballad but then adds some layers of guitars to it, mostly during the chours's. \\"Cloud Nine\\" is another pleaser on here with some haunting sounding chants and Amy's voice, again, in perfect form! \\"Lacrymosa\\" is a very unique song. A full choir in the background. Amy uses her voice to the fullest - hitting all sorts of notes (high and low) - AMAZING!!! The CD ends with a truly 'hair standing on end' ballad: \\"Good Enough\\". Only Amy's voice and a piano. 2 VERY beautiful instruments!<br /><br />Although I did not review every song, they are all outstanding. There is not one song on here that I skip. I just wanted to highlight some of my personal favorites on this set. This CD pretty much keeps with the same formula as their debut CD. It is raw, edgy, unique and VERY radio friendly. I can hear a lot of hits coming from The Open Door. This CD is a MUST own!tty much keeps with the same formula as their debut CD. It is raw, edgy, unique and VERY radio friendly.

B000E41MRC|5.0|After slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we Twenty-First Century Americans were not the intended audience for this movie. The movie was intended to be a unifying morale-builder for the National Socialist Party in Germany, which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made.     From its loss of World War I until the NSDAP was elected to power in Germany in 1934, the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare, illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of Germany at the hands of the French, and an economic catastrophe that made our American Depression look like a picnic by comparison.     This movie sought to persuade Germans (GERMANS!) that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal Bolshevik traitors responsible for Germany's defeat in World War I, and all the residual woes, would be defeated once and for all. It must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don't get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of Germans who attended the NSDAP rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out.     If you speak and understand German, you'll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies, and this film that celebrates them. For many who are not conversant in the German language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in American World War II films, the film is actually pretty boring after a while.     You sit there and watch one group of soldiers, police, or workers after another, marching and marching and marching. This is interspersed with speeches by Hitler and the other Party officals. From time to time you'll see interesting-looking people doing everyday things, some in costume, but mostly they're just talking, walking, eating, brushing their teeth, and so on. Be advised -- for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring, gigantic SS parade with weapons bristling, be prepared to be disappointed. The last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the SS Leibstandarte Adolph Hitler, and they're marching to what was reputedly Hitler's favorite piece -- \\"Der Badenweiler\\". Remember to notice that they aren't even carrying rifles or bayonets....     Lastly, in my opinon, the commentary by \\"historian\\" Dr Anthony Santoro is mostly just another sarcastic, demeaning rant against the people in the film, so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war. The marching soldiers and other Germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor, beleagured country are all long dead, but Santoro must make fun of them for the amusement (?) of the American audience. Try to remember -- this movie was not made for YOU!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|It's been five years since the series' finale of \\"The X-Files,\\" and in that time there have been several television shows that have attempted to be the heir to one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time.  Now that show has arrived, sporting a young, talented cast and a series of veteran television writers who know how to bring strong drama, suspense, humor, and scares to the table.   <br /> <br />The premise of the show's first season is relatively simple:   <br /> <br />22 years ago, Dean and Sam Winchester's mother was killed by a powerful, elusive supernatural entity.  Their father, John Winchester, seeking vengeance and armed with the knowledge that the supernatural really does exist in our world, began hunting down the evil monsters that infest our world.  Through the years, he trained his two sons to become hunters themselves.   <br /> <br />But that life wasn't for Sam.  Wanting normalcy and a peaceful life, the youngest member of the Winchester family gained a full-ride scholarship to Stanford University and entered law school, leaving his previous life-and his brother and father-behind.   <br /> <br />Then one day Dean shows up on Sam's doorstep, telling him that their dad is missing and he needs Sam's help to find him.  Now, Sam must return to the life he thought he'd left behind, and join his brother on a journey into the heart of evil to save their father. <br /> <br />The formula for the show works well.  It's not so serialized that a viewer can't miss an episode now and again.  The majority of the episodes stand pretty well on their own, and the few \\"mythology\\" episodes that exist turn out to be some of the show's best.  The series' mythology is well-thought out and intriguing, keeping a viewer guessing as to what exactly has happened to John Winchester.   <br /> <br />As much as I like the overall story-arc of the series, almost all of the stand-alone episodes prove to be as equally intriguing and creepy as the show's mythology, pitting the brothers against a terrifying army of evil creatures.   <br /> <br />By far the strongest element of the series is the dynamic between the two brothers, Sam and Dean.  The two actors, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, portray the heroes with complexity and flaws.  Neither brother is perfect, and they clearly have issues with one another, like many siblings in the world.  Each episode works to advance their relationship, which keeps the viewer wanting to watch to see what happens next.  Unlike the characters in many television shows, Sam and Dean are constantly evolving, and by the end of the season, they are both changed men, for better or worse.   <br /> <br />The real standout of the show is Jensen Ackles, fresh off his secondary role on \\"Smallville.\\"  The young actor really brings life to Dean, showcasing the many layers the character has and bringing energy and humor to every scene.  There aren't too many characters in the history of television who started out essentially as the comedic relief and ended up becoming the most complex character in the series.   <br /> <br />Another important trait that this series has is that, unlike most \\"horror\\" movies or TV shows, this one is genuinely creepy, and watching it late at night can make even the most jaded viewer slightly creeped out.  Sure, not every episode is entirely effective in this department, but there are only a few that don't acheive the desired goal of scaring its audience out of their seats.   <br /> <br />The only real flaw the show has is that some of the \\"monsters of the week\\" don't turn out to be as horrifying as the show's creators meant them to be.  (The Reaper in particular comes to mind.)  But this is only a minor complaint.  Overall, the series has done an amazing job of creating a series of frightening supernatural creatures that are more than a match for Sam and Dean.   <br /> <br />Here is a listing of the season's 22 episodes, along with a brief plot synopsis for each: <br /> <br />\\"Pilot\\" <br />Along a lonely California highway, a mysterious woman lures men to their deaths, and gives the Winchester brothers their first clue to their father's whereabouts. <br /> <br />\\"Wendigo\\" <br />Sam and Dean's search for their father leads them to the Colorado woods, and face-to-face with a ferocious cannibal spirit.   <br /> <br />\\"Dead in the Water\\" <br />While investigating a series of mysterious drownings in Wisconsin, the brothers suspect a supernatural spirit may be at work, and only a traumatized young boy with psychic abilities can predict the next victim.   <br /> <br />\\"Phantom Traveler\\" <br />Sam and Dean race to stop a demon from bringing down a jet full of passengers, forcing them to perform an exorcism at 30,000 feet. <br /> <br />\\"Bloody Mary\\" <br />The brothers face a demonic spirit that has taken the form of the Bloody Mary, a legendary figure who appears through mirrors to kill those who summon it. <br /> <br />\\"Skin\\" <br />An old college friend of Sam's is accused of murder, but Sam and Dean discover a mysterious shape-shifter may be behind the killing.   <br /> <br />\\"Hook Man\\"   <br />A vengeful spirit begins to kill children in a small Iowa town, and it's up to the Winchester brothers to stop it.   <br /> <br />\\"Bugs\\" <br />After a construction worker is attacked and killed by insects, Sam and Dean discover that a new housing development may be in danger because of an Indian curse placed on the land centuries ago.   <br /> <br />\\"Home\\" <br />Sam and Dean return home for the first time since their childhood to find that the people now living in their old house may be in danger from the same evil that killed their mother. <br /> <br />\\"Asylum\\" <br />The brothers investigate a shut-down mental institution with the power to turn intruders into violent killers.   <br /> <br />\\"Scarecrow\\" <br />A malevolent scarecrow inhabited by the spirit of a Norse god is killing visitors to Indiana, and the brothers are next on its list.   <br /> <br />\\"Faith\\" <br />After an accident leaves Dean near death, Sam takes him to a faith healer who holds a deadly secret.   <br /> <br />\\"Route 666\\" <br />Sam and Dean investigate when reports of an evil truck that is killing African-Americans threatens Dean's ex-girlfriend.   <br /> <br />\\"Nightmare\\" <br />The brothers pose as priests to gather information on a recent death that Sam foresaw in a dream.   <br /> <br />\\"The Benders\\" <br />Dean must rely on a suspicious deputy when Sam is kidnapped by a family of backwoods hunters who like to use humans as prey.  <br /> <br />\\"Shadow\\" <br />The brothers run into an enemy who may have ties to their mother's death-and who has the ability to control shadow demons.   <br /> <br />\\"Hell House\\" <br />Sam and Dean confront a homicidal spirit, but their efforts are hindered by a pair of goofball paranormal investigators.   <br /> <br />\\"Something Wicked\\" <br />Following a tip by their father, the brothers chase down a powerful witch with disturbing ties to the Winchesters' past.  <br /> <br />\\"Provenance\\" <br />A portrait of a murdered family is the brothers' chief suspect in a series of gruesome killings. <br /> <br />\\"Dead Man's Blood\\" <br />Sam and Dean reunite with their father to face off against a group of vampires with a weapon capable of destroying the demon that killed their mother. <br /> <br />\\"Salvation\\"   <br />John Winchester faces a terrifying choice when he must decide between saving the life of his closest friends-and letting Sam and Dean face the demon that killed their mother alone.   <br /> <br />\\"Devil's Trap\\"  <br />The brothers mount a daring mission to rescue their father from a pack of demons intent on destroying the Winchester bloodline.   <br /> <br />So, if you are looking for a worthy follow-up to \\"The X-Files,\\" or just looking for a show with great characters, humor, and scares, then look no further than this DVD set of Supernatural's first season.     <br /> <br />
B000F8O35U|4.0|With all of the hype of re-mastering, Disney forgot to mention that this new version has been CENSORED.  If you have the old DVD,Laserdisc, or VHS tape you have the uncensored version.<br /><br />Those who objected to the bent knee of the minister when Eric and Vanessa walked down the aisle to wed can rest easily knowing that even if it wasn't supposed to represent an erect version of a body part, no one will make that mistake again. The lone kneecap's bouncy, under-the-tunic appearance during the aisle walk has been unquestionably edited out.
B000003TA4|5.0|Most rock fans regard this as one of the greatest albums of all time, myself being one of them.  However, there are those reviewers and critics who say Cobain couldn't sing or play guitar well and that Nirvana was an overrated band.  Here's my take on the whole thing.  I will never say Nirvana was overrated or Kurt Cobain was not talented; I personally think he was a genius.  But I think much of the appeal of Nirvana in general, and this album in particular, was that they were the right band at the right time.  No band ever had a greater sense of timing than these guys.  Nevermind exploded onto the music scene and effectively killed hair metal once and for all (a good thing, to be sure; hair metal needed to die.)  Nevermind is an instant classic and will be listened to by every generation of true rock fans.  Every song is brilliant in it's energy and impeccable sense of rebellion.  Nirvana didn't invent anti-establishment in rock and roll; they just perfected it.  This is one of the greatest albums of all time; an undisputed fact among true rock fans.  Enjoy.
B000GY729M|5.0|...and that is a good thing.  This album is so over-the-top, ridiculous, overblown, overproduced, epic and almost cheesy that you either push it away in disgust or give in to the ride and just enjoy it.  This album still shows the dance oriented post-punk influences of Hot Fuss, but marries that to Bruce Springsteen, U2, Queen and The Beatles.  All of which seems to be a very bad idea but The Killers are so oblivious to what a bad idea that is and, therefore, they pull it off magnificently.  Lookout for supposed third single \\"Read My Mind\\", it could be huge.   <br />
B000H0MKGK|3.0|John Mayer is a significantly talented guitar player, and I can remember a quote of him saying something like \\"I didn't realize how much I liked playing the blues until I played the Crossroads tour with Eric Clapton.\\" Which he did after his first 2 studio albums. He was already held in high respect by the guitar community, but looked at as a \\"pop\\" musician. Then he proceeded to put all doubters to rest with \\"Who Did You Think I Was\\" and the live album Try!. <br /> <br />That said, being a guitar player, and someone who really liked the album Try!, I was terribly let down by Continuum. I was expecting slashing guitar solos like Stevie Ray Vaughan, with the perfection and soul of Clapton...I'm pretty sure it wasn't just me, now I'm just thinking who did you think I was?
B000FZERIG|4.0|George Harrison may sound a tad \\"preachy\\" on this, his second album, but the sneaky humor is still very much intact.  For example, in the title track of 1973's  Living in the Material World he delivers a brief history of his previous band:<br /><br />Met them all here in the material world<br />John and Paul here in the material world<br />Though we started out quite poor<br />we got Richie on a tour...<br />[Ringo drum fill]<br /><br />Ya gotta love it.<br /><br />OK, so this record is no All Things Must Pass, but then again, nothing could be.  It certainly has its moments of glory though (Give Me Love, (Give Me Peace on Earth), and Don't Let Me Wait Too Long).  There would be much mediocrity in his future (Extra Texture or Gone Troppo anyone?),  followed by triumphant mature comebacks (Cloud Nine! Traveling Wilburys! Brainwashed!).  So, in retrospect, this is a strong and satisfying collection of songs.<br /><br />When this album was first released, I was all of sixteen and working as a dishwasher on the New Jersey Turnpike.  As I scrubbed egg off plates, this album (in particular the song Don't Let Me Wait Too Long), used to dance through my head, making my miserable first job infinitely more bearable.<br /><br />Living in the Material World covers an interesting period of a young pop-star learning about his life and his precarious place in the mad mad world of show business.  Eventually, he found his way.<br /><br />Minor grumble:  I'm thrilled to have B-sides Miss O'Dell and Deep Blue attached to this release, but where the heck is the studio version of  Bangladesh, the latter's A-side?<br /><br />Huh?<br />Dhani?<br />Olivia?<br /><br />Anyone?
0440219078|4.0|I remember reading this book in 8th grade and absolutely despising it.  I thought the writing was slow and that the plot was hollow.  Boy oh boy was i wrong.  This is a fantastic book (once you get through the first 50 pages) and presents some very poignant and though-provoking ideas about a future with no feelings.   <br />  I do think that the book did take a little to long to really get going, but on the other hand, i think it was neseccary.  We are so used to living in a world with color and emotions that the author needs to try and bore us to tears so that when emotions happen, they are shocking.   <br />  When push comes to shove, i think that this is an excellent novel for all ages.  The writing is clear and concise, and the ideas are daring. Now more than ever you see politicians attempt to  \\"keep us safe\\" from certain    things that could cause any sort of emotional response.  The Giver gives us a picture of what the world could be like with a government that retains total control over thoughts.  The picture is very bleak indeed. <br /> <br />Meyer H Brown <br />Virtual High School <br />Mythology
3937406328|5.0|I listen the entire new album of Chris Rea. I never hear a Chris Rea album before. This is an excepcional, complex & mesmerize album. This is the best album of this new century & one of the best blues album of all time. Eleven albums in one year !!! This is incredible. You must listen to it to believe it. The latin blues by English man sounds superior to the latin blues make for sud americans & spanish people. All the albums are great & sounds very very diferent. My favorites are: 60's & 70's, Chicago Blues,Electric Memphis Blues, Latin Blues & Ballads Blues. I recomend very much.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Well folks, the day has finally arrived! Evanescence's long awaited second major label album has finally arrived, and boy, was it worth the wait!  There sophomore album surpasses there debut Fallen in every possible way.  The Open Door is just that, a door of opportunities and possibilites that was opened up to the band when chief songwriter/lead guitarist Ben Moody left abruptly on tour in late 2003. Ben was the one behind the major commerical and pop aspect of Fallen. But now, on The Open Door, Amy Lee and fellow bandmember Terry Balsamo have taken full force of the songwriting and theme of the new album, and yes, its all the more epic, complex, creative, and experimental music you could ever ask for from them.  <br /> <br />The album opens with the hard driving rocker, \\"Sweet Sacrifice,\\" where Amy Lee declares fear is only in our minds and she's not putting up with any more crap. This is sure to be a great concert favorite and will make a great opener at there shows due to it being one of the heaviest songs on the album.  The first single, \\"Call Me When You're Sober,\\" is full of Amy's soaring vocals and hard hitting guitar that we have come to expect from them and should please any fan. Other standout tracks include, \\"Weight Of The World,\\" with its eastern motifs and hard hitting chugging guitars making it probably the heaviest song on the album. \\"Lithium,\\" an awesome power ballad blended beautifully with piano, strings, guitar.  \\"Cloud Nine,\\" a spooky, hard driving rocker bringing back memories of Fallen's, \\"Haunted.\\" Without a doubt, the most creative and experimental song off the album. Track 7, \\"Lacyrmosa\\" shows that Evanescence is now even leaning more into classical and epic territory, and this is the most epic song on the album as you would have guessed. An awesome cover of a wonderful Mozart musical piece.  The album ends with the piano ballad, \\"Good Enough.\\" This really was an excellent and smart choice to end it like this, on a happy and positive side,even if it is unusual from Evanescence. <br /> <br />All in all, I highly recommend The Open Door to all Evanescence fans and to any lover of great rock music.  You will not be disappointed!!!  Evanescence has defintley proved there staying power and I only expect them to go higher and higher with there third album and in other future releases. BUY IT NOW!!! <br /> <br />THE OPEN DOOR - ROCK ALBUM OF THE YEAR - 2006
B000HIVO64|5.0|I've always been partial to Beck's Mutations, Sea Change and Odelay offerings and this disc did not disappoint at all on first listen.  In fact, I was completely blown away by how psychedelic, organic and tuneful this was while at the same time being modern and even danceable!   <br /> <br />This one manages to merge the beautiful melodies found on Mutations and Sea Change with the funky stuff found on Odelay, Midnight Vultures and Guero.  There are songs on here that a person can completely get lost in, and I mean that in a very good way... <br /> <br />I encourage everyone to listen to the disc for the first time by watching the DVD with a good set of headphones.  The DVD is completely original and as a bonus, the chicks are hot too. <br /> <br />If the 1967 Rolling Stones were teleported to 2006, given 70s and 80s era equipment and asked to produce a disc that would sell to the hippest people on the planet, it would sound like this. <br />
B000F8O35U|5.0|This is unquestionably my favorite Disney movie of all time. Great music, great story, humor, this movie has it all. Snatch it up before it is no longer available!<br /><br />The DVD features on this edition of The Little Mermaid are wonderful! The deleted scenes are roughly animated, but are delightful. Each is introduced by the co-writers/co-directors, and the missing scenes even provide you with information about the story never before known (did you know that the Ursula is King Triton's SISTER?!) The making of featurrette is a 45-minute extraveganza that goes into all the details you ever wanted to know about the development, creation, and even ramifications of the film. And did you know that Disney at one time was developing a Little Mermaid theme park attraction ride? This DVD allows you to not only learn about the ride and it's development, but also to take a virtual ride on the attraction itself - as it would have been if it had ever been realized. The 10-minute Disneypedia is in my opinion the most valuable feature on the entire DVD (besides the film itself, of course). It combines animation with live footage of undersea creatures. It is especially wonderful for children because it not only entertains, it EDUCATES! And that is the most wonderful thing of all!<br /><br />This is a gem of a DVD... Don't miss it!
B000HIVO64|5.0|When I first played this I felt a little let down because I thought a lot of the tracks resembled Guero... only in the sense that he was rapping on certain tracks.  And I was expecting an album that sounded more like Mellow Gold.  But after numerous listens this album really grew on me and I think it's what an overproduced Mellow Gold would sound like.  This album is very crazy in comparsion to his last few albums.  (Sea Change being all acoustic with strings and Guero being mostly hip-hop).  This one jumped genres all over the place.  Definitely one you should buy (if not for the amazing packaging alone).  Beck rules, enough said.
0517543052|5.0|This book guides you through Ram Dass' transformation from Harvard Professor to seeker of enlightenment.  You will never read a book quite like this.  You must experience it to appreciate its artistic quality and great wisdom.  Highly recommended for any seeker of truth and awareness.
B00005JOQS|2.0|(SPOILERS!!!) Imagine a guy, lying comatose in a hospital bed, patterned pyamas and all, being visited by the son he doesn't know he has... one of the rare things differing this movie from the Mexican soaps is the absence of Spanish language (I know a lot of people likes this genre, but it doesn't have anything to do with Superman). It was trumpeted for it's faithfulness to Richard Donner's movie, but, in the light of this situation, any refference to it and a quotation feels more like sacriledgeous blow than a nod. Mr. Donner knew and felt what Superman IS all about, and what we get here instead is pathetic soap, interspersed with overblown action scenes. To discuss the fact that any logic is surgically operated out of this movie (eg, Superman stops the plane from crashing in the last moment, becouse of it's weight, and then, afterwards, hurtles the whole mountain consisting partly of KRYPTONITE into space, almost effortlessly) would be beside the point. The music, when it is not any of majestic John William's themes, is simply put awfull, especially contrasted to aforementioned themes, which are very well performed, orchestrated, recorded, and engineered this time, making the situation enven more painful. Well, Bryan Singer never had good music in his movies anyway, but he had good movies so far, so he could get away with that. Also, the logic of casting a cute, but ultimately charisma-and-character-less actress in the role of Lois Lane will forever elude me. Saying all this, I have to point out that I respect Mr. Singer and his work very much, and congratulate him for discovering Brandon Routh (if only he had restrained his emoting a bit, it would not look that he is going to throw up one too many times - otherwise he was great as Superman). All this would be even more of a reason to ask: what was Mr. Singer thinking? Was Superman too super for him? Find out for yourself...
B00028U6B8|5.0|For the whole album concept, this is Airplane's finest work. There's a number of distinguished guests helping out (greats Nicky Hopkins, Stephen Stills, and Jerry Garcia to name a few), and every track is a gem.  <br /> <br />There's country, folk, and good old rock 'n' roll. Something for everyone.  <br /> <br />Essential listening for fans of 60's american rock.
B000GG4XJM|2.0|geez, how many times can you repackage and sell Bruce's stuff? We had the essential Bruce that you had to buy to get the bonus disc. Next we have the Seeger sessions, and now an updated version of it with some new tracks and video just a few months later. How about \\"Born To Run\\" ? An aniversary edition of it with a DVD of a London show in 1975. THEN a 2 disc audio Cd of the live show. Geez, if you have the DVD just record the audio portion. I know property taxes are high in Jersey but does he really need the money that bad? We're all supposed to run out and buy whatever he sells? So much of what he's been doing lately is BORING. I love Bruce and have from the beginning but enough is enough! My rule now is that if it's not with the E-Street Band it's not getting my money. Sorry if I don't share Bruce's artistic vision lately but I know I'm not the only one.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming of age story about a young man who is a wallflower is his own life. While this gives him some startling insight about his friends, he finds that he's not really participating, not really living his own life. <br /> <br />As Charlie struggles to get a grip on his increasingly slippery life, tackling such topics as dating, sex, abuse, drugs, abortion and depression, it's his past that may ultimately be his undoing. <br /> <br />While Perks of Being a Wallflower may seem a bit unrealistic in a time sense, once you get over the fact that Chbosky essentially condensed the bulk of the highschool experience into one year you'll find the book to be poignant, heartfelt, and always, above all, honest.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Like all other fans of this movie, I've impatiently waited for the last five years since the Platinum Editions line was formed in 2001 (Back when TLM was scheduled for a 2008 (!) re-release date, may I add.) for this Special 2-Disc Edition of the movie on DVD. Well today, two years earlier than originally planned, the Platinum Edition of The Little Mermaid is FINALLY available, and it's been well worth the wait.    The centerpiece of the whole set is on disc 1 - the movie itself. Forget all the grain, softness, and other video issues on previous VHS releases, as well as the not-so-hot non-anamorphic transfer of the barebones 1999 Limited Issue DVD. THIS has been digitally restored, with colors punched up, most of the grain removed, and just all around made fantastic, and is presented in anamorphic widescreen, which means it's enhanced for 16:9 TV sets. It's never looked this gorgeous or amazing on video. It's never SOUNDED this good either. The sound mix is amazing. Trust me, if you own any of the two previous VHS tapes, and/or laserdiscs, and/or the Limited Issue DVD, you STILL need to get this just for the improvement in the video and audio.    There are only a few bonuses on disc 1. The commentary and Ashley Tisdale music videos are ones I have not yet checked out, although I plan to listen to the commentary soon. The Little Mermaid III Musical Sneak Peek is also included. The quality of the animation is subpar, but not as subpar as what you see in the preview for Cinderella III, which looks like it was made by the same crappy animation team that did Cinderella II. Sad.    Disc 2 does NOT contain a massive quantity of bonus materials like a few of the previous Platinum Edition DVDs like Snow White. However, this time around, Disney decided on quality over quantity. All the bonus materials make up ONE page of the DVD guide, but this time, Disney does not include much of the usual fluff from post-Snow White Platinum Editions, such as crappy games and 5 crappy pop videos. Ashley Tisdale's video is the only one in the set, and it's on disc 1. And instead of games, Disney includes a VERY special bonus in the Games and Activities section - a recreation of the cancelled Little Mermaid Attraction that was in development for Walt Disney World in the early 90's. With CGI animation, the ride that almost was is brought to life. There are two ways to explore it. You can explore it as a ride, with audio commentary. You can also explore it with \\"Ride With Disney Imagineers,\\" which lets you listen to the commentary AND view storyboards, the ride itself, and at certain points, turn on the lights so you can see all the stuff going on. I'm absolutely impressed with this bonus feature, and it's one that merits repeat viewing.    The Deleted Scenes section of a Disney DVD usually only includes maybe two or three scenes. This one contains three deleted sequences, a song demo, and three alternate/extended versions of scenes that are in the movie, including an alternate ending. Among my favorites were the alternate version of Fathoms Below, where we learn that Ursula is Triton's SISTER. I also loved the alternate version of Poor Unfortunate Souls, which includes alternate lyrics from the original demo, as well as some additional dialogue. The final scene isn't a scene at all. Instead, it's audio from the quickly deleted song Silence Is Golden, which was to be Ursula's song, but lyricist Howard Ashman hated it and threw it out early in the picture, so it was never even storyboarded. The audio is played with a screen giving details of the song and a piece of developmental artwork of Ursula and Ariel. The Deleted Scenes section is absolutely awesome, and definitely something fun to watch.    Backstage Disney is always the best part of a 2-Disc Disney DVD's extras. The Little Mermaid's Backstage Disney section is no exception. The central focus is the 45-minute documentary Treasures Untold. The documentary isn't just fluff about how they worked on thepicture, etc. It also goes into detail about the management changes that made The Little Mermaid possible, and how *gasp* Jeffrey Katzenburg almost wouldn't let Part Of Your World be in the picture! They even acknowledge that they made The Black Cauldron in this one, which to me is absolutely shocking.    In addition, there's a featurette on the Special Effects Unit, and the \\"Story Behind The Story,\\" (No, not a port over from the Beauty and the Beast DVD.) which talks about Hans Christian Andersen and the original fairy tale of TLM. However, a nice surprise is a new animated short based on Andersen's story The Little Match Girl. No dialogue, and set to Alexander Borodin's String Quartet #2, this short was intended for the now scrapped Fantasia 2006 project. This short is more melancholy than Disney's treatment of The Little Mermaid, but VERY faithful to the story, right down to keeping the bittersweet ending of the original tale intact. Rounding out this section are galleries, (Which include concept artwork done for a scrapped TLM project at Disney from the 1940's.) the early presentation reel which includes visual development drawings, concept art, etc. set to a demo version of Under The Sea, and the original 1989 theatrical trailer.    I urge you, if you're a fan of this movie, even a casual one, PLEASE pick up this DVD. It's worth the cost JUST for the movie alone, but awesome and MEATY bonus features that, for the most part, break away from all the \\"kiddie\\" fluff oversaturating most Disney DVDs nowadays absolutely sweeten the deal.    And to the people complaining that computer generated animation has been added to this DVD, any computer animation you see in this movie has always been there. The 80's saw a lot of experimentation with computer animation, and there's several instances of this, such as the opening shot of the ship in the movie, as well as a staircase background later in the movie. In addition, the wedding scene was also the first usage of Disney'snew computer colorization program, which would be used to full effect in Beauty and the Beast, along with complete scenes featuring computer animation. The only thing in this movie that is different from the older versions is that the preist's \\"excitement\\" has been digitally airbrushed out. *Although since it's actually his knee and not the far more sexual thing people claim it is...*
0743454537|3.0|This book told a fascinating story.  As a parent of small children, it was easy to put myself in the shoes of these parents.  What would you do if your toddler had a deadly disease?  Wouldn't you do anthing in your power to save her?  What if your choice was hurting your other child?  Although the mother in this story was more a villain than necessary, I could understand her panic when confronted with the possible death of her daughter.  I liked the different points of view and found Anna's situation heartbreaking and compelling.  I was ready to give the book five stars.... right until the ending.  The ending was a terrible cop-out; I couldn't believe it even as I was reading it.  I'm certain the author thought this ending was the neatest way to tie up any loose endings, but ANYTHING else, regardless of how messy or hurtful, would have been better.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|the soundtrack makes you re-live the moments of the movie. It has a wonderful variety of artist from kelly clarkson to wyclef jean, some new lyrics and some are cover songs for example from the greatest band of the 60's-The Beatles.  It's a very enjoyable album.   I hope you all enjoy it, as much as I do.
B00097DX3U|2.0|I think I've listened to this once....that's all I could take.  \\"Be Yourself\\" is the only decent one here.  Anybody want my copy?  It's in the bottom of the Mississippi River somewhere near Memphis.  Good luck!
B0000A0DRY|5.0|One of the greatest albums of all-time! Favorite songs are D.C.B.A.-25, White Rabbit, J.P.P. MeStep B. Blues, My Best Friend, Somebody to Love, She Has Funny Cars, and 3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds.
0739302043|2.0|I found this to be a really annoying, and - in the audio format - annoyingly-told story. It sounds like a screenplay, with symbolism, mystery, and trivia that are so mediocre... how best to describe it? Here, read the book if you think this is fascinating: the orange is a symbol of the divine feminine because it's round like a mother's womb. If that doesn't blow you away, read something else.<br /><br />The two leads are so stereotypical, it hurts. Lastly, the guy reading the audio version puts on these heavy nasal French accents that actually impede understanding of what's being said, and then he has French people speak to each other in these accents - way overdone. Then, layered on that, they are explaining things to each other that any French person would already know (cle de voute, for example) for the reader's benefit.<br /><br />Taking in the many supposedly intriguing objects and situations in this book was exactly like watching the movie Van Helsing for me - I'm watching that thinking \\"a werewolf, and vampires? and frankenstein? and hot chicks? why, it's got everything! what next?\\" Short attention span theater. The fact that this book is so popular makes me sad.
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I understand why the Beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck. They only made about two decent songs in their \\"Hey Jude\\" a pretty song, and \\"Ballad Of John And Yoko\\". The sixties was a horrible decade of rock music. I would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties, which one of them is Neil Young's \\"Down By The River\\". <br />I have listened to the Beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was. They were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time. This ONE album is definately not the album to buy at ALL unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music. <br />Here you will get 25 of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want good music, I recommend go buy albums from Foreigner, Dire Straits, Green Day, Guns N' Roses, and Metallica insted. Don't buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on 25 awful songs.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|My god this movie stunk, at least compared to the first two movies anyway.  This movie is worse than the worst of the x-men cartoons in plot, characterization and just plain fun.  I'm sure they spent lots of money on this movie, too bad they didn't spend more of it on the script and the director.  And it is obvious that the movie was \\"hacked\\" together, when the scene on the Golden Gate Bridge starts, it is the middle of the day, the next  minute they are at Alcatraz and suddenly it is midnight.  But the worse thing they did is the destruction of the characters, not just the ones they killed off, but how they changed them.  I wished I'd never watched this movie, it took characters that I liked and made them detestable, weak, stupid, etc., etc.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|I first started to listening to Bowie back in the 70s through his HEROES album.  A masterpiece of song writing and producing, it was, to me, one of the best albums of the 70s, and the peak of Bowies powers (I had heard other Bowie material on the radio). <br /> <br />LOW was added to my Bowie library, albeit reluctantly at the time.  For decades, my exposure to Bowie consisted solely these two albums. <br /> <br />Recently, however, I have expanded my Bowie experience, and have learned to appreciate his genius throughout his career.  There are periods which appeal to me more than others - pre-STATION TO STATION is a bit too silly, and the 80s period is too techno. <br /> <br />However, his return to work with Eno on OUTSIDE (continue the series, please!) saw Bowie re-embracing a style I could appreciate - it was daring and unpredictable. <br /> <br />As good as HEATHENS is, REALITY is the true successor to SCARY MONSTERS, Bowie's last Great Album before he fell into populism excess.  The production values are astounding (even the detractors here admit that), and the songs are adventurous, compelling, and confident.  Bowie has surely arrived at that point in his career where he is free to let the music speak, rather than being concerned if he is going to fit into media molds. <br /> <br />I am now solidly a Bowie fan.  Sure, there are albums - heck, whole periods - that don't appeal to me.  But, his willingnes to take risks, to change, and to push his own limitations will always be inspiring, and will surely garner him new legions of fans for years to come. <br /> <br />Bravo, David. <br /> <br />Thank you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-
B000FTWB7G|4.0|This album is very good. I actully like it better then their first album. The first track is great. Her voice is hot.
0156027321|5.0|This used to be my favorite book.  It's still in the running, no doubt.  Still, Some of the tiny details could have been worked out better, maybe some emotions explained more deeply.  Of course, that's why I feel this book is so well written.  It's quite human.  We often can't describe our emotions nor the actions based upon our confused feelings. <br /> <br />Looking for a thought-provoking (but never brain-numbing) light read?  This could be the book for you.  I couldn't put this one down, even skipped a few meals for it-- I never do that.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I don't want to rehash everything everyone's already said before, but all of the superlative reviews are true.  This is one of those albums that the more you listen to it, the more AMAZING it becomes.  I have been playing it nonstop in my car on the way to and from work since the day I bought it, and can't seem to get enough.  I've always been a Cee-Lo fan, although I confess I was never really familiar with Danger Mouse.  Cee-Lo's lyrics are exceptional-- I'd even go so far as to say profound, and coupled with Danger's beats, this album is on another level.  My favorite track on this album is \\"Storm Coming\\".  The beat is just epic in scope, and Cee-Lo really get's caught up in his rendition as the song builds to a crescendo.  When he sings \\"When I sing it's a cyclone, I'm writing a RAGING sea\\" you FEEL it!  That song is great played loud while coasting down a highway.  Simply spectacular.  Indeed, all the songs on this album are great, with one exception in my opinion- the opening track \\"Go Go Gadget Gospel\\".  I love \\"Feng Shui,\\" \\"Who Cares,\\" \\"Smiley Faces,\\" \\"St. Elsewhere\\" \\"Necromancer\\" and \\"Transformer\\".  A truly outstanding album.  Buy it!!!  (Oh, by the way, the OutKast double album has NOTHING on this album.  I thought Speakerboxx/The Love Below was mostly crap.  St. Elsewhere is something wonderful.)
B000GY729M|3.0|While i have to give these guys credit for taking their time to release a second album I wish I could say I like Sam's Town as much as Hot Fuss. That said, there is still a lot of talent on this album IMHO. Since I usually read reviews to find out which tracks are worth an honest listen, I figured I would recommend a few. If you don't like these great songs then don't bother listening to the rest. If you are a killers fan like I am then you will definitely find the genious in them:<br /><br />Bling (i think it's better than When You Were Young)<br /><br />Uncle Johnny<br /><br />Bones<br /><br />The rest could very well grow on me in time but I doubt it.
B000089RVX|4.0|I got this CD the summer of 2003, but I like it much better now.  This is a solid set of songs.  Sonically, it's good but nothing very innovative for the most part:  9 hard-rocking songs and a couple of beautiful piano ballads.  What makes this better than so many other hard-rock bands is the fact that they have a female lead singer who has a gorgeous, haunting voice, like Sarah McLachlan but even more powerful than that...so somehow it suits this kind of music.  Also, the lyrics are personal, raw, and introspective, and I like that too.  The only song I could do without is \\"My Last Breath\\" because I find it boring overall, and the only thing I would add is the radio version of \\"My Immortal\\" as a bonus track, which was more rocking at the end of the song.
0743298020|5.0|Who cares about the style... the plot... the writer. This is one great read. You finish the last pages, you close the book, you think to yourself of what you've just read and breathe a sigh of satisfaction. \\"Well done,\\" you'll say... \\"I liked that,\\" you'll say. \\"who should I lend this to first\\" you'll wonder. New books are a dime a dozen. Keepers are rare. This one is a keeper.
5558765283|1.0|If anyone is hoping for a happy ending - or any ending at all, you're not going to get it in this book.  The characters wander around until they're killed in some senseless and/or horrible way.  No plot at all! These books have become increasingly misogynistic - very disturbing.
B000GY729M|1.0|Whoever is writing that this IS a good album must be industry plants. <br />I do not hear a second single at all...WHATHAPPEN? <br /> <br />I traded it two hours ago for the New Morrissey...........Totally bummed...
B0009R1T7M|1.0|Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album.  Stevens blatantly rips off his own music.  I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece.  Do yourself a favor and start there.
B000GY729M|4.0|The Killers' debut was easy to like.  It was straight-up '80s-influenced rock.  Nothing complicated.  It also would have been easy to release a follow up that attempted to continue to milk the success of their previous release.  First off, I am glad The Killers decided not to rehash their first album.  The question, though, is whether or not what they've done with Sam's Town is worth the effort. <br /> <br />The first track, Sam's Town, sets the groundwork for the rest of the album.  Although there is still some of that trademark synthesizer sound, it is relegated to the background as a heavier guitar sound takes over. <br /> <br />After a short detour with \\"enterlude\\", the current radio-play song, When You Were Young brings back the synthesizer a bit.  Perhaps this song is the closest thing to the sound everybody broke their teeth on so many months ago.  Admittedly, I am not overly fond of it.  It sounds too much like an attempt to throw a hasty coat of paint on an old theme. <br /> <br />Although I've seen several people mention \\"Bling\\" as a standout on this album, it's somewhat of a pass for me.  I prefer For Reasons Unknown, the following song.  It sports the high-tempo vocals that make The Killers what they are without sounding much like the material from their debut. <br /> <br />Read My Mind and Uncle Jonny continue to help define The Killers new sound.  Neither is a \\"killer\\" (pun intended), but they manage to hold their own.  The following track, though, \\"Bones\\" is a standout.  This song manages to extend what's at the heart of what makes The Killers who they are; the melodic rollercoaster ride with Brandon's voice getting a nice workout along the way. <br /> <br />The next few songs, while not necessarily notable, certainly aren't bad.  On a side note, the last song, \\"exitlude\\" reminds me a bit of Modest Mouse.  It is an interesting change of pace to end the album and closes down the theme set up by \\"enterlude\\". <br /> <br />All in all, Sam's Town doesn't quite live up to the standard set by the debut.  However, it is still a good listen.  It is obvious The Killers are trying to move in a different direction without completely abondoning what got them to where they are.  Change is good, and there is a lot of room for these guys to evolve.  I am looking forward to seeing them live in a couple of weeks and for what comes from them down the road.
B000GB775E|3.0|This movie is okay.  But overall, it is not very good.  This movie is not all funny.  Some of them are actually fair-fetched.  For the story, it is only so-so.  It is all because these kinds of lucky and unlucky scenarios do happen in real life.  However, some cases do not need to be over exaggerating.  For the acting, it is a good one because for the role of Ashley, Lindsay Lohan suits as her role.  For the direction, well, it is okay overall because the whole movie is just okay.  For the visuals, they are so-so.  For the music, they are good because almost all the music is from McFly and suits the movie.  Finally, for the sound effects, they are okay.  So, overall, this movie is okay to see.
1878424114|5.0|I have read most all of Deepak Chopra's books - this one has a different presentaton style and makes for an entertaining reading and learning experience!

A great gift buy for someone you love!<br /><br />A FIVE STAR BOOK!
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I'm saddened to say, as a huge fan of Evanescence's last album, this one was a horrible follow up.  The music is ok (and when I say music is ok, I usually do not bother buying the cd), but the production was just horrible.  The singing and guitar work are totally off note from each other in the majority of the songs, and the beats mixed with vocals just do not work.  Instead of sounding \\"goth\\" rock, or darker, they just sound shrill and whiney.  Aside from some \\"ok\\" songs like \\"Lacrymosa\\" and \\"Like You\\", which have an essence of the old Evanescence, the rest of the album just made me sit there angry because it was so horrible.  Now don't get me wrong, as I said, I loved \\"Fallen\\", but this is a far cry from what I enjoyed off of the last album.  Some fans that are new to this band may enjoy this cd, but I cannot for the life of me see how any one who enjoyed \\"Fallen\\" can even compare these two albums.  What I find on \\"The open door\\" is Amy Lee with an extremely whiney voice, compiled with completely average guitar and instrumental work.  I hate to say it, but I think this band now lives up to their last album, they have \\"Fallen\\" in my eyes. <br />
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This album really does have a different sound from Fallen. I think Fallen had more a pop appeal like Amy said. I think that this album has more maturity, int erms of vocals and music. The songs are definitely more complex and maybe with just one listen you won't be able to appreciate it fully.
B000HIVO64|4.0|I have loved every Beck CD. That said, when Beck announced that the new CD would be hip-hop influenced, I expected something along the lines of Midnite Vultures. Not the case. The first time I listened to this album, I wasn't sure I understood what Beck was going for. I agree with a previous review, it does sound like a combination of Odelay and Sea Change. But what's interesting about this album, at least to me, is how DARK of an album this actually is. This album is like a clown performing tricks in front of a bunch of kids, but with a looming, malevolent shadow slowly creeping up behind him. Beck has traditionally dealt with the concept of technology in a whimsical, fun way. On this album, however, he unveils a new vision of the future: sterile, soulless, and scary.   In my opinion, the album is best listened to as a concept and a mood album. It's not a comfortable listen, but it's definitely worth your time and money. The man continually amazes me.
0913866156|5.0|Note that the printing problems refered to in some reviews is NO LONGER an issue. This is the correctly colored best in-print edition of this deck. Buy with confidence!
B000GY729M|5.0|I don't understand any of the bad reviews this CD has gotten. This is the most brilliant album of the last 5 years that I've heard. \\"Hot Fuss\\" is great, too, but I can't understand why anybody would want a band to release the same album, no matter how great, repackaged and stale. This album is the perfect compliment thematically to \\"Hot Fuss\\". Their first release felt like a nighttime dance party. This album is like the daytime desert trip through the countryside before you end up at that club. Each song on the album is distinct, unpredictable, and memorable, with different timbres and instruments flavoring the songs with interesting tidbits. This band IS the SASS, which I think is what is missing from a lot of music today. Yes, it's occasionally over the top. But when it is, it's with a knowing wink.  <br />This album deserves more review than \\"It's not Hot Fuss.\\"
B00005KAQP|5.0|I love whoopi goldberg, and I love this movie. wholesome (besides the shooting, etc)AND funny..I also bought the second one because I love it so much too
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This is a great Album that I hope will top the charts. Evanescence is a great band with a great sound and message.  They are truely unique and great at what they do. <br /> <br />\\"The Open Door\\" is a must-have album, with the same great sound as \\"Fallen\\", but with a slight edge.  I love every single song on this  album, and would recommend everyone to get it.

B000002TQB|5.0|OK. So I was duped. Alan Williamson--see The Stone Roses review--is the funniest man alive! Thinking he was serious, I got all riled up and blasted him a new one over this Stone Roses album and ended up sounding like a complete arrogant putz in the process. Bravo, sir! His reviews are hilarious and well worth searching out, especially the Beatles REVOLVER  and the one (S) about Kelley Clarkson and womens shoes! Very funny stuff.  <br />Want to know who he really likes? The ones with only 1 star!  <br />This album is one of the greatest debuts ever, by the way...JUST IN CASE YOU WERE READING THIS TO ACTUALLY SEE WHAT I THOUGHT OF PARKLIFE! Not as good as he OST from the Pagemaster movie staring a very young Mr. Culkin, but not bad at all! <br />(wink wink) <br /> <br />
B000G759LW|4.0|This is a good cd..I LOVE aint no other man..4 stars beause there werent a lot of big ballods like i expected to hear from christina
B000GY729M|5.0|Listened to the Killers new album Sam's Town, although not Hot Fuss at all it was still good!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|Never a fan of the comic book hero outings, this viewer watched X-MEN - THE LAST STAND with a bit of mental prejudice: action heroes capable of destroying everything in sight at the glance of a weird eye or the motion of a hand have just never seemed entertaining.  But given that stance, watching this very colorful film was an art study in how far computer generated graphics have come in a relatively short time. And that makes the time spent on the non-story worthwhile.<br /><br />Of course it is always a pleasure to see Sir Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden, Patrick Stewart, and the newly buff Ben Foster in action: nice costume effects despite overdone makeup etc.  But the story is so slim that it can be ignored and the viewer can watch the rather extraordinary special effects - until they ultimately wear thin (as when the house lifts off the ground, etc!).  So advice for those fellow viewers who avoid these Marvel Comic movies: drop the prejudice long enough to see what is au courante in special effects.  It is rather entertaining...for a while.

B000GY729M|5.0|It would have been so easy for the Killers To Follow Up their Debut CD Hot Fuss with Hot Fuss II but they took a chance and made a CD that takes them in a new direction and it really pays off! This is the kind of cd that needs to be listened to a few times to really appreciate how this band has grown and evolved. The Stand Out Tracks to me ar of Course  When you were Young and also Bling but every track is excellent! I commend the band for taking a risk and making a cd that may not be as commercial as the first cd but every bit as great if not better! I was lucky enough to meet the band at their Virgin Megastore Signing in Hollywood on the day the cd was released and they were Very Friendly to their fans. In addition to the new cd they also signed memorabilia that the fans brought with them and were just so down to earth. This is a band that more than paid their dues and I am Happy to see that their hard work has paid off! They deserve every bit of the huge success that they have achieved! ROCK ON KILLERS!
0618551050|4.0|\\"Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself in a dark wood where the right way was lost\\"...\\"As I walked through the wilderness of this world.\\" <br />     Pilgrim Smolin has fashioned an entertaining and informative travelog that leads us through the modern equivalent of those classic landscapes. It is the account of an emergent PhD seeking his identity in the dark wood for the next thirty years.  Making his way through relativity, quantum, particle and string theories, he encounters the best and the worst of doing science. Career opportunities vie with disillusionment in shaping his course. His story is laced with vignettes of fellow travelers who shared his experience. <br />     The final section of his book is a commentary on sources of \\"The Trou- <br />ble\\"--a burgeoning bureaucracy in control of funding and an aging hierarchy <br />of successful professors who channel the work of their young colleagues. <br />Still, ambition and the drive for a place in history can prevail! (In phys- <br />ics the prize is concisely identified by Nobelist Paul Dirac's famous ques- <br />tion to a young Richard Feynman, \\"Do you have an equation?\\") <br />     At publication time, Smolin apparently has the object of his quest in <br />sight: a theory of loop quantum gravity. Let's hope that his next book will <br />unveil his equation. Meanwhile, come up to speed by reading this one.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|ok when i first read the reviews on this album before it was ever released i was alittle dissapointed cause the reviews were all bad..but now that i have listened to the open door this album is so awesome..i just dont understand how some of you can put bad reviews on this album then you are truly not evanescence fans...evanescence did an awesome job on this album....evanescence rocks!!!..if you havent purchased this album yet then i suggest you purchase it now,you will not be dissapointed...
B000GG4XJM|1.0|Shame on Bruce.  Who would have believed Mr. Springsteen would be gouging his fans like this?  Pay me my money down alright - and again, too.  Stay away from this rip-off!    Like the 'Boss Fan' says in his review:  \\"It's only a ripoff if you buy it\\".  Right on man.  Save your money!
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I only bought \\"Fallen\\" about a month ago and loved it right away. I loved all the tracks on the CD and thought they all had great lyrics and catchy music. It is one of my favorite CD's that I own. So, obviusly, I was eager for \\"The Open Door\\" to be released. I liked the first single, \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\", however, I didnt think it was anything exceptional. While I wasn't dissapointed by the album, it didn't meet up to expectations for me. In my opinion, the best songs on the CD are \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Weight of the World\\",\\"Cloud Nine\\", \\"Like You\\", \\"Lose Control\\", \\"The Only One\\", and \\"All That I'm Living for.\\" These songs stand out in the true Evanescence fashion. The lyrics are, I must say, a little better than their first album and the music and tone are heavier and deeper as well. Now, while I have appreciation for \\"LIthium\\" \\"Lacrymosa\\" and \\"Good Enough (since this is the only song on the CD that follows in the footsteps of \\"My Immortal\\"), I don't see what the big fasincation is with them. ALso, at times, I felt like i was listening to the same song over and over again. Of course, AMy Lee still has an amazingly haunting voice. You can feel her pain and its as if shes acting in her singing. She is definatly one of the best vocalists around today. Any Evanescence fan will no doubt enjoy this album- although not as much as \\"Fallen\\". THere really aren't many songs that you can play over and over again and not get tired of them (like all the songs on \\"Fallen\\"). This is a good CD to own though and most people will not be dissapointed.
B000GY729M|5.0|First off, if you're looking for the Hot Fuss-sounding tracks...buy Hot Fuss! This album is a brilliant one. However, it is a total departure from the well-known \\"Killers\\" sound. At first listen, you can't really take in the whole experience. Listen more than once and you start to hear it! Those who slam this album do so simply because they have no concept of The Killers' talent range or what it takes to become a great artist. The lyrics are superb and the music is spot on with this one. As aforementioned, if you're looking for songs that sound like \\"Somebody Told Me\\", or \\"Mr. Brightside\\" you won't find them here. But, if you're looking to purchase a great album from a great band, then I would highly suggest giving this one a try. Don't be scared off by the magazine reviews. If you're reading a review in some death metal magazine, then, yeah, they'll probably slam the album. Form your own opinion! If you are more into the \\"heavy\\" scene, then this is not for you. This album, in my opinion, has a sound sort of like a mixture between Queen and Bob Dylan. If you are a true fan that truly appreciates a well-crafted, unique musical ensemble, buy this one today! If you only like the earlier sounds...just go download \\"When You Were Young\\".
0156030322|2.0|There's an old adage amongst some of us online reviewers that kinda/sorta goes like this: if you have to resort to frequently using words like \\"perfect,\\" \\"riveting,\\" \\"startling,\\" and \\"stunning,\\" you're more than likely describing what the story isn't for the average person because the average person -- the casual reader, Joe Six Pack with a good in his hands -- tends to find these adjectives descriptive of very specific events in his life ... events like falling in love, throwing the game-winning touchdown pass, and having a child.  As a consequence of such overblown rhetoric, James Sallis' DRIVE ends up being memorable only on the grounds that one was duped into believing such a middleground neo-noir tale is destined to be literature's next classic when it'll probably be nothing in the next ten years.<br /><br />Yes, it's \\"lean,\\" and it could quite probably be read in a single sitting if not in a handful of hours, and, yes, it's full of the pretty-sounding, poetic prose any reader of Sallis has come to expect, but there's little meat on these bloodied bones: Driver sticks to what he does well -- he drives, be it for movie studios or as the getaway driver for a handful of hardened criminals -- but, once he's double-crossed, you find out he's a wealth of other talents in extracting revenge on those who set him up.  The grim reality here is that no one REALLY sets Driver up; he simply takes the wrong job at the wrong time, and, as generally happens in noir tales, there's a price to be paid.  Driver isn't fond of paying such a price, so he hits back at those he try to take him for a ... well ... er ... for a ride.<br /><br />Unfortunately, unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the narrative extremely difficult to follow, as Sallis attempts to successfully unfold this yarn out of chronology -- think of it as sort of an even hipper, jet set, PULP FICTION type narrative where some events are even told twice ... with the same exact words and from the same point of view.  It's a gamble -- a highly calculated gamble -- and I didn't feel it came off very well here.  As a matter of fact, it forced me to flip back to the earlier section in the book to make certain I wasn't somehow lost in this 160-page novel.<br /><br />Yes, DRIVE is certainly a noir tale, but it's hardly 'hard-boiled,' as Ohio's ThisWeek tries to make its readers believe.  It's been my experience that critics who don't dabble in 'hard-boiled' literature usually do this -- attach the adjective to what they believe is 'hard-boiled' in order to sound relevant -- and this tends to produce a flattening effect: less people question the validity of the description and, instead, pick up the book and read.  I give credit to Sallis to creating a inventive modern day noir, but, at this cynical, I give his salivating critics credit for selling more copies than was humanly necessary.f view.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|Holly cow! This guy has been doing a little wood sheddin'. I have Heavier Things and it occasionally makes its way into the CD player and then back to the shelf. Try! stays in the CD player. A very impressive piece of work. Great song selections that carry a little more import than some of Mayer's previous more pop-oriented writing. But it's really the guitar playing, backed by this incredible rhythm section, that stands out. Mayer set out to prove something to his audience on this disc, establishing himself as a musician to be taken seriously, and he pulls it off convincingly. When you play in a trio format there is nowhere to hide, and Mayer stands at the front of this band and rocks. This is the best CD I've heard in a long time. Its reassuring to know that with all the drivel you hear on the radio, someone still has the integrity to break through the [...] and put out an exceptional CD.
B000F8O35U|5.0|At last, one of my all-time favorites has been released again to DVD. This film relaunched Disney into mainstream movie dominance, and it is so easy to see how. Everything about this film is perfect. The voice cast, the animation, the story, and oh so importantly, the music. \\"Under The Sea\\" and \\"Kiss The Girl\\" each were nominated for Best Original Song, with \\"Under the Sea\\" winning the Oscar, and the film's score won Best Original Score. This film seemed a return to the glory days of Disney animation, indeed, this film was the start of an amazing run for the Disney Studios, which continued well into the 90's and early 2000's. The Sea Witch, Ursula, is one of the best villains ever thought up for a film. Sebastion, the reluctant sidekick crab, almost steals the film. Ariel, the title character, is just loveable. You find yourself pulling for her immediately. The strength of the story is such that even when Ariel loses her voice as part of her deal with Ursula, the animation captures her desperation and determination perfectly, with such exquisite nuances as a slight head turn, a lift of an eyebrow, a sigh, expresses exactly what spoken dialogue would. Hard to believe this movie is almost 20 years old! My how time flies. Fortunately, a thourough clean-up and restoration was done, with the film looking and sounding like new. Many bonus features are included, as usual for a Platinum Series release, so money spent here is well worth it. This film is a rare treat: a so-called children's film that the whole family can sit down together and enjoy. Get this wonderful film for your DVD collection, and go \\"Under The Sea\\" over and over!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is a film that covers the early career of Johnny Cash and his early romances, plus his encounters with rock n' rollers such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley while on tour. My Mum saw it at least 3 times in the cinema, and then went a whole bunch of Johnny's albums afterwards. When it came out on DVD, I had to pick it up, see what all the fuss was about. It's really well done, I thought, in pretty much every way.    Joaquin Phoenix plays Johnny, and Reese Witherspoon plays June Carter, but after a while I forgot it was them. They did a really good job, I reckon. They really looked the part, they really spoke the part, and really sung it. You could feel the humour, the struggles and the yearning in their lives. Can't say the same about the guy who played Elvis, which is the only thing that bugged me about the film. I mean, he did an all right job, but considering there are so, so many Elvis impersonators in the world, you'd think they'd get someone who looked and sounded a little truer. Ah well. Not really a big deal.    The direction is really great, I thought. I like the way some of the shots helped you guess just what Johnny was thinking just as you needed to in the plot, if that makes sense. The filmmakers definitely have a love of the music and for the man. You can see there's a lot of care taken making the sets, reproducing the instruments and the colour of the 1950s and 1960s. There are a few things to think about besides the music too (father/son relationships, the nature of compassion, etc), but nothing feels forced, it seems to come naturally out of the story. It all feels very natural, actually, that sums up the style very well. Realistic, yet warm.    There's only a couple of special features on the one disc edition, but it's enough for me. There's a commentary by director James Mangold, who describes why he wanted to make the film, what he was trying to evoke, and even reads some parts from the screenplay while its particular scene isplaying. There's also ten deleted scenes, also with a commentary by Mangold, and the original theatrical trailer.    Definitely worth a look for music fans, lovers of Johnny Cash and biopic watchers. It's a fine \\"line\\"!
B000002BE9|4.0|Tidal is a lovely album, and for me can only be likened to the sensation of lying on a settee in that near sleep stage, warmed by an autumn sun streaming through the window. It is that post-lunch satisfaction, the lazy smoke off a fire of piled leaves on a still evening. It is all of these and more. The songs that particularly stand out for me are 'Slow Like Honey' and 'A Child is Gone'. I must admit that I love this moment in her musical life, for, in my humble opinion, 'Tidal' and 'When The Pawn' show acres of raw awareness that 'Extraordinary Machine' unfortunately appears to have lost.
B00007AJF8|2.0|I am a lover movies, and can appreciate even the worst of films. This happens to be one of the ones I appreciate, not love. The plot was creative, but not my taste. It was very corky and dumb, despite it's immense originality. Leaves me to the better question of: why not somebody more entertaining than John Malkovich?<br /><br />The one thing this film does right is cinematography. When you actually are John Malkovich, the camera work is brilliant, as well as the depth perception, sound, and lighting. Basically, what the film does is make a peice of crap LOOK really pretty. John Cusack and Catherine Keener had great performances, but John Malkovich and Cameron Diaz had mediocre performances at best. The film leaves you with nothing. You watch it and you go \\"oh,\\" there is no \\"wow\\" not \\"OH MY!\\" no \\"I can't believe it.\\" You are left there completely apathetic and in utter disappointment.<br /><br />*Side note* If puppets creep you out as much as they do me, than don't watch this film.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|Ok, this is going to be a tough one. I am an unabashed fanatic of the original movie which made such an impact on me when I saw it at the tender young age of 9. It remains my all time favourite movie, albeit it dated and slightly camp. So when I heard that it was being remade by Wolfgang Peterson I was alternately pleased and apprehensive. Pleased because 30 years later there is so much more one can do with specials effects and CGI and apprehensive because who would fill the roles played so admirably by Shelley Winters, Gene Hackman and especially STELLA STEVENS?.  Fortunately the film makers realised the original cast fit their characters perfectly and that the film is a cult classic so they opted for an entirely new set of characters and a newer modern cruise liner set in the present. <br /> <br />That said its quite ironic that in the opening credits it states \\"based on the novel by Paul Gallico\\" when the only thing it has in common with the original novel and book is 1.tidal/rogue wave 2. cruise liner gets turned upside down...surely \\"inspired by\\" would have been more apt. Ok onto the film itself; it certainly is a feast for the eyes the pre capsize sequences show a cruise liner of great beauty and outstanding sets. The capsize sequence is visually spectacular and very realistic and the post capsize sequences are definately gripping and well done. <br /> <br />But and its a big but..there is absolutely no depth and any character development whatsoever, in fact there is hardly anyone that appeals or even stands out in any way. And this is the movies downfall as you dont really care who lives or dies, unlike in the original where each death is gut wrenching. Its also implausible that in a ship of this size there would only be six survivors. Its cold and heartless and the gruesome deaths of hundreds of people is disturbing. <br /> <br />Having said all of the above I still think Poseidon should be viewed and taken on its own merit, spectacular special effects and many stunning sequences which are worth viewing more than once on the DVD. <br /> <br />Would have liked to have a commentary and deleted scenes added.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This is one of those great CD's you play while relaxing by your self or snuggling up with your mate. If you like soft, sweet, easy-going music, with great relatable lyrics, then this is the CD for you! I give it 7 stars!!
0345440900|4.0|We loved this book - both my husband and I.  The author has a very balanced view on baby scheduling and other helpful tips for new parents.  Our sweet baby girl was on a wonderful schedule within 3 weeks and slept through the night at 6 weeks old!  Now, we realize that all babies are different, so you need to see what works best for you & your family - read it and see what you think!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had, on a whim, decided to download this movie because I remembered being mildly intrigued when it came out in theatres, but didn't get a chance to go see it.<br /><br />Within the first 5 minutes I realized what a mistake it was to miss out on the chance to experience it on the cinema screen.<br /><br />This amazingly beautiful story unfolds with well developed and interesting characters.  The pathos is palpable.  Joss Whedon is simply the master of creating a unique universe of characters and situations you identify with and yet have never experienced.<br /><br />I became an instant fan of the movie, the comic series and the TV show.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|As other reviewers pointed out already.  Evanescence's \\"The Open Door\\" lacks the heart that \\"Fallen' has. With a listen through the entire album, each song hardly strays from the same formula.  There really aren't any songs that stand out and the entire album comes across as somewhat of a background music album. It is a shame that Ben Moody and Amy Lee had decided to go separate ways also I was a bit worried when it was decided that a live album was to be the follow up to \\"Fallen\\" this is something that I would expect to be released after a band has collected a substantial catalog of music. With these two occurrences, I had the fear that Evanescence were doomed to disintegrate entirely.  I am glad that that wasn't the case, but I did expect as beautiful an album as Fallen.  Of course it it unfair to compare this album to that one, and maybe with continued listens it will grow on me, but when there is a band or musician that you really respect, having their follow up releases have to grow on you is a bit disappointing.
B000HIVO64|3.0|Beck was kinda like Madonna.  He always reinvented himself.  All of his albums have been drasticly different until Guero came out.  Guero went back towards the style of Odelay, which is fine.  But guess what?  Odelay has been done before!  Not only that, but it wasn't as original as Odelay.  With \\"The Information\\" he atempts this style again.  To discribe this album, I would compare it to Odelay and Sea Change combined.  It contains a lot of his rap style from Odelay and a lot of electronic and melodic elements from Sea Change.  I love Beck's rap style from the early years, but alot of his vocals are drowned out by the beats and blips.  Many times the song goes nowhere.  The first track is great.  Cool effects and a catchy song.  the next couple are good, but then it starts to sound the same.  I find the second half to be a lot better than the first.  It gets more interesting towards the end.   <br />This album is pretty long.  About 17 tracks, more or less.  Since half of it is pretty good, I feel it could have been shortened.  I lose interest in a lot of albums because they are too long.  I think 10 - 12 tracks is the perfect amount.   <br />I used to think Beck could do no wrong.  I've been a huge fan since mellow gold.  Ever since Sea Change, I have been less and less impressed as each album comes along.  They aren't bad albums...they just aren't as good.  Also they aren't as original.  I thought beck wanted to make guitar heavy album.  What happened to that idea?  How about another raw folk album if he is gonna repeat himself.  This album is very new to me.  Maybe it needs repeated listens.  But so far, I'm not impressed. <br />I am impressed however, by the package.  By not reinventing himself musically, he reinvents in the package.  You can create your cover by stickers, and watch a dvd with a music video for all of the songs.  Some of them are quite boring, but it could change the way albums are made.  If you are a big beck fan, get it.  If not, get an earlier album.
0783117523|5.0|I adore this movie. A.J.'s performance is almost too incandescent to watch. She becomes the character in a way that entirely blows my mind. The beauty and reality she creates on the screen, the pathos, the pain and the sense the character extols that there is a raw flame of immortal life in the world and that, at least at the moment, it's on the screen reminds me of what Henry James wrote of Dorothea Brooke, the heroine of Middlemarch: 'We believe in her as in a woman we might providentially meet when we should find ourselves doubting of the immortality of the soul.' <br /> <br />J
B000H0MKGK|4.0|This is a great collection of songs from John Mayer. I saw him on the Today Show and enjoyed him enough to give this a try. <br />Do yourself a favor and give a listen.
B000002572|5.0|There are those who hate AOR on principle (these are the oft-bashed prog snobs--being a huge fan of progressive rock, I can say this because very few of us really act this way).  There are those who hate 1970s rock in general.  And there are those who just hate Boston with a passion derived from some other motivation. (And, I'm not even considering the adolescent generation, most of whom are hopeless.)    Thankfully, assembled these people make up an extreme minority of the population.  Most of us understand just what good music really is.  And we know that 'Boston' (1976) is good music.    The brainchild of MIT graduate and former Polaroid employee Tom Scholz, Boston is a remarkable collection of musicians named Tom Scholz, Brad Delp, Tom Scholz, Tom Scholz, and Tom Scholz.  What?  That's right; most of the album was written and performed by the instrumental wizard Scholz.  To be fair, the drums were laid down by Sib Hashian, and some of the guitars were played by Barry Goudreau.  In addition, some of the bass was played by Fran Sheehan.  Brad Delp's copious range and incredible energy are used to monumental effect in the vocals department--Brad sang both lead and harmony on all the songs.  Other than that, the organ and clavinet, most of the guitar, some of the bass guitar, and all the engineering were handled exclusively by Tom Scholz.    Though this information is readily available now, at the time the album was released it was virtually unknown.  In order to record the album, this had to be kept secret even from CBS, who disapproved of the one-man show and his basement tapes.  Incidentally, Scholz simply re-recorded all the tracks at home with miniscule differences, sent the remainder of the band to a recording studio to work on the lone Delp-penned song (\\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\"), and met up with them when he was done recording the background music.  Delp recorded the remaining vocals, and Scholz added the organ part to \\"Let Me...\\"  And CBS was well andduly fooled, the result being a record in sales for a debut album (it has since been broken, but it stood for years).    Boston's music is a synergy of several different styles, from the hard rock of Led Zeppelin to the melodic grace of the Beatles.  There are also some similarities to Queen, especially in the operatic, layered vocals.  Lyric-wise, it's more intelligent and varied than typical 70s rock, and on the whole the lyrical content is positive.  The songs all more or less follow a standard format, though some are more progressive in structure.  And, something Tom Scholz finds very important to mention, Boston does not use synthesizers or computers on any of its albums (well, actually this only holds true for the first three).  The instrumentation is pure, vintage equipment, put together in a very unique arrangement.  There is a certain Boston sound that pervades every aspect of the instrumentation, something that is so apparent that it has never been imitated anywhere--the source would be so obvious that it would be counterproductive to copy this Boston sound.    The album consists of eight tracks, all of which are in regular rotation on classic rock radio stations all over the United States.  For me, the mark of a good radio station is that it plays Boston.  This album carries some pretty potent memories for me, concerning whom I was with when I first bought it in the summer of 2003 (there was a girl...).  The memories are bittersweet, and my love for Boston has, I can finally say, outlasted my foolish love for the girl.    A track listing, along with my comments for each song:      1.  \\"More Than A Feeling\\" - Everybody and his ugly cousin has heard this song, unless he has been living under a rock, keeping his ugly cousin company.  It's everywhere, all the time.  And yet, it's still an elating piece of music.  The soaring melodies, lyrical guitar, and the fantastic voice of Brad Delp make this a legendary statement in the annals of classic rock.  I don't need to describe it--you all know it already.  It is considered the band's most famous song, even though \\"Amanda\\" from 'Third Stage' (1986) was the band's only number one hit.    2.  \\"Peace Of Mind\\" - Surprisingly, this one didn't chart near as well as the first track, even though \\"Peace\\" is of the same stock.  It gets a fair amount of airplay, though not as much as the first track.  \\"Peace\\" has the same swooping guitars, the same awesome layered vocals, and a really awesome instrumental ending.  The pervasive rapid striking of the tambourine sets this song apart from the previous track: \\"Peace\\" is a more upbeat and driving song.    3.  \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" - If I had to pick my favorite song from this album (please don't make me do this), this one would have to be it.  An electric opening sequence (\\"Foreplay\\") shows Tom Scholz and co. (yes, they play a few notes here and there) in full form, with ripping organ riffs, blazing guitar, searing clavinet, nimble bass, and thunderous drums.  When the sequence slows down somewhat, Scholz uses his guitar to create some cosmic sound effects, along with some high, quiet chords on the organ.  Just as the instruments strike a resolution, a thumping bassline makes itself heard, growing ever in intensity, until the next section of the song begins, explosively.    The \\"Long Time\\" section of this song is more conventional in form, yet it also shows Delp's outrageous vocal range.  He hits a high F (the first F above tuning A-440 Hz) not once but twice in this song.  The chorus of this song, much like the remainder of it, is catchy and interesting.  This song, like all Boston, seems to cause people to air guitar and belt at the top of their lungs with no apparent self-consciousness.    4.  \\"Rock & Roll Band\\" - This is one of my least favorite songs from the album, which is saying something because I still like it fairly well.  It's a straight-up rocker, more in the vein of the next song on the album (\\"Smokin'\\") than that of \\"More Than A Feeling.\\"  Ironically, the story the song tells--that of a rock band and its climb to success--has nothing to do with the band Boston.  Most people assumed the song chronicles Boston's own collective strife, but as we discussed in the introduction, this is not the case.  It's still not a bad song, though.    5.  \\"Smokin'\\" - For some reason, this is my least favorite track on the album.  I guess I just don't much care for those feel-good party songs.  I don't think much of \\"Party\\" on the next release, 'Don't Look Back' (1978), either.  Even so, \\"Smokin'\\" is a competent rock song, with a very good organ solo (with the drawbars set to 888888888) and an impossibly high note (A-880 Hz--a full octave above tuning A-440 Hz) hit by Brad Delp.  If you like this sort of thing, Boston does it just as well as, say, ZZ Top.    6.  \\"Hitch A Ride\\" - This is one of the more melodic songs on the album.  The call-and-answer structre of the vocal melodies is very nice, and the harmonies are lush and perfectly-executed.  This song flows more nicely than any other on the album, even with the break in the middle for a blasting organ solo.  The song ends with an intrumental fadeout, with Scholz (or is it Goudreau?) delivering a signature-Boston guitar solo.  This is one of my all-time favorite Boston songs.    7.  \\"Something About You\\" - This song was the least popular from the album.  The fact that I have heard it fairly frequently on the radio even now, 30 years after it was originally released, makes a statement about the quality of the songs on this album.  This song begins softly, with some very nice neutral syllable vocals from Delp.  Once the introduction passes, the song has a driving yet slightly disjointed beat, and is of course replete with heavenly Delp vocals and all the other elements that define classic Boston.    8.  \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" - The only Brad Delp-penned work on the album, this song makes it clear that Delp was a good songwriter in his own right.I wish we could have heard more from him, especially since Boston albums are usually relatively short--nothing would have had to have been removed to have fit some of Delp's work onto the albums alongside Scholz's songs.  But that is a moot point.  In any event, \\"Let Me...\\" is an excellent closer to the album.  It invokes more acoustic elements than the other songs.  This is likely because everybody in the band played his respective instrument in full in this song, unlike in the other songs, where Scholz performed most of the instrumentation and the other band members just performed supplimentary material.  This song ends with a frenzied, constantly accelerating jam, tapering into a fadeout.      It is of note that this particular edition of the album is the original 1990 striking.  Its sound quality is notoriously poor.  There exists now, as of 2006, an edition of this album (along with 'Don't Look Back') that was personally remastered by Tom Scholz.  The difference in sound quality, by general consensus (supporting my own opinion as well), is profound.  When you find this album in stores, make sure you buy the remastered edition (it comes in a digipak and should have a sticker trumpeting about the album's sales and Tom Scholz's involvement in the project).  Amazon also offers the remastered edition, and at the moment it is offered at a very reasonable price.    All in all, this is a treasure of classic rock history.  There will always be nay-sayers, but consider the fact that, thirty years later, every single song on this album is still being played nationwide.  Boston was way ahead of its time, or any time, for that matter.  This work is timeless, ageless, and flawless.  If you don't own this album yet, you have no excuse.  Get out there and get it!  That is my final recommendation.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|People, honestly, who cares if Franz Ferdinand is today's best band or if this album is \\"funky\\" or not. This album is just good ol' fun music that's not at all watered down or lackluster. Just listen to this album and dance to it. Not every critical acclaimed album has to be a masterpiece.
B000002J2B|5.0|After the unexpected success of the first Phil Collins-era album, 1976's 'A Trick of the Tail,' the British progressive rock band Genesis knew they needed something of at least equal caliber in order to maintain the sudden increase in the size of their fan base.  Very rarely is it that a band will record and release two full-scale albums within the space of a year (fellow British progressive rock band Yes did it in 1972 with 'Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge,' and the American progressive rock band Kansas did it in 1975 with 'Song For America' and 'Masque').  There is good reason for this: Often times, the quality of the second release suffers both from the lack of time devoted to its composition and production, and from comparison to its predecessor (incidentally, this was true of Kansas, but not of Yes).  Fortunately, this is not the case with 'Wind & Wuthering,' which was released in the last week of 1976 in the United States and in the beginning of 1977 in Britain.  In some ways, 'Wind' is a more mature and well-developed musical statement than 'Trick.'    Let's explore that statement.  The most apparent difference between 'Trick' and 'Wind' is in the overall mood of the collective whole of each album.  'Trick' is eclectic musically, whereas 'Wind' is somewhat contiguous.  Specifically, 'Wind' has an autumnal or brumal cast, facilitated by the collective prowess of the band but most apparent in the treatment of keyboardist Tony Banks's Mellotron passages.  On 'Trick' the Mellotron had a more vibrant, unfiltered tone.  On 'Wind,' however, the Mellotron is bathed in reverberation and processed to silky smoothness; this lends a distant, more desolate tone to the majority of the album.  Also significant is the inclusion of icy, neutral male background vocals.  On 'Trick,' the Mellotron 8-Note Chorus was used for this effect.  On 'Wind' this chorus tape set is never used.  Instead, the background vocals (particularly prominent in the closing track) are used exclusively.    There are other differences, though.  Steve Hackett's contributions are much less noticeable on this album than on previous efforts.  Much of his playing is buried beneath Banks's synthesizers, and Hackett's normally integral songwriting offerings are more sparse.  Furthermore, the band outright rejected some of his submissions, which led in part to his exodus from Genesis after this album (they would be terribly crippled by this--it seems Hackett was even more important to the band than former frontman Peter Gabriel, who left before 'Trick').    Finally, and perhaps more importantly, the lyrics on 'Wind' are, on the whole, much darker and more mature than those of 'Trick.'  There is also a much greater degree of social commentary on this album, and some of it is more literal than the clever allegory and allusion found on 'Trick.'  Neither approach is necessarily better than the other; indeed, the difference heightens the value of both albums symbiotically.  Even so, it is worth mentioning that 'Wind' seems almost like a culmination of an artform and the sunset of an era.  And, in many ways, it was.  Apart from the quasi-progressive stylings of 'Duke' in 1980, 'Wind' was the last truly progressive album Genesis ever released.    The track listing, along with my comments:      1.  \\"Eleventh Earl Of Mar\\" - This is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The organization of an album is important--a band will try to place the most initially appealing figures first so that prospective listeners will be captivated right from the onset.  Genesis excels at this sort of thing, and they were no less successful with \\"Earl.\\"  An intriguing and worm-like synthesizer/organ theme repeats itself several times, with Hackett's guitar joining in for good measure.  The opening sequence moves toward a dramatic swell on the Mellotron strings, followed by a chord shift.  A hint of things to come appears first on the Hammond organ, and is confirmed when Collins enters with a brilliant drum fill.    The song consists of three distinct parts: The first includes the introduction and the main A and B sections, each of which is a unique and dynamic listening experience.  The second part is a soft, pensive moment that contrasts the first part beautifully.  The final part is a reprise of the first section, along with a conclusion (which harkens back to the introduction, expanding this theme and ending on the decay of a massive chord).    Lyrically, this song seems to tell the story of a child who loves his father despite the man's neglect of his son.  The father is called to fight in a bloody and impossible war, and while he is away, he thinks about his son and some very tender moments they had spent together.  At several intervals the son begs his father to promise that he will return alive from the battle.  Perhaps these instances are also memories.  Unfortunately, it is apparent that the father perishes in the battle, and the son's last cry to his father is unanswered, raw, and anguished.    2.  \\"One For The Vine\\" - This is a return to the Genesis epic format.  At exactly 10:00, this is one of the longest Genesis songs ever recorded in the Collins-era.  Musically, this one is very interesting--it begins softly with Hackett's guitar and Banks's piano.  The lyrics are performed in a very straightforward sort of manner, though the rhythm is often unusual.  On the choruses, the first ever instance of the heavily chorused, treble-heavy effect used with wild abandon on Collins's voice in the 1980s appears.  Perhaps this is to facilitate clarity, considering that Collins had at this point still not effectively mastered proper announciation.  Aside from all this, a standout feature of this selection is the highly energetic solo section in the middle, which seems to induce involuntary movement in all those who listen to it.  It seems almost impossible to control the impulse to just get up and move around when this section is playing; it's very uplifting and musically appealing.    Lyrically, this song is the first of the social commentaries, and it deals with the messiahdom expressed by organized religion.  The story is brilliant: A fellow who is part of a group who enter battle in the name of a divinity suddenly loses faith and leaves the charge.  He wanders into a mountain settlement, where he is instantly seen as \\"he the chosen one\\" by the natives.  The fellow at first accepts this treatment, until he realizes this is exactly that from which he fled.  At this moment, he leaves the settlement and comes upon a stream, where he can explore himself through introspective.  As he returns to the plateau, he notices another large group of soldiers.  He then glimpses one who leaves the group--he recognizes it as himself.  And so messiahdom is cyclical.    3.  \\"Your Own Special Way\\" - I'm sorry--this song is an embarrassment.  It is close to the worst thing to carry the Genesis name, I believe (though of course nothing is worse than \\"Whodunnit\\" from 1981's 'Abacab').  \\"Way\\" is a disgusting, sappy pop ballad.  What's more, it isn't a particularly good one, either.  And it certainly doesn't belong on a progressive rock masterpiece such as 'Wind & Wuthering.'  Finally (I really am giving this one a beating), though I would have to check the chronology to see which is the original source, this song sounds too much like \\"Endless Love\\" for there to have been a conincidence.  It's quite obvious that one or the other was derived from whichever of the two came first.    4.  \\"Wot Gorilla?\\" - This is an instrumental that has never been counted among Genesis's finest.  Aurally it seems to have a jungle cast, but this seems forced.  It certainly isn't a bad piece of music, but Genesis has done much better instrumentals (\\"Los Endos\\" and \\"Duke's Travels/Duke's End\\" come to mind, as well as the seventh and eighth tracks on 'Wind').    5.  \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" - This track reflects the tongue-in-cheek humor of 'Trick,' particularly \\"Robbery, Assault And Battery.\\"  Incidentally, \\"Mouse\\" and the latter song share the same track position on their respective albums.  However, \\"Mouse\\" presents its story in a much darker, serious fashion.  This, in part, contributes to the humor through irony.  Musically, this song flows nicely, following a song form similar to that of the first track on the album.  The song ends with a beautiful instrumental section that fades into oblivion in a stately, measured, understated manner.  Hackett's guitar finds some rare glory in this section.    Lyrically, this song tells the story of a mouse that finds itself in a house where it is suddenly discovered by the owners.  It escapes persecution, only to almost literally run into the cat.  Assured of itself, the cat taunts the mouse long enough for an object to fall upon the cat's head, thereby allowing the mouse to escape yet again.  The cat then comes up with a tall tale to excuse his failure to catch the mouse.  The words may or may not have hidden meaning; perhaps the humor is solely derived from the juxtaposition of such a silly, prosaic tale with the mood of the music to which it is set.    6.  \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" - This song is a dark, brooding masterpiece.  The Mellotron is used expertly to achieve just the proper effect, the synthesizers compliment the mood perfectly, and Hackett shines more brightly than at any other point in the album with an inspired, naked acousitc guitar solo at the beginning of the song.  Such delicacy, coupled with such unbridled power and drive, are heard in quantities approaching those on 'Wind' virtually nowhere else in the music world, and this is exemplified by this song.  The choruses are some of the most chilling, riveting moments on the album, and they, along with the remainder of the song, epitomize the aural character of the entire 'Wind & Wuthering' release.    Content-wise, this one is pretty straightforward.  This song deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the constant coverage offered by the media.  The song also hints at the impersonal aspect of this coverage and how it is proliferated in similar fashion all across the world.  Classic symbols like rain and blood are used to support a somber tone in this song, which is one of Genesis's finest achievements.    7.  \\"Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers...\\" - This is the first of two conjoined instrumentals on the album, both of which derive their names from the final sentence in the Emily Bronte novel 'Wuthering Heights' (incidentally, this is also the source for the name of the album).  This instrumental is very soft and pensive; it is also the shorter of the two.  The synthesizer program used for the melody is hauntingly gorgeous, almost like a cross between whistling and a beautiful soprano voice.  This track segues into the second instrumental in the sequence.    8.  \\"...In That Quiet Earth\\" - This is often cited as one of Genesis's finest instrumentals.  It is more animated than the previous track, is composed of several different sections, and is a keyboard workout for Tony Banks.  The synthesizers used here are varied and intricately-entwined.  There is a sense of movement about this work, a sense that it is not the end but a means to an end.  And, in that respect, such a sense proves correct.  This work segues into the final track on the album.    9.  \\"Afterglow\\" - There are many wonderful songs on 'Wind,' but there are some days when I consider \\"Afterglow\\" my favorite.  There is so much to be said in this song, and it accomplishes it with so small a footprint (4:12) as to intensify the already electric quality of the music.  The song moves along at a slow, stately, inevitable pace.  Phil Collins's vocal is delivered with a bastion of emotional output rarely matched by other vocalists.  The melody, a simple one, is soul-fulfilling.  It's a song to sing at the end of all things, when one's world has come crashing down around him.  And the ending sequence, with its myriad intricate layered vocals, is ethereal and breathtaking.  The impact of these icy sustained phrases, comprised entirely of the word \\"Ahh!\\", is simply unparalled.  It's the perfect ending to the album, the setting of the sun, the end of an era.      So, above all, this album is one of Genesis's finest.  There are occasional weak moments, but on the whole it is a masterpiece.  It is especially impactful when taken alongside 'A Trick of the Tail,' as these two albums compliment one another perfectly.  Each is what the other is not, and together they run the gamut of symphonic progressive rock.  I would recommend this album to fans of Genesis from all periods (both Gabriel-era and later Collins-era); it will require some acclimation, particularly for later Collins-era fans, but it is very much worth the time.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Renee Olstead was born to sing. <br /> <br />It is an interesting aspect of the role which \\"critics\\" play in the music industry that sometimes they appear to be more interested in writing for themselves than for us.  For whatever reasons, a critic may suggest that in order to be a \\"really good\\" singer, Renee Olstead (or, before her, Frank Sinatra) needs to be different than they actually are -- e.g., possess a better voice, with more range -- you know, like a Caruso.  But it ain't necessarily so. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most wonderful attribute a singer (or writer, or painter) can have is the ability to communicate effectively with the rest of us. <br /> <br />We really don't care who has the best voice.  We're interested in who sings the song in the way that most effectively stirs our musical souls.  <br /> <br />That's Renee Olstead.  From my perspective, she would win these national-level awards: <br /> <br />Best \\"signature\\" album by a \\"new\\" singer -- Renee Olstead. <br /> <br />Best single track by a new singer -- \\"Summertime\\" by Renee Olstead. <br /> <br />The singer we would most like to do another album -- Renee Olstead. <br /> <br />Whoever she is, some of us have never heard anybody sing the \\"classics\\" better (at this stage of their careers) than Renee Olstead.  Let's just hope she isn't ruined by the critics or the producers before her time, because she certainly appears to be on the right track now. <br /> <br />Good luck to Renee and hope to hear her sing again, just like this, some day soon.
B000002J27|5.0|The year was 1975, and fans of the British progressive rock band Genesis were in despair.  Why was this?  Their demigod, the illustrious Peter Gabriel, decided to retire from his post as lead singer of Genesis.  Apparently, he wanted to spend more time with his family.  The resulting void was a very difficult one to fill.  Hundreds flocked to the auditions, some dressed in outlandish costumes reminiscent of those Gabriel himself wore in concert, to vie for the job.  Unfortunately, a Gabriel-imitation was next to impossible to find, and those who showed up certainly didn't come up to scratch.  Defeated and in a pinch, the band selected drummer Phil Collins--an acquisition made in time for the 'Nursery Cryme' album in 1971--as a replacement.  Not inexperienced vocally, Collins actually sang lead on one song on 'Nursery Cryme' (\\"For Absent Friends\\"), and his voice was invaluable as backup during the Gabriel years.  Even so, there were those who were very skeptical about the concept of a Collins-led Genesis.  Many predicted that the band's tenure was expunged.  And, when it was announced that a new album was to be released, fans of Gabriel-era Genesis feared the worst and doubted that this album would be of any decent quality.    They were utterly and completely wrong.    'A Trick of the Tail' (1976) is one of the finest albums the band ever recorded.  Now that the band was freed from the attention-capitalizing Gabriel, it suddenly came to light that the real songwriting engine lay with the remaining members, particularly keyboardist Tony Banks and bassist Mike Rutherford.  On 'Trick' one can hear the band working together as a unit more than ever before.  In addition, their technique improved exponentially on this album.  Finally, the band steered itself away from the grand, sweeping epic form (expressed in \\"Supper's Ready\\" from 1972's 'Foxtrot' and on 1974's 'The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway') and instead composed shorter, more focused tracks.  The songs on 'Trick' makea return to Genesis's earlier style, where each work was a self-contained tale, almost like in a storybook.    What follows is the track list, along with my comments on each song.      1.  \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" - Right from the onset, one knows this is something special.  This track begins unassumingly enough, with a tenuous, chromatic pattern strummed by guitarist Steve Hackett.  Almost immediately a jarring, contra-rhythmic figure overlays this constant, ending the phrase with a powerful chord anchored with deep synthesizer bass.  This pattern repeats itself three times, each time descending one semitone.  Then, after some modulation and variation on the theme, the song launches into action with some thunderous drum filling by Collins.  A new theme appears, one that will become a pervasive motif.  Once this theme has asserted itself, the vocal begins, with yet another melody.  The coda is a frantic instrumental dance with a driving accelerando, ending on a soft passage, almost like an afterthought.     This song will sound somewhat strange to the new listener because it does not follow a steady, usual beat.  Some have compared the polyrhythm in this song to the effect of a compact disc skipping, and indeed one might at first gain that impression.  However, repeated listening makes this song irresistibly catchy (like everything on this album).  The lyrics tell a pretty straightforward tale about a man whose destiny is to climb a volcano and confront its spiritual extension into the physical world by dancing about the lava.  He is faced along the way with the bodies and banners of those who did not complete the journey.    Genesis produces very good music for interpretation because the lyrics are intelligent yet accessible.  And there are myriad messages derived from this particular song, the most obvious being that the volcano is symbolic of life as an uphill climb, the lava is symbolic of adversity, the bodies and banners strewn along the path are symbolic of those who have succumbed to the journey of life, and that the dancing is symbolic of meeting life's challenges.    Musically and content-wise, this is a brilliant piece of work.  But there's more.    2.  \\"Entangled\\" - This is often cited as one of Genesis's most hauntingly beautiful tracks.  Beginning with gentle 12-string musing, the song winds its way toward a heavenly chorus, replete with the breathtaking layered vocals of Phil Collins.  This chorus repeats itself twice, and then a dark, chilling solo section appears.  Played on the expansive and exquisite Mellotron 8 Voice Choir set, and awash with reverberation, this section pushes toward a climax that will give the prospective listener goosebumps.    Lyrically, I find this song deals with much more than what is apparent on the surface.  The one line gives it away, \\"Freudian slumber...\\"  Sigmund Freud, as every psychologist well knows, was obsessed with dream interpretation.  His theory was that the content of dreams indicates the deepest, most heartfelt desires of an individual.  From a scientific standpoint this is almost impossible to study objectively.  But the concept remains a romantic one (therefore one given to inclusion in poetry or song), and many believe very strongly that Freud was correct.  So this song, then, deals with psychologists experimenting with dream interpretation upon a client.  The patient is asked to allow the psychologists to probe deeper so that they may gain a greater understanding of their subject's mind.  The staff are instructed to leave the patient undisturbed, his thoughts become abstract, and he drifts off to sleep.  There are glimpses of flying and picturesque scenes, which seem to delight the psychologists.  Then, of course, comes the element of Gabriel-esque humor, when the client is shown the bill!  This song may be a cleverly-disguised commentary on the ethical misgivings of clinical psychologists charging the addled for therapy.    3.  \\"Squonk\\" - Here we have it: my namesake.  I have waited a long time for the opportunity to review this album, specifically so that I may have the joy of mentioning this one song.  Of the eight songs on this album, this one is by far the catchiest.  Its driving rock rhythm reminds superficially of the hit \\"Hold Your Head Up\\" by the forgotten Argent (incidentally, the album that contains the latter is currently out of print).  Musically, \\"Squonk\\" has a very nice, mid-tempo groove.  It gets stuck in one's head and does not quit playing itself, over and over.  It was the first song I liked from this album when I took a chance and bought 'Trick' without having heard a single track.    This song is more straightforward in its meaning than some of its album mates.  It relates, through verse and song, the myth of the squonk, which is a small, ugly creature that lives in the forests of Pennsylvania.  Because of its ugliness, it weeps constantly.  When confronted, it dissolves itself completely into tears.  Hunters can follow it easily on moonlit evenings because of the silvery, tear-stained trail it leaves behind.  Once a hunter thought that he had captured a squonk, but when he \\"...opened up the sack, all that [he] had [was] a pool of bubbles and tears...\\"  The band might have had some hidden meaning for relating this tale, but more likely than not they just thought it would make a good subject for a song.  And it does.  \\"Squonk\\" is among my favorite Genesis songs.    4.  \\"Mad Man Moon\\" - If \\"Squonk\\" was among my favorite Genesis songs, then \\"Mad Man Moon\\" IS my favorite Genesis song.  It is one of the most grossly underrated masterpieces ever recorded by any group, anywhere.  The most recognition I have ever read for this song was several reviewers' statements that \\"Moon\\" is, to quote the one reviewer, \\"A Tony Banks composition.\\"    Musically, this song is breathtakingly beautiful.  It begins with a soft, delicate theme which makes one think of a music box.  The instrumentation in this song is predominantly piano and Mellotron strings, with synthesized flute and brass appearing in the instrumental break in the middle of the song.  Collins gives what I consider his finest vocal performance in this song.  His emotional output is effusive, and his tone drips with melancholy.  And yet, he doesn't over-milk the expression, as Gabriel undoubtedly would have.  Collins sounds as though he were truly moved by what he was singing.  The chorus is absolutely breathtaking and chilling; few musical moments achieve the impact of this chorus.  Then comes a highly-animated instrumental section, where Banks demonstrates his prowess on keyboards.  Interrupted by a frenzied break where Collins plays the role of the Sandman, the song returns to the melody from the first half, repeats the chorus once more, then ends on tones of somberness and desolation.    I believe this song's lack of popularity stems from the fact that it is misunderstood lyrically.  Most people look at the surface and gather from it the typical, \\"the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence\\" theme, along with the \\"you never know what you have until it's gone\\" message thrown in for good measure.  Indeed, on the surface these things are apparent, but they don't account for the symbolism in this song, nor the melancholic mood of the music.  You see, the oft-covered \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\" has a very similar message to the common interpretation of \\"Mad Man Moon.\\"  And yet, \\"Taxi\\" is a pop monstrosity with not a hint of pensiveness or sadness.    Obviously there is more to \\"Moon\\" than what meets the eye (or ear, as it were).    My interpretation is perhaps a stretch, but not only does it appeal to me greatly, it also assigns this song a depth of meaning that legitimizes the beautiful, tear-jerking quality of the music.  This song is about a near-death experience.  The narrator is at the edge of his life and in the company of a loved one (it is not clear whom).  The recurring motif of opposite perspectives in conjunctionin each phrase (\\"Was it summer when the river ran dry/or was it just another dam\\"; \\"When the evil of a snowflake in June/could still be a source of relief\\" etc.) reflects the narrator's vacillation between clinging to life and succumbing to death.  The \\"final crest\\" is glaringly symbolic of death.  The narrator's illusions of flight are derived from an age-old belief that spirits lift from their bodies when people expire.  The \\"deserts of sand\\" are the afterlife, bare and uninviting (perhaps a jab at organized religion's promises of splendor or hellfire, depending upon the nature of the individual in life, awaiting the newly deceased).  The narrator flies too close to the desert and is mired there.  He sees mirages, which entice him to land, only to discover that the landscape is entirely sand.  ONLY THEN does he realize what he had in life, but now it is too late for him.  Salvation--\\"a fall of rain\\"--seems to him now but a dream, \\"a dream of Mad Man Moon.\\"    The visit from the Sandman inspires the narrator to fight his way out of the \\"gaol\\" (a British variant of the word \\"jail\\") of sand and to return to life, which is cast in sharp relief as \\"a muddy pitch in Newcastle, where it rains so much you can't wait for a touch of sun and sand.\\"  The narrator comes to fully realize the desolation of this afterlife when he is presented with an image of himself as one among many shadowless figures in a rainless valley, who must \\"learn to disbelieve the sea,\\" where the \\"sea\\" is \\"life.\\"  One can reasonably gather that he decides, after singing the chorus once more, that he wishes to live after all.  Though his return to life is not chronicled, it is simply assumed--the support comes from the repetition of the instrumental themes with which the song began, thereby indicating a reversal or completion.    5.  \\"Robbery, Assault And Battery\\" - Despite my inital impression, this song grew on me.  I thought it was terrible at first, but the jaunty rhythm eventually captivated.  It's almost a sing-along, complete with Collins's patented attempt to imitate Gabriel's character voices (as heard most prominently in \\"Supper's Ready\\").  Musically this is a showcase for every member of the band, and the musical aspect of this song makes up for the sort of silly, tongue-in-cheek lyrics.  This song was an attempt at Gabriel-esque humor.  It has been received with mixed emotions.  Lyrically this song is pretty lightweight: It contains the typical message that the spirit of crime is a metaphysical apparition that can never be contained by capturing and killing individual criminals.  Even so, \\"Robbery\\" is a very innovative and creative vehicle for that message.  The instrumental solos, particularly Banks's keyboard escapades, make this track worth many a listen.    6.  \\"Ripples\\" - Many consider this one of Collins-era Genesis's most enduring dark masterpieces.  Hackett really comes into his own here with some truly marvelous acoustic guitar.  Musically, this song is the darkest on the album--while \\"Mad Man Moon\\" is also melancholic in mood, its is a transient pensiveness devoted to a single, impermanent experience.  \\"Ripples,\\" on the other hand, conveys an air of depressing inevitability.  And so it is when we consider the incontrovertable fact that we all will age, our looks will fade with time, and we will be left only with ourselves.  We are all equals in old age.  That is the main gist of this song.    This work's most enduring melodic feature is the peerless central solo section, dominated by Banks's piano accompaniment and a melody played on a unique, gorgeous synthesizer tone.    7.  \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" - This is the title track of the album, and as title tracks go, this one's not bad.  It's certainly not on par with some of the more profound works on the album, yet it's certainly better than anything you will hear on the radio today.  It's short, as progressive rock songs go, clocking in at 4:34.  And it's pretty standard insofar as song form: Three or four repetitions of the chorus (the B section), with the A section always preceding each repetition (except in the middle of the song, where the chorus follows the C section).  Musically, it's very catchy in a sing-along type of way.  Its lyrics invoke some of the same tongue-in-cheek humor of \\"Robbery, Assault And Battery.\\"  There are several different interpretations, including the classic theme of society not accepting what it doesn't want to see and not seeing what it doesn't want to accept.    8.  \\"Los Endos\\" - This is the closing track and, except for the ending, it is entirely instrumental.  \\"Los Endos\\" recalls several different motifs from songs on the album, including one cut, entitled \\"It's Yourself,\\" which didn't make it into the lineup.  The song is heavily influenced by fusion, which makes for a highly-energetic and intense listening experience.  Then, out of the blue, the beginning sequence from \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" begins, dissolving into some empyreal Mellotron chorus chords, and then the song launches into a reprise of the \\"Squonk\\" principle theme.  It is at this point that Collins sings, overlaying the instrumentation with the two lines, \\"There's an angel standing in the sun/freed to get back home.\\"  These are lifted from \\"Supper's Ready\\" and are sung with the same melody as when they appear in the original work; the \\"Squonk\\" theme actually supports them perfectly.  The piece ends on a fadeout.  \\"Los Endos\\" is a supremely powerful ending to a remarkable album.      All in all, this is one of my favorite albums in all of music, performed by one of my five favorite bands (the others being Yes, Jethro Tull, Kansas, and The Who).  It is also one of my three favorite Genesis albums from the Collins-era (the others being 1977's 'Wind & Wuthering' and 1980's 'Duke').  'A Trick of the Tail' is where I made my true entry into the world of prog, and I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to discover just what defines symphonic progressive rock.  Forget the later years of Genesis; while I do listen to these albums, I consider them the product of a band that has changed its genre designation completely.  I do not associate or directly compare the two incarnations of the band.  The last truly progressive effort by the band was 'Duke' (which is a fine album--see my glowing review for more details).  Even so, we still have the legacy of the great trilogy of Collins-era albums: 'Trick,' 'Wind,' and 'Duke.'  The fertile period of creativity that spawned progressive rock was extinguished by the collective media conglomerate by 1980, but the spirit lives on, pervading the hearts and souls of all us true fans of the genre.    I for one will never surrender my passion, and I will never stop listening to masterpieces like 'A Trick of the Tail.'
B000HEWEJO|4.0|Buyers beware....This supposedly \\"new\\" 60th Anniversary Edition of \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is THE EXACT SAME DISC AS THE PREVIOUSLY RELEASED VERSION FROM REPUBLIC PICTURES / ARTISAN!!!! The only differencne is that the new version is from the Scrooges at Paramount DVD and they've added new cover art (whoop-de-doo).  <br /> <br />In addition, the \\"new\\" disc has the same bonus features and the same B&W transfer as the older edition. Paramount desperately needs to GIVE THIS FILM A REAL SPECIAL EDITON and stop suckering consumers into buying a product they already own!!!!! <br /> <br />By the way, there is NO COLORIZED VERSION on the 60th Anniversary DVD or the older release. Amazon has mistakenly listed this title as \\"color\\" and misled several reviewers to say that there actually was a colorized print on the disc. THIS IS WRONG!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Open Door answers all those looming questions about Ben Moody's departure. The answer: Amy Lee was and is the driving force behind Evanescence. A solidly written and performed album. It is what we got from Fallen but harder and has more edge. There are so many layers to each song that you will listen over and over and hear something new each time. Overall a great combination of lyrics, music, and musicianship.<br /><br />I also love that Amy got her sisters involved doing background vocals on Call Me When Your Sober.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|Well, this new album goes to show that Ben Moody was the lifeblood of Evenescence.  Moody provided the melodies, and Amy Lee wrote the lyrics and sang with excellence.  Not so anymore.  No Moody, no more magic.<br /><br />This album is a messy collection of dull, non-melodic songs, that fail to capture my interest in any way, shape, or form.  The debut album was captivating--this is mundane.  Lee's lyrics are just as good as ever, but the music is lacking something fierce.  The band couldn't fill the void that Moody's absence left, unfortunately.<br /><br />I have been looking forward to this album for years, and I'm extremely disappointed to say that it does VERY little for me.  Great single, \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\", but other than that, the album doesn't have all that much to offer.  For whatever reason, the band was able to scrap together a melodic hit song, but placed it on an album full of songs that go nowhere.  I'm greatly disappointed I have to write such a review, but this is the truth about the album.  Nevermind what you read on here from hyped up fans, who would like their music even if it was the worst it could possibly be.  The truth is here, folks.  This album is shaky, at best.
B000F4PD7G|5.0|Starring Gerard Butler, Stellan Skarsgard, Sarah Polley, Ingvar Sigurdsson, and a superb cast of supporting actors, Beowulf & Grendel is an imaginative and engaging recasting of the ancient Norse legend of a mighty Geat warrior who fought against a monster and his mother who were slaying Danish men. This mythical medieval adventure brings to the story a new dimension casting Grendel as a troll with a backstory that provides an unexpectedly sympathetic perspective to his condition and his quest for vengeance. The plot twists and revelations, the accurate historical details of costume and set designs, the spectacular scenery, the incredible suspense and impressive battle sequences, and the intertwining themes of loyalty, honor, and vengeance on the part of both sides in the conflict, make Beowulf & Grendel a very strong and entertaining contribution to personal and community library DVD movie collections. The DVD format also allows a number of bonus features including a director's commentary, deleted scenes, cast interviews, costume sketches, and the featurette: \\"Wrath of Gods\\".
0884271536|4.0|Eli Goldratt is one of the most respected experts in the field of Project Management. His work on the Theory of Constraints provides project managers with some very useful tools for keeping projects focused, on budget, and on target. I have definitely benefitted from Goldratt's insights into these topics.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this work of fiction, with three largely separate story lines, makes for an awkward read. The 246 page novel has about half of its page count spent on two stories that add little to the main message of the book. The ongoing storylines about fixing the business school's executive MBA program and the main character's relationship with his wife Judith have nothing to do with project management. Fortunately, these two superfluous stories are at the end or beginning of each chapter and it is easy to skip over them and get to the useful subject material in the main story line, the running of projects and their problems. Skipping over about 100 pages of the book makes me question the value of paying for a book that could have easily been less than half as long. I might be OK with that if the stories were interesting or well written, but they are not.  <br /> <br />Using the book as a reference would be challenging. It has no Table of Contents, no Index, nor a Glossary. The Chapters do not even have titles, or a summary of the key concepts at the end in most cases. I would struggle to find an important concept if I went back to the book more than a week or so after reading it. <br /> <br />A much slimmer, edited version of this book, with just the TOC and project management material, laid out end to end would be an instant must have, and a valuable learning tool.

0743246616|5.0|I purchased this book based on a long-held love of Magnolia cupcakes.  A friend took me there one lovely midnight several years ago and I was hooked.  Being from Arkansas, no one understood my fascination until the pop culture references started accumulating and everyone wanted a piece of the Magnolia pie.<br /><br />I did not purchase the first cookbook based on the criticisms of several disappointed Magnolia fans/friends.  But, on a whim I purchased the second book.  The cupcakes, of course, are fabulous.  But it was the other desserts that ended up really wowing me.  Torey is very creative, but not in such a heavy-handed way.  All the recipes are classic with easy to find ingredients and simple preparation techniques.<br /><br />So far I've made:<br /><br />*Raspberry Cream Cheese Breakfast Buns  (beyond words, fabulous)<br /><br />*Pumpkin Walnut Cookies with Brown Butter Frosting (great for the fall, produced a very cakey, moist cookie--unique)<br /><br />*Apricot Cream Cheese Struesel Bars (very good, but my least favorite so far)<br /><br />*Brownies w/Caramel & Peanut Butter  (Thumbs way up.  My friends were on the floor after one bite.  \\"Best ever.\\")<br /><br />*Apple Tart w/Hazelnut Brown Sugar Crumble (Similar to a traditional Apple Crisp, but with an amazing crust and the hazelnuts provide great texture)<br /><br />*Pumpkin Cheesecake with Gingersnap Pecan Crust (So simple to make and a lovely combination of tastes)<br /><br />*Peaches and Cream Pie with Sugar cookie crust (just as amazing as it sounds.  The cookie crust could stand for a little improvement, but the filling was amazing.)<br /><br />*Red Velvet Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting (One of the best I've ever made)<br /><br />I agree with previous reviewers that more photos would have been nice, but the delicious sweets more than make up for this single missing ingredient.
B000002UAR|3.0|I've no designs on being iconoclastic or a hater or anything like that, so before you read on, please understand that. I fully understand that Beatles fans can be a fanatically loyal bunch who back up their beliefs with scores of critical support from the \\"experts\\" who have annointed the Beatles as kings of rock and roll music and innovators of all sorts of styles, production values, and other musical milestones. One reviewer even had the audacity to say that this album was \\"unquestionably\\" one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century. Well, I certainly question it. Am I able to say that \\"Road to Ruin\\" by The Ramones is unquestionably one of the greatest works of art of the 20th century as well? Why not? It's all subjective no matter how much one wants to convey their expertise. This album is good but there are dozens I'd rather hear instead and that criterion alone is the sole one I use to rate albums. As with so much of the Beatles, a bit less of the excessive banner waving and veneration would be a nice change.<br /><br />For the record, the Beatles wouldn't place in my top ten favorite musical acts of all time, but that's just the point of my review.<br /><br />So then, Revolver. I don't mind it and I think the three stars is a fair rating since half stars aren't possible. Too much psychedelia, the moronic cartoon throwaway of Yellow Submarine, and the dated sound are all negatives. On the plus side, of the fourteen songs, eight are good to great, four are fair, and two are throwaways.<br /><br />The Good: I'm Only Sleeping is a good song and the backward solo is certainly novel. For No One and Here, There, and Everywhere are good songs indeed in the McCartney mold, with the latter being so sweet I think I should get a check-up for cavities. Eleanor Rigby is the gem of this release for me. This is McCartney at his best, and Paul is the Beatle I'd rather listen to over the others. Taxman is a great song, second only to Eleanor Rigby. Rocking, riffy, and with a bitchin' haywire solo, this one is a highlight. Good Day Sunshine is classic Beatles; the harmonies, the peppy turn of the century melody, and that golly gee-ness of so many Beatles songs, and yet I still like it. Doctor Robert, And Your Bird Can Sing, and Got To Get You Into My Life are all very good songs as well, especially the last two.<br /><br />The Fair: Love You To, with its harsh lyrics, is full of the Indian sitar sounds of the age. It is interesting if not altogether toe tapping. I Want To Tell You is okay but nothing remarkable, She Said She Said has the chimey sound of their earlier work mixed with some of their trippy guitar work.<br /><br />The Ugly: Yellow Submarine is just too silly. This is one of the problems I have with the Beatles (the other being the psychedelic sound). I just don't get the need to put ridiculous songs like this on albums. Amazingly, even with this Peter, Paul, and Mary tripe, people still say the album is the greatest of all time. How can that jibe? I just don't get it. Yeah, they have a sense of humor. Great. Save it for the outtakes. Tomorrow Never Knows? How is it that this is so frequently mentioned as the favorite song on the album? It is the most painful for me. Granted, I truly can't stand psychedelic music, and, if one reviewer claims, the Beatles, and this song in particular, are responsible for that wretched sub-genre, then that's a knock against them and not a feather in their cap. I can take Pink Floyd, some of the Beck-y Yardbirds stuff, and \\"Third Stone From The Sun\\" by Hendrix, but beyond that, take that psychedelic stuff and bury it in the ground beside the tie-dyes and hippie beads or save it for your next thematic get-together. Seriously, give me disco or the synth-pop of the 80s over psychedelic crap any day. Talk about dated music...ugh. No redeeming qualities at all for me.<br /><br />Lastly, I'm curious why there seems to be the need to bolster your review's credibility by citing music rags and their Top 100 lists. Either you're a mob follower feeling protected by the reputation of these rags or you're uncertain of your own beliefs and need the support of the so-called \\"experts.\\" However, let's put at least Rolling Stone magazine in perspective; they recently claimed that \\"Presence\\" was the best Led Zeppelin album.<br /><br />Spare me the heresy bit and the condescension of \\"You're entitled to your opinion even though you're wrong.\\" I'm just being honest to my own taste aka my definition of art.u're a mob follower feeling protected by the reputation of these rags or you're uncertain of your own beliefs and need the support of the so-called \\"experts.\\" However, let's put at least Rolling Stone magazine in perspective; they recently claimed that \\"Presence\\" was the best Led Zeppelin album.  <br />Spare me the heresy bit and the condescension of \\"You're entitled to your opinion even though you're wrong.\\" I'm just being honest to my own taste aka my definition of art.  <br />                                                            <br />
B00003CX97|4.0|Fifty years ago, theater-goers tolerated more talkiness and less action in their war epics than they would today. \\"Bridge\\" is as famous for its music as it is for its story. While the acting is uniformly fine, the script definitely could have been tightened. That said, this depiction of allied POW's being forced to build a bridge for the Japanese in World War II has powerful and suspenseful moments which make it a success. In this era of prisoner mistreatment in Iraq, \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\" reminds us that in World War II, torture and mis-use even of uniformed POW's was common, especially by the Japanese, whose code of honor labeled soldiers who allowed themselves to be captured alive as beneath contempt, no matter what the mores of their own cultures.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I first heard \\"Evanescence\\" when I saw \\"Dardevil\\" in the theater...before the \\"Bring me to Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\" actually had hit it big.  I looked into who the band was and bought \\"Fallen\\" and have been hooked ever since....\\"Anywhere But Home\\" was a great album to have w/the DVD and 5-star \\"Thoughtless\\" cover; needless to say, I was extremely excited by the release of this album. <br /> <br />Amy definitely still carries her own and is what listeners pay attention to...however, I am afraid I do have to admit, that with the departure of Moody, the music has lost some awesome guitar hooks that made \\"Fallen\\" so great.  With \\"Fallen\\" nearly all the songs were perfect, and those that were \\"just ok\\" were still worth a listen, because you could find some kind of cool guitar riff or arrangement style that made the song standout from the others. <br /> <br />With this album there are still some cool arrangements, with music kicking in after Amy sings and plays a lighter part, or things just stop and are stripped down to a beat and vocals.....but I honestly cannot think of a guitar riff clearly in my head from this album...where with \\"Fallen\\" there are many licks that people would be humming for months. <br /> <br />There are many solid songs on here, but they tend to sound the same after a while and just kind of wander about within themselves....as you listen you wonder if they are going to go anywhere, and at times they do....but the dynamic of the arrangement we're used to hearing is not nearly as strong as before. <br /> <br />Casual fans of the band should get the first album and wait out on this until you hear more singles.... <br /> <br />Fans of the band will most definitely enjoy this album, and while my review seems negative, I do like the album a great deal....but it's more \\"atmosphere music\\" that you'd have playing straight-through rather than an album you can pull a bunch of singles from because each are unique and stand on their own.
B0009X766Y|5.0|Newman, Redford, Robert Shaw as the bad guy, twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so...how can anyone not like \\"The Sting\\"? When I saw it on the big screen upon its first release, I did not think it deserved the Oscar as best film of its year, although I enjoyed it. Now, decades later, and after having seen it perhaps 20 times, at least in pieces, I think it one of the best achievements in movie-making in its century. It has STYLE, and a consistent sensibility, and logic, and on first viewing, it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top. I can't imagine that anyone over 30 hasn't seen it yet, but if that's you, fix it as soon as possible. It is a primer in how to write, direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience. Newman's drunken card-player on the train with Shaw is absolutely classic.
B000HIVQK8|4.0|First the important question does this remaster/reissue improve on the previous version released nearly a decade ago? Yes. The sound is fuller with slightly better detail. It is remastered a bit louder as well but the most important improvement is the inclusion of the B-sides \\"Deep Blue\\" and \\"Miss O'Dell\\" The former song was the B-side to \\"Bangela Desh\\" written about George's loss of his father and the latter is a lark with a Dylanesque quality to the music. The lyrics go from serious to humourous with George cracking up during the chorus.<br /><br />As to the DVD well it's nice to have the two bonus tracks (with \\"Give Me Love\\" in 5.1) as well as the video footage. I suspect that many fans will not watch the videos more than once (although the live footage was nice). I'd like to see the full live show for \\"Live in Japan\\" get a DVD release separate from the re-releases/remasters of his back catalog. I don't feel that the CD/DVD set is essential but fans who pay for it will enjoy the second disc I was just hoping for more live footage/outtakes/demos or even the other mix of the album.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed that George's rehearsal for \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" with George on lead vocals (he co-wrote the song with Ringo even though he wasn't credited as such until recently)isn't included as he provides a spirited version of the song (this has also been available on bootlegs for years. My suspicion is that if it is eventually released it will find its way onto \\"Dark Horse\\" although it really belongs here).Finally it's a pity that the single version of \\"Bangela Desh\\" wasn't included as well.<br /><br />The booklet included has some nice rare photos from the inside cover shoot which feature George along with musicians that appeared on the album. We also get a brief essay discussing the recording of the album and the secular world's reaction to one that focuses so much on spiritual issues. Although it isn't George's finest album (\\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Cloud 9\\" and \\"Brain Washed\\" are my favorites ahead of this one)it has two songs that rank high up there in the Beatles/Harrison canon; \\"Give Me Love\\" and the bluesy \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" a witty take on The Beatles legal square dance.<br /><br />All things being equal in the material world, I'd suggest going for the CD version vs. the 2 disc set unless you absolutely MUST have the two additional tracks on the second disc and the videos. Are they worth it for hardcore Harrison/Beatles fans? Sure but you could get by just as easily with the CD edition and I don't know that the price for the second set is justified given how thin the pickings are on the second disc.my favorites ahead of this one)it has two songs that rank high up there in the Beatles/Harrison canon; \\"Give Me Love\\" and the bluesy \\"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\\" a witty take on The Beatles legal square dance.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|This CD reminds me more of the independent releases before the band hit it big than of Fallen.  I love almost every song (and even the ones I am not a genuine fan of yet are growing on me the more I listen to them) but it might be too dark, brooding, harsh, or confrontational for some.  I honestly don't see many of these songs being played on heavy rotation on the local pop station...which is a plus for me but might not be for others.
B000HCO840|2.0|Just bad overall. Character storyline, flow of movie, horribly finished! Sorry, the first two were well done, this on just does't do the others any justice. Hated It!
B000FTWB7G|4.0|This is the review I had hoped I would never write, and am most reluctant to write.  And, I very much hope my opinion will change upon repeated listenings, but my first impression of \\"The Open Door\\" is disappointed. <br /> <br />To be fair to you dear reader, I'm not the typical fan.  While I have been listening to rock music since I first heard \\"Meet the Beatles\\" in 1964, my heart and soul is in classical music.  Rarely have I found a rock group that I truly loved.  An exception was Gentle Giant back in the 70's.  I was a huge fan.  Evanescence was the second. <br /> <br />\\"Fallen\\" hit me light a bolt of lightning.  I stumbled upon it totally by accident by way of the \\"Bring Me to Life\\" video, which I found fantastic.  But, having been burned by so many albums with one good cut only, I sampled all the cuts on \\"Fallen\\", and found them all very good.  I rushed out to get the CD, and found myself shedding many tears over multiple repeated listenings.  I have never found any music so overwhelmingly powerful outside of classical music. <br /> <br />What Fallen (and much of the pre-Fallen material, too) seemed to do is combine darkness and beauty seamlessly.  Many of the ideas that make for great classical music (and great movie soundtracks, too) seem to influence the ideas in \\"Fallen's\\" songs. <br /> <br />But, I digress.  This isn't meant to be a review of \\"Fallen\\". <br /> <br />I was hopeful for \\"The Open Door\\".  Most others had been saying that \\"Call Me When You are Sober\\" is the weakest track on the CD.  Since I have grown to like that song quite a bit, I thought to myself if that's worst cut on the album this is going to be one fantastic CD. <br /> <br />In addition to buying the CD, I also bought it on iTunes for the interview, and \\"The Last Song I'm Wasting On You\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Last Song I'm Wasting On You\\" moved me to tears.  Like the cut \\"Breathe No More\\", it's a wonderful Amy Lee & piano only song. <br /> <br />I thought if a great song like that was cutfrom \\"The Open Door\\", this is going to be one fantastic CD. <br /> <br />Well, I'm truly sad to report, that upon first hearing the entire CD last night, I'm disappointed.  There is not a single cut on this release that immediately blew me away, unlike the amazing \\"Bring Me To Life\\" or \\"My Immortal\\" cuts from Fallen. <br /> <br />To my ear this is a much more a modern, alternative rock release, than Fallen was.  I don't particularly care for the direction that rock has taken over the years.  I saw \\"Fallen\\" as a huge breath of fresh air for the genre.  I see this release as a step back, or a step forward in the wrong direction. <br /> <br />Cuts 4, 8, and 13 are written by Amy Lee only.  They are probably the best of the group.  Track 12 was written with John LeCompt, and is okay.  The rest of the songs are written with Terry Balsamo, and here I think lies the problem for me.  Amy Lee + Ben Moody = great music.  Amy Lee + Terry Balsamo = ?!.   <br /> <br />I write \\"?!\\" because I'm going to need to give this some more time to digest.  Maybe I will grow to love this new sound with time.  I hope so.  But, to conclude, my honest reaction is I'm disappointed.   <br /> <br />And, if you want to hear a great synthesis of Mozart's Requiem and rock, download, if you can find it, Evanescence's \\"Anything For You\\", which I find far better than \\"Lacrimosa\\". <br /> <br />I'm not sorry I bought this release though.  This *is* something I needed to buy and hear.  IMO, Fallen remains one of the greatest, if not the greatest rock CD of all time, and Amy Lee unquestionably had a great deal to do with that.  I am now compelled to follow her career.  She's a remarkable talent, and I look forward to what she does next.  I'm hoping it will be a solo release, and/or acoustic only.  I'm frankly burned out on this highly harsh, heavy produced rock sound.  Maybe old age is finally taking its toll. -smile-  <br /> <br />I expect this release will generate a diverse response.  That's okay.  I intend to listen to it again soon.  If my opinion changes, I'll edit this posting, and make it clear that I have done so. <br />
0618680004|5.0|All this usually boils down to cause. If you have been so unfortunate to be imprinted with the idea that some deity governs the way the world works and subsequently interferes with everything else, there is little hope for your little pink dogmatist mind. If on the other hand, you have a unadorned idea of life and are willing to accept that stuff happens according to natural laws or it just happens, there may be hope for you. I recommend two things that so called liberal artists do not include in their curriculum: statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. There I said it! One will tell you that reality exists as a probability, the other that there is no free lunch. Dawkins has the problem of being a descriptive biologist, a person who explains things by giving them a name. But, read this book. When you ascend to a higher and perhaps celestial plane, take up J.

B000002O3I|5.0|My friends, this is the real deal, it just doesn't get any better than this. This is Howlin' Wolf at his gritty, slashin', terrifyin' best, and just about nothing matches the greatness and intensity of the Wolf at his best. Nearly every track is a classic and all of them are superb. \\"Red Rooster\\" \\"Wang Dang Doodle\\" \\"Spoonful\\" \\"Back Door Man\\" \\"Evil\\" \\"I Asked For Water...\\" are among the most well known clasics in the entire genre, but every track is top notch. His voice was truly original (even tho Capt. Beefheart managed to imitate it uncannily well) and likely shocked the pants off the first to hear him. This is such down and dirty, greasy, slicin' blues that it's impossible to think of it as being as \\"old\\" as it is. The Wolf was so far ahead of his time that time still hasn't caught up. Though he's had many admirers among rock stars, such as the Stones, he's really never quite received the fame and recognition that he deserves for having been such a genius. THe musicians are wonderful, Hubert Sumlin may be the nastiest blues guitarist ever to grace a track, but it is the monumental, legendary, godlike Wolf who stands out the most.
B000G73UEU|4.0|Leonard Cohen may well be one of the most celebrated songwriters we have these days, but he sure isn't one of the most prolific. Since 1990, he's released only three albums of new material, so it is only natural (and fitting) that his fans hang on every word. Words are Cohen's currency, but within his relatively small catalog, he tends to be tightfisted, making every syllable count - sort of an `inverse-Dylan, if you will. He's an acquired taste, so a lot of potential fans miss out on him. He has also attracted a significant following among the folk artist cognoscenti, and there have already been a few albums and collaborations dedicated to Cohen's work, but none have been quite as fulfilling as \\"Leonard Cohen -I'm Your Man.\\" The CD features excerpts from a film of the same name, which itself was a spin-off of a Hal Willner project entitled \\"Came So Far for Beauty: An Evening of Leonard Cohen Songs\\" (you may remember Willner as the compiler of other `tribute' projects containing songs for Disney animation, Charles Mingus, and Thelonius Monk, among others).<br /><br />\\"Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man\\" may be Willner's most successful project to date, mostly because he lets the music speak entirely for itself. Rather than juxtapose various artists against one another and allowing them to reinterpret the music, this project allows each individual artist to perform Cohen's songs, usually in a manner that is deeply respectful of the original recordings. The sum effect is truly beautiful. The Wainwrights - Martha and Rufus - lead the pack with devastatingly gorgeous renditions of \\"Tower of Song\\" and \\"Chelsea Hotel No. 2,\\" respectively. Each of their interpretations is respectful and yet incredibly personal and heartfelt, to a point where it becomes literally palpable. They each repeat this trick again later in the disk, with definitive versions of \\"Everybody Knows\\" and \\"The Traitor,\\" adding emotional nuance to songs that already were jam-packed with not-so-subtle innuendo. Nick Cave is also a brilliant interpreter here - his version of \\"I'm Your Man\\" has the unfortunate side effect of displaying how is own material is sometimes lacking when compared to the wit and grace of Cohen's song. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this collection is how nobody fails; Jarvis Cocker sounds like a virtual carbon of Cohen himself, while Beth Orton and Teddy Thompson each render performances that surpass the occasional mediocrity of their own solo work.  If you are unfamiliar with the man, \\"Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man\\" is good enough to serve as a satisfying introduction to the work of Leonard Cohen, especially since Cohen himself appears in tandem with U2, performing an alternate (and extraordinarily effective) version of \\"Tower of Song.\\" If you respect the art of songwriting, then you owe it to yourself to hear \\"Leonard Cohen: I'm Your Man.\\"  A  Tom Ryanve is also a brilliant interpreter here - his version of \\"I'm Your Man\\" has the unfortunate side effect of displaying how is own material is sometimes lacking when compared to the wit and grace of Cohen's song.

B000FS9FCG|5.0|Some people just don't seem to get it.<br /><br />I know we are in the middle of \\"The War on Terror\\" but some people seem to interpret everything in our culture as either Pro-Government or Anti-Government.  The same polarizing statement can be made about homosexuality.  Something is either completely Pro or completely Anti.  If someone does a documentary about the Holocaust and mentions Homosexuals were also targeted does that make them 100% Pro Homosexual?  Some reviewing this movie would have you think so.<br /><br />I believe why this movie arouses such hate in some is because it is a little too close to the mark.  You can both support your government while at the same time not trusting it with unlimited power.  This movie is about a society that has signed over all its freedoms to a totalitarian regime for the promise of security.  Somebody posted that this could never happen to an advanced Socialist nation stating they never regress.  I say the opposite.  As any society begins to put more and more dependency on the government for their lives and well being they are only more willing to hand over more freedoms in exchange for additional perceived security.  I see a heavily Socialist society as more likely to cross over the brink into a totalitarian regime than many others.  America would be less likely to easily fall into this because of the basic structure of its Constitution but given enough of a push anything could happen.<br /><br />The push in V is war, terrorism and plague resulting in a population filled with blind fear.  Perhaps because we already have war and terrorism in abundance with plague a constant threat in the media some people are a little touchy on the issue.  The movie is from a now insular English perspective.  It is not surprising plenty of fault is thrown onto the US.  That does not make it justified; it is merely a way of pointing the finger outwardly.  I would not take it any further than that.  Basically what happens is terrorism becomes very extreme to the point that people begin voting out of fear.  This causes a small hate mongering party to gather some power and is entirely plausible.  That party point the finger of blame at foreigners, Muslims, homosexuals, and any \\"deviants\\" who express doubt with regards to the measures this party believes are needed for safety.  The whole time the party plays to base of terrified English citizens who are in the majority.  It is always easy to get frightened people to point the finger at anyone different.  The leaders of this party are also somewhat religiously fundamentalist in their outlook, leading them to condemn all they consider immoral.  This is easy enough to do once they have the power.<br /><br />This party does not have absolute power yet though.  While developing a biological weapon and antidote those party members involved in the program decide it would serve the greater good, and preserve England, to sacrifice a few.  The idea is the vast majority will see the real need for security and make the decisions that need to be made (i.e. put the new party in charge.).  The virus is unleashed on domestic targets with the goal of creating the most fear.  It works and the party of hate is swept into power promising strict measures to insure security.  Soon after the \\"cure\\" is discovered, thanks in part to the party now in power.<br /><br />The main character blames the people for what they put in power and urges them to throw it off, while at the same time carrying on his personal vendetta against those who imprisoned and tortured him.<br /><br />The movie makes a good point that you should never blindly trust your government.  Those who think that the point of the movie is somehow \\"subversive\\" and call it terrorist propaganda do not see the irony in their position...  That should worry people far more than a simple movie!<br /><br />The movie is well acted.  All the praise placed on the actors already written is well deserved and will not be duplicated here.  It is also well shot.  I do think a few more details could have been revealed.  Not having read the Graphic Novel I do not understand just how V was as superhuman as he was, or how he accomplished so much alone (clearing bricked up subways and laying tracks?).  Perhaps it was something to do with the tests on him but it is never made clear.  I also thought that the time from when Evey left V (after the imprisonment) to November 5th was completely glossed over.  What did she do?  Was she a subversive or simply living under the radar?  It seems strange she would have such an awakening and then do nothing.  I did like the twist that brought Evey's awakening.  She had stated earlier that she lived in constant fear for her life and wished she did not, would give anything to not live in such fear.  As her father said \\"Artists use a lie to tell the truth\\" and that is what freed her from her fear.  The ending I found a little too cinematic.  I doubt that those fireworks could have been set up around Parliament and not been detected.<br /><br />Overall I give it 4 stars for the acting, cinematography, and thought provoking story.  It would have been 5 if it were not as full of itself and needlessly vague for those not familiar with the source material.
B000FTWB7G|3.0|I loved Fallen, it is still one of my favorite cd's I had to buy another copy because I wore out the first!  This cd will never get worn out I was really dissapointed in it.  We know that they have potential and they didn't live up to it.  It sounds like Amy Lee forgot half of the words to the songs and she is just mumbling along.  Some of the songs are good, I recommend previewing the songs and just download the ones you like, you can live without the rest of it, that way it will only cost you a couple bucks.
B000GY729M|3.0|This album is not a classic or worth five stars. A classic album is an album worth five stars and is an OUTSTANDING album. A true classic, one that will be played for YEARS to come. Like U2's Joshua Tree or Paul Simon's Graceland. Please people, remember this when you dish out stars or call albums classics.  <br /> <br />This is a pretty cool album. A album that you can put into the CD player and will make the drive that bad. Pretty good music, good beats, and not horrible singing.
B000GFLE86|5.0|Unexpectedly, I was plesantly introduced to the wonderful soothing music of Madeleine Peyroux, while shopping for books this past weekend at Borders.  This album is so impressive and it sounded so good in the car and on my main house stereo, but not in the bedroom, that I had to run and buy a new stereo system for the bedroom.   <br /> <br />Two days later, I am now shopping for her other albums and trying to figure out which concert date I can make before her tour moves to Europe.  An outstanding addition to my (anyone's) music collection.  Marvelous, simply marvelous...
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Metal is changing. There's no doubt about it. A lot of people see bands like Slipknot, Disturbed, etc. and say that it's nothing like death metal, thrash metal, etc. (which you can clearly see by the reviews of many users below me) The point is that, for starters, each band is evolving in their own way and there are many that cannot appreciate most of the varrying genres of metal (I myself like nu-metal, power metal, thrash metal, speed metal, death metal and black metal so don't tell me I'm a lame nu-metal junkie or some s#!t like that).<br /><br />This is how Slipknot has evolved. Their first album was a lot of rap-metal, not that it wasn't good. Recently the song \\"Wait and Bleed\\" appeared in a metal magazine (I forget the name of the mag off the top of my head though) in it's list of the best 100 metal songs of all time. Their second CD, Iowa, was a little messy but had some very impressive songs like \\"Disasterpiece\\" and \\"The Heretic Anthem.\\" Then we get Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses.<br /><br />The first thing that ran through my mind when i picked this album up was: Wait, this album is clean? How did a band like Slipknot manage that?! Well, they did it in a very good way, I must say. The change the band seems to have undergone is actually reflected in the very first track's line \\"We shed these skins again.\\" There are many hard songs that are heavy especially for a lot of nu-metal bands that plague the radio (The two heavy singles from this album are \\"Duality\\" and \\"Before I Forget.\\" Even if you don't know what they are, you've probably heard them on the radio at one point or another). The songs \\"Vermillion\\" and \\"The Virus of Life\\" tend to stray away from the pounding guitars and go with a more industrial feel while tracks like \\"Circle\\" and \\"Vermillion pt. 2\\" actually go with a more softer, melodic flow that seems to give the album a little bit of everything.<br /><br />Final Word: Slipknot's third album is definitly their best to date, though there's still plenty of room for improvement. The one thing that constantly annoyed me was the completely unsmooth continuity into the next song (with the sole exception of \\"The Virus of Life\\" going into \\"DANGER - Stay Away\\"). Keep the metal coming! And to you nu-metal haters, if you worship only your s#!t then stop complaining about others.<br /><br />---4 Out of 5 Stars---y of room for improvement.

B0000028M7|5.0|Despite popular opinion, neither Nirvana nor Pearl Jam were the best band to emerge from the early-nineties Seattle music scene.  That was Soundgarden.  Likewise, neither of those bands produced the era's best album.  That was Dirt.    If the track names on Dirt give you the impression that this is your typical death-obsessed metal offering, you're way off.  If the track names give you the impression that this is a morbid and depressing album, well it is.  But it's not nihilistic.  It's the opposite, in fact, it's desperate.  There is a hope for something better pervading all of these songs, and a sense of true passion.  It's like a junkie that knows his life is unraveling, but is powerless to stop it - at least he WANTS to stop it.  And in fact, the subject matter of most tracks centers on that very subject, based on singer Lane Staley's personal addiction.  There hasn't been a better heroin album since Sly and the Family Stone's \\"There's a Riot Going On\\".  I've never done the drug in question, but the layers of instruments and echoing vocals lend a definite narcotic quality to the album's sound.  It's also a sound that, despite the band residing on the completely opposite side of the United States from the Louisiana bayou, can be described as downright swampy.  On top of it all, Staley's cracked voice slithers and changes direction like Jerry Cantrell's deft guitar playing.  At one point, he sings that he's eaten the sun, and that's about how he sounds.  Regardless, he's still a great singer, not just a \\"vocalist\\", and he's no stranger to a melody.    The lyrics that Staley has written are intensely personal, and probably only ever really understood by him.  They are powerful, however ambiguous, and delivered sincerely.  The common theme of death/drug use is obvious, but little touches like the flying imagery are very interesting as well.  It is sad and unfortunate that he would eventually succumb to his drug use, but Dirt stands as a uniquely stirring and intensedocument of his plight.    Note - There are two different track listings for this CD (mine has \\"Down in a Hole\\" as the 12th track).  I've heard both, and I actually prefer the epic track towards the end of the album.
B000HIVO64|4.0|What a beautiful, empty, cavernous, sweeping album this is. Beck continues to age gracefully with The Information, some of which plays like Guero's desolate twin, some of which employs the manic, sample-crazed country-hip-hop of Beck's earlier years (there's far more rapping on this record than the previous couple he's done), and much of which is embellished by the overarching granduer of beautiful string, guitar, and synthesizer swells. Nigel Godrich, who produced this baby and Sea Change also, apparently loves his reverb.<br /><br />Sonically, this album is in many ways simpler than Beck's previous efforts. Whereas discs like Odelay and Midnite Vultures were jam-packed with samples, blips, distortion and noise, these tracks are built much more around the rhythm section, relying on Beck's voice, Godrich's atmospherics and the occasional twanging rhythm guitar lick to keep things interesting. And the beats, they do hop. But sometimes, like on 1000bpm for example, the vocals seem shoehorned into place and don't fit the songs as well as they did on Guero. And the highs are less high. Nausea is an excellent, very Beckish track, and Soldier Jane is a beautiful pop cut in the vein of Guero's Girl. But this record doesn't really have an E-Pro, a slam-bang, knock down na-na-na number. It's a more subdued, reflective, and sprawling work. While its beats are more danceable than their counterparts on Sea Change, in some ways this is the more unhappy record of the two. Melancholy, perhaps, but satisfying. Recommended.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and there's a whole DVD with this thing, along with Beck's latest invention: do-it-yourself cover art, where you get to place several dozen stickers over a sterile blueprint grid. Just in case you were thinking of getting this record from iTunes instead.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Evanescence stregnth: Hands down Amy's strong and powerful voice mixing with the gothic/alternative rock sounds and questionably-Christian lyrics.  <br /> <br />I am a devot fan of \\"Fallen\\", but I don't much care for metal and rock. So this review is for such listeners. In \\"The Open Door\\" Evanescence takes a journey through hard rock...which I couldnt really feel. It lacked the subtlety of \\"Fallen\\". So as they venture deeper in the alternative, fans walk through with them. But for more fans of the alternative, the other half of the album makes that $10 worth it. Through out, Amy's voice is guiding you on this journey to the other side. <br /> <br />Sweet Sacrifice 4/5 - It could grow on me, but it was too raw and grudgy for my taste. <br /> <br />Call Me When You're Sober 5/5 -More to the sound I was looking for. <br /> <br />Weight of the World 4/5- This I could definitely learn to like. But again, its very hard rock. <br /> <br />Lithium 5/5- Simply Beautiful. Amy's voice carries the song and you away. Acoustic guitars, violins, pianos, percussions...it has it all. <br /> <br />Cloud Nine 4/5 - Eerie, yet beautiful. Again I could learn to love it.  <br /> <br />Snow White Queen 4/5 - If this is the track rumored to be for the Chronicles of Narnia film, I'm glad it wasn't picked up. I expected aiery and light electric guitar, but it is very edgy. It's still good with drums added in the right places. Definitely a head banger. <br /> <br />Lacrymosa 4/5: It starts off very dreamy and somehow gets very loud and hard. But i love the addition of the gothic choir. <br /> <br />Like You 5/5- Simply Amazing. It has the lyrics, chorus, and the right amount instrumentals. It is very soft, more to the sound of Fallen. What I'm used to. <br /> <br />Lose Control 5/5 - Piano + harmonized ghostly intro = a wonderful hit. <br /> <br />The Only One 5/5 - Is it just me or is it about Jesus? Christian Rock Band...I'm telling you. Definitely true to Evanescene style and sound. So I had to give it a 5.  <br /> <br />Your Star 5/5 - Again, Amy's haunting operatic vocals make this song such an eerie  hit. <br /> <br />All That I'm Living For 5/5 - This is definitely a pop-py chorus ballad song, but it breathes pure Evanescence style. <br /> <br />Good Enough (Infinity!) I instantly fell in love with it. It's a slow dreamy song, sleepy and unqiue lyrics. I had to put it on repeat. It was such a breathe of fresh air. It is the hidden jewel of the album.
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|30 seconds to mars is the greatest band ever and A Beautiful Lie is their best album yet. Jared Leto is freakin amazing. Shannon is one of the best drummers i have ever heard. The song a Beautiful Lie and the Kill are by far my favorite songs out of the 5,000 songs I have on my mp3. Buy this CD <br />30 seconds to mars is awesome
B000GG4XJM|5.0|The best keeps on getting better. I just have a couple of regrets regarding this cd. I wish that the Boss would've included more songs from his tour (which is still better than the cd) specifically, the new versions of Johnny 99 and Open All Night. I am also mad at Bruce for making me like this genere of music. Btw while this albulm is labeled as a folk music it isn't the same old  \\"boring\\" songs that you learned in grade school. Every song on this cd is fresh and unique and done in original  Boss style. In short these songs are brilliant. <br /> I realize that I am probably in the minority, but as much as I love the East Street Band, I hope that Bruce releases a second folk song albulm. Yes too me it was that good. <br /> So in conclusion I hope you all buy this cd and give it a chance. I also hope that people will enjoy this music and review the cd based on the music's merit and not on partisan politics. Anyway my hats off to Bruce. IMO he will be the Boss forever.
B000GY729M|4.0|I am a huge fan of Hot Fuss and still listen to it almost daily. I was excited and nervous to listen, afraid I would be disappointed. I agree with previous reviewers who say you need to give it more than one listen. It has a different sound than Hot Fuss...more rock less indie like. My favorite tracks so far are Bling (confessions of a king), Bones, Sam's Town and This River is Wild. <br />I don't know if it's just me but I feel like Brandon Flowers tried to sing a little too high on some of the songs which gave it almost an unfavorable sound. <br />Overall I think it's a good album, just not as good as Hot Fuss.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|X-Men 3 is very cool. this movie is bursting with non-stop action. although it is inaccurate from the cartoon's content, I still enjoyed it. I thought Kelsey Grammer was the perfect person to play Hank \\"Beast\\" McCoy as he is just as intelligent. they ought to have more characters from the cartoon series, such as Sabretooth and Toad, on a possible 4th movie. the movie had a bit of nudity in it, and that was when Mystique was hit with a \\"cure\\" dart and turned into a normal woman, but there was no frontal nudity involved.
B00006JSS8|5.0|It needs to be stated at the outset that Stevie Wonder has more than just 21 hits. But this cd brings together the best hits from the 1960s through the 1980s. They are also remastered with the best possible sound. You get \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours),\\" \\"Superstition,\\" \\"Living for the City,\\" \\"Higher Ground, the anti Nixon \\"You Haven't Done Nothing,\\" \\"I Wish,\\" \\"Do I Do,\\" \\"My Cherie Amor,\\" and many more on one disc. Completists will wish the cd had room for \\"Isn't She Lovely, Frontline, Ribbon in the Sky, and a few others, but no one can quibble with what IS contained on this disc. You can always download the ones that are missing. <br /> <br />Stevie Wonder was the most soulful and funky singer of the 1970s. Your pop/rock collection isn't complete without this cd.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|After 6 long years, it will finally come to DVD.  I have waited and waited and now...I couldn't be more excited.  This was by far the best show on tv and brings about so many good issues.  This is the king of drama tv.  I am so excited and I just wanted to share my excitement!
B000059GEH|5.0|Absolutely funny film! Sure a lot of the humor is outdated and a woman's sole objective in life today is no longer to become a devoted housewife and loving mother! As women of the world today, we don't even need to marry if we choose not to or worry about the stigma if we don't.    But the idea/notion of landing a rich husband MAY still appeals to many women today..... How the three main characters go about it is pretty funny. They decide to rent an expensive apartment in an upscale neighborhood to attract affluent men into their arms..... Plus try a lot of other ideas as well---- Only all their ideas back fire!    Only one of the three women in this film gets \\"lucky\\", purely by accident, in attracting a multi-millionaire and having him fall in love with her. She thinks the guy is \\"dirt poor\\" the whole movie and wants nothing to do with him, until she can no longer deny that she feels something for him. It isn't until after they get together that she finds out he's wealthy!
B000GY729M|5.0|While I was expecting The Killers to still have the same sound from 'Hot Fuss' (and I am slightly saddened that it isn't here), 'Sam's Town' is still a very good album, albeit different. The songs are still memorable and the lyrics catchy. Though this isn't 'Hot Fuss,' I still recommend this album, and I'm glad that The Killers have had the courage to evolve and change.
B000HIVO64|5.0|The album art here is unique and really inspired. You are given over 60 stickers to attach to the album were ever you see fit, to design your own album art. You can attach the stickers to the inserts, the CD and the DVD . It I'm very happy with my design I thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating it. All versions of the album come with a bonus DVD containing a video for all 15 album tracks. It's great to get cool bonuses for dishing out the money to pick up an album rather than just downloading it. <br /> <br />One other note if you purchase the album at best buy you receive a free download of a bonus beck track titled \\"This Girl That I Know\\". Overall the album is of high musical quality and I highly recommend picking it up.
B000HDR9NG|5.0|I'm not going to lie, I didnt think this album would measure up with Hot Fuss. For me, only From Under a Cork Tree by Fall Out Boy, Futures, by Jimmy Eat World, The Tracks of... by Tyler Hilton, Chariot, by Gavin Degraw and Just My Luck, by Mcfly are in my list of Albums Where EVERY SINGLE SONG IS AWESOME. So, I just didnt think Sam's Town could be as good. However, I was VERY wrong. I am a big Killers fan, and I woke up at six to download their CD from iTunes, which I preordered the very first day you could.  <br /> <br />Now, to the actual CD. It is very different from Hot Fuss, it's a little darker, but in a very good way. This album is JUST as good as Hot Fuss ( I now 6 titles in my list :) ). The songs on this album are somewhat slower and more lyric-based, instead of being more based on the background music, like Hot Fuss. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Uncle Johnny, Where the White Boys Dance and The River is a Wild. <br /> <br />I 100% recommed this album. It is EXCELLENT.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|You'll surely like this movie if you've followed the original Firefly series. This movie is just a continuation of the story that takes the series to some kind of conclusion using the movie. Special effects are quite decent and the production is of a high quality. But the story line is a bit weak - I mean it could have been written better. Overall the movie is quite watchable and entertaining but definitely not mind blowing. You'll get the answer to why Reavers are who they are with this movie.
B000GY729M|4.0|I saw the Killers a couple of years ago in Tampa in what I still think is one of the best shows I've ever seen.  To this day I'm still surprised, because I really wasn't expecting anything fantastic.  Now it's two years later and the band's new album Sam's Town is finally out.  Like the debut Sam's Town is a front loaded album.  All the immediately accessible songs are on the first half of the album and things fade out after Uncle Johnny.  The Enterlude and Exitlude are basically one track opening and closing the album.  My favorite track is the irresistible \\"For Reasons Unknown.\\"  It will likely be the biggest hit of the album.  The weakest track is \\"Bones,\\" I just can't get into this song.  Overall it's a satisfying follow up to Hot Fuss.  This tour should be amazing with all the good tracks available from both albums.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|You can't help but root for a shoe salesman who hears a Steven Stills song, says \\"I can do that\\" runs off, makes a record and does ok.  Now what?  You just can't do that twice!  So instead of just going back to the farm and fixing the barn roof he makes one of the finest albums I have ever heard.  I won't bore you with comparisons to Tim Hardin, Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. Mr. LaMontagne is an original.  These songs have the sweetness and sadness of all our lives in every note, every lyric. At a time when we are all so caught up in the traumas of daily life these songs clean things up, take us deeper and ultimately show us that we will all be ok if we listen to our soul.  Thanks Ray, you just never know from where inspiration will come.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I'm not sure what's up with the other reviewers and their initial disappointment but I totally love this CD!  IMO it's better than Fallen and I thought that was one of the best CD's I'd ever heard.  So far the 2 tracks I like best are \\"Lithium\\" and \\"Lacrymosa\\" with \\"Snow White Queen\\" running a close second. <br /> <br />Not sure what the others were expecting but I experienced no disappointment with this CD at all.  Sure it's different from \\"Fallen\\" but isn't that the whole point?  I wasn't even aware of a change in their lineup until I read it in one of these reviews. <br /> <br />Ignore the rest.  This CD ROCKS!
0596009208|5.0|This is a great book.  How many technical books have you read in 1 week?  That's what I did with this book.  I love the Head First series. They don't make great reference books if you are an expert, but the expert on the title topic is not the audience.
0618680004|2.0|I read books from different points of view in a search for balance.  This book is obviously a smear campaign on religion in general.  Scientists hate the fact that they can't disprove the existence of a God.  Religious people hate the fact that they can't provie God's existence.  Maybe there is one question for which no answer exists.  If all religion was eliminated from the world, is it prudent to believe that man would turn to science alone and everything would blossom?  I don't think so.  Yes, violence, war and pain has been delivered in the name of many religions.  It's also been brought by educated and intelligent people without a religious foundation or belief.  Bottom line, our human existence and history proves that man is not inherently peaceful.  Blaming religion is convenient but not helpful.
0060254920|5.0|I read this book to my daughter and son and they loved it.  It is my daughter's favorite book.  This author is very created in taking you into a different world.  Very science fiction.
B000062YAZ|5.0|I have to say, this is by far the greatest thrash metal album of all time. You can have 'Master of Puppets'(although I do like it a lot) and 'Rust in Peace', this is where it's at. From the shredding, insanely fast solos of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, to the great drum work of Dave Lombardo and perfect singing from Tom Araya, this is the mold that everyone has been following for the past 20 years. Without Reign in Blood, there would be no death metal or metalcore or anything else like that. I have been listening to thrash for a couple months, and this is the best I've heard. If you want ear-busting, brain-melting, all-out, go-crazy metal, you HAVE to get this!
B000HCO840|3.0|I am an advid fan of both the x-men comic books and the movies. I have been a fan of Marvel Comics for over twenty years. I feel that the characters depths were reached in the first two movies but were not carried on to the third, yet they seemed to add many more to the mix, and the special features were a travisty. These things lead to my actual review being closer to 2.5 stars.    I feel that the addition of new characters enhanced the movie and hindered it at the same time. Beast, played by Kelsey Grammar was very well done, to the point of him saying \\"Oh my stars and garters.\\" The Kitty Pryde character seemed one dimensional with no depth at all. She is shown to be a bit intelligent in the class room discussing Plato's view of ethics, but then used as a third wheel of a love triangle dissolves the hope of any furhter depth. Colossus's use of the \\"fastball special\\", at the beginning the movie, was awesome to the point of ingenious, but that is where his character loses his appeal. He has next to no lines and begins to blend into the background in many scenes.     The plot is based very losely on the story arc \\"The Dark Pheonix Saga\\" and when I say losely, I truly mean losely. The comic story involved a much greater deal of internal conflict within Jean, in which Jean solves by comitting suicide. In this movie, her death only comes by the hand, or claws of, yup you guessed it, Wolverine. The depths of emotional conflict in Jean is never brought to the screen, except for her saying thank you to Wolverine at the end of her life. I felt no pythos or pain, that her life needed to be forfeited. I was unimpressed and unmoved by the representation of the pheonix/Jean saga.    Extras/Special features? These were all things picked up off of the floor of the editing room and pasted, any way they could, back into the movie.  3 Alternate endings that have no rationale behind them or connection to the movie. The world of Marvel, this section is a cheap way for Marvel to exploit the viewer into purchasing some of the lesser quality superhero movies. They show the trailers for Daredevil, Electra and FF. Ther is no in depth look into the world of Marvel Comics at all. For those who really want to be cheated out of their hard earned cash, buy the colectors edition of the DVD, it has different packaging and a comic that stars San Lee. Yeah!!!    The whole presentation from the coverr of the actual DVD to the Special Features seem as thrown together as the actual Movie. I as a viewer feel a bit let down by the conclusion of the trilogy. Marvel, does not seem to shy away from the open handed, gimmie your money approach to commerece, just look at the Civil War Strory in stores now, so I would have to say wait a few months and you will probally see a new release of the DVD that does not seem so thrown together.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Here's a review from one of the people who bought Fallen and can still listen to the whole thing straight through in awe of how gorgeous the music is. Here's what I think of The Open Door, for which I had very high expectations:    1)Sweet Sacrifice: 7/10. It's not bad, but it didn't grab my attention like anything on Fallen did. The actual melody is good, but unfortunately the song  gets a bit drab in the second half, as it's kinda repetitive and doesn't ever increase in intensity, which gets frustrating.    2)Call Me When You're Sober: 8/10. The first time I heard this song, I immediately loved it. I didn't give it a 10 because now it doesn't have the same effect after hearing it 20 times, while all of the Fallen songs never lost their impact. The cool thing about the song is how it keeps changing and keeps surprising you from beginning to end. It's not repetitive or monotonous, and has a great melody.    3)Weight of the World: 7/10. It has its good parts, it has its bad parts. The verse is strange and just doesn't match the chorus...I hate the ghost-y, Egyptian-y background singing. Sounds tacky and not Evanescence at all. But the chorus is very epic and strong, with nice strings pulling it together.    4)Lithium: 9/10. The first 35 seconds are uneccessary and strange, but once the song really starts, it's great. It's got a mystical, flowy melody, and has great epic parts... it starts out slow and dramatic, then by the end is exploding, which it a hallmark of this band. Excellent song.    5)Cloud Nine: 6/10. Ugh, starts out with more tacky 'ghost' noise, which unfortunately is in the background for a lot of the song. Luckily Amy overpowers them in the chorus, which is good, but the verses are strange and all over the place.     6)Snow White Queen: 5/10. The beginning is just boring and weird. The chorus has a good melody, but it's not as strong as it could be. This song is alright, but it just is very offcenter, and dull at parts.    7)Lacrymosa: 10/10. This is the one and only song on the album that could have been seamlessly added to Fallen and fit in with the other songs. It's also the only one that I absolutely loved the first time I heard it. It's gorgeous. It starts off with these wonderfully mysterious strings (Mozart's \\"Requiem Lacrymosa\\") and a haunting verse, then goes into this awesome, powerful chorus, and eventually reaches an indescribably awesome bridge, then gets into the end of the song which is as epic as Evanescence gets, an awesome ending with a high note by Amy, flooded with strings and riffs. And the melody is just perfect.    Like You: 10/10. Another great one. I've heard it a bunch of times and still love it. It hasn't gotten enough attention in these reviews, but it's one of the best songs on the CD. Starts off gloomy but pretty, and eventually is gloriously heavy, peaking at the bridge, which has this wonderful sequence of chord changes that just sounds awesome. The final chorus is powerful and climactic, very Fallen.    Lose Control: 3/10. Not a good one. Boring. All over the place. It starts out alright, but it goes downhill from there. The silly background singing (ooooh ooh) at the bridge is intolerably annoying. The sound doesn't have a peak or valley, just blah. You spend the whole 5 minutes in anticipation of something better, only to be disappointed.    The Only One: 8/10. Has a great, melodic chorus, and gradually gets stronger from beginning to end, which is always a good thing. The verses are too melancholy for my taste, but the chorus and bridge make up for it.    Your Star: 7/10. Hmmmmm. This was a hard one to score, because I just HATE the first 2 minutes, but I just LOVE the last 2. The verse is horrible; just weird and annoying, and when you first hear it you can't help but cringe. But surprisingly, the second half is awesome. Once the chorus plays for a second time, with a much cooler and intense vibe, the song suddenly erupts into this crazy and awesome bridge, and just sets off from there into more awesomeness. It sucks so much that they had to start the song off so horribly. I totally understand the split opinion that people are having.     All That I'm Living For: 10/10. I wish they wouldn't have started the song with the chorus; it would have been much more dramatic that way, but it doesn't change the fact that the verses, chorus, and bridge are all awesome. The verse is gorgeous, soft and flowy and gloomy, followed by an explosive chorus, and eventually makes its way to the climactic bridge. There isn't a dull moment in this one.    Good Enough: 10/10. So......*pretty*. The piano intro is just gorgeous. Doesn't at all match the rest of the song (because it was originally part of another piece that Amy was writing for the Narnia movie but got rejected), but it's so pretty I don't care. The main song isn't very structured, and has pretty much the same intensity throughout, but the melody is just so gorgeous, as chopped up as it is. A great end to the CD.    Overall, it is not a good as Fallen as a whole, but still a good album. Once you listen to it enough to get used to the new sound, it's a great album.
0307276902|4.0|If you can get past the scandal that revolves around this book and actually read it, you will not be disappointed.  This is a MUST-READ for anyone who has been touched one way or another by a drug or alcohol addiction.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Without a doubt, the best Slipknot album thus far.  The band has sharpened their musical assault to a fine edge and broken into new sounds with this effort.  Slipknot deserves a lot of credit in bringing numerous styles to metal w/o compromising their unrelenting assault on the senses.
B000055XMF|1.0|If you want to watch a movie where young boys (unattractive teenage boys, ladies) sit in bath tubs, with no attempt to hide their private parts with bubbles.  All the while they curse back and forth at each other in such a harsh British accent, that all one can understand is the foul language; then this film is for you.      Half way through, I took out my sharp compass and scrapped the word \\"Disgusting\\" across the DVD, so I could never make the same mistake of watching this rubbish again.  I'm U.S. Navy (Retired).  And I have never, ever, heard such needless foul language even from drunken sailors, as is in this film.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I'm going to go against the grain here and say that I'm disappointed in the new direction the band is headed. There, I said it. This will probably rub alot of other Evansesence fans the wrong way and get me negative reviews, but I figure honesty is the best policy. I pre-ordered this album since Fallen was one of my favorite CDs -- nearly every track on that album ended up in my favorite playlist. After listening to \\"The Open Door\\", none of them come across as favorites that I can listen to over and over.  <br /> <br />Gone is the growling drive of the electric guitars. In fact, the guitars in \\"The Open Door\\" are much softer and tamer. I don't even hear the bass in the drum so the overall sound is very high pitched. I think this doesn't suit the sound very well, since the guitars were the main source of bass in \\"Fallen\\", and acted as an anchor of lower sound that complimented Amy Lee's vocals. There is a quality of \\"shrillness\\" to her voice that can be a bit overwhelming if you're not used to it, and \\"The Open Door\\" seems to turn up the knob on her vocals moreso than before to the point where the entire album seems focused on her vocals alone. I think your enjoyment of \\"The Open Door\\" will depend largely on if you're a big fan of Amy's vocals. <br /> <br />Along with change in the balance of sound, the pacing of the songs has slowed down. Most of the songs on \\"The Open Door\\" have a ballad feel to them. The phrasing kind of seems all over the place too, with what feels like arbitrary chord changes that ramble vs. something more intentional and streamlined.  <br /> <br />In the interview, Amy talks about how in \\"Lithium\\", she tries to break free from her sorrow that she loved so much and that was the source of a lot of her writing. Also, that \\"Good Enough\\" was her way of coming to peace with herself. While I respect her personal and artistic journey tremendously, I think this does affect the sound of this new album, which is not as angry, not as black and dark as thefirst.
B000HCO840|4.0|I bought the Collector's Edition of \\"X3\\" just because I'm a big fan and I didn't mind shelling out the extra dollars for the snazzy box and the nifty gifts. Well, the DVD comes in a nice box protected by a plastic sleeve with Wolverine's claw embossed on it. The box houses the DVD case with a nice little photo of the major characters in an ensemble shot. The comic is a little book with some reprinted X-stories and the much anticipated new story written by Stan Lee himself. Honestly, I don't plan on keeping the box or plastic sleeve. The comic is nice, though.  <br /> <br />Then there's the DVD which was kinda disappointing. After \\"X-Men 1.5\\" and \\"X2: X-Men United\\" I was expecting a bus load of behind the scenes documentaries and interviews. Especially with this being the last film in the X-Men trilogy. The deleted scenes and commentary are good along with a hidden \\"easter egg\\" scene featuring Beast reciting Shakespeare to encourage his teammates before going to war (found in the \\"Scene Select\\" option). Also, the viewer has the option of choosing the style of the menu to reflect the Brotherhoods' personality or the X-Men's. Also has a sneak peek at The Simpsons Movie which was another welcome surprise. Overall, it's a pretty skimpy DVD that will probably be released in a double disc \\"Ultimate Edition\\" format in the future to further capitalize on the X-Franchise.....\\"X-Men: The Second To Last Stand\\" anyone? <br /> <br />For those who don't know the plot it's basically three challenges for the X-Men to deal with in their latest adventure: the creation of a \\"cure\\" drug that can supress the mutant gene permanently, the aggressive response to the drug by Magneto and his new Brotherhood, and Jean Grey comes back from the dead in the guise of her malevolent alter ego Phoenix. The movie is a step above the typical summer blockbuster yet it lacks the sleek, sci-fi flavored, \\"less is more\\" style used in the first two films. The story also suffers from plot-overload. The Phoenix, Magneto's Brotherhood and The Cure are just too much for one movie and it shows. So, for action and blockbuster fans this is definitely a must have. And X-Fans will get a nice buzz from seeing some of their requests fulfilled such as an airborne Storm, Beast as a major character, and a Danger Room sequence.  <br /> <br />Though I highly doubt this will be the last X-Men film it is an ambitious finale to a unique and memorable trilogy.
1591840562|5.0|I'm a bit of a business book junkie, and this one is my favorite so far.  It's up there on top with 7 Habits and Guerrilla Marketing.  I've recommended it to several friends and family members since reading it cover to cover like a novel this weekend.  If there was ONE single book I'd recommend to any startup business entrepreneur, it would be this one.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful, the ideas are simple yet battle-tested, the philosophy is elegent yet real-world.  I've read stuff that was mystical (Think & Grow Rich) and stuff that was all nuts & bolts (The Portable MBA in Entrepreneurship).  Guy's book struck the perfect balance of practical, mystical, sensitive, energizing, and hard-nosed.<br /><br />Right away, I had a perspective shift.  I asked myself \\"Hmm, if someone came up to me and pitched me my business, what would I do?\\"  I'd tell them to go bootstrap & get some revenue from the real world, then come back & tell me what they've learned before mortgaging my house to invest in their startup!<br /><br />Thank you Guy Kawasaki!
B00005NKKZ|4.0|A lot to like here, the very best songs being the legendary title track, the Boxer and The Only Living Boy in New York - Cecilia, El Condor Pasa, Baby Driver and Try to Keep the Customer Satisfied are also good songs. But some of these songs fall apart, particularly the last three: Song for the Asking feels incomplete; Why Don't You Write Me is a throwaway; the live cover of Bye Bye Love doesn't add much. Probably their best, though Bookends is also quite good.
B000HCO840|5.0|X-Men III with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman and all the others fill out this cast in a non stop action fest.  The special effects we've seen before in other films but it still stands as a solid action film.  It's something I'd watch again. Without Bryan Singer, it's still a good film.<br /><br />The film starts with the senator Worthington has a cure for mutants.  It all begins from there as there is a dividing line between humans and the serum to suppress the mutant genes, permanently.  Hugh Jackman gets most of the lines in this one.  We get to see the demise of three characters, whom I am not going to say here, but it's going to be hard to bring them back for sequels.  I only wish that there's a way to bring them back in flashback scenes or holographic programs.  The scene in the beginning took place in a Star Trek Next Generation style holo deck.  I don't know if this was done in the comic but it does lift a few Trek concepts.<br /><br />Kelsey Grammar does a superb job of the Beast.  He has a small amount of time on the screen and chews up the scenery.  Back in the 70's the Beast was the wild card member. He wasn't always that Blue Haired Wolfman.  I wish that the characters that made brief appearances had something more to do.  Colossus should have had more to do than throw Wolverine into battle.  Juggernaut had much more cunning and intelligence in the comics.  He was wearing sculpted muscles in this one.<br /><br />I was hoping that we'd get some of the comics script into the film.  In the original version, Phoenix was shot by a laser cannon unknown to Scott (Cyclops) Summers. The comics version had them in on alien planet giant arena fighting for their lives.  With CGI, it would have been possible to reproduce the environment in the comic.  I was hoping Chris Claremont would have had a hand in the script.<br /><br />The comic insert was a good addition.  They should have added the DVD ROM of the first 500 issues as a selling point.  I was disappointed to see original X-Men artists Dave Cockrum, George Perez, and Tom Palmer not have any of their stories in the comic.  I love the Jack Kirby ones but they have been reprinted endlessly in best of collections.<br /><br />The good thing I do have to say about the film is that it can be seen repeatedly.  There are a lot of comic elements that make this film a keeper.  The conflict between Xavier and Magneto is much deeper.  It's not a conventional battle because they were best friends at one time and had great respect for one another.<br /><br />From what I've read the next film is going to be a solo Wolverine film.  I'd like to see the origin of Wolverine portrayed in the next one.appointed to see original X-Men artists Dave Cockrum, George Perez, and Tom Palmer not have any of their stories in the comic.

1400032717|4.0|Great book written or narrated by an individual with Asperger's Not Autism. Fascinating to read, great detail and perspective on this disorder. Touching but not maudlin. The contrast of his 'logic' with the drama around him fills the book with dimension.
B00005JP87|4.0|The movie opens with Richard Norton on a stage in late 1800's Austria performing some sort of magic trick when a group of soldiers bursts in to arrest him.  The rest of the movie is a \\"flashback\\" leading up to that scene.  We find Norton's character as a boy coming across a mysterious man by a tree.  You don't know if Norton actually met him or imagined him as the guy disappears.  Norton has an interest in magic and his character meets a well to do girl who he becomes friends with.  The two sneak off together so Norton can show her his magic tricks and generally hang out (like friends in a clubhouse).<br /><br />The girl's parents infuriated that she has taken up with a \\"commoner\\" come after her.  When they are about to get caught the girl begs Norton to make them disappear.  Norton tries but fails and the two are caught.  The girl is brought home forbidden to ever see Norton again.<br /><br />Years later Norton has become a famous magician with the name of Meisenheim.  He is watched by a police chief who is somewhat of an amateur magician himself.  He is fascinated by Meisenheim and begs to be shown one of Meisenheim's tricks where he makes an orange tree seemingly grow out of a flowerpot instantaneously.<br /><br />At one of Meisenheim's shows he calls a volunteer to assist him from the audience and it is the fianc&eacute;e (Jessica Biels) of the heir to the Austrian throne.  Meisenheim realizes it is his childhood friend because she is wearing the same magic locket that he gave her when they were kids.  He becomes infatuated with her and starts to pursue her.<br /><br />Meanwhile the police chief, loyal to the Austrian heir is keeping a close watch on Meisenheim, suspecting something may be afoot between him and Biels.  The police chief has his own agenda as he was born a peasant and believes through faithful support of the heir, he can rise to Mayor when then heir becomes the next emperor.<br /><br />The rest of the movie becomes a game of cat and mouse between Meisenheim, the police chief and the heir and Biels and you are not sure if what you suspect to be is true or an \\"Illusion\\" as the title of the movie suggests.  Not really a spoiler but the real facts are only revealed in the last sequence, which seems to happen so fast that if you watched it on DVD you would need to rewind several times.<br /><br />I thought that the acting of the police chief and the heir were superb but Norton and Biel's performances were just okay.  The movie seemed to drag in parts and even when you see the explanation at the end, some of the scenes seemed to not be feasible based on the explanation given.  All in all I give it between 3 ½ and 4 stars and I do agree with some of the critics that said that the special effects seemed to be low budget.ween Meisenheim, the police chief and the heir and Biels and you are not sure if what you suspect to be is true or an \\"Illusion\\" as the title of the movie suggests.

0393327655|4.0|Sam Harris is obviously a brilliant person and a gifted writer.  He is thorough going in his critique of the irrational elements of religious belief.  Religious belief is most dangerous when it is used to justify doing harm to others.  It is irrational when it excuses or encourages violence.  Harris makes a very convincing critique of radical Islam.  And, of course, the criticism must extend not only to radical Islam.  If reason is our criterion then all of Islam must be viewed with scrutiny.  The Islamic view of the Quran alone as the divine speech of God himself must be seen as strange.  Is it a reasonable proposition to argue that God speaks to humanity only in Arabic?  Further, is it a reasonable proposition to argue that any of the Scriptures of the world's religions is a divine book? <br />     Harris also provides a scientific alternative to what he calls \\"faith\\".  It is meditation.  Science demonstates the beneficial effects of meditation.  Harris presents a multitude of neuropsychological evidence to establish his argument.  Here he seems to be advocating a kind of secularized Buddhism or meditation stripped of any religious trappings.   <br />     The problem with the book is not what Harris knows; it is what he does not know.  Harris's bibliography is particularly weak on Christian theology.  He does not seem to be familiar with the extensive theological literature that does engage modern critical thought and the criticism of traditional theism.  This is the fundamental flaw in the book.  I would suggest that many more Christians than Harris might think are sympathetic to his fundamental premise: that religious belief can be deadly.  My hope would be that this book would lead Christians who sympathize with his outcry to more vocally criticize the dangerous figures within their own community whose rhetoric masks underlying violence. <br />
B00005UD0O|5.0|I agree with my fellow reviewer and Amazon friend, gobirds2, that this is a darker, more pessimistic, and therefore atypical Ford movie. In this film, the wicked prosper as much as the virtuous, and it is much less certain that good will triumph over evil and that law and order will prevail in the end. In fact, it only prevails because Wayne himself resorts to some good, old-fashioned \\"western style justice,\\" saving Stewart's life and ridding the town of the troublesome and evil Valance. The cast is as stellar as it gets, and I recall one more time Stewart and Wayne worked together. In Wayne's last movie, The Shootist, Wayne visits the doctor, played by Stewart, and finds he has a fatal cancer and only has a short time to live, thus precipitating the exciting finale of that film, when Wayne decides to go for broke against the arrogant younger gunslinger, played by Hugh O'Brien.
0307346609|4.0|1st entry:  Just began reading it a couple days ago and cannot put book down.  This is essential reading for anyone hoping to survive a natural or man-made disaster of Biblical proportions (i.e. Hurricane Katrina comes to mind, and perhaps, the next flu pandemic).  Work, cooking, exercise keep getting in the way of reading this book.  This is an oral history of a future world war between humans and zombies.  The undead are infectious!  Its like some form of viral rabies pandemic.  The zombie pandemic can be traced back to \\"Patient Zero\\", a child whose father may or may not have been bitten and disappeared during a dive into the submerged ruins of the Three Gorges Dam in China. Each chapter corresponds to a time frame pertaining to before, during and after the pandemic--referred to as World War Z because the only viable response to the pandemic was to \\"eliminate\\" the infected (i.e. the zombies).  This is not the first pandemic zombie work to come out this year.  So far so good--and a vastly superior work relative to Stephen King's zombie story Cell: A Novel (although King's novel may have some more interesting literary goodies like allusions to genocide and evolution I have yet to mull over).
